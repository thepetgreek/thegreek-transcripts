00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,570
Greetings everyone and welcome to Uncommon Radio and if you recognize the

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:08,470
voice it goes by the Greek. And I would say it's around the 26th day of the

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:15,670
second month. Yes, it has nothing to do with the pagan stuff. Well, so it's

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:22,190
not February. Well, let's just say it. It's what they call May 4th, 2017 on that

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:26,570
ridiculous Pope's work schedule. And lawfully, which is something that

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,030
seemingly surface-dwelling earth inhabitants have no idea about, not even

7
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,170
a clue because in order to have an idea there needs to be something behind it. I

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,510
would say that it's around the second month, around the 26th day. And the day

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,590
goes from noon to noon and the full moon rules the month. By the way, when I

10
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,450
said full moon here, I was just jumping the gun a little. The Sun rules the day and

11
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:54,410
the moon rules the month. Get it? And they seem not linear but they're very

12
00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:01,270
precise because things are not really linear. So anyway, just to kind of give

13
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:05,750
that little bit of a dig on the surface-dwelling earth inhabitants, I got

14
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,650
a little bit of a message and a couple of people have reminded that around

15
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,390
this time we're going to be discussing water tonight and a few people are

16
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,450
quite, let's just say, enthusiastic about it. The Greek has been known to discuss

17
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,870
water before, probably in an unusual way. What makes it unusual is that it's

18
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:28,450
practical. It is so practical it makes most other discussions about water seem

19
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:36,150
useless, childish. Can we say a dummy load? And just to bring this up,

20
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:42,310
folks, it's really, really simple. And well, can it be simple? Yes. I mean, it

21
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,010
should be simple. Let me just give you a little history of past few days. I

22
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,590
actually went on this thing called the internet. You know, it's just ghetto for

23
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,350
internet, right? The web, whoever's weaving that web. Anyway, and I looked

24
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,930
around for water, information about water. And really the only thing that I would

25
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:04,370
suggest perhaps looking at is a little bit of Victor Shawburger stuff. But

26
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,710
apparently, even then, you know, it's been surrounded with a lot of breakfast

27
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:13,110
cereal. If you know what I mean, breakfast cereals made of fruits, nuts, and flakes.

28
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:19,950
Get the point? So before we get the point or discuss anything, I'm going to

29
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,950
bring up the what's called the phone lines. If the studio here has remembered

30
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:31,130
to at least activate them. Okay, I just got a message that they are on. And while

31
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,690
I'm bringing them up, let me just recite the number once again. If you go to the

32
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:41,150
American Freedom Radio homepage, and it's on the left, you'll see a red box. And if

33
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:47,370
with call in number 218-339-8525. And if you don't see it on the left, it's on your

34
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,830
other left. It's a red box on the American Freedom Radio homepage, call in

35
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:58,570
number 218-339-8525. And if you do enjoy the Skype convention for its fidelity and

36
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:05,170
for other reasons, I would suggest using the Uncommon Radio email as the contact

37
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:10,330
that seems to be the way to get an apropos to the Skype. And that would be

38
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,210
UncommonSenseRadio1 at gmail.com. And that's numeric one. And if you missed that,

39
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:23,670
you can go to the www.uncommonradio.com site. And you will see as you scroll down,

40
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:32,550
it's clearly posted there. So for some reason, I don't see. Oh, there it is. Okay.

41
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,010
To bring up these numbers here. Well, actually, not the number, but the

42
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:44,190
actually conference manager here, and we seem to have it on. Yes, and there it is.

43
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:51,790
Okay. Well, let's say this is a Sonic episode, Sonic Solo, number one. Actually,

44
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:58,070
I'm number one. I think I'm on a coffee deprivation here. Number 10. 10, what is

45
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,870
significant about 10? 10 tends to be the number of judgment or atonement. Perhaps

46
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:09,290
let's just stick with things that are sort of judged. Now, I just want to bring up a

47
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:15,410
point here before we get into water and we meaning people want to hear what the

48
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,630
Greek wants to say about water. I'm going to go to etymology online. It seems to be

49
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,970
the only place you can get a quick reference on that. And we're going to put

50
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:29,990
in judgment for a moment and just see what is referenced as that as a C judgment.

51
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:37,030
Okay. Related judgmental. And it's an action of trying at law or trial. So

52
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:43,910
capacity for making decisions. Old French, who haven't? Well, French accent there

53
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:49,150
is not really, but legal judgment diagnosis. The last judgment. Okay. Who's here

54
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:54,310
to judge a penalty imposed by a court? Okay. I think they're looking at it from a

55
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:59,090
narrow point of view, meaning a descriptive point of view and how it's used

56
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:04,630
technically to explain certain things, I guess, that are memorialized. But in one's

57
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:12,470
capacity for making decisions is part of the definition as well. So if you're out in

58
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,530
the world, you hopefully have a capacity for making decisions. Therefore, you are

59
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:22,170
exercising judgment. Now, of course, there's the world of men in the world of

60
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,910
the gods. And then there's the planets in the material realm, of course, that both

61
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:31,530
interact with. So take that as you will. But regarding water, I just wanted to go

62
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:37,170
back. If people recognize the voice as Greek or Greek speak as the Greek or

63
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,490
Greek speak, you will hear that one of the points that always are bringing up is

64
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,670
the concept of water. Now, what's interesting about it is, you know, you could

65
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:52,570
look at it, you know, for however you want to imagine it or however you interact

66
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:58,290
with it. And hopefully, you are interacting with it. Okay. But I just want to bring

67
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,730
up a couple of points and reiterate some of the historical points that I've been

68
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:11,470
bringing up and historical meaning from Greek speak. And one is, well, if the

69
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:20,430
things. And water is H2O, okay, meaning two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.

70
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:26,210
Why does a bucket of water weigh more than a bucket of air? And it shouldn't.

71
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,150
And by the way, I've been in many conference calls with captains of industry

72
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:38,790
and others of the like, older academics and let's say people that would be the

73
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:44,350
heads of your society regarding the subject. And whenever I bring up, why does

74
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,070
a bucket of water weigh more than a bucket of air when it shouldn't? And I

75
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,030
preface it as such, you know, that the periodic table of elements is accurate.

76
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,990
And they all laugh. And the most ridiculous answers I get are, well, one's a

77
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,950
gas, one's a liquid. Well, they're not paying attention, which is normal, by the

78
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:06,450
way. You ever notice that the people that are leading the society are not paying

79
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,830
attention? Isn't that called being asleep at the wheel? Or maybe no one's at

80
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,910
the wheel. You ever think about that? But anyway, let's go back to the water.

81
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:20,970
Okay. Now, on an atomic or molecular level, we're not discussing phase, are we?

82
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,970
It doesn't matter if it's a gas, a liquid, or a solid because it's one single

83
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,950
molecule. The phase is irrelevant at this point. We're not talking about a mole or

84
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,650
other groupings, and I don't want to get pedantic into how they define orthodox

85
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:41,750
terms. But essentially, this is a way of poking fun at the unintuitiveness of

86
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:49,290
standards that they've put in front of society. Now, how is the, not the

87
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,650
academic, but the industrialist, the engineer, the chemist, working with the

88
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:58,190
references they put out, how are they supposed to have an intuitive, let's just

89
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:03,850
say, grasp of what is going on when something as simple as denoting if the

90
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:09,710
periodic table of elements is accurate and water is H2O, why does a bucket of

91
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:16,050
water weigh more than a bucket of air? And there's no answer. Why? It's very

92
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:21,350
simple. Well, let's just look at the answer and the reference material.

93
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:28,230
Hydrogen weighs one and oxygen's around 16. So H2O denotes two hydrogens and one

94
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:33,330
oxygen. So it would be 2 times 1 plus 16, which gives you a molecular weight of

95
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:39,230
18. Now, based on the constituents of air, the eight major gases and all the other

96
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:45,750
gases in there, if you go do a little bit of study, they'll tell you that air, the

97
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,370
compound of air, the mixture, the air mixture, has a molecular weight of around

98
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,910
28.529. Now, remember, this is irrelevant to phase. We're not talking about one

99
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,610
being solid or liquid or a gas. Now, by the way, let me just throw this in here for you

100
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:06,290
folks. Water does not have a gaseous phase. And recently, I did some, again, a

101
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:10,970
ridiculous venue called YouTube. Why do I say it's ridiculous? Because look at who

102
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:16,630
it's accommodating. But anyway, if you look at that, there was actually an academic

103
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:23,270
person there. Why can't I say that word? All right. That was stating that water has

104
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:27,070
a gaseous phase as well as a solid liquid in gaseous phase, which is incorrect.

105
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,410
Water does not have a gaseous phase. Because if it had a gaseous phase, well,

106
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:37,210
let's just say that would make condensation irrelevant, wouldn't it? You see,

107
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,150
when you have humidity and water in the air, it's not in a gaseous phase. It's

108
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:46,230
still in a liquid phase, teeny tiny little droplets. Now, it doesn't have a

109
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,170
gaseous phase. Now, think about that for a moment. Because when you gasify certain

110
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,570
things that you are not, let's say, familiar with being gasified, other than

111
00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:01,230
alternative media, show hosts and guests, oh, sorry, and mainstream, of course, you

112
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:06,630
will find that it's called sublimation. Like certain things go from solid right to

113
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,330
gas and are sublimated, let's say. Without getting pedantic here, let's just think

114
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:16,470
about this for a moment. The reference material that's put out about water is

115
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:23,710
unintuitive. You just have to memorize it. You get it? Just do as you say. Well, as

116
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:31,570
we say, whoever we is, or do as they say. Do as you are told. Okay? Now, what better

117
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:37,110
way to pick apart a particular, let's say, orthodoxy than using its own self? A

118
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:45,450
house divided can't stand, or it's called an implosion. So anyway, there's so much

119
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:51,310
to say about that regarding on the chemical side, or the laboratory side, or the clinical

120
00:10:51,310 --> 00:11:00,250
side, or the academic side of it, about how it's self-contradictory. Let's just continue

121
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:06,130
for a moment. One of the experiments that one can do regarding water and air, and how

122
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:16,210
air should not be heavier than air, but it, you know, technically, well, people say, well,

123
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,330
you know, one is a gas, one is a liquid. So fine. Go to a place where they compress air

124
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:28,490
into a liquid and measure the weight of the container with the liquid air, and then take

125
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:34,890
an equal size container of equal weight and put in some liquid water of equal volume and

126
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:42,550
measure the weight. Well, you find the water is heavier. It shouldn't be. So now we've

127
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:49,850
just blasted the phase aspect out of control here. So this is really a harsh commentary

128
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:55,430
on what you are being presented with as references. Now, is it that harsh? Now, if you ever recall

129
00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:01,410
coming to these sonic events, whether it's solo or not, the concept of lawful time is

130
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:06,790
brought up and it's always mocking or making fun of, not necessarily the Pope's work schedule

131
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:11,370
because you have to have some order. There are many corporations that have their own little

132
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:19,570
timekeeping also. I'm just mocking the inhabitants of the earth. Would it be an offense? Yeah.

133
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,970
Do you deserve to be offended as a whole group? Yeah, absolutely you do, and you will be majorly

134
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:31,430
offended in the future, but not by the Greek. So at this point, you've probably gotten into

135
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:34,890
the notion that the majority of the things that are put in front of you as reference

136
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:41,650
materials are kind of spurious and kind of put together in a way that maybe it's going

137
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:48,190
to require a little bit of investigation to whatever, defunct. So there's the most I'm

138
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,710
going to get into about academic stuff, but there's something else I want to get into

139
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:56,330
before I get into the water and basically what you can do right now and what can be

140
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:03,790
done immediately about it. One of the things that has been worked on with water is something

141
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,010
called structured water. Now, most of the stuff out there regarding structured water,

142
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:12,970
again, is a dummy load, but water being able to carry memory is an important thing to consider.

143
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:18,390
Now, let's just put everything aside about what water is and we're going to discuss that

144
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:23,890
as well, but let me just give you a little point here of, let's say, some research that's

145
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:31,610
been done. You might as well try to find it on the Internet, probably will. Okay, this

146
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,710
thing called water memory, it's not just this thing that you hear bandied about in dummy

147
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:45,010
load fashion. It can be proven, and what do I mean? Proven. When you offer proof or evidence

148
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:51,390
to this world, it should be in some material form, and that's exactly what I'm discussing.

149
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:56,410
Okay, we'll get to the point. The point is this. You can take some purified water, for

150
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:02,110
example, and imprint in it the signal, and I mean literally a signal of what they call

151
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:08,230
DNA or something that is a nucleotide or mitochondria, something very, very small, and that's biological.

152
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,610
And by the way, don't be fascinated by DNA. If you actually research DNA and all these

153
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,950
things, objectively, you'll see that they've been hyped up, but they do exist with whatever

154
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:24,110
label they're using. But you can actually force these materials, these very little pieces

155
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:30,270
of cell tissue, let's say with a coil and an electrical signal, and as the electrical

156
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:35,070
signal goes through these cells, they will give off a signature or radiation, meaning

157
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:40,390
like electromagnetic, almost like a radio frequency that can be recorded, and you send

158
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:47,170
that just the frequency through the water. And once you do that, it changes again slightly,

159
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:51,930
and then you record that. Okay, and then what you do is you put that on a thumb drive as

160
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:59,050
a file, and you send it to someone across the world, and they are able to put the thumb

161
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,170
drive into a computer on the audio jack out, for example, have a small coil, something

162
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:08,810
that looks like a coil, that will play that frequency, very simple, just like you send

163
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:16,990
a music file, into another vial of purified water. And what you will find after a few

164
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:23,850
hours is that those cells that you were getting to imprint that file, the frequency from,

165
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:31,750
are starting to physically appear on the other side of the world, right, using just the signal.

166
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:38,750
But it has to be done using water. So this might be called a form of rudimentary teleportation

167
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:43,850
or whatever, but you need water to do it at this point. And this has been done in several

168
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:51,130
laboratories, and it's, I wouldn't say commonly known, but it's well known by certain people

169
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:57,890
that understand structured water and how water carries memory. So we want to chew on that

170
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:04,030
for a little bit, because the way you access water is usually through some form of conduit

171
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:09,550
or container. And do you think it's being imprinted? You know, that's just a rhetorical

172
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:14,290
question. So I just want to throw that in a little bit, because it is a bit fascinating

173
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,890
to see how fascinating and amazing it is, because it is things of fascination. It's

174
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:24,030
almost on the level of magic. And just like when the body is discussed.

175
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:28,510
Now, I want to get into something else before we get into just the general water discussion.

176
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,390
How many times do you actually hear, oh, the body is 70% water, the earth is 70% water,

177
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:39,510
you know, most living things are 70 or plus percent water. Well, that's true on an initial

178
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,250
examination. But if one were to look a little bit closely, let's take the human body. When

179
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,210
they say it's 70% water, what they're doing is looking at all the fluids that could be

180
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:52,190
extracted as if you took someone and put them in a giant press, right? And what would strain

181
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:58,990
out at the bottom would be about 70% by volume and weight water. Now, that is a rudimentary

182
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:05,010
examination. But in actuality, what you will find if you just remove the bones, you will

183
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:09,390
see that the bones are still moist. And if you looked at on the cellular level, you will

184
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:15,349
see that the bone cells themselves are more than 70% water, even though they're hard and

185
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:21,329
crusty. And if you look at the actual cells or the remaining cells in the body, they all

186
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:27,810
contain a great amount of water. So if you actually factor in not only the movable liquid

187
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:34,190
in the body being 70%, but all of the other present liquid holding stasis, let's say, that

188
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:39,150
is not flowing readily, you might say that the body is more than 90, and I would say

189
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:46,910
99% water. Now, let's take the earth, for example. You might say, yes, the earth is

190
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:52,070
about 70% water by initial inspection. But once you get on dry land, you might say, well,

191
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:57,950
this is not the water part that we're measuring, is it? No. But let's move around on dry land.

192
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:03,070
You pick up a piece of grass. Oh, that's mostly water, isn't it, again? The birds, the lizards,

193
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:08,350
the tigers, the elephants, right? The soil itself, if you were to look at a soil sample,

194
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:14,490
okay? Petroleum itself, if anyone has ever analyzed petroleum, even purified refined

195
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:22,690
petroleum has a constituent of water in several percentiles. So again, is it 70% or is it

196
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:28,430
90%? It's more than 90% water, okay? Now, we're not talking about the dynamics

197
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,350
in the structure because the earth, most of the water is not even visible. It's underneath

198
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:39,010
all of what you call landmass and several layers. It's a primary water, and it behaves very

199
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:44,570
differently. But let's just say this. It's water, water

200
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:52,590
everywhere, and not a drop to think about, maybe. So let's just maybe digress again because

201
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,270
there's so many things that can be discussed about water. Now, we just kind of brought

202
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:04,510
up the point that if the periodic table is accurate and water is H2O, then why does a

203
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,430
bucket of air when air should be, you know, it's around 28, 29 molecular weight and water

204
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,830
is around 18. Obviously, there's a big difference there. You can figure out the percentage.

205
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:18,630
It's about 60% or something. So when you look at this, okay, we have to

206
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:23,010
not really look at these reference materials as being accurate. So what's going on there?

207
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:28,530
Well, the hydrogen-oxygen component was derived through what's called electrolysis. Electrolysis

208
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:35,770
is very simple where they discuss, let's put two electrical plates, DC voltage, let's

209
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:40,210
say, in current, one positive, one negative, and we see readily that gases come off each

210
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,970
respective plate. Off of the cathode or the negative, we see the hydrogen, and off of

211
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:50,470
the positive, we see the oxygen coming off. And it's an stoichiometric mixture where you

212
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:55,310
have twice as much hydrogen than oxygen. So the rapid conclusion that water is made

213
00:19:55,310 --> 00:20:00,950
of H2O because through electrolysis, we are actually turning water into its elemental

214
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:08,130
gas, which is okay. Presumptively, you can accept that, but there's a problem that no

215
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,910
one has ever taken a given amount of water and completely reduced it to hydrogen and

216
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:18,690
oxygen. It's not like discussing, you know, you could take apples and make them applesauce,

217
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:22,630
but can you take the applesauce and make it back to an apple? It's something different.

218
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,590
What happens is when you keep reducing the water by electrolysis is you end up with a

219
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:33,030
different kind of water, don't you? Yeah. I'm not going to say what it is because it's

220
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:38,550
used in certain industries that make things go bang. And it's very expensive, and it's

221
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:47,650
kind of tricky. So what's going on here? Now, if you kind of look at, let's say, water

222
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,430
from an energy perspective, you could look at it from a nutritive perspective, you could

223
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,170
look at it from an existential perspective, you know, it's everywhere. You could look

224
00:20:55,170 --> 00:21:00,850
at it from any point of view. Why? It's interesting. It's one of the things that is everywhere

225
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:07,330
and is used by everyone in almost everything. So it seems to almost have an elemental aspect

226
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:13,510
to it. And it tends to have an intelligence. So let me just say what I mean by the intelligence

227
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:22,390
that when pressed and when forced, let's say, or a certain direction or path is put into

228
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:27,630
it, it will comply or it will fight back. That's what I mean by its intelligence. And it does

229
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:32,410
these things in a way that is very different from anything else on earth. There is no other

230
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:37,250
material or substance known that even resembles the qualities or the properties of water.

231
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:44,490
So what the point here is I'm getting to is that there's not a lot of thought, intuitive

232
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:49,850
thought, that is being put into water. And the way people think about water is, I would

233
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:55,470
say, at this point, counterintuitive. Because, well, you know, you could figure that out

234
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:02,630
why it's counterintuitive. But I would say that the simplest thing to notice about water

235
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:09,970
is that other than it's clear, and it's transparent, and it's wet, and it's in a liquid state,

236
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:16,470
which can also be in a solid, of course, known as ice, is that it has characteristics on how

237
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:22,410
it takes form and shape. And the form and the shape is very important. Now, I'm going

238
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:25,890
to get into the form and the shape and the aspects of the quality of it very quickly,

239
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:32,770
only because through redundancy, through repeating several times, the purpose of having

240
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:38,010
this, let's say, solo event about water is something that listeners can walk away at

241
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:43,910
any point and get, at least from now on, from this event, and get an idea of how to increase

242
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:50,510
the quality of water in their surroundings immediately, very simply, and effectively,

243
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:56,470
you know, without buying devices or other materials, which can be done later on. And

244
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:01,930
they will be discussed, perhaps, in another venue with more specifics. But essentially,

245
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:07,050
if you're going to walk away from this solo episode right now, all you have to know about

246
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:11,970
having quality water is you need to keep it in the dark, not exposed to light, whether

247
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:17,570
it's artificial light or sunlight, keep it covered, keep it in an opaque container,

248
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:25,790
and keep it cool. Now, what I mean about keeping it cool is water is, what Schauberger said,

249
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,590
anomaly point is around 39 degrees Fahrenheit or 4 degrees Celsius. It gets more specific

250
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,170
than that, but those are the general ones. That's why most refrigerators are typically

251
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:41,190
set at 39 or 4 degrees Celsius by coincidence. In other words, it coincides with the properties

252
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:49,290
of water. Things don't spoil at that temperature. So one thing to consider here is if you're

253
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:54,610
listening to this and you want to get something out of water, or if you're listening to anything

254
00:23:54,610 --> 00:24:00,090
that's called Greek speak, you'll see that it's typically discussing quality or knocking

255
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:04,350
those that are promoting lack of quality, let's say, because they do go on these rants.

256
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:11,990
So the point here is keep it cool, keep it dark. Now, I know if you take this to heart,

257
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:18,370
you might find what's going on on this planet to be very much incoherent about all the other

258
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,750
things that you've heard discussed by the Greek, because wherever you go into venues,

259
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:27,970
private or public, commercial or non-commercial, you'll see the water is mistreated, meaning

260
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:32,610
it's exposed to light and room temperature, and people are considering it to be nutritive.

261
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:40,930
So at this point, that would be the thing to remember that will be repeated consistently

262
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:46,370
throughout this, let's just say, solo event. Keep it cool and keep it dark. And that is

263
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,870
the beginnings of increasing the quality of water.

264
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:54,530
And let me just bring up what Schauberger meant about the anomaly point, that that's

265
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:59,690
where water was at its healthiest. And there's something called in, well, there's various

266
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,450
descriptions about, I'm not going to get into it, about how temperature affects the

267
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:09,030
quality of things. What's interesting about water is that it's at its densest form at

268
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:13,670
around 39 degrees Fahrenheit or four degrees Celsius, meaning as the temperature goes up

269
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,530
or down, the water starts to expand slightly, okay, or quite a bit when it starts to go

270
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:24,710
into a solid phase. So why is it important to have it in that state is because it's the

271
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:31,310
densest form, okay? And its volume is at its minimum as well.

272
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:37,290
Now, why perhaps could it be called an anomaly point? Because most things have a temperature

273
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:41,790
where they are, let's say, the freshest, they have the most vitality, or they work the best

274
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:48,310
or the most healthful. That would be, let's say, for example, the human body, 98.6 Fahrenheit

275
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:57,070
would be considered the mean temperature for someone feeling like they have vitality or

276
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:02,930
they feel well. Well, if you raise the temperature or lower the temperature by quite a bit, the

277
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:09,150
individual typically doesn't want to be vertical. They want to be horizontal. So they lose levity.

278
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,590
They're not feeling well. And most things have this temperature anomaly kind of thing.

279
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:20,130
So that's why it's important to kind of know around 39, well, you should know it's kind

280
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:25,050
of around 39 or 4 degrees Celsius where you will find that point where water becomes of

281
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:29,710
its highest quality. And this is also why, for example, when you look at a lot of the

282
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:35,870
absorbative type filters, like what's called a carbon filtration unit, as the temperature

283
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:42,230
goes up from the 39, its effectiveness or efficiency goes down. So if you're ever going

284
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:48,310
to use especially, let's say, a non-inline filter or something called like a standalone

285
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:55,470
filter, a pitcher type filter, make sure that the water is chilled prior to pouring through

286
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,910
the filter. The efficiency of the unit will go up. And of course, you chill it afterwards

287
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,870
and keep it in the dark. So this is a very simple approach that I'll keep repeating.

288
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:11,370
But regarding how incredible this element, and we're going to call it an element because

289
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:18,050
it has an intelligence to it where, like I've described, if you put electricity through

290
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:23,450
it with metal or other conductive, well, so-called conductive materials, it will emit hydrogen

291
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:30,550
and oxygen. Now, it will never all turn into hydrogen and oxygen, but it will emit that

292
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:37,770
gas. Now, what's interesting about it, when you combine that with one of the accounts

293
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:42,430
that I gave in the beginning about how water structure and water memory can actually be

294
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:48,630
used to create substance, yes, it sounds incredible, in a rudimentary form of teleportation, let's

295
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:55,330
say, that is also one of the attributes that water has when it comes in contact with other

296
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:59,250
things and is energized, whether it's the Earth's magnetic field, the electricity in

297
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:07,030
the air, or living beings. That's one of the keys to perhaps opening the door to comprehending

298
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:17,170
the necessity of water in biology or life. It has the ability to be the canvas, let's

299
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:23,710
say, and also the instigator based on its memory to actually produce substance. Now,

300
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:30,190
the easiest thing to see is the electrolysis where the electricity is put into it and

301
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:37,310
the hydrogen and oxygen is created through a form of electrical disintegration. And the

302
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:46,670
initial account that I gave was how a electromagnetic signal can influence the water to create a

303
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:50,690
substance on the other side of the world or wherever else can play that electromagnetic

304
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:57,470
signal, you see. So, if anyone is more interested in that, I hope there's some stuff on it online.

305
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:03,270
I believe some of this research was initially discovered, at least through academia, I should

306
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:10,830
say, or unofficially, officially put through academia, I think it was a Nobel Prize Laureate

307
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:15,170
for discovering some virus or something, which doesn't exist, but at least they gave him

308
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,410
a Nobel Prize for it anyway, and he might be along those lines.

309
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:26,310
So, the reason why I'm not giving more specifics on that at this time, perhaps in the future,

310
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:33,350
is because it really opens an entirely different, let's say, view on how water can be used.

311
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:40,790
And if you understand the mentality of human society, it will probably not be used in constructive

312
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:44,830
means or, well, yeah, you can kind of think about it.

313
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:52,170
So, I mean, just to finish off maybe the subject just to go to the rest is, if the rudimentary

314
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:56,510
teleportation through water is possible, do you think they're going to be, well, let's

315
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:01,090
say those in power, let's say, based on their ability to accommodate the masses, are going

316
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,630
to want to accommodate the masses for good or for the opposite?

317
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:12,010
And I would say the opposite. So, well, again, just to please remember that

318
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:18,070
water should be kept in the dark and cold. Now, this is one thing that, secondary to that,

319
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:27,070
that needs to be considered is the shape and whether the shape is in motion or in static,

320
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,810
it changes and that can be observed. And why should it be observed?

321
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:38,550
Because it gives you, let's say, the education by observing what the water body or what it

322
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:45,630
would like to determine to be in its best state when it comes to the 3D world, let's say,

323
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:52,390
or the physical world when it's in a volumetric form, whether it's moving or it's stagnant.

324
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:58,930
Now, if you notice, when you look at, for example, the blood vessels or the roots of

325
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:04,850
a tree or, let's say, a high vantage point of what a river, a natural river looks like,

326
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:10,210
you will see that all of these three things share the similar geometric patterns.

327
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:15,230
Okay? The reason why the blood vessels in a living

328
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:23,270
creature, the roots of plants and rivers share similar geometry is coinciding with the optimum,

329
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:27,670
let's say, geometric form that water likes to take when it's in movement.

330
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:31,290
Right? Isn't it interesting how there's so much discussion

331
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:37,030
about biology? Well, let's say, if you go down that line of study, but they never tie

332
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:42,130
everything together, how similar they are. And you could also see that there's an archetypal

333
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:46,270
pattern that appears in many other things as well, because there's even another archetype

334
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:51,110
behind that, which one might ponder to say is electrical, which I'm not talking about

335
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:56,970
stuff. You plug it into the wall or a battery type of electricity. Maybe one day we'll discuss

336
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:02,710
electricity. But the aspect of water taking on that shape,

337
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:09,350
and that is why blood vessels and roots of plants and rivers look the way they do, is

338
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:14,330
because that shape accommodates the water body when it's moving. So think about it for

339
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:20,030
a moment, because you will see the geometric patterns and forms that, let's say, engineers,

340
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:24,350
at least in the past hundred years or so, have been using to move water, or let's say

341
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:29,250
moving water would be transported water, is radically different.

342
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:35,710
And I believe Schauberger and others along his line of thinking have discussed when

343
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:40,330
you run water through straight channels or pipes, it's like putting water in a strait

344
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:46,630
jacket, right? So you're restricting it. And there's always, imagine taking a healthy being

345
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:54,850
and suturing or tying him down, how they're going to feel. So that is the pattern that

346
00:32:54,850 --> 00:33:01,410
you will see in nature or in the natural physical world that accommodates the water body in

347
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:07,270
its vibrant state. The second state you will discover water will be in, let's say we're

348
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:15,250
discussing liquid form, would be in a static state and it would be typically in, I wouldn't

349
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:20,930
say spherical, but more ovoid. And I would say most definitely ovoid, meaning like an

350
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:26,330
egg shape and not necessarily like a chicken egg in shape. But what I mean by ovoid, it

351
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:34,110
is generally a spherical or round shape, but one end tends to be a little bit pointier

352
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:42,110
than the other end. And the reason for that, one can surmise, it could be simply because

353
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:49,110
there is an energetic movement that is required in nature. Otherwise, when things become completely

354
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:56,030
static, they're considered, let's say, less vital. So to keep this subtle movement and

355
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:02,050
of not only the water, but any other form of convection, meaning heat or light or anything

356
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:09,790
like that, in a state of imbalance. So essentially the egg creates a state of imbalance by having

357
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:14,310
one end slightly pointier than the other. And let's give a quick description of that

358
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:22,690
because this is how water maintains its quality geometrically when it's static. Because it's

359
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:27,210
obviously less dynamic when it's moving, but it's still important to comprehend to some

360
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:33,550
level. If you look at the ovoid shape or the egg shape, you'll find that it's a volumetric

361
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:39,230
shape. It takes up volume and it's not a sphere. But if we look at the sphere as being, let's

362
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:44,750
say, a prototype or an archetype for it, if we were to put, let's say, liquid in a sphere,

363
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:52,070
the distance from, let's say, the center of that sphere to anywhere on the outer sides

364
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:58,750
of the sphere is equal. That's why we define it as a sphere. Its radius is consistent throughout

365
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:05,470
the entire 3D volume. Now, you might say, well, then why don't we just put it in something

366
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:09,910
elliptical? Well, if it's elliptical, well, let's say you have two ends, still a sphere,

367
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:15,330
but let's say squashed down, slightly truncated, and the two ends are pointy and they're symmetrical.

368
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:22,590
Well, now the distance from the center to anywhere on the container is not equal. But because

369
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:29,410
there is a symmetry, okay, there will be an exchange of symmetry along the pointed sides.

370
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:35,470
The energy will go back and forth for a short while and then come to a static balance, you

371
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:41,250
see. But when you have the egg shape where one side is slightly pointier than the other

372
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:46,230
and the other is slightly more oblong, the distance from the center to these ends is

373
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:50,970
not the same, let's say, the center mass. And not only is the distance not the same,

374
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,710
but the shape is not the same. So the way the energy is reflected back internally is

375
00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:01,890
very different. And you think of the inside of the egg as the concave side. Imagine two

376
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:07,910
satellite dishes, let's say, or two concave objects that have, or a concave object has

377
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:14,170
a focal point. And when you have two slightly different levels of concave geometric forms,

378
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:20,590
the focal point is different. So what will happen is you will have this form of asymmetric

379
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:24,990
imbalance inside the egg that will convect energy, anything that passes through there,

380
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:33,270
that is not material, also in an imbalanced state, which promotes movement. Now, hopefully

381
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:39,050
that was imparted in a simple way, even though it was pretty elaborate on the geometric side.

382
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:45,310
But one thing you will see simply, if you want to just tie in this rationale, if you

383
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:51,490
do any historic referencing through imagery, you will see that the ancients and older

384
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:56,990
societies always kept fluids, not only water, but other fluids as well that were considered

385
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:04,330
to be of quality, or quality of the fluid was of importance, in non-flat-bottom containers,

386
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:11,910
non-spherical, non-square, non-rectangular, non-triangular, but in ovoid shape. If you

387
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:18,190
look at what's called the ancient amphora, I guess you'd spell that A-M-P-H-O-R-A, amphora,

388
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:24,530
you'll find that most people might criticize and say, �Look how stupid these ancients

389
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:28,750
were. They didn't know how to make flat-bottom containers, so none of the vessels stood up

390
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,710
on their own.� That's right. They didn't stand up on their own. They had to build elaborate

391
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:39,850
stands and they had sandboxes and things. Well, just think about that for a minute when

392
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:45,690
they criticize how moderns are. We're so modern now, right? I believe on several other

393
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:53,710
occasions I've made one of the critical comments. One of the things to look at society is pretty

394
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:57,850
much to see how they store their fluids. If you see flat-bottom containers exposed to

395
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:03,230
the light, you want to get off that planet if you have a means to. Anyway, the food here

396
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:12,810
is good and the women tend to be good-looking. The animals are fun to interact with. It's

397
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:18,570
nice to have pets, let's say. Like one of the films, I think it was Cape Hatch or something

398
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:23,550
that says you have good produce. The sky seems to be reasonably good. It's not an unpleasant

399
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,710
place. It's just that people do really dumb things.

400
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:33,310
Those considerations, by the way, so far, keeping it out of the dark, keeping it cold

401
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:38,870
and seeking out an ovoid container. Most people are not going to be able to affect the geometry

402
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:45,450
of the transport mechanisms around them, meaning the plumbing. Yes, plumbing. Plume is a word

403
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:52,650
for lead because lead was used for pipes back in the day. Lead oxide, by the way, is inert.

404
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:58,450
It's like a ceramic material, so don't be so frightened when you hear about lead. Anyway,

405
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:05,030
I wouldn't say it's good for you, but don't be so scared and troubled when you hear about

406
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:11,230
certain things. The plumbing, by the way, is the antithesis

407
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:16,630
of what you would want to design. When one thinks about how running all these things

408
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:21,130
in a straight fashion, if you discuss this with the engineers, they say, �Well, if

409
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:26,310
we don't make it like this, we get cavitation and other problems and things like that, and

410
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:33,070
we get weird things happening because water starts to act like it's alive, right?�

411
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:38,590
They go silent when you say that. Nonetheless, I'll just share a little bit

412
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:45,590
of a personal one. I've been involved in working with water for quite a while. I wouldn't say

413
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:53,250
there is any satisfactory, maybe some places in Europe approaching mildly in a fixture

414
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:58,850
capacity, not in a network of plumbing, even in a building that is satisfactory to carry

415
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:05,610
the water. I'm talking about the rule now. There isn't even an exception where I can

416
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:10,390
point anyone on how water is being treated properly in its conduit form or transport

417
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:15,450
form at the moment on this planet, other than perhaps projects that I shouldn't say somewhat

418
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:23,530
I know very well is affected. Let's just continue. Moving of water, the

419
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:29,370
storage of water, if you got it, you got it. If you got it that the water should be kept

420
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:34,110
out of the light and kept cool, you got it. If you're going to work with water and you

421
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:43,330
are pursuing the quality of water for biological purposes, let's say for food or drink, I would

422
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:50,790
suggest those things, keeping it cool, keeping it dark, keeping it in an ovoid-shaped container.

423
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:55,250
One of the comments that I've gotten, well, many comments that I've gotten in the past

424
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:59,350
is I can't find an egg-shaped container. That's fine. You ever see, by the way, in

425
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:04,170
wine cellars how the bottles are laying down? Well, yeah, it's regarding sediment and other

426
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:09,810
things like that, but keep the cork wet so it doesn't dry out. Let's say you took those

427
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:15,030
considerations out, keeping the cork moist and the whatever. Stand a bottle up, lay

428
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:18,810
one down. The one that's laying down always tastes better on a double-blind test because

429
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:23,590
the bottom of the bottle when it's laying down is not flat. It still gets a good amount

430
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:27,350
of convection. Actually, it could be a semi-profile of an egg shape.

431
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:34,050
I'll just give you a little secret. Regarding egg shape or ovoid shapes, when you want to

432
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:40,610
purify water or a purification process, the water should be stored with the egg with

433
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:44,510
the point down. That's why when you look at many of the ancient M4s, they're very pointy

434
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:50,890
at the bottom. When you're looking for the water to, let's say, have digestive qualities

435
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:57,070
or de-disintegrating qualities, let's say for sewer water treatment or fermentation,

436
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:04,670
the pointy side goes up and the oblong side goes down. It's a direction of internal energy.

437
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:10,110
I just want to share that for you folks. If you're doing research on this subject and

438
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:17,270
you find, let's say, images regarding industry using these egg shapes, you will see sometimes

439
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:21,610
they're vertical. No, they're not vertical, but yes, they are vertical, meaning the opposing

440
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:27,570
ends are up and down. You will find that the pointy side being down, pointy side being

441
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:32,130
up is for different purposes. Again, the pointy side being down is for purification of clear

442
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:36,730
water and the pointy side being up or the oblong side or the wider side of the egg

443
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:41,810
being down is for fermentation or breaking down purposes. Think about that. This way,

444
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:45,530
hopefully, it will help your cognitive ability if you're doing any research on the subject.

445
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:53,770
Pretty much right now, I would suggest that anyone, wherever you are, whether you are what

446
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:58,590
you call in a boat or on the road or anywhere, if you are planning on interacting with this

447
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:03,890
liquid cold water and you are looking to immediately raise the quality of it, put it in the dark

448
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:11,090
and keep it cool. Now, the coolest spot, I mean, obviously, it's not between your legs

449
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:17,510
or under your arm when you're carrying it. Keep it away from the body. You might want

450
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:25,750
to consider putting it near the floor, things like that if you don't have what's called

451
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:26,710
refrigeration.

452
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:33,110
People have gotten really used to that modern thing called refrigeration. Typically, when

453
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:37,990
I'm looking to keep something cool, that is the last resort that I look for because it

454
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:46,170
takes up energy and it's a very specific type of thing. It's a machine. By the way, in most

455
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:50,750
natural environments, unless you're in a colder weather or colder climate, it will be difficult

456
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:56,810
to approach the 39 degree or 4 degree Celsius without refrigeration. Always be mindful for

457
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:59,070
storage to keep it out of the light and keep it cool.

458
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:06,190
What does that mean when you go to what they call the stove and you see the water in clear

459
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:12,630
plastic bottles on the shelf at room temperature? All that means is that those that are providing

460
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:19,710
that water to the public and ultimately yourselves and also the people that are advising these

461
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:29,130
people or all around them are clueless of this or don't care about quality. This is a

462
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:33,710
very heavy statement to make because this seems to be consistent across almost all societies

463
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:41,290
at the moment. If you want to judge a society, make a good decision about it. You will see

464
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:42,850
that obviously there is very little care.

465
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:48,270
Whether they know about what we've just discussed here regarding upping the quality of water

466
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:53,390
or not is irrelevant. The fact is you are being provided with water that is exposed

467
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:58,530
to light when it's static, of course, in a bottle and exposed to room temperature and

468
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:04,030
there is no consideration otherwise. Now, whether you want to become an attorney for

469
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:07,810
the water providers and say, well, they don't know, they haven't inquired, this is not

470
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:11,450
the point. The point is that this is the fact and the truth of the matter now.

471
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:17,550
So the judgment call here is get it out of the light, get it cool. Yes, there is a veritable

472
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:22,370
other group of matters that could be discussed about water being in plastic and other materials.

473
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:28,070
Yes, of course. But the main thing here is to get it, if you were to just stop listening

474
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:32,590
now is to walk away and know that if you're going to interact with water for nutritive

475
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:39,610
purposes, whether it's plant, animal or whatever, you're going to keep it out of the light and

476
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:44,830
keep it in the coolest place possible simply and also avoid a flat bottom container if

477
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:49,310
possible. And if it has a flat bottom container and a sealed lid, turn it on its side if it's

478
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:55,290
curved and most tubular shape objects are, meaning bottles. So this is what anyone can

479
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:57,070
walk away with at the moment.

480
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:01,090
Now, I just want to bring this up. Very often I get comments, just stop talking about how

481
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:05,630
crappy everyone else is and just do your thing. I'm like, yes, but you've got to throw a dig

482
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:10,850
into what's going on in the world. There is so much discussion about all this foolishness.

483
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:14,550
Let's just say dummy load. If you're not listening to the Greek for the first time, you've been

484
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:18,730
around here before. When I say dummy load, you know what I mean. It's a dummy load, folks.

485
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:25,450
It's all a dummy load. How much discussion, quote-unquote ridiculous websites, ridiculous

486
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:31,190
videos, ridiculous stories, ridiculous books about water and wherever is it emphasized

487
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:35,150
that you need to keep it out of the light and keep it cool. Other than Victor Schauberger

488
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:44,510
using that as the basis, you don't hear this in common discussion in modern times or not

489
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:50,570
only modern but meaning 5, 10, 20 years as far back as you want to go within your limited

490
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:56,290
lifespan here. Let's just say the digital format especially. It's not being stressed.

491
00:46:57,590 --> 00:47:02,270
So does it deserve to be stressed as an important point? Yes. Keep it out of the dark. Keep it

492
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:09,010
cool and keep it out of things that have corners. Maybe that's the simple way to say it.

493
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:18,730
So I would suggest that at this point, anyone anywhere can do these things that will raise

494
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:26,270
the quality of water meaning no matter where you are or just simply applying the principle

495
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:31,270
of keeping it cool, keeping it dark and avoid a flat bottom container is going to raise

496
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:37,190
the quality of the water simply and this is what anyone can walk away from now knowing

497
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:44,030
and applying. Now, there's many other aspects about the qualities of water and what one

498
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:50,070
can do to up the quality of it and perhaps we'll discuss that. We're almost an hour

499
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:57,110
into this discussion or recitation I should say. Perhaps get into more of the actual details

500
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:05,010
of what can be done with a little more effort because most people are creatures of their

501
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:10,270
culture, creatures of their traditions. Most people think that, well, I walk into a room,

502
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:15,570
if it's dark, I'm going to reach around and look for a wall switch because obviously the

503
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:19,850
switch is off and that's why the light is not on. This is the common thinking. You see

504
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:25,670
the culture right now has been taken for granted all of the things, I'm discussing most parts

505
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:32,330
of the world that if it's dark, you're looking for a light switch to turn on. If you need

506
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:37,710
water, you're looking around in an edifice or somewhere, where is there a tap or a valve

507
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:40,570
where water is being plumbed through here, you see.

508
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:47,950
So, all of these things now that are accommodating the people's just very basic needs because

509
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:55,370
they have regarding water are really moving in the wrong direction or wrong geometry.

510
00:48:56,110 --> 00:49:03,690
Just producing the substance has been determined to be quite a success and quite enough. But

511
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:09,350
over the years, what people are not making a point of is the longer and the more that

512
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:14,570
water is being transported and handled the way it is, you've noticed how people's character

513
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:20,070
has been getting poorer and poorer. What I mean character is the personality. The people's

514
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:23,890
health in general has been getting poorer and poorer.

515
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:29,010
You've heard of something called cancer, it's a Greek word by the way. Victor Schauberger

516
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:33,350
had written something in the 30s with a chart regarding cancer because he noticed that since

517
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:37,650
the Danube began to be in Germany and Austria and places like that began rivers were straightened

518
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:43,530
out and more of the straight conduit plumbing was installed. He says that the cancer rate

519
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:48,390
had gone from 500 people to 1,000 people over a few years in Austria which was shocking out

520
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:54,890
of the many millions. He did a chart projecting that if the world was on this course about

521
00:49:54,890 --> 00:50:00,250
running water through straight pipes and chemically treating it as they do, he did a chart in

522
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:06,210
the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s into the 2000s what the percentage of the population would

523
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:12,130
be that would catch cancer. Let's just say in ghetto terms. You call it cancer? No. Okay,

524
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:15,790
we'll come down with this thing called cancer. It's a dysfunctional illness.

525
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:21,710
If you actually look at the figures that he had coming into the 21st century, what they

526
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:26,210
call the 21st century and the 2000s are pretty accurate because by that time, he says that

527
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:30,590
one out of three and then it will be one out of one and then by 2050, no one will be left

528
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:35,410
because of it. Now, he might have been maybe a bit strict suggesting that it was strictly

529
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:42,650
regarding water but I find it to be just unnervingly prophetic that he was that accurate just by

530
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:47,830
presuming that if the water was to be transported through straight pipes, the cancer rates would

531
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:53,350
increase thusly and he was extremely accurate about it. A great mind of an individual there.

532
00:50:56,530 --> 00:51:02,910
Something to think about. Couple that by the way with what I started out earlier by saying

533
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:08,870
water has memory and how it can be used as a rudimentary form of teleportation for small

534
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:13,010
pieces of cells and I hope someone does some research on this and find something online

535
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:17,210
about it because water is quite amazing regarding that.

536
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:25,130
The next level of course would be seeking out higher quality water in itself, wouldn't

537
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:30,510
it? Spring water is always touted as being the best. There's also a lot of talk about

538
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:37,970
rainwater and I'll get into spring water and rainwater and other forms of water but also

539
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:43,070
the point of discussing water is that whoever is listening can walk away and actually do

540
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:50,030
something about it instead of this ridiculousness that you see on the internet regarding, oh,

541
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:54,070
what can be done with water and what water is and all this ridiculousness that you hear

542
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:59,710
out there. I don't think it's possible to balance the equation but a ridiculousness

543
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:05,650
but just providing it at least once or a couple of times which I think will be provided again

544
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:13,050
perhaps in a future project with more detail. How anyone can just take a short report or

545
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:17,550
a short message, let's say, and have it affect the way they view the world or especially

546
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:25,790
in this case, water. Again, keep it cool, keep it dark and avoid right angles, corners,

547
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:29,710
flat bottoms and you're on your way to increasing water quality.

548
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:37,850
The next thing that we could pretty much bring up in the near future of this episode will

549
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:43,870
be what one can do to improve it and what you will find when you get into what's called

550
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:48,430
water purification devices and other devices to improve water quality and we're talking

551
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:53,590
about devices that are specifically engineered and provided to the public to do that, whether

552
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:58,650
it's to eliminate pathogens or to increase water quality or whatever. Typically, most

553
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:04,910
of quote-unquote water purification devices are to address pathogens and chemicals.

554
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:12,790
As I mentioned again in the beginning, there's a lot more to it but let's just say how do

555
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:18,050
you make a more educated or a better judgment when you're crossing that line, let's say

556
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:23,370
the line of making a purchase or putting something together that is going to act as a water purification

557
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:29,630
device. That would be perhaps the next level because right now it's gotten to the point

558
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:34,750
economically and commercially feasible to just spend a little bit in a lot of these

559
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:40,190
big box stores and get very rudimentary devices called pitcher filters and I'll get into the

560
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:45,570
significance of how to use those properly and optimally and perhaps discuss a little

561
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:49,270
bit about spring water and rain water and we might have about a minute or two before

562
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:54,490
the break. Let me just bring up something regarding water memory again. When you change

563
00:53:54,490 --> 00:54:01,570
the phase of water, whether it goes from a liquid to a vapor or a liquid to a solid,

564
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:08,730
you also address its memory and we will discuss more about that on the second hour and keep

565
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:09,050
it wet.

566
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:16,510
Greetings on this around 26th day of the second month. It's lawful timekeeping of course and

567
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:22,550
if anyone knows what that means anymore, but let's just say this is Uncommon Radio and

568
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:28,470
you could find archives and other things either at American Freedom Radio website or the Uncommon

569
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:34,970
Radio site and it's www.uncommonradio.com and there you can also contact the Greeks.

570
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:41,770
This discussion, this is solo 10 and discussing water and before the break, we were kind of

571
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:47,290
bringing up the point that what you can do again is to keep water cool, keep it dark,

572
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:52,750
keep it out of flat bottom containers and yes, you will not see this anywhere you go pretty

573
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,810
much on this planet at this time. Let's just move on.

574
00:54:56,330 --> 00:55:02,170
The next level of consideration here is this, I guess with a little bit of thought during

575
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:06,470
the break, would be addressing more of the cosmopolitan types or the urban types or even

576
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:13,470
suburban types that rely on getting water from a tap and what I got into previous is

577
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:20,850
regarding spring water and rainwater because many parts of the world, there are still quite

578
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:25,470
a few people, even people I'm in touch with that do get their water from a spring or a

579
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:30,230
well type situation direct from a source or from rain catchments.

580
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:34,910
So I just wanted to bring up something that maybe would have been faded out during the

581
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:39,190
last part was that when you change the phase of water, when you freeze it from a liquid

582
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:45,610
to a solid to let's say ice or you vaporize it, now again, this is not really distillation

583
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:52,330
but you can say that yes, distillation is vaporization. You tend to let's just say erase

584
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:56,670
a lot of the previous memory that it had. Now there are magnetic systems that can do

585
00:55:56,670 --> 00:56:00,150
that as well but one thing to consider, I'm not going to get into a lot of this other

586
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:06,050
stuff about the memory of water and magnetism and other things like that. That will be done

587
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:10,850
in the future perhaps but let me just bring up a couple of points regarding that.

588
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:19,630
The distillation, the heat distillation again is taking water into a vapor state, condensing

589
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:24,190
it. It basically is still and then when the water goes back to a liquid state, it must

590
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:30,430
be considered again to be kept out of the dark, out of the light and in the cool. So

591
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:35,370
again, to up its quality but you have a different quality of water there but most of the memory

592
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:40,410
let's say is gone and we'll discuss memory a little bit again perhaps after we talk about

593
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:46,970
filtration. Now the other aspect about rainwater here, the other aspect of being as a source

594
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:52,510
for many people is they have rain catchment, let's say tanks and things like that which

595
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:59,230
have their own issues. When the water comes down as rain, it is a newly formed water by

596
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:05,150
the way. It's not really based as science discusses because if you ever look at a rain

597
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:13,230
cloud, if you actually look at a rain cloud prior to rain, do you see any water in that

598
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:17,690
cloud? Anyone can do the math of what let's say five or six millimeters or a quarter of

599
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:22,710
an inch of rain over a few square kilometers, what that weighs. Yes, it's in the thousands

600
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:27,350
if not hundreds of thousands of tons. Do you think those clouds have any water in them?

601
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:36,610
You might but in reality they don't. Ask anyone who is an aviator or a pilot. So the instance

602
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:43,230
of switching the discussion to how rain is formed is quite mind blowing in itself because

603
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:48,130
the water is just created out of nothing underneath the cloud. Yes, something to do

604
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:54,050
with condensation because anyway, let's just give a little bit of a dig to the meteorologists

605
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:59,190
and the scientists again. You know how you hear about mass and energy are conserved,

606
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:04,130
right? It can't be created or destroyed, just transferred. Well, if you have a given amount

607
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:10,190
of humidity and they tell you that it's the humidity in the air that condenses into raindrops,

608
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:15,890
then that means that the level of measurable humidity, which basically is 15 grams per

609
00:58:15,890 --> 00:58:21,850
cubic meter of air you need to, they say to have or 30% humidity to have rain. If they're

610
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:26,270
telling you that it's the humidity in the air that condenses into raindrops, then right

611
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:31,950
prior to the rain or after the rain, the humidity level should drop because it's transferred

612
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:37,410
from the measurable water vapor in the air into condensed drops. But what happens when

613
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:43,410
you actually measure rain events, the humidity actually goes up as the rain event begins.

614
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:50,070
So where is that water coming from? You have a huge increase of water by volume, whether

615
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:55,950
it's vapor or droplet form increasing in the environment. Where is it coming from? Well,

616
00:58:56,030 --> 00:59:01,430
nowhere. Well, nowhere is the opposite of somewhere, isn't it? We'll discuss that in the future.

617
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:07,010
And it's not about humidity coalescing around dust particles and that ridiculous scientific

618
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:11,750
stuff. And I'm not going to get into it because it's really easy to go on a rant with how

619
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:17,410
stupid these academics are because I've actually spoken to people on graduate level and I asked

620
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:21,230
them why the sky is blue. And I said, well, my professor told me the sky is blue because

621
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:28,310
it reflects the color of the oceans. This is the level of idiocy. But anyway, the rain

622
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:34,090
is very important in this case because it is a new water. It's, Victor Schauberger

623
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:40,670
might call it an immature water. And I would suggest it's a better quality, obviously,

624
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:46,270
than what are you getting out of a straitjacket, which are the straight conduits at the municipalities

625
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:52,330
and the modern, so advanced people on this planet are providing you with. And much better

626
00:59:52,330 --> 01:00:01,490
than the clear light bearing containers that are at room temperature that your modern wonderful

627
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:07,650
procurers are bringing to you, wonderfully evolved civilization that you are, you see.

628
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:16,670
So just again, if you're going to the source, consider the dark source, meaning water rain

629
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:22,650
catchment and water well or water spring catchment type places. You still have to consider

630
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:31,470
the dark and the cool or the cold if possible. So at this point, thinking of going into the

631
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:38,670
next level is for most people in addressing the cosmopolitan, suburban, semi-urban, urban

632
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:45,670
types that have rubbed two shekels together and go to a big box store, not that I'm recommending

633
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:49,750
it, even a thrift store somewhere and getting what's called a pitcher filter. There are

634
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:55,410
more elaborate types that have been, I don't want to really use their names, but you can

635
01:00:55,410 --> 01:01:00,950
guess. They're made of stainless or various other. They have these candle type screw-in

636
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:05,650
filters and you pour water in and you wait half a day and you get some water in the catchment

637
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:11,310
area that's allegedly purified. And I say allegedly, pretty much is of the measurable

638
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:17,330
chemical and pathogenic substances in the water. But that's another discussion because

639
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:21,950
there are things that can be measured that are not known to these academics. And by the

640
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:25,450
way, you don't want to really deal with them too much, so hence this episode.

641
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:31,630
So let's just go back to the pitcher filter, the gravity filter, that type of thing. If

642
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:37,270
you can rub a few pennies or shekels or something, shillings together, you can probably acquire

643
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:42,510
what's called a pitcher filter. And other than the real expensive ones, let's say,

644
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:46,290
or the ones that are relatively expensive, you will find some cheap plastic ones. They're

645
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:51,230
usually made of a polycarbonate, which is not a BPA-free and you can get into a lot

646
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:55,690
of this other chemical stuff. I don't want it to be a discussion on how toxic the environment

647
01:01:55,690 --> 01:02:01,750
has, or mildly toxic it has become under the goddess religion, which you folks still don't

648
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:05,970
know anything about, meaning not necessarily the direct listener, but society in general

649
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:10,510
does not address this, which I have previously and will in more detail in the future.

650
01:02:11,210 --> 01:02:16,690
You are being mildly toxified, of course, by almost all substances you come in contact

651
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:21,270
with that are produced by industry for a reason, and it's not only what you think.

652
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:25,510
There is a religious reason behind it, and that will be discussed, but you will find

653
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:31,510
these pitcher filters of low price to be of not the best material, but you are not seeking

654
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:36,530
out the material. You are seeking out the function. Now, there are many other ways to

655
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:42,430
do it. Now, to do what? Use a simple gravity filter to up the quality of water. Now, the

656
01:02:42,430 --> 01:02:45,490
reason I'm bringing up the gravity filter or the pitcher filter is because the other

657
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:50,230
option, of course, is an inline pressurized or non-pressurized system through attached

658
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:55,890
to the plumbing somehow, and that gets a little more elaborate, and at that point, I would

659
01:02:55,890 --> 01:03:01,170
say for most people what their water needs are, you could bypass that, but that would

660
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:07,450
be another discussion, by the way, when you're affecting the plumbing, but again, the end

661
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,510
result has to be the water kept out of light and kept cool.

662
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:17,890
Now, with what you call a rudimentary or more elaborate gravity filter or pitcher type filter,

663
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:23,830
the thing to consider is when you approach this device, the water going in, meaning the

664
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:28,150
water in question, the water that you are not ready to drink because you got a filter

665
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:34,810
to filter it with first should be cool. Now, what does that mean? Let's just give a scenario.

666
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:40,870
You just came back from some setting where you now are bringing, let's say, to your abode

667
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:47,310
a new pitcher filter or a new old one or something. You just got one in your life, let's say.

668
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:53,510
Immediately, keep it clean, of course. There's instructions on how to do that. You can follow

669
01:03:53,510 --> 01:04:00,190
them or not. You most likely are going to go to a tap or some source. That source water

670
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:05,750
should be chilled overnight or at least four hours in the fridge. Now, I'm presuming now

671
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:10,590
that you have a fridge or if you don't have a fridge, in a very cool spot. Years ago,

672
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:15,030
there used to be things called root cellars underground that were cool. There, I would

673
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:20,770
leave it for 24 hours. So when you touch, when you put a part of your body in the water,

674
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:26,490
it feels cool to cold, right? Now, again, addressing those that have the conveniences

675
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:32,310
of this modern world, if you have a fridge set at around four degrees Celsius or 39 degrees

676
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:38,010
Fahrenheit, which they typically are, put it in a jar, put it in a container. Yes, avoid

677
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:43,030
is best, but if not, at least we're chasing the cold and the dark in this case.

678
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:48,110
Even though it has not been filtered yet, chill it first. Put it in the dark first.

679
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:53,070
What that does is several things. You've set water on its journey to become more in a better

680
01:04:53,070 --> 01:05:01,270
state, and also you're increasing the efficiency of the filter element itself. Most filter

681
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:07,050
elements tend to be of some form of carbon, acidified carbon, coconut shell, hopefully.

682
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:12,330
The real inexpensive ones use bone. I would make sure that it's made of coconut shell,

683
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:19,870
not burned animal bone, which is not very typical, but is out there in some less scrupulous

684
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:26,710
manufacturers. Also, they have some typically ion exchange resin beads and other things

685
01:05:26,710 --> 01:05:30,350
like that in the inexpensive pitcher filters, and other ones, the more elaborate ones, have

686
01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:36,990
ceramic type filters and things like that that are carbonized or not. All of them will

687
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:42,770
work better when the water is cold. Also, the water is denser. It is more degasified,

688
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:48,350
so imagine, let's say theoretical here, a molecule of water when it has dissolved gases

689
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:52,790
in it, and you have a gas molecule next to a water molecule going through a filter, you're

690
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:58,510
not really maximizing the surface contact because you don't want to filter the dissolved gases.

691
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:05,770
The chilling also removes dissolved gases. When water is dense, that's why when you take

692
01:06:05,770 --> 01:06:09,690
water out of a dense state, let's say out of the fridge, pour it in a glass and leave

693
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:13,730
it on a table, you'll notice that all these little, for a few hours or less sometimes,

694
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:19,110
you'll notice all these little drops or little droplets of gas or air start to form on the

695
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:23,630
side of the glass. Now, depending on how and where they form, again, this could be another

696
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:27,230
discussion of determining the quality of the water and such. If they're near the top, that

697
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:31,490
means the water was degassed and now is absorbing gas. If they're at the bottom, it means that

698
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:37,170
the water now is doing both gassing and degassing. So this is an evidence of how you see the

699
01:06:37,170 --> 01:06:42,430
little drops of water form against the sides of the container if there's dissolved gas

700
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:47,250
and water. So it's important to have the water in its densest state to maximize the filter

701
01:06:48,730 --> 01:06:53,410
ability. Now, this sounds very rudimentary, very simple. Now, just to move ahead,

702
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:59,390
you pretty much got it. If you've got a basic tabletop filter, make sure it's cold when you

703
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:03,990
run it through and then immediately put it back in the cold and in the dark for a little while

704
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:09,370
before you use it. Now, this is for nutritive purposes, for drinking, let's say.

705
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:16,170
Now, another thing to consider regarding this is because it is a consideration and it's an

706
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:25,550
aesthetic one or one that is regarding taste. You have water in what's called the appearance

707
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:30,490
of plastics. There are various types of plastics too that can be identified either by... You don't

708
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:36,650
have to be a polymer chemist. They're usually labeled. Get it out of the plastic. Eventually,

709
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:41,410
you will find that things, if not already, taste better when they're in glass containers

710
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:47,810
or ceramic containers than if they're in plastic or paper. Most of these soft paper containers,

711
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:53,250
by the way, have a plastic lining in them as opposed to some types of paraffins and waxes.

712
01:07:53,430 --> 01:08:00,650
Plastic can also be a wax. So getting it out of that, if you can, is best.

713
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:09,490
So for example, if I had an ovoid-shaped plastic container or a mason jar, a glass, which is not

714
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:17,430
ovoid-shaped, I would take the mason jar flat bottom over the plastic ovoid just to give a

715
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:24,990
sense of priority. Okay? So if you're using these pitcher filters... Now, it's not that difficult

716
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:31,590
if you are sort of handy, I should say, to just perhaps purchase the elements for these pitcher

717
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:38,529
filters and find a vessel of some sort that can separate the incoming water from the filtered

718
01:08:38,529 --> 01:08:42,569
water that is not made of plastic or metal. I was just saying, I didn't bring up the metal.

719
01:08:42,689 --> 01:08:46,910
I don't want to stick on that too much, but metal is also not very good for obvious reasons.

720
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:51,350
Maybe not so obvious to some, but that could be discussed perhaps if we have time.

721
01:08:52,010 --> 01:08:59,710
Now, if you can devise a way to do a gravity filter without using a plastic-type container,

722
01:08:59,950 --> 01:09:06,270
that would be far superior as well. So really simple here. Again, this sonic episode,

723
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:10,970
I'm keeping it basic. I was thinking of elaborating on more things. It's possible

724
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:17,990
to if there's time. But the essence of this discussion or this presentation is that

725
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:26,270
if anyone can be empowered by comprehending what should be done and could be done to water to

726
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:32,830
increase its quality and be able to execute it simply and immediately is a success. It's far

727
01:09:32,830 --> 01:09:41,430
better than hearing all of the ridiculous tripe either from internet guests and hosts and YouTubes

728
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:47,470
and ridiculousness about water that the listener is just wondering,

729
01:09:48,609 --> 01:09:51,710
why am I listening to this? I should be touching myself instead.

730
01:09:51,870 --> 01:10:00,870
But anyway, because how can you walk away from what is supposed to be imparting of information

731
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:06,550
and be neutered? In other words, not be able to do anything about it. By the way, I've just

732
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:12,750
explained all of mainstream and alternative media. So the thing here is very simple, folks.

733
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:16,930
Again, keep it cool, keep it in the shade. Yes, and if you want to be sarcastic, you could say,

734
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:22,530
yes, do we keep it cool? Do we keep it in the dark? Yes, of course. And the attributes of a

735
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:27,390
simple gravity filter, it's a very simple way to go. Now, that is the beginning of it.

736
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:35,870
Now, I'll get into a little bit more perhaps. More meaning, let's just say more on what's

737
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:41,170
being done and how it's being presented to you. Now, the folks that are getting their water from

738
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:45,870
what's called a non-municipal source or a spring or a well and those that are collecting it from

739
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:51,150
rainwater catchments are not going to be so much concerned about what the quote-unquote

740
01:10:51,150 --> 01:10:55,590
water authorities or municipalities are putting in the water because you hear that very often.

741
01:10:56,450 --> 01:11:00,350
Now, there used to be a lot of discussion about all of the negative attributes of the chemicals

742
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:06,030
that are being put in water and it's sort of a limited discussion because you understand when

743
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:11,750
you do hear, let's say, for example, fluoride and other things in the water, that's how you actually

744
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:17,510
know those that are screaming about it are part of the Gustave Le Bon crowd mentality, the typical

745
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:23,050
moron with a microphone, I call it, syndrome that you see throughout the internet and other places

746
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:29,770
because what is not being discussed and can be discussed here very simply and anyone can

747
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:34,150
research it is when you hear about these morons discussing fluoride in the water,

748
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:41,030
they never bring up the fact that fluoride and fluorine and other things like that are, now,

749
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:44,750
regardless of the compound because there's sodium fluoride and calcium fluoride and one is

750
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:48,770
deemed more toxic than the other, but fluoride is what it's called nonetheless.

751
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:55,170
What these morons fail to bring up is that it is what's called, again, let's refer to this

752
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:58,610
ridiculous thing called the periodic table of elements that is supposed to be a reference tool.

753
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:03,230
That is what's called the halide groups or the halogen or halides in that area.

754
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:10,610
Again, morons with microphones, when they scream about their ridiculousness stuff because they're

755
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:16,670
part of a crowd mentality, hopefully people will watch their YouTubes, whatever, what's going on

756
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:21,650
is they don't know the story. Just like I mentioned, when you hear this ridiculousness

757
01:12:21,650 --> 01:12:27,290
on the internet, it's because it's become so oversimplified to get to those that are

758
01:12:27,290 --> 01:12:31,170
purveying the information and receiving the information that it no longer resembles its

759
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:37,850
original source or what the matter is really about. Now, the halide groups, think about it.

760
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:45,890
What else is going on there? Well, what do halide elements do? What else is like a halide or even

761
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:49,770
beyond the halogens and things like that, not just lights, right? Think about it.

762
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:55,890
Well, what else is in there? You got iodine, fluoride, bromine, bromide, chlorine,

763
01:12:55,890 --> 01:13:02,230
chloride. You see the point? What do they do? Those elements harden tissue in the body,

764
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:07,790
soft tissue and particularly like the brain, if you've still got one or if you've got at least

765
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:13,570
two cells to rub together or other parts of the sensitive part of the body. There's some studies

766
01:13:13,570 --> 01:13:19,190
that are done, academic studies on how it hardens the tissue in mammals and it could cause some

767
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:23,350
minor to major damage. I once brought this up to an academic and they said,

768
01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:28,930
well, that has nothing to do with people. This is the level of intelligentsia that you have on

769
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:32,710
your planet. So whether you're proud of it or not, it's not very good.

770
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:38,330
So again, whenever you hear the discussion regarding fluoride or so, it is not just the

771
01:13:38,330 --> 01:13:44,170
fluoride compound or sodium fluoride. You ever heard of, well, I just mentioned bromine or

772
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:48,650
bromide. You know what flour is? Yeah, they make bread and cookies and things out of it. You know

773
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:56,070
why most of it is brominated, right? Okay, you get it. Or they have some non-brominated flour,

774
01:13:56,210 --> 01:14:00,230
but you will find bromine in there a lot. It has like a chlorine smell. It's like a

775
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:04,610
amber liquid until a mental state. But have you ever heard of something called chlorine? Oh yeah,

776
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:08,010
we got to put that in and get rid of the bugs. Anybody that knows you're a little bacteria,

777
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:11,790
everybody who's ever had a swimming pool where they use bromine tablets or chlorine gas or

778
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:16,610
whatever, it doesn't do much. It initially does clean up, but then it gives an emergence of other

779
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:22,510
bugs and critters that have not been acknowledged. So you also hear a lot of these prepper idiots

780
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:26,390
that talk about, oh yeah, I'll just store water with chlorine and then run it through a carbon

781
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:32,050
filter later. And what they don't know is that the chlorine will eliminate initially some of the

782
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:36,910
initial presence of pathogens. But while it's just sitting there, it'll create a rise of other

783
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:41,510
pathogens that have not been acknowledged. Yeah, that's why they're called preppers. I don't know

784
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:50,390
why. By the way, when you think of morons discussing and yelling about Florida, which

785
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:55,950
they haven't anymore because they change their tune every week in the media, basically alternative

786
01:14:55,950 --> 01:15:00,370
media I'm discussing now. You won't hear much whoop-de-doo about it on the mainstream.

787
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:05,530
But when you hear this crowd mentality, you have to keep in mind, do a little bit more work and

788
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:15,570
find out that there is a pervasion of not only inflicting you with fluoride, but also chlorine

789
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:21,230
and iodine. Yeah, iodized salt. You ever hear of that? You need iodine or you're going to die,

790
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:26,710
one doctor once said. I said, oh yeah, really? That's why I call them devils with white lab

791
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:31,490
coats or devils with white coats. But why do you think they iodize the salt? Why do you think you

792
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:39,590
got brominated flour? Why do you think? Because they all have the same effect. So whenever you

793
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:43,990
hear about fluoride in the water, start thinking about all the other elements that are being used.

794
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:49,070
Now, what does hardening of the tissue do, by the way? It turns people into cows. Keep it short,

795
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:53,750
kind of like lithium in a way. Now, am I for it or against it? I'm not going to say. Well,

796
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:57,310
on one end, it's kind of insidious to do it. I think if you're going to do something like that,

797
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:02,350
someone should let them know. But on the other side, can you blame them? Have you been out in

798
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:06,530
public lately? Have you ever seen that the potential violence that the masses can put

799
01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:12,930
on each other? So anyway, putting stuff in the water to harden soft tissue has been going on

800
01:16:12,930 --> 01:16:18,150
since the 30s and it's not just the fluoride, folks. It has nothing to do with teeth, but it's

801
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:23,090
also the bromine and the iodized things and the chlorine. Think about it. Well, actually don't

802
01:16:23,090 --> 01:16:27,790
think about it. You'll be in a lot of trouble. So this is just something to think about. Well,

803
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:34,050
again, I said it again. Well, why? Because not only are they, most of the municipalities have

804
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:39,430
adopted putting this nasty chemical in the water, but they've now come up with a new thing.

805
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:45,890
Well, it's not so new, but to some it might be. Well, they add ammonia, which is an alkaline to

806
01:16:45,890 --> 01:16:51,390
the chlorine to make it even more effective. Now, that's being dubbed as a chloramine.

807
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:55,450
Yeah, however you want to spell it. However, it sounded probably close enough.

808
01:16:56,250 --> 01:17:02,530
M-I-M in the end. Well, think about it. Now, these carbon filters are not designed to remove

809
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:06,790
chloramines, which is a compound or a loose compound of chlorine and ammonia.

810
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:10,310
And this is what's coming through a lot of people's tap water municipalities.

811
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:15,710
So a lot of these carbon pitcher filters and even in-house and line filters are not going to be

812
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:20,910
very effective against it. So what is? Very simple. And I'm going to bring this out.

813
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:26,890
There is something, a material that you can incorporate into a pitcher filter. Now,

814
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:31,250
remember when you're using a pitcher filter, or if you're using an inline filter, you can buy a

815
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:34,510
canister for it, but it's more elaborate. I'm not addressing inline filters here.

816
01:17:36,230 --> 01:17:40,570
This compound of chlorine and ammonia that they're introducing now, which renders many

817
01:17:40,570 --> 01:17:47,410
basic systems, I wouldn't say useless, but very ineffective to getting out the chemical side.

818
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:52,150
There's a material called zeolite, Z-E-O-L-I-T-E,

819
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:58,830
zeolite. And it's an inexpensive material. What it is, it's basically old lake beds,

820
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:04,850
ancient lake beds that are compacted almost into a chalky calcium kind of thing. Years ago,

821
01:18:05,030 --> 01:18:09,110
when cat litter was introduced, they used zeolites, but now they just use other forms of clay.

822
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:15,610
It's a form of clay, but it's not just any clay. It's not really water-soluble like clay is. It's

823
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:24,430
not organic. It's more mineralized and considered inorganic. It's a compound of alumina, not

824
01:18:24,430 --> 01:18:29,610
aluminum, alumina. It's a material that you will find, if you ever look at a spark plug,

825
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:33,950
the white center, they call that the porcelain. Well, there's no porcelain in that. It's alumina.

826
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:41,250
It's a centered ceramic type oxidized element, basically. Alumina is not aluminum. You could

827
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:45,630
look it up. It's its own element. But what's interesting about the zeolite, you can source

828
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:51,750
it at a pet food store. This is the type that is designed for water to be interacted with.

829
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:58,390
And they're called ammo chips, ammonium chips. If you go to a pet food store or a pet store that

830
01:18:58,390 --> 01:19:04,490
has aquarium supplies, and it's important because if you know anyone or research aquariums,

831
01:19:04,530 --> 01:19:10,730
one of the killers of freshwater fish is the high ammonia content in them. So what they do is they

832
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:18,910
incorporate zeolite to capture the ammonia out of the water. And again, zeolite is being used

833
01:19:18,910 --> 01:19:24,350
in the pool industry. If you go to a pool supplier, it's not as clean. It's not as white as

834
01:19:24,350 --> 01:19:29,450
the one for aquariums. It might have a little bit of a turquoise color to it or some other

835
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:36,510
mineral that could actually kill the fish. But it won't kill you. The reason I'm bringing up

836
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:41,550
the pool supply is because you could get a bag that's about half as tall as you are for just

837
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:47,190
a little bit, where if you go to the aquarium and get the laboratory grade or the very high quality

838
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:53,770
grade, that will probably, a liter of it could cost $10 or so. So there's a big price difference.

839
01:19:53,770 --> 01:19:59,190
But you're not going to use a lot of it. So what you would consider doing is buying this

840
01:19:59,610 --> 01:20:04,270
zeolite or ammo chips, ammonium chips used for aquariums, and you follow directions on cleaning

841
01:20:04,270 --> 01:20:09,070
it, which is usually a long soak and a lot of rinsing. And you'll figure out, like, am I ever

842
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:12,670
going to get this thing to run clear, you know, because it clouds up the water? Yes, you will.

843
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:17,410
Just take your time. A little bit of hydrogen peroxide to the water helps. Now, what you're

844
01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:21,950
going to do with that is apply it to the back end or the business end of the pitcher filter.

845
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:26,910
Now, you'll notice that when you have a gravity filter, you open the top usually,

846
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:31,730
because we're using gravity here. And that, excuse me, is the business end. That's where

847
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:38,250
the pre-filtered or the original stock water goes into. And those filters, in order for them to

848
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:46,030
work, they are fastened very tightly and water sealed to the top or upper portion of the gravity

849
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:53,170
filter. So you just simply pour in the clean and washed zeolite around the pitcher filter area,

850
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:59,470
whether you have one of the elaborate multiple filtered ones or whether it's one of the

851
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:05,690
inexpensive single drop-in one. Just don't worry about it. Just don't be concerned about it getting

852
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:10,230
in the water because it's going to filter, you know, it's going to hit the filter element and

853
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:15,930
won't pass through. And that will take care of the chloramine or the ammonia compounds that are

854
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:22,530
not now, but recently, I should say recent 20 years or so, but almost standardly put in most

855
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:30,910
municipalities now. And what you will do there is eliminate the ammonia. But it also, zeolite,

856
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:37,030
by the way, is also used for nuclear or radioactive water cleanup crews. When you have,

857
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:44,330
I think they're called NEST crews, there's Nuclear Emergency, whatever, Sanitation Team or

858
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:48,630
something, called NEST, whenever there is a nuclear spill or something like that. You see a

859
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:54,090
lot of them descended on 9-11 in New York. Anyway, I'm not going to get into that, but

860
01:21:54,850 --> 01:22:00,530
you can see that zeolite is important for that industry as well. And if there are nuclear

861
01:22:00,530 --> 01:22:05,670
radio tides in the water, which there are natural sources of uranium in spring water and things,

862
01:22:05,810 --> 01:22:10,510
I mean, the amount of what's considered radioactive material, radium, uranium,

863
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:16,450
other things, heavy metals in water. But if you want to address reducing that, the zeolite will

864
01:22:16,450 --> 01:22:22,090
do that as well. It has internally, the zeolite does a hexagonal structure that captures heavy

865
01:22:22,090 --> 01:22:28,110
metal. It's also known for that as well. So you might actually decrease the majority of heavy

866
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:37,070
metals in the water. So you're getting a twofer. And with the zeolite, it also has a propensity

867
01:22:37,070 --> 01:22:43,530
to attach to nitrogen and nitrates. So if your water source has been contaminated with

868
01:22:43,530 --> 01:22:47,750
agricultural runoff, which seems to be the main source of that, that will address it as well.

869
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:53,010
So now you've gotten, for just a couple of quid or a couple of bucks, either used or new,

870
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:59,470
an inexpensive pitcher filter. And hopefully, you have the inspiration or gumption or make

871
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:06,190
the effort to get some what's called zeolite or ammonium chips from an aquarium. And when you

872
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:11,090
think about how much to buy, just buy the smallest amount. And what that would be, it would

873
01:23:11,090 --> 01:23:17,710
be like 100 grams would do or maybe a pint, but you'll typically see it in a quart. Properly

874
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:22,210
prepare it and add that to the top or the business end of the gravity filter. And now you have taken

875
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:28,450
care of the majority of the nasties that most people discuss. And yes, it will treat a lot of

876
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:33,750
the halide compounds as well as the fluoride as well. It will not completely eliminate the

877
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:38,090
fluoride in the water, but it will heavily reduce it. So the combination of an inexpensive

878
01:23:38,090 --> 01:23:44,690
gravity filter with basic zeolites now is what you're going to hopefully walk away from

879
01:23:44,690 --> 01:23:50,290
listening to the sonic event. Now, one thing just to interject here, the zeolites do not

880
01:23:50,290 --> 01:23:55,490
need to be discarded and the filters that you are purchasing, the replacement filters,

881
01:23:55,610 --> 01:24:02,890
not to be discarded as soon as the quote unquote manufacturer recommends. If you are able to do

882
01:24:02,890 --> 01:24:07,310
what's called back flushing and if you have a little bit of hydrogen peroxide, which is

883
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:11,950
inexpensive to get, you don't have to use straight hydrogen peroxide. You can remove

884
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:16,830
the filter and the contents of the zeolite and leave them overnight in a hydrogen peroxide

885
01:24:16,830 --> 01:24:20,830
water mixture. How much hydrogen peroxide? Well, the more the better, but maybe just

886
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:26,190
like a one third or one quarter hydrogen peroxide or one part hydrogen peroxide to three or four

887
01:24:26,190 --> 01:24:34,630
parts water is considered okay or if not optimum, I should say, you don't have to use

888
01:24:34,630 --> 01:24:43,990
pure hydrogen peroxide. Now, the zeolite typically uses an exchange method to give up whatever

889
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:50,230
it's collected by salt. And typically you will see an industry in order to get the zeolite

890
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:57,190
cleaned up again so you can reuse it, they put it in a salt bath overnight. And when the salt

891
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:02,390
meets the zeolite, the zeolite tends to give up all the nasties that it's been holding on to.

892
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:07,890
But then again, if you decide to go that route, which I would recommend for if the water is

893
01:25:07,890 --> 01:25:12,990
really questionable, then you should go through a rinsing process again to get rid of the salt

894
01:25:12,990 --> 01:25:18,770
water. You will find that you could do a little bit of research on how to clean or back flush

895
01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:23,450
zeolite using salt and it's an industry standard way. But I find that most drinking water,

896
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:28,090
the amount of nasties, even the ammonia that you're going to get out of the

897
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:33,770
water that the municipalities put in doesn't deem a backward flush with salt, but you can

898
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:42,130
do that as well. So what I'm suggesting here is that you can increase the life of your filter

899
01:25:42,130 --> 01:25:47,790
elements by using a hydrogen peroxide wash or back flushing. Back flushing simply just means

900
01:25:47,790 --> 01:25:53,790
turning it upside down and running water through it backwards. The zeolite could last indefinitely,

901
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:59,250
I mean, years and years, the same zeolite. But if you have a very high, let's say,

902
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:06,030
dissolved solids or hard water area, I would recommend replacing it a year or two or three

903
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:14,750
or so. So here, hopefully anyone listening can walk away with comprehension of how you can up

904
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:20,090
the water quality in your urban, suburban or whatever environment you have. Now,

905
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:26,770
regarding the zeolite and the pitcher filter, some people that have a source known as a well source

906
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:31,150
or non-municipal might want to consider the pitcher filter and zeolite as well,

907
01:26:31,630 --> 01:26:37,510
if you think about it for a minute, especially if you live near an area where a lot of coal mining

908
01:26:37,510 --> 01:26:43,390
has been done. Yeah, what does that have to do with it? Well, with coal mining, for example,

909
01:26:43,390 --> 01:26:48,270
the anthracite or the carbon, the nature of the carbon, it was a natural filter in the earth for

910
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:53,030
underground water movement. And when that was mined, in a lot of cases, not only did they make

911
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:58,970
odd penetrations in the ground, but remove the carbon and you have typically near coal deposits,

912
01:26:59,110 --> 01:27:04,510
you also have heavy metal deposits and you might have a slightly heavier, more heavy metals and

913
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:12,110
other things like that in the well water if you're near a coal mine type situation. And when I say

914
01:27:12,110 --> 01:27:17,390
near, when you consider that most underground water moves at around 10 feet per second or three

915
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:26,530
meters per second, even four or 500 miles away is near. So think about that. So you might want to

916
01:27:26,530 --> 01:27:31,730
incorporate the zeolites in that case. Now, there are other things that can be done, which we'll

917
01:27:31,730 --> 01:27:38,590
probably will discuss in the future. There is other considerations of things, nasty things in

918
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:45,470
the water. And the mentioning of the existence of, let's say, carbon filters and now adding the

919
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:53,310
zeolite type filter, those are what's called, those are what I call or industry calls absorbers

920
01:27:53,780 --> 01:28:02,090
or absorbers with a B, A, B. There's another category of material. Now, you remember,

921
01:28:02,270 --> 01:28:05,810
we're just discussing the material chemical aspects of water purification.

922
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:12,290
There's another class of materials that deal with water and they're called adsorbers with an

923
01:28:12,290 --> 01:28:18,590
AD and spelled like absorb, but with a D instead of a B. And what they do, they're like catalyzers

924
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:25,690
or think of them like as flypaper where the surface of the material that's being used as

925
01:28:25,690 --> 01:28:32,130
an adsorber is where the nasties kind of bond to. And one of those things are what is called

926
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:38,410
magnetite. Magnetite is black sand. Chemically, they call it Fe3O4. It's an iron phase. It's pure

927
01:28:38,410 --> 01:28:47,630
iron. It's an iron and oxide, iron oxide, but it's not rust. It's Fe3O4, which is in a crystalline

928
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:53,790
form. If you do a little bit of research on magnetite, you'll see that it looks in natural

929
01:28:53,790 --> 01:28:59,810
form like a double pyramid. And it actually has the 51.4 degree angle of the Great Pyramid.

930
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:05,950
So you wonder about that. Or a 360 divided by seven. So magnetite's a very interesting material

931
01:29:05,950 --> 01:29:11,370
because it is an iron oxide, but it does not rust, but it is magnetic. So that's a mouthful.

932
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:16,950
Typically, it's called black sand. In the mining industry, they call it black sands. And if you've

933
01:29:16,950 --> 01:29:22,070
ever dragged a magnet on the beach or been doing some landscaping, whatever, and you had anything

934
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:27,190
magnetic, you'll notice you try to shake off the dust or the dirt. But this is telling you this

935
01:29:27,190 --> 01:29:31,870
stuff likes to stick to the magnet. It looks like sand and it looks black. And that's really

936
01:29:31,870 --> 01:29:38,930
little iron particles. It's called magnetite, M-A-G-N-E-T-I-T-E, like tight magnets, magnetite.

937
01:29:39,550 --> 01:29:46,750
And magnetite is an adsorber. In other words, it's a very dense material. Unlike the carbon

938
01:29:46,750 --> 01:29:53,430
block or carbon aggregate or unlike the zeolites, which are very porous, it is a very hard material.

939
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:59,130
It's a crystalline iron and it's very inert in most cases. Now, why am I bringing it up? Because

940
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:06,290
it is an adsorber for what's called arsenic and other things, maybe cadmium and certain types of

941
01:30:06,290 --> 01:30:12,390
bacteria in the water and radionucleotides, again, the heavy metals and possibly semi-radioactive

942
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:20,450
material in the water. Magnetite has been, I should say, debated, but not really more like

943
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:26,570
ignored because they rather use flocculation to remove arsenic, which is an expensive chemical

944
01:30:26,570 --> 01:30:31,770
process, basically putting spiderwebs in water. Not spiderwebs, but chemicals that look like

945
01:30:31,770 --> 01:30:37,330
spiderwebs called flocc. And as this flocc falls through water, it removes arsenic, a nasty chemical.

946
01:30:38,230 --> 01:30:44,090
Instead of using arsenic, I mean, instead of using magnetite for arsenic, because it kind of,

947
01:30:44,150 --> 01:30:48,850
again, magnetite, it's a hard iron crystal and you don't have to buy it again. You just buy it once.

948
01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:55,450
You see? Now, how do you get magnetite? Well, let's just cut to the chase. You go to eBay,

949
01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:59,970
somebody's always selling it, usually out of Arizona or New Mexico, and the shipping costs

950
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:04,130
more than the material sometimes because a very small pouch of it is very expensive

951
01:31:05,410 --> 01:31:10,910
to ship because it's heavy. It's iron, basically. Another way to do it is if you live near a water

952
01:31:10,910 --> 01:31:16,570
course or river or, I don't know, rollo, even in the desert or anywhere you are pretty much near

953
01:31:16,570 --> 01:31:21,910
where there was a decomposed mountain at one time or a very strong water flow, even if you're

954
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:26,310
near the beach, just drag some magnets along the ground, keep dragging them long enough,

955
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:32,430
and you will see that there are little black specks that stick to the magnet and that is

956
01:31:32,430 --> 01:31:36,150
typically black sand. And hopefully it'll be black and not red in color because otherwise

957
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:41,990
it's just iron dust, which most iron dust is not magnetic anyway. Now, of course, you want to get

958
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:45,850
the staples and all that other stuff out. Now, it also tends to be very dense. So if you're going

959
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:52,950
to go on a hunt to get magnetite, get familiar with what's called panning. As you mix grains and

960
01:31:52,950 --> 01:31:56,550
things in water, the heavies go to the bottom, you scoop off the lighter stuff at the top.

961
01:31:57,250 --> 01:32:02,910
But you can purchase it. It's called magnetite or black sand. Gem shops, mineral shops have it.

962
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:09,450
I'm not promoting that you engage in commerce regarding this discussion or this episode about

963
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:14,090
water because the thing is if you can get it for free, get it for free. If you can get it used,

964
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:18,850
get it used. And then if you're going to buy it new, buy the least expensive stuff to start

965
01:32:18,850 --> 01:32:24,350
out with, but be frugal. If it's absolute junk, don't get it, of course. But this is a very frugal

966
01:32:24,350 --> 01:32:30,310
and thrifty way to approach water purification. So again, using a gravity filter with carbon,

967
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:36,730
incorporating some zeolites, and hopefully you can go back in the archives if you've missed any of

968
01:32:36,730 --> 01:32:43,010
these points, and then ultimately adding the concept of an adsorber as magnetite to remove

969
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:50,570
the rest of perhaps of the nasties. And what you will end up with is a water quality that is

970
01:32:50,570 --> 01:32:59,930
measurably and pleasing to the palate beyond most waters that you can acquire. And this whole thing

971
01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:05,950
in terms of your cost or output is minimal other than acquiring a pitcher filter and the elements

972
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:12,090
that might require replacement through time. But the zeolite and the magnetite will last a

973
01:33:12,090 --> 01:33:15,930
very long time and you will end up with a very high water quality. Now again, please remember,

974
01:33:16,230 --> 01:33:20,830
if you're applying the gravity filter, the pitcher filter, let's say with the zeolite and the

975
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:27,630
magnetite all together, still the water should be pre-chilled or kept cold and in the dark before

976
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:34,370
filtering and after filtering to keep the water quality high. Now again, the magnetite, just to

977
01:33:34,370 --> 01:33:40,610
reiterate here a little bit, you combine it with the zeolite just in a bulk way on top of the

978
01:33:41,370 --> 01:33:46,170
business end of the gravity filter. You can put it in a stocking or some kind of a net or a bag

979
01:33:46,170 --> 01:33:49,990
or something to contain it, but it still goes through. These particles go through just if you

980
01:33:49,990 --> 01:33:55,330
want to keep it a little neater, that's fine. But this is just a very simple approach where

981
01:33:55,330 --> 01:34:00,670
I would challenge anyone to go anywhere on the internet at this point. I hate doing this really

982
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:05,030
because you don't have to say you're really good at something if you really are, but I'm just

983
01:34:05,030 --> 01:34:10,910
telling you people it's amazing how there are millions or billions of sightings or millions of

984
01:34:10,910 --> 01:34:15,990
water on the internet and there is no discussion as has been done here almost now for about two

985
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:22,630
hours regarding a simple rudimentary approach on creating high quality water for yourself and

986
01:34:22,630 --> 01:34:26,430
others very inexpensively. Hopefully, you can acquire these materials and things.

987
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:31,990
Now, there are many other things that can be addressed regarding inline filters, storage tanks,

988
01:34:31,990 --> 01:34:36,870
wells and other things like that, but presumably the majority of the people that are going to be

989
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:45,470
accessing this solo Greek-speak event will be in a suburban, urban or cosmopolitan environment where

990
01:34:45,470 --> 01:34:51,930
they have fridges and not just two brain cells they can rub together, but maybe a few shekels to get a

991
01:34:51,930 --> 01:34:56,530
gravity filter if you don't have one and some zeolite and perhaps magnetite later on if not

992
01:34:56,530 --> 01:35:03,050
necessary, but that would be the trio. You would end up having perhaps some of the best water you

993
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:09,130
can acquire or upping the quality of any water that is available to you. I'm talking about fresh

994
01:35:09,130 --> 01:35:15,930
potable water. Now, there is a fourth thing that can be done. If you are concerned about micro

995
01:35:15,930 --> 01:35:21,210
filtration, I'm not talking about what's called reverse osmosis, but at least down to below one

996
01:35:21,210 --> 01:35:30,270
micron. Now, why one micron? One micron, you'll see there's ratings on filters. One micron tends

997
01:35:30,270 --> 01:35:37,210
to be the standard absolute one micron. It tends to be the standard for filtering out most of the

998
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:42,550
pathogenics and their eggs and things like that, like Giardia and other cysts and things like that

999
01:35:42,550 --> 01:35:49,450
and the E. coli and things that are in the water, but typically a 0.1 or 0.2 micron absolute is the

1000
01:35:49,450 --> 01:35:55,830
best way to go. If you can acquire something with a 0.1 or a 0.2 micron absolute filtration, this is now,

1001
01:35:56,170 --> 01:36:00,670
there's nothing to do with the chemistry now. This is just particulate matter. You're able to actually

1002
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:07,170
go to a river or a pond or something and actually filter through that or pass the water through that

1003
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:13,550
and know that you're not going to, not for sure, but 99.99% not get any pathogens or amoebas and

1004
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:20,330
things in the gut, in the body. I don't want to promote a particular company, but there's a few

1005
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:25,470
of them. If you go to, I say I don't want to promote because I don't know what's on the market there,

1006
01:36:25,570 --> 01:36:31,950
but there's a couple. You could do internet searches on camping filters and you'll see that

1007
01:36:31,950 --> 01:36:37,910
they use a microtubular polyethylene tube. Basically, they use like a laser to make these tiny

1008
01:36:37,910 --> 01:36:41,610
holes in these tubes and they bunch the tubes together and you push water through it and they

1009
01:36:41,610 --> 01:36:47,590
tend to be 0.1 or 0.2 micron, which is very small, absolute. A human hair is 20 to 30 micron,

1010
01:36:47,790 --> 01:36:54,510
let's say, or maybe a little bigger. You will find these are like camping filters are usually

1011
01:36:54,510 --> 01:37:00,410
recommended to be used if you're going to drink river water or pond water or stream water.

1012
01:37:00,850 --> 01:37:06,210
You can somehow incorporate that with the pitcher filter, either prior to the pitcher filter or

1013
01:37:06,210 --> 01:37:11,710
post-pitcher filter. Again, these are acquired typically at camping stores. They are also

1014
01:37:11,710 --> 01:37:17,570
available in cartridges for inline systems. They tend to be more expensive than all of the things

1015
01:37:17,570 --> 01:37:22,550
that I mentioned combined. If you're going on the frugal end in what they call the US

1016
01:37:22,550 --> 01:37:27,750
in America, typically those are $30 to $50 just for what they call dollar credits

1017
01:37:30,590 --> 01:37:36,070
in their portable form. The good thing about most of these super filtration

1018
01:37:36,710 --> 01:37:43,210
camping units is that there are some of them, one of them, if you research this, you might

1019
01:37:43,210 --> 01:37:48,810
actually find the manufacturer starts with an S, but it's touted as being a 1 million gallon filter,

1020
01:37:49,310 --> 01:37:55,790
which would be 4.5 million liters. They run around $50. That should last 20 or 30 years

1021
01:37:55,790 --> 01:38:01,310
as long as you don't run hot water through it. Now, I can give you some testimony on it. I've

1022
01:38:01,310 --> 01:38:08,790
used them. Yes, they do and had many aspects of them tested and they do as claimed, so they are

1023
01:38:08,790 --> 01:38:15,090
a very good value. Now, again, this would take care of the little microorganisms that most people

1024
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:21,110
consider you have to boil water to get rid of. By the way, the reason I'm bringing this up as

1025
01:38:21,110 --> 01:38:25,550
the fourth element for the simple water purification is because know that most gravity

1026
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:31,470
filters that are inexpensive with the zeolite magnetite will not treat these little critters

1027
01:38:31,470 --> 01:38:38,050
in the water. Some of the larger, more elaborate gravity or pitcher filters will or are touted to

1028
01:38:38,050 --> 01:38:43,130
because they have that less than one micron absolute. Absolute means that they're assuring

1029
01:38:43,130 --> 01:38:49,790
you that none of the pores in the filter are greater than that number. These are camping

1030
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:56,510
filters you can research online. The easiest way to catch the one that I'm familiar with that I

1031
01:38:56,510 --> 01:39:03,830
think is the best value is someone put in the chat. I'll just say it. It's a Sawyer at REI.

1032
01:39:03,970 --> 01:39:11,530
That is a simple way to get it correct. Thank you. I said it. The reason I don't bring up

1033
01:39:11,530 --> 01:39:18,090
products by name is well, of course, it's not sponsored. The second thing is there's always

1034
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:23,950
something new on the market. Who knows? We don't want to really create a limit on the

1035
01:39:23,950 --> 01:39:28,630
sonic event. If someone is listening into it down the timeline here, they'll still find

1036
01:39:28,630 --> 01:39:31,350
the information more applicable than just giving out a brand.

1037
01:39:36,330 --> 01:39:41,330
I would tend to not necessarily, let's say, cap off the water discussion at this point

1038
01:39:41,330 --> 01:39:46,310
or the water presentation simply because the purpose of discussing water, especially if

1039
01:39:46,310 --> 01:39:52,790
you're doing it on a public venue, is what do you walk away with? Are you walking away?

1040
01:39:52,850 --> 01:39:56,790
Has anything been imparted that you can actually use? Have you ever heard of, quote-unquote,

1041
01:39:56,990 --> 01:40:01,290
useless information or just talk? There's a lot of that.

1042
01:40:02,150 --> 01:40:09,330
Here is a very, let's just be stern for a moment and say, if you're discussing something,

1043
01:40:09,430 --> 01:40:14,710
whether it's food, water or whatever, what can you take away from the time that you invested

1044
01:40:14,710 --> 01:40:19,310
in listening to the information? What can you take away with it? Can you act on what's

1045
01:40:19,310 --> 01:40:19,930
being said?

1046
01:40:20,810 --> 01:40:24,370
The answer with most of the information that's being relayed that I've noticed, this is just

1047
01:40:24,370 --> 01:40:30,050
a personal comment and opinion which I rarely give, is pretty useless in most cases, if not

1048
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:35,330
all cases, in the majority of the formats that I've seen, at least digitally and such.

1049
01:40:35,390 --> 01:40:39,830
Even in books, who wants to sit and read books anymore, right? Think about it. I'm not saying

1050
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:47,730
that sarcastically because it's kind of hard to look at the written word and do other

1051
01:40:47,730 --> 01:40:52,690
things where you can actually put on something in digital format through headphones or speakers

1052
01:40:52,690 --> 01:40:56,110
and listen to it while you're doing something else as well. It makes it more interesting.

1053
01:40:56,850 --> 01:41:04,950
Unfortunately, well, let's just say fortunately, at least one can say, well, you can say for

1054
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:09,430
sure, you're not going to be dummy loaded tuning in to Uncommon Radio, that's for sure.

1055
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:14,290
The second thing, and that's not an opinion by the way, and the second thing is at least

1056
01:41:14,290 --> 01:41:19,090
you can walk away with some comprehension on how to raise the quality of water.

1057
01:41:19,230 --> 01:41:25,990
Have we even touched on 1% of what water is or what can be done with water? No, not even

1058
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:33,590
maybe a thousandth of a percent, but I would say 99% of what was said can raise the quality.

1059
01:41:33,590 --> 01:41:38,110
If anyone were to apply what's been said in this particular sonic event, the majority

1060
01:41:38,110 --> 01:41:42,470
of it will raise the quality of the water that one is interacting with substantially.

1061
01:41:42,690 --> 01:41:48,890
We're talking about water in a nutritive sense, right, for drinking and consuming and or cooking

1062
01:41:48,890 --> 01:41:56,010
or for plants and other things like that. This is a very, I should say, poignant, very

1063
01:41:56,010 --> 01:42:03,570
narrow focus on immediate action that can be taken to, again, raise the quality of water

1064
01:42:04,190 --> 01:42:10,610
for anyone that's listening. Again, just to recap everything, perhaps I would say if you've

1065
01:42:10,610 --> 01:42:15,370
got water in the vicinity and you're planning on drinking it, keep it cool, keep it in the

1066
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:19,850
dark. I know it's contrary to what you've seen and maybe what you believe, but this is

1067
01:42:19,850 --> 01:42:23,510
the suggestion. If not, almost I would say the dominant point.

1068
01:42:23,510 --> 01:42:29,330
The second thing is if you're going to interact with water, pay attention if it's moving properly,

1069
01:42:29,490 --> 01:42:37,230
meaning if it looks like blood vessels, roots of a plant or the rivers naturally do. Typically,

1070
01:42:37,470 --> 01:42:43,270
you will not see this in urban or let's say modern society. If it's not being stored in

1071
01:42:43,270 --> 01:42:48,370
an ovoid container, it's not being stored properly, geometrically at least. This is

1072
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:54,970
going to be one of the most profound aspects of why water has become so detrimental no

1073
01:42:54,970 --> 01:43:00,350
matter what its chemical purity is because it has been almost spiritually disturbed by

1074
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:06,870
eliminating its volumetric capacity to take the shape and direction it naturally wants

1075
01:43:06,870 --> 01:43:11,550
to because there's an element behind water that drives it in that direction. When man

1076
01:43:11,550 --> 01:43:14,790
changes it, it makes it a very negative source now.

1077
01:43:14,790 --> 01:43:20,610
The other thing is if you're going to up the quality of water by simply acquiring these

1078
01:43:20,610 --> 01:43:26,970
gravity type, pitcher type filters regardless of what they are and adding a properly prepared

1079
01:43:26,970 --> 01:43:37,870
zeolite and even maybe a magnetite to ultimately create what can be considered at this point

1080
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:46,730
the best we can do with water for consumption. If you have the consideration of being curious

1081
01:43:46,730 --> 01:43:50,110
about little critters in the water because it is really tough, by the way, if you've

1082
01:43:50,110 --> 01:43:54,410
ever traveled somewhere and you've caught what's called an amoeba, you get stomach

1083
01:43:54,410 --> 01:44:02,010
aches for weeks and months and months on end. Typically, other than antibiotics, it's

1084
01:44:02,010 --> 01:44:10,290
charcoal pills and other remedies, but if you have pathogenic questionability in the

1085
01:44:10,290 --> 01:44:15,290
water, a microfilter which doesn't do anything for the chemicals or heavy metals, but just

1086
01:44:15,290 --> 01:44:21,270
for the critters, I would suggest researching these portable camping type filters. The one

1087
01:44:21,270 --> 01:44:27,310
that I have experience with is the one that has been touted to have the one million gallon

1088
01:44:27,310 --> 01:44:27,710
guarantee.

1089
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:34,990
With that said, if there's anything in chat, if there's anything in email, I've tried to

1090
01:44:34,990 --> 01:44:40,810
keep it really simple as time goes on and if there is the ability to continue speaking

1091
01:44:41,450 --> 01:44:47,710
on this and other things, there will be more elaboration. Of course, there might be some

1092
01:44:47,710 --> 01:44:53,050
that are interested in the rudimentary teleportation aspect of it and is it something that you could

1093
01:44:53,050 --> 01:44:56,490
pretty much do at home? Maybe we'll discuss that in the future.

1094
01:44:58,530 --> 01:45:03,790
We have a few minutes left on the show. What I'm going to do here, I have to take a quick

1095
01:45:03,790 --> 01:45:09,450
break. I'll be right back. I'm going to just put on a little bit of music for you folks

1096
01:45:09,450 --> 01:45:11,350
and I shall be right back.

1097
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:56,100
Okay, by the way, that is the musical break that you get on the Uncommon Radio. We're

1098
01:45:56,120 --> 01:46:01,700
on the Uncommon Radio site. It's by someone called Panther and I hope you folks enjoyed

1099
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:01,980
that.

1100
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:07,720
Okay, so just to have a little bit here, if there's any other comments or anything else

1101
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:15,440
that could be interjected. Someone, yeah, an amoebic dysentery, someone in chat wrote,

1102
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:19,180
no kidding, I know someone almost died from amoebic dysentery. Yeah, it could be pretty

1103
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:19,560
rough.

1104
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:26,920
So, again, hopefully folks, this has been a rudimentary discussion, perhaps basic but

1105
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:32,680
not too basic, but some of the best things in life are simple and free, of course. Could

1106
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:38,580
free be an acronym that could perhaps mean from revenue emanated elsewhere? But there's

1107
01:46:38,580 --> 01:46:45,240
many things that will be discussed and can be discussed and as promised, hopefully that

1108
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:51,100
the discussion on the water is edifying and just, again, being redundant. If I've said

1109
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:55,540
it a hundred times, it's not enough. Keep it cool, keep it in the dark and you are on

1110
01:46:55,540 --> 01:47:00,000
the path of getting water up to a higher level of quality.

1111
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:06,240
And I don't want to apologize, which actually means to defend, but you folks are being so

1112
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:13,700
dummy loaded on the world wide web and internet radio and mainstream and university that I

1113
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:19,180
don't know how anyone can see straight or get anything done because I'll tell you, it

1114
01:47:19,180 --> 01:47:26,960
is a testament to the robustness and durability of the human spirit because pretty much anywhere

1115
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:33,100
you look, I'll just say, it's just stupid shit, man. And you folks are just sitting back and

1116
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:39,200
taking it, but I don't, by the way. If I have an opportunity to say how stupid things are

1117
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:43,700
and I could give specifics, I will. Why? Because maybe it's just a little reminder because

1118
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:49,040
I don't hear anyone else saying it, but by the way, I did a little bit of listening to

1119
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:55,640
internet radio this week and I've noticed, this is a coincidence or not, that some of

1120
01:47:55,640 --> 01:48:03,120
the hosts in places are starting to use the word like idiot or words idiot and moron more

1121
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:09,040
frequently. Now, I find that to be quite interesting and they're using it in a, let's say, clinical

1122
01:48:09,040 --> 01:48:14,900
sense or slightly emotional. Now, I don't want to say I blazed that path, but it is

1123
01:48:14,900 --> 01:48:19,540
blazing to hear. So again, thank you everyone and stay wet.
