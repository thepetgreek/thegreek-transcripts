00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
Greetings everyone and welcome to Uncommon Radio.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,440
And if you don't like what's being said here, you're probably not welcome, but I'm just joking.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,880
And I would say, by the way, we always kind of date this.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,360
Now, this is the 11th solo, and I just want to bring up lawful timekeeping again.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:27,120
And it's something, whether you can do it or not, or whether you can't do it or not, it doesn't matter.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,880
Are you aware that there is a lawful timekeeping precedent?

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,460
Are you aware that there's lawful money?

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,040
Are you aware that there are lawful things to eat?

9
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,840
Are you aware that there's, you know, basically something called law?

10
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,320
I'm not talking about natural law. That's kind of moronic.

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,920
It's kind of a pagan excuse.

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,080
I'm not talking about pagans where they'd let their hair grow long,

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,920
wear dark sunglasses at night and paint their toenails black.

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,780
No, that's just a fashion statement.

15
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,100
I'm not talking about just being plain dumb.

16
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,300
But anyway, welcome to Uncommon Radio.

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,980
This is American Freedom Radio.

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:10,080
And you are listening to this live on what they call May 11th, 2017, on that ridiculous thing they call the Pope's work schedule,

19
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,640
which all of you follow, by the way.

20
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:18,980
Not follow, but, you know, the entire society is using that as its corpus diem stuff.

21
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,580
But I would suggest it's already the third month and around the third day.

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,980
Yeah, because day starts at noon. Look it up.

23
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,340
Well, no, I don't do that.

24
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,180
By the way, this kind of stuff doesn't make people happy.

25
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,560
Well, it should, actually.

26
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:37,420
Have you ever heard of – it's better to have love and loss than to never have loved at all.

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,460
Isn't it better to have known the truth and be just a little dismayed at the idiots around you than to have never known it at all?

28
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,320
But anyway, when I use words like moron and idiot, by the way, that is just an accurate medical term.

29
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,920
You know, there are other things.

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,100
I mean, there's people around that use other stuff, but, you know, that seems to be accurate, I think.

31
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:04,840
So just for the sake of considering this sonic episode, feel free to call in if you like.

32
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,800
It's 218-339-8525.

33
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,960
Again, it's 218-339-8525.

34
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,260
It is on the left side in a red box on the AFR homepage.

35
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,980
If you don't see it on the left, it's probably on your other left,

36
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,120
and you'll see it in a red box, call in number 218-339-8525.

37
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:34,800
And if you do prefer the fidelity of Skype, you can use the Uncommon Sense Radio or the Uncommon Radio website email.

38
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,080
You can go on the www.uncommonradio.com and you scroll down.

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,100
There will be an email there.

40
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,660
It is a Gmail.

41
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,760
That is also the Skype contact, and I'll just give that out.

42
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,940
It's uncommonsenseradio1 at gmail.com.

43
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,600
That's a numeric one, and hopefully I'll be able to bring you in.

44
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:59,320
In the meantime, I will just take a momentary pause here because walking and chewing gum is sometimes a little complicated,

45
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,160
and I will bring up the conference manager.

46
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,020
Let's see if we have the phones accessible, and yes, they are.

47
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,320
So here we are.

48
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,600
It is roughly the first week, well, most likely the first week of the third month,

49
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,240
and how many people really even think of anything lawful anymore?

50
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,480
Now, I just wanted to bring up a few things.

51
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:33,160
One thing I want to bring up is, well, let's say firstly, this is the bell lap, for those that know, one to go of solo episodes.

52
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,060
I think we'll wrap it up around 12 episodes.

53
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,460
I appreciate AFR giving me the ability to do this.

54
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,840
Most of you folks might have heard of Greek Speak or not, but this is around the 11th time.

55
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,440
There will be just the 12th.

56
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,340
I don't think there's going to be a baker dozen.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,380
What you've heard is basically the solo Greek effort, no interference, no co-hosts, very few people calling in,

58
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,280
and just gave a go at it, and I hope it's given some useful information to people.

59
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,480
If you have a program or an operating system to use the files, by the way, or what's known as information.

60
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,180
Secondly, I want to bring up the concept of donations and things like that.

61
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,160
If you folks remember when the solo thing came around, so let's do a four-week experiment on,

62
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:29,400
let's see how much financial support can be garnered or credit can be sent to AFR regarding the Greek being on.

63
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,180
We set a goal and we exceeded that goal by 30% or 40%.

64
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:45,480
The people that are tuning in using the old radio vernacular or listening to Greek Speak were very generous.

65
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,660
We met the goal, like I said, over 30% or 40%, and then it kind of went away because it was an experiment.

66
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,680
I just want to bring up this is in terms of the actual needs of AFR.

67
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,560
You also have to keep in mind, let's be honest, I'm not going to be on AFR anymore or any other internet thing.

68
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,300
I'm doing a project that will be more in private.

69
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,120
But AFR is looking for a computer.

70
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:15,380
If anyone would like to donate a computer or send them or give them or present to them for keeps a computer for archiving,

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,840
it just needs to have memory and things like that, please do so.

72
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,500
You can contact them, I guess, on the homepage.

73
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,000
There's contact information and hopefully the email and all that you guys can hook up.

74
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,980
Otherwise, I would just suggest give a donation if you can.

75
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:38,780
If you have liked the Greek as a going away present, send them some funds of some sort, some credit, just whatever it might be,

76
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,240
just to say thank you.

77
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:46,860
This was for having the Greek on because folks, I didn't want to say this, but I'll say it.

78
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,980
When I'm gone, you're condemned to stupidity.

79
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,960
Did I just say that?

80
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,340
Yes, sorry, to a certain degree.

81
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,360
Now, most people just like listening to music and radio.

82
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,480
By the way, friends don't let friends listen to bad music.

83
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,280
Why would friends let friends listen to bad, well, you know what I mean.

84
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,440
The thing is, be perceptive, be objective.

85
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:15,100
I don't want to tout this, but no one's really talking about what's lawful or really how things work.

86
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,900
Sorry, it's kind of sad, but I just want to bring this in because this is real talk.

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,220
People don't want real talk.

88
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,660
They don't want real wheat.

89
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,100
They want puffed wheat.

90
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,440
They want puffed rice.

91
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,880
They want free speech, man.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,740
They want, oh, bad vaccines, oh, bad Illuminati.

93
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,260
It runs out of steam.

94
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,840
I mean you do have a little bit of people interviewing people with their own experiences

95
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,720
and whatever stuff, but they come out and it's like, oh, it's typical human stuff.

96
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:51,960
Yeah, you had a really bad experience, but the way you're explaining it is just not so.

97
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,660
Anyway, I just want to throw this in.

98
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,320
I kind of mentioned it before.

99
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,860
I recently did an interview with Freeman again for you folks,

100
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,600
so I think about 90% of the people that make sense have come over from that group,

101
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,200
but I just wanted to throw that in as a plug or whatever, not necessarily for Freeman,

102
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,040
but his listeners tend to be of a pretty high caliber in terms of asking questions.

103
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,720
Fortunately, I haven't been getting anyone saying, well, Greek, I really like you.

104
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,820
I like what you're saying.

105
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,260
It's like, well, what do you like about it?

106
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,160
I don't know.

107
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,180
I just like it.

108
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,700
Fortunately, I don't get any of that because that will be quickly just dispatched away to somewhere else.

109
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:36,540
But at this point, fortunately, the majority of the people that have been making contact

110
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,000
and asking the right questions, meaning, well, let's just say,

111
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,140
I couldn't say they were really wrong or right, but they're definitely not wrong,

112
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,700
meaning they're on the right track, meaning what are things based on?

113
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:55,740
You guys are not a really good lot as a human condition right now,

114
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,080
meaning you guys, meaning all of humanity is in really, really bad shape.

115
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,180
Now, you are obviously tempered and controlled by certain cultural aspects,

116
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,220
which society and traditions and things like that, and I'm not talking about that.

117
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,740
I'm talking about the true aspect of humanity right now,

118
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,500
where you are, let's say.

119
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,560
Things do change, so things have changed quite a bit, but yet they seem the same.

120
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,980
So I guess the things I wanted to cover, I guess, were, yeah, AFR could use a computer.

121
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,500
They could also, why not send them a going away thank you for the Greek?

122
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,720
You got one more week as well.

123
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,799
Just go ahead and dig in and dig out or go ahead and use that allegorical credit thing,

124
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:43,500
which, whatever, and send something over.

125
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,020
I just want to thank everyone, especially for the first four weeks.

126
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,300
It was a monumental achievement to actually meet the goal,

127
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,840
because how many times do people actually meet goals and exceed them,

128
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,020
at least in this kind of venue?

129
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,280
So I would just suggest a little bit of thank you and appreciation to AFR,

130
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,980
and even if you are hearing this live

131
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,520
and if you wanted to send them something that would be more than excellent.

132
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,640
So I wanted to just, you know, I have nothing planned out or outlined,

133
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,540
and, of course, I'm going to go to the e-mails there.

134
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,260
I have gotten some e-mails that are really noteworthy.

135
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,580
I will bring up the points and topics on there.

136
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:32,620
Also, I would like to bring up a topic that is reoccurring, and it's very contemporary,

137
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:37,820
and I want to just tie it in to the condition of where you are listening now.

138
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,700
You're listening on what's called alternative media platform, internet radio.

139
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,840
I'm sure you could tell if you don't know, if you listen to the adverts,

140
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,800
that it's not mainstream.

141
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,360
Now, I don't endorse anything or anyone or any of that stuff.

142
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,020
I just happen to be here, but because I'm here, it's fine.

143
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,520
I might as well make the best of it, but I want to just bring up a point,

144
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,660
especially for the people that are in internet or alternative media.

145
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,920
What you will notice, and I've been saying this for a while,

146
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,280
is this is the time right now where you're going where you're all going to be hurting.

147
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:21,280
Hosts, radio platforms, you're all going to catch a hurting because the paradigm is changing.

148
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,300
Of course, you don't know because you don't know what day it is or anything like that.

149
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,880
You're stuck on the dummy load, which is fine because that's just the way things are,

150
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,180
and I want to get into why you're all stuck on the dummy load.

151
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,040
What you will see now with alternative media, and actually all media,

152
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,120
all communications is they're hurting, and they're hurting through accessibility

153
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,440
and especially finances and attention.

154
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,500
Less people are paying.

155
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,460
They are losing the relevancy they once had.

156
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,060
Can you fault them for procuring dummy loads?

157
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:00,020
Yes and no because it's all dummy loading, even university.

158
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,300
At least you're not paying $50,000 a year to be dummy loaded on alternative media,

159
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,840
but across the board, they're all hurting because they don't know what's going on

160
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,080
and you don't know what's going on.

161
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:16,600
The gods kind of go after those that are providing the stuff more than those

162
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,760
that are accepting it if they're going to look for change.

163
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,900
There's a paradigm shift that's happening, and that's all you're experiencing.

164
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,980
You're all struggling with your donations and your YouTube monetizations

165
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,700
and your subscriptions and all that.

166
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,060
I say pretty much, even the AJ, the great Alex, you know who,

167
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,520
has been subject to some turmoil lately.

168
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,880
This is a sign of the times.

169
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,700
I'm just going to loosely refer to something ancient about a certain time period

170
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:50,680
that you've been in and are going in where the common man's actual income

171
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:56,860
or intake will be equivalent to a pretty modest equivalent of grain,

172
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,600
but it also states that do not harm the oil and the wine.

173
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,780
What that means is the oil and the wine would be the more of the wealthy

174
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,940
because in order to do oil and wine, you need infrastructure.

175
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,580
I just want to mention that the caste system that you folks are always discussing,

176
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,940
have you ever heard of middle class?

177
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,860
Oh, the middle class is suffering.

178
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,940
That's a caste system, by the way.

179
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,000
Shame on you.

180
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,980
I shouldn't say that because it does exist,

181
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,220
but if you ask any of these morons that use the middle class terminology,

182
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:35,760
upper class, and whatever, they don't know that they're actually using a caste system.

183
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,020
You're not supposed to know what's going on because that's the nature of the cosmic censorship,

184
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,140
and that was the point that I was leading to.

185
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,520
There's something called cosmic censorship I've been giving up,

186
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,580
and even though others have discussed it with me on air,

187
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,240
they don't seem to get a grasp on it.

188
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,920
How do you get a grasp on it?

189
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,460
Well, let's just not say it's a problem,

190
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:00,920
but the situation with most things that people conceptualize or are cognizant of

191
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,820
is on the typical surface-dwelling, earth-inhabitant mentality,

192
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,220
which is equivalent to tic-tac-toe or checkers.

193
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,620
By the way, what I mean by that is there's a chicken in New York City, Chinatown,

194
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,000
that will beat you in checkers.

195
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,820
Yes, you put in a couple of bucks or something and a slide thing,

196
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,740
the chicken is on the other side of the window,

197
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,460
and you push some buttons and the chicken will beat you at checkers.

198
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,660
The reality of it is more like chess,

199
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,960
but the problem is when you get from that tic-tac-toe checkers mentality,

200
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,040
which you see everywhere, when I mean everywhere,

201
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,540
let me just say it again, everywhere,

202
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:45,200
the most people that enter into that reality forget that by the rules of the game

203
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,600
that a pawn can take a king.

204
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,360
Now, that sounds kind of, you know, anyone who knows chess says,

205
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,520
yes, I guess Greek it can, but that never happens.

206
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,360
That's right, it doesn't.

207
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,900
Because usually when you sit down at a chess game,

208
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,280
you kind of like have a strategy or a tactic,

209
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,220
and right now you're sitting in a position where you're still so heavily censored

210
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,960
that you couldn't pour piss out of a boot even if you had instructions on the heel,

211
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,260
if you heard me use that before,

212
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,340
or you could think of other metaphors that might come out of Texas.

213
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,360
This is the condition of all humanity,

214
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,440
and obviously the ones that are bringing you information are under the same condition

215
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,960
because it is a cosmic censorship.

216
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,220
When I say information, it's all of it.

217
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,120
Mainstream, alternative, all of it.

218
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:33,120
Now, not here and there, all of it, even university, you know,

219
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,260
and even your gurus and your spiritual people, these morons.

220
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,240
But anyway, you're under censorship, man.

221
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,220
And here's the thing, it's like, well, aren't you too Greek?

222
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,840
Well, it's irrelevant.

223
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,220
No one else is reporting it.

224
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,740
If you think I'm censored, I'm censored.

225
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,220
If you don't think I am, then I'm not.

226
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:48,720
How's that?

227
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,300
Here's the thing I wanted to bring up.

228
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,580
If you're stuck in this mentality of checkers and chess,

229
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,560
especially where a chicken will beat you at it,

230
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,980
or you get into checkers or tic-tac-toe,

231
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,260
and you get into chess and you let your king being taken by a pawn,

232
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,720
this is not what I'm talking about.

233
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,780
There are many levels, like Star Trek 3D chess.

234
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,060
That's really what's going on.

235
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,340
But unfortunately, those that are on the game board,

236
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,620
meaning the people and the leaders and the other institutions

237
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,560
aren't aware of what's going on because of the censorship.

238
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,740
Okay, Greek, you've mentioned censorship so much.

239
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,920
So what's going on?

240
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,340
It is not a simple thing.

241
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,680
But once you are made aware of the context of the censorship,

242
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,300
you can very well get an idea of what is being censored.

243
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,280
And sometimes when something makes a statement

244
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,380
or there is a statement made somewhere,

245
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,220
it actually gives a lot of information not also by what it's discussing

246
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,980
or mentioning in the information but what it's not discussing by omission.

247
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,560
So the thing about the censorship, I just want to get back to it,

248
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,640
it's put on humanity by the gods.

249
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:57,480
Let's just say imagine the mindset or the perception or consciousness of humanity

250
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,500
and what they are aware of being bound in a book or a scroll.

251
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,640
The censorship would represent a seal on that or a lock.

252
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,220
Now you know it exists.

253
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,040
You just don't know.

254
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,100
You can't see it.

255
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,360
Now if you bring that to someone and they say,

256
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,540
well, I can't see what's in there because it's sealed.

257
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,100
Well, then you bring it to someone else and they say,

258
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,980
well, I can't read it anyway because I'm illiterate.

259
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,240
And then you bring it to someone else and they say,

260
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,520
well, I can't see, I'm blind, so it wouldn't matter anyway.

261
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,700
You see, there's the three levels of the censorship.

262
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,900
So what you're going to be seeing soon, and this is because,

263
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,440
well, this is metaphor, is the blind are going to begin to see

264
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,120
and the illiterate are going to be more literate

265
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,080
and the seal finally will be open

266
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,540
and you folks will see what was there all along.

267
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,220
And what is it all along?

268
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,440
In subject or in context, all along there's been a parallel world

269
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,120
known as the gods or the unseen,

270
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,920
and it's also transferred over as things that you know nothing about

271
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,319
but are aware of that exist.

272
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:09,579
Like, for example, years ago when people put hot coals in a room

273
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:11,720
to keep the room warm and they had the windows and doors shut,

274
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:14,980
the next morning, knock, knock, no one's there.

275
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,300
Yes, they are.

276
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:16,900
They're all dead.

277
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,180
They went to sleep and woke up dead.

278
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,920
There's some kind of ether or something coming out of the charcoal.

279
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,099
See, they didn't have a carbon monoxide detector then, did they?

280
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,220
They knew that you shouldn't do that because when you do that, people died.

281
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,920
So you folks are kind of operating as a whole now, at large,

282
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,840
as a wholesale group on that level.

283
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,680
You know if certain things happen, something bad is going to happen,

284
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,760
but you're always kind of always going in that direction anyway.

285
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,220
Now one of the things, one of the directions,

286
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,100
we've got roughly another hour and a half or so.

287
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,640
There's much to say but much won't be said publicly.

288
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,500
I keep bringing this up because you ever notice when the more people

289
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,500
that are being addressed, the more superficial the address.

290
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:02,380
Why?

291
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,780
It's just the way things are.

292
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,500
If you look at just how it's been, just think about that for a minute.

293
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,460
Okay, the more people that are being addressed,

294
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,060
the more superficial the matters.

295
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,040
Just think of it even reduced down to a small group.

296
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,540
You're addressing someone over here and you say,

297
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,500
Tom, can I speak to you outside?

298
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,340
Ooh, he's going to speak to him outside in private.

299
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,860
You think it's a little more critical, the information, isn't it?

300
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,960
So as the group gets smaller and smaller,

301
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,800
and when I say group I'm not talking about the group mentality,

302
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,840
but the information can be conveyed more.

303
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,300
That's why I've suggested that I'm done with internet radio for now,

304
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,820
for a while actually.

305
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,020
I'm going to be doing a more private podcast type thing

306
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,720
that is not open to the public.

307
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,880
So more can be discussed and more rational, more helpful information,

308
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,060
let's say unabated by knowing that you're speaking publicly.

309
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,840
Because I assure you folks, what is being said right now is everywhere.

310
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,460
It's amazing you guys can even see straight from the dummy loads,

311
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,640
but this is the thing.

312
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,200
There's things that are going to be happening.

313
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,140
This is the last year of the seven-year period

314
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,360
where I personally just bring this up.

315
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,380
I don't want to be near the internet or the news.

316
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,940
The last thing I want to do is have an internet show

317
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,360
and have people calling me in about all the carnage that is going on in the future,

318
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,660
in the near future in a certain place.

319
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,220
And I'm going to get into that a little bit

320
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,640
because there's a lot of hypocrisy there and there's just a lot of perception.

321
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,240
There's a lack of maturity.

322
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,340
There's just not much good to say about what's going on.

323
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,320
Now, the other thing you have to remember,

324
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,660
when you offer anything publicly, you have to be accommodating the audience.

325
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,260
Otherwise, no one comes or no one buys or no one listens or whatever.

326
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,440
Well, that's the interesting catch right there.

327
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,360
Most people hear things, but they don't listen.

328
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,720
Unfortunately, I don't get much of it,

329
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,420
but I've had people message me privately and say,

330
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,800
hey, a lot of the stuff you've said is coming to fruition.

331
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,920
Like they were having a discussion with someone else.

332
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,560
I said, well, can you mention like what?

333
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,220
They're like, well, I don't know.

334
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,560
And I'm like, well, how do you know the stuff that I mentioned?

335
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,300
And sometimes I catch a little flack about that being a low-hanging fruit.

336
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,960
Now, the best of the best is low-hanging fruit right now with humanity.

337
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,360
Most of them are falling off the tree and are on the floor rotting.

338
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,760
So anyway, and the top of the tree has been cut off.

339
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,260
So at this point, this is not something I want to get into

340
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,180
because if you listen to Greek speak, you've known about this already.

341
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,640
It's not a surprise to you.

342
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,900
The aspect of what's coming and how things are going to be

343
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,100
goes into the realm of the future, doesn't it?

344
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,060
And I do want to address some of the things.

345
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,200
I don't think there's anything in chat and anything in e-mail

346
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,560
that we can probably open up another form of subject matter.

347
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,700
And someone, let me just say here before we get into any kind of a thing here.

348
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,320
It appears to be the second day of the third month.

349
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,300
Yeah, it could be.

350
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,480
I suggest the third at noon.

351
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,040
It started at noon, so and even beyond for others.

352
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,320
Okay.

353
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,440
There's certain discussions that will be had regarding events that will be coming.

354
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,140
And a lot of them are also going to be more enriching.

355
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,660
I just want to, in terms of enriching, I want to bring up the point that

356
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,080
I want to also give a shout out.

357
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,520
Let's see if someone wants to come in on Skype.

358
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,680
That there are things, yes, let's just see.

359
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,940
I have someone that would like to call, and we'll just say yes.

360
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,880
And let's see if I can get Skype to work.

361
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,560
Because there's also a correction I'd like to make

362
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:56,020
regarding the types of humans on the planet.

363
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,240
And recently, because of a listener, I have been under the discovery,

364
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,480
through paying more attention to what is going on,

365
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,220
there are actually four types of humanoid creatures on the planet.

366
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,160
And I want to thank that one.

367
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,340
And let's see if we can, he might be the one that might want to come on.

368
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,180
So let's just see.

369
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,800
Oh, this sounds kind of like a delay.

370
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,920
Should I put on some?

371
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,540
Skype is not cooperating.

372
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,220
Ah, here we go.

373
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,860
Let's see if it, add to group.

374
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,260
Let's see if it, okay.

375
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,520
Greetings.

376
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,080
Ah, greetings.

377
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,300
Are you on?

378
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,220
Is this Sam?

379
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,780
Yes, I'm on.

380
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,880
Hello, can you hear me?

381
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,580
Greetings, yes, I can hear you.

382
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,760
I just started bringing up a little bit of the conversation we've had

383
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,260
regarding the four types of creatures that are on the planet,

384
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,160
and you wanted to come on.

385
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,360
I mean, talk about riding the telepathic superhighway.

386
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:52,980
So how are you?

387
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,200
I'm doing well.

388
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:54,880
I'm doing well.

389
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,940
I'm sorry I didn't catch that tail end of the discussion,

390
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,860
because the Skype feed, I think, is a bit behind the live feed.

391
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,640
Yeah, yeah.

392
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,080
We're about a minute or so.

393
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,220
So what's on your mind, and thanks for coming aboard.

394
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,000
Well, thank you for having me.

395
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,420
Well, I had certain things on my mind that I think are not in line with what you were talking about,

396
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,740
so please excuse that I changed the subject.

397
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,060
Please, that's okay.

398
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,980
We are allowed to do that.

399
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,140
Walk and chew gum, I call it.

400
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:22,460
Go ahead.

401
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,340
Well, I wanted to ask about two or three different things,

402
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,920
and the first being connected to sort of food and biology.

403
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:41,800
I think when you examine the back of fruit juices, yogurts, packaged non-water fluids in general,

404
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,520
there's a reoccurring ingredient that has a widespread use that you see often

405
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,480
to the point where you start to scratch your head and wonder why that seems to be everywhere,

406
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:58,920
whether it's something that you would consider to be organic at a fruit vendor's stall at a farmer's market,

407
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:04,020
or whether it's something that's clearly processed food, and that is ascorbic acid.

408
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,160
It's frequently marketed as natural vitamin C, and it's added to foods as an alleged natural preservative,

409
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,580
and a lot of people are being sort of fooled by the misleading semantics,

410
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,760
but we do know that vitamins are not individual molecular compounds,

411
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,320
but rather biochemical interactions and complexes that consist of different things, nutrients, enzymes, and so on.

412
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,660
So when isolated into these artificial commercial forms, like what they call ascorbic acid,

413
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:36,460
I sort of feel like they're synthetics that act as drugs rather than what we call vitamins.

414
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:43,640
So we know that a lot of so-called vitamin C is synthesized corn, and it has nothing to do with citrus fruits,

415
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,800
and I've read a few articles about it being linked to cancer and thickened arteries and such,

416
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,760
although I don't know how much weight to place on that.

417
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,220
But I wanted to ask you, why such an insistence on this use of ascorbic acid in drinks, and what are the health effects?

418
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,840
Okay, you've heard of the concept of fashion. It's fashionable now, right?

419
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:08,040
The scientific, industrial, nutrition, whatever community has fashion as well.

420
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,200
Think about that for a minute. They have their own fashions and their own trends.

421
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,080
Think about how they almost – they are the true terrorists, by the way, I should say,

422
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,200
because terror is to bring fear and terror onto the public.

423
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,080
How many times have you heard them talk about the little critters that cause diseases

424
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,580
and what you should eat and shouldn't eat?

425
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,980
That harkens back to what is lawful and what is not lawful, which I go into a lot.

426
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,800
And I'll tell you the misgivings of any of it or all of it.

427
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,960
We can either address – addressing solely the ascorbic acid aspect, I believe,

428
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,000
is demure from the real stuff that's going on.

429
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,040
They have a false premise that the body absorbs things.

430
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,840
And also, when all of their research is done on dead things,

431
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:58,520
don't they research things when they're under a slide and separated from the living host?

432
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,460
So unfortunately, yeah.

433
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,040
Basically, let me just say it like this.

434
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,260
At this point, what your question is about is about trust, isn't it?

435
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:18,820
And I would say the entire group is untrustworthy at large, every single one of them,

436
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,000
except for those that have figured out what's going on in the scientific medical community

437
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,760
and are looking for an exit strategy.

438
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,080
You always got to give a little bit of a leeway for this.

439
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,040
There might be some good people left there.

440
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:36,080
Essentially, what they have gained their trust on, the scientific and medical community,

441
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,360
when it comes to the human body, is they have repackaged battlefield medicine as healthcare.

442
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,440
Let me just say that again.

443
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,760
The reason why people think doctors and nurses and all these people are important

444
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,780
is because they have repackaged battlefield medicine as healthcare.

445
00:26:53,800 --> 00:27:01,060
They are a miserable failure everywhere else, and they are going down the wrong path.

446
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,400
Now, this can be garnered.

447
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,540
Well, it's actually easier than the flat earth versus the round earth argument.

448
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,540
You've heard that brought up recently, right?

449
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:16,340
Some people want to talk about the extolled virtues of the medical society,

450
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,700
and I'll tell you that you just want to walk away from that because there is none.

451
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,560
Because reality of what they are doing, again, I'm repeating it again,

452
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,040
is they have repackaged battlefield medicine.

453
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,340
And if you want to understand what battlefield medicine is,

454
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,320
then that's a whole other discussion.

455
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,400
I think you get the point.

456
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,800
Their massive failure is the way that they're training, actually,

457
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,860
and what they are doing to the public at large is based on death,

458
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:49,040
studying dead organisms and chemicals that are synthesized or whatever for economic purposes.

459
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:55,680
Now, it doesn't mean that humans cannot have a good, let's say, medical society emerge.

460
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,540
Yeah, you will in the future.

461
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,260
But the one right now is really bad.

462
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,520
It's just like telling someone, you know, go to church to learn about the gods.

463
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,140
You're not going to learn anything about it.

464
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,820
It's ridiculous.

465
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:15,340
I'm glad you brought it up because it just shows one of the veritable symptoms of what's going on.

466
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,980
There are many aspects to it, but I would suggest if you want to get more critical into it,

467
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:24,880
how much of a percentage, how much ascorbic acid are they adding in there,

468
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,880
and then again you might say, well, if you understand homeopathy,

469
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:35,200
you may not need much of the substance at all to actually have maximum efficacy anyway.

470
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,280
So interestingly enough, let's just say it this way.

471
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:46,060
You know, Rudolf Hoschka is one of the fathers of vitamins, and he coined –

472
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:51,600
I'm not sure if he coined the phrase, but he was trying to search what gave food its vitality,

473
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:58,040
and ultimately he found out that these substances, these extracts that later became vitamins,

474
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,920
only had efficacy for a few days.

475
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:05,660
So that adds another – so even in industry, if you're making drinks or whatever

476
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:10,160
and you buy a truckload of ascorbic acid, you're probably – even if you use it within a few days,

477
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,940
it's probably not going to go to the end user.

478
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,000
So it's kind of like another dummy load to the body.

479
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,540
The body only reproduces things that it recognizes.

480
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:24,200
That's why if you eat a piece of plastic, it comes out just like a piece of plastic,

481
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:28,140
even though there's thousands of calories in a piece of plastic if you burn it.

482
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,200
You don't get anything out of it, do you?

483
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,940
It's undigestible. It's not recognized.

484
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,420
You see, that's what makes a poison a poison.

485
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,100
The body recognizes it as something it can reproduce.

486
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,600
There are many substances that can be chemically considered toxic,

487
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:46,080
but you can take them and they won't kill you because the body doesn't recognize it.

488
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,300
I'll give you another example.

489
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,020
You ever heard of something called margarine?

490
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,980
That's something the body does not recognize.

491
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:52,560
It's foreign.

492
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,940
It's just like putting lube on a gear and it gets all messy.

493
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,600
So there are many things like that.

494
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,260
Industrial synthetic – when you say ascorbic acid,

495
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,140
when you bring up the vitamin C, then there's a qualitative issue.

496
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,860
Ultimately, if you continue with that thought, you'd say,

497
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,880
well, then we should have citrus for it.

498
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,060
But there's another problem there.

499
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,920
We really don't know what's in citrus until –

500
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,240
to communicate it the way people are used to having it communicated

501
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,060
because in order to do that, they have to assay the material,

502
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:24,420
which is bring it into the lab, squeeze the juice out

503
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,240
or whatever other component they're going to use an extract from,

504
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,680
and they usually torch it and combine it with other chemicals

505
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,100
to see what they can derive as being its constituents,

506
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,180
and all those processes change it.

507
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,500
So if I tell you something that might sound ridiculous on its face,

508
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,540
like no one knows what's in an orange, we really don't,

509
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,600
other than it's wet and squishy and juicy and orange in color and smells good

510
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:54,580
because the way we define what's in it, the process that it goes through

511
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,500
to define it, let's say clinically or academically, also changes it.

512
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:05,520
So in essence, if you're having a food question or anyone is, it's very simple.

513
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,660
Well, if you want to go more exacting, it would be eat lawful,

514
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,600
and that comes from your god, by the way.

515
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:19,980
And secondly, you will find out that we are integrated into the environment

516
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,700
so much that the environment provides us with what we need,

517
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,740
whether it's abundant or not.

518
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,660
Even if you were in the desert, something like the Sahara or Gobi,

519
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,020
where it's really kind of barren, and you had enough know-how,

520
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,080
you could still survive.

521
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,460
You would still figure out how to garner nutrition out of that environment,

522
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,500
even though it's hostile.

523
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,440
So I would suggest that there is a rhythm in seasons,

524
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,540
there is a rhythm in agricultural growth that is by the seasons,

525
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,780
and when you eat seasonally and you eat locally or cross-latitude, I should say,

526
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,340
you will probably benefit the most.

527
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,660
In terms of things called healing diets, I always tell people,

528
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,800
if you're going to want to heal something,

529
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:09,520
never eat anything that comes sealed in a package or has ingredients on it.

530
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,680
If it has writing on it, don't eat it.

531
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,560
Well, what does that mean?

532
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
Well, what do we do then?

533
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,820
Well, you receive some of these markets where they offer things in bulk.

534
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,240
You kind of scoop it out of a large container and put it in a smaller container

535
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,120
and have it weighed out or measured,

536
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,720
and then you finish the transaction and bring it home.

537
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,760
Have you ever heard of like a bakery where you walk in

538
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,440
and it smells like bread has just been baked and it's just right there cooling off?

539
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,800
And when I said that, it was really ironic.

540
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,600
When I started saying this a long time ago,

541
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,120
I started noticing a lot of produce had little stickers on it with writing on it and barcodes.

542
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,520
I said, oh, this is a cosmic joke, isn't it?

543
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,340
Because I used to tell people, don't eat anything that has any writing on it.

544
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,720
And here you buy a tomato and it has a sticker on it with writing on it.

545
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,360
I'm like, okay.

546
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,760
Now I'm like fighting with some cosmic force on this.

547
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,840
Now I'm going to leave it alone.

548
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,700
So you would say that because these vitamins, in this case ascorbic acid,

549
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:21,200
because a lot of what is useful in them is rendered inactive or sterile after a certain period of time,

550
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,760
it's not a health hazard as far as consuming it in excess amounts?

551
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,460
Anything in excess.

552
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,180
Well, nothing exceeds success and everything in moderation, I should say.

553
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,540
But I would say that all these things, no matter if it's okay.

554
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,100
Let me just say it this way.

555
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,000
The premise of it is poor, what they're doing and why they're putting it in there.

556
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,500
It's a very poor premise.

557
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,000
It's like Santa Claus, Easter Bunny premise type stuff.

558
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:47,780
Everyone does it.

559
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,800
No one knows why and they don't care.

560
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,140
This is ultimately the thing.

561
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,920
This is a religion, by the way, that we're discussing now, if you know what I mean.

562
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,600
The other aspect of it is it's a testament.

563
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,860
Even if it was really nasty stuff, it's a testament to the robustness of the human organism.

564
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,420
Think about that for a minute.

565
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:15,639
The other thing is I was speaking with someone even on another Internet thing for an hour and a half a few days ago.

566
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,540
I was saying there's a perception of how we interact with the material world.

567
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:31,800
For example, an average adult, male or female, man or woman, requires about half a kilo or a pound of food a day.

568
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:41,020
Going by the Pope's work schedule, let's say that would be 365 pounds of food or 180 kilos or so.

569
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,960
Now, if I said to you, this is the food you need for the whole day,

570
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,719
can you pick that up and carry it around all the time?

571
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:52,540
No, but you will consume it in a year one bit at a time because it's a very large burdensome load.

572
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:56,060
Most people couldn't pick up something that weighs twice as much as they do.

573
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,600
This is how the information about food can be too.

574
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,460
You want to really get into the finite and the massive amount of information.

575
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,980
It will just bury anyone.

576
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:15,400
They'll say, I need to take a break from the food discussion because I'm hungry right now.

577
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,080
A little bit at a time.

578
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:25,400
If you're going to parcel out a large body, something that could be burdensome one piece at a time,

579
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,400
wouldn't you want to just give the more important things in the beginning?

580
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,880
Because if you didn't continue that process, at least they got the most important stuff.

581
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:37,720
That's what I tend to do regarding food matters.

582
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,960
That is eat seasonally and eat locally.

583
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:45,760
In other words, if it's hot out, don't eat food that was grown in a cold climate.

584
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:51,140
If it's cold out, don't eat food that was grown in a hot climate

585
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:56,260
because obviously, look at the food as being an input to the body

586
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,900
and it will change it according to the environment.

587
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,740
That's why, have you heard people that live up and near the North Pole,

588
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,600
they eat blubber, pure fat to survive.

589
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,180
Things like that.

590
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:17,520
In the tropics, the variety of the diet is typically hot chilies and more tropically grown,

591
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,480
sugary stuff or water-based, quite the opposite.

592
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,960
Very little fiber in it.

593
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,680
Let me just bring up, this is like a loose conversation now,

594
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,400
but there is something that is counterintuitive.

595
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,620
For example, when someone eats hot and spicy food,

596
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,300
they think it is warming them up.

597
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,520
I've seen this with people here in America that have come from Asia.

598
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,100
When it's cold outside, they say, oh, I want it spicy to warm me up.

599
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,100
I'm like, no, actually, that's going to do the opposite.

600
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,300
It's going to open your pores and thin out your blood

601
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,900
and you might feel hot at the moment, but you will feel worse tomorrow.

602
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,880
Some of it is unintuitive.

603
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,940
Some of it you really do have to rationalize what is really going on.

604
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,700
Right.

605
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:07,140
In this case, back to that, would you say the question about ascorbic acid or vitamin C

606
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,660
and all that is very similar to anything else that they're putting in there,

607
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,500
whether it's mysterious or not as a vitamin?

608
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,400
I would say so, but it's nice to have specifics

609
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:26,020
because those things would have very particular effects on the consumer of them.

610
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,840
Yeah, it would, but here's the thing.

611
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,300
They don't want you to drop dead from it right away, do they?

612
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,480
Because then you won't come back.

613
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,100
Right.

614
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,140
When you mentioned that the ability for humans to consume certain things

615
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,500
is a testament to their robustness, I mean, if you get bitten by a snake,

616
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,940
you'll probably die if it's a poisonous snake of a certain variety.

617
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,520
Unless you drink your urine within the first 30 seconds or a minute.

618
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,800
That's where the antidote is, but go ahead.

619
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:51,840
Yeah.

620
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,100
Oh, I didn't know that.

621
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,940
I thought that was just a myth, but no.

622
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,380
Well, I mean, if they really wanted to kill you,

623
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,900
there are ways to go about doing that in a very concrete, effective way.

624
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,340
So obviously the agenda as far as food is concerned

625
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,720
is deliberate to sort of kill you slowly.

626
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,840
Yeah, but the thing is, if it was really so,

627
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,960
I think people would protest and have them hung

628
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,060
like at the end of the Frankenstein movie, you know, the villagers come.

629
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:18,960
Yeah.

630
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,560
Okay, yeah.

631
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,420
I would suggest from firsthand experience being around people

632
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,260
that are captains of industry that they don't know what's going on.

633
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,200
They are just as intellectually humbled or as ignorant as everyone else.

634
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,480
Now, it's kind of hard to say that because they have access to many more means

635
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,860
because of their wealth and stature in society than others,

636
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:42,960
but I would suggest that they have drank their own urine, I should say,

637
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,880
or their own Kool-Aid for too long.

638
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,560
So, yeah, they're not – you're all – it's like no one's at the wheel.

639
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,460
No one's – yeah.

640
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,440
I'll touch on one more food point if that's okay.

641
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:58,500
Sure.

642
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:03,300
I guess mindset-wise it's probably in line with the previous question,

643
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,980
but just to hone in on another specific,

644
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,580
there's another overt agenda in the food world

645
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,940
which is that of these estrogen, estrogen-heavy foods

646
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,460
and endocrine disruptors that are contained in synthetic foods,

647
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,740
whether through government subsidies for certain crops

648
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,320
or widespread injection of farm animals with hormones

649
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,520
or the ingestion of xenoestrogens through plastics,

650
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,180
it's kind of clear that that's a situation that is artificially maintained,

651
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,100
whether one wants to see it as a chemical warfare operation

652
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:37,500
or whether it's just a misguided move on the part of certain whole food fanatics

653
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,860
and new age enthusiasts who push every soy product under the planet.

654
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,700
What are the effects of estrogen imbalances in the body of males and females,

655
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,020
or men and women, rather?

656
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,280
Well, a short way to say it without really getting into it,

657
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,260
again, the body has to recognize it to reproduce it, right?

658
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,220
So that shows that the male can reproduce the estrogen

659
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,960
once there's a stimulus in the intestine or the stomach,

660
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,640
and it actually starts in the mouth.

661
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,480
I think I've mentioned before,

662
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,740
this is one of the agendas of the unknown goddess religion.

663
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,000
And I think the teaching, I'll reiterate it again,

664
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,620
the teaching of the ancient goddess religion which has been revived,

665
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,080
which is not known, by the way, but you could research this painstakingly,

666
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,500
and start piecing it together,

667
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,320
is that mankind was in a godlike state at one point.

668
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,140
In order to return a society of people back into a godlike state,

669
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,520
you promote male with male union.

670
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,580
The males become effeminate and sterile.

671
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,120
You promote a female with female union,

672
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,940
and the females retain sterility and procreate without the male.

673
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:45,000
And hopefully the females then will have asexual or hermaphroditic creatures.

674
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,460
And when everyone is now either asexual or hermaphroditic,

675
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:53,400
both sexes or no sex, you have a godlike society on earth.

676
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:57,300
And this really started at the turn of the 20th century.

677
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:02,380
That's why, and by the way, the scientific community, the legal community,

678
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,340
the religious community is all on board with this, and they don't know it.

679
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,560
The scientific community, let's say the medical community is on board with it

680
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,680
with the in vitro fertilization and their obsession about fertility.

681
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,060
And obviously all the other things that they're doing.

682
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:24,640
The scientific community is up on it also for, again, similar reasons.

683
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,920
The legal community is up on it by saying that if you want male with male union

684
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,920
or female with female union, you have legal rights now, right?

685
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,480
On and on and on.

686
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:38,900
And the religious community is on board with it because, well, I should say,

687
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:45,880
not directly but indirectly, the patriarchal aspect of it is being challenged.

688
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,320
And when you look at the patriarchal aspect of the religions,

689
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,540
they are actually just a male aspect still under the female goddess religion.

690
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,420
So anyway, because she has priests that are men,

691
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,400
because if you actually look at the writ of ancient texts,

692
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,140
women are held in very high regard.

693
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,460
Right.

694
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:11,340
But Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and other places don't hold women in high regard

695
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,920
because they're not adherence to their text.

696
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:17,920
So this is, would you say, cosmic reason?

697
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,000
And that's why when you know the cause,

698
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,320
do you want to maybe garner a sense of spiritual protection or the divine from it?

699
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,460
I would say that's a good place to start, right, because that's the cause of it.

700
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:36,900
And then the second aspect of it is to get protection or insulate yourself

701
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,500
from the beings on this planet who have legitimized the savagery.

702
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,480
Because, you know, when savagery is legitimized, it seems normal, doesn't it?

703
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:45,600
Yeah.

704
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:47,640
Yeah.

705
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:53,160
So this is a cross, this is a multifaceted thing that's going on.

706
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,920
But again, you know, let me just fast forward.

707
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:04,000
You know, in the amount of time that is left for human society on the planet,

708
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:09,260
if it was not, let's say, interrupted, let me just say this as a presumption,

709
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,720
because we won't get there as a society,

710
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,480
but if society is not interrupted, 50 or 100 years from now,

711
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,000
if a woman gets pregnant, she won't even have a fetus or an embryo.

712
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,520
It'll just be a cancerous lump.

713
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,860
I hope that sinks in to people.

714
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,620
This is the agenda, folks, from, you know, the influence of what's going on.

715
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,220
So the interruption, fortunately, you will be interrupted,

716
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,660
but unfortunately, you will be interrupted.

717
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,040
So either way, it's all right.

718
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,660
So at the same time, I would just guard oneself.

719
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,060
I mean, most people don't really care about what they eat,

720
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:48,880
and if you happen to care about what you eat,

721
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,840
it'll take a lot of time out of your life finding good food.

722
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,220
Now, if you think of that statement for a moment,

723
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,300
if you go back and look at, let's say, much older cultures,

724
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,520
don't you think they spent a greater percentage of their waking hours

725
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:07,220
thinking about how they're going to get food or making food to eat than they do now?

726
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:08,980
Yeah, they would.

727
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,280
It seems to be a revival in that direction.

728
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:16,800
Right now, the prepackaged food, ready to eat, heat it electronically or whatever,

729
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,020
well, you might want to contrast that and be more like the ancients,

730
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,780
you know, making fresh food from more raw ingredients.

731
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:33,100
And now you end up spending, I'd say, at one-tenth of your day at least

732
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,740
for just preparing food.

733
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,400
So let's say most people are up 16 hours or so, so an hour and a half a day.

734
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,420
There's shopping, buying, preparing.

735
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,020
That's normal.

736
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:50,960
I mean, in some places it could be all of your waking hours is getting food in some places, right?

737
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,960
So there's a contrast.

738
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:53,780
Right.

739
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:01,460
I kind of do understand more of the male effect as far as the estrogen imbalance would go as a male

740
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,640
and sort of seeing it overtly being displayed on people's bodies.

741
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,080
But on the female side, I guess it's a bit more under the hood

742
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,940
as far as if you already are somebody that has that disposition

743
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:18,060
to have more estrogen than a man, what exactly would that imbalance do to you?

744
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,860
Yeah, but let's just go back to the vitamin C perception.

745
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,480
Let's just keep it really simple and raw, so to speak.

746
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,860
Do we even know what estrogen is other than extracting, you know,

747
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,840
hormones and fluids from a living thing and segregating them through fire

748
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,760
and other chemicals to isolate them?

749
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:41,180
And is it possible that we're creating estrogen in the laboratory?

750
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,220
It doesn't really exist, but it's a form of communication.

751
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:48,740
How many times has the scientific community, medical community, even legal community

752
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:52,640
produced an aspect of something chemical or physical in physics,

753
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,140
but they never talk about how they separated it and got it?

754
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,440
They always just tell you, this is estrogen that does it.

755
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,840
Everyone agrees, but no one ever discusses how they were able to isolate it to estrogen.

756
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:06,040
And even the most rational, quote, unquote, uneducated mind,

757
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:11,620
if you look at the entire process of how they separated or segregated estrogen

758
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,540
from a living being, you're like, that doesn't sound right

759
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:17,560
because all those things they did to separate it could have actually created it

760
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,760
or changed it, you see?

761
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:25,620
One other way to think of it is the consistent appearance

762
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:30,000
or presence of something called estrogen consistently, you know,

763
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,680
through certain diagnostic processes or scientific processes,

764
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,800
showing up in many other things, you see?

765
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,940
Because how would you test something for having one?

766
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,100
Now, here's the thing.

767
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,480
Even when they – let's say they isolate or synthesize that hormone

768
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:51,240
and put it into a subject, now it's a completely different thing all of a sudden, isn't it?

769
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:55,000
You see, now it's like another – now it's just a different story again

770
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:00,020
because, you know, I'm sure they've done – they've isolated estrogen-type hormones

771
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:03,700
or what they could classify as mostly estrogen and inject it into rats or people

772
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:07,900
or monkeys or dogs and cats and looked at the effects of those that haven't.

773
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:14,680
And they might find consistently, yes, their genetic – meaning, should I say,

774
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,220
what is it, male or female differences that are accentuated or diminished?

775
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:24,080
So the storyline continues, you see?

776
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,620
But again, you know, really good science is based on knowledge,

777
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,080
and that's all the word means.

778
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:36,520
I would suggest that, you know, when we start discussing the effects of very specific chemicals,

779
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:42,610
it starts to get into what's called fractional thinking, you know?

780
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:45,330
And again, you brought up the soy aspect of it.

781
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:48,230
You know, there are so many varieties of soy,

782
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:55,170
and what most people are getting as soy products are the ones that are the least expensive to produce.

783
00:47:55,630 --> 00:48:02,350
In other words, require the least irrigation, the most resistant to bugs, and are –

784
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:08,730
and grow the fastest, and that is not always the best soy for human consumption, let's say, you see.

785
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:12,750
I've been saying for years and years and years, a lot of people say,

786
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,670
well, I have – I'm allergic to gluten.

787
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,110
I need – who told you that?

788
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:16,890
Well, the doctor told me.

789
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:17,850
I said, okay, wait a second.

790
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,130
There's no such thing.

791
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:21,790
This is moronic again.

792
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:26,190
The reason people have, for example, gluten intolerance or whatever

793
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:29,690
is because of the quality of the wheat at this point.

794
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:33,830
And of course, you know, there's also been the lactose, they call intolerance,

795
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,710
for certain people with dairy.

796
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:38,470
Again, that's kind of spurious.

797
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,470
Again, it's a very personal thing.

798
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:45,610
But this whole thing about gluten-free right now is because you basically have a substandard wheat crop

799
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:48,410
that's been sprayed and modified.

800
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:54,230
But this is okay because this is a planet of M-O-R-O-N-S.

801
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:59,490
But with regards to the lactose thing, I mean, I do kind of hear a lot of people profess that,

802
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:03,830
and I guess what they're trying to hint at or point in the direction of

803
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:08,050
is that something along the lines of the lactic acid doesn't fully digest

804
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:11,010
and sort of leaves some kind of residue in the intestines,

805
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:14,770
and that causes flatulence and gas and things of that nature.

806
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:18,230
And I wouldn't claim to understand the specifics of it at this point,

807
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,570
but I've had some kind of experience where I consume dairy products,

808
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,830
and there is that kind of an after effect, which is undesirable.

809
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:29,010
And the question is, have you consumed dairy products that are less tainted,

810
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:31,570
like directly, you know, direct whole milk,

811
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:35,250
or products that are made from direct whole milk that haven't been packaged

812
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:39,950
or let's say affected by industry and had the same effect?

813
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:44,250
Well, the best I can say on a sort of layman level

814
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:47,650
is that I went into what they would call an organic food store,

815
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:51,190
and I bought the milk that was there thinking that, well, this is more reliable,

816
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:52,650
and the effect was still the same.

817
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:54,590
Okay. All right.

818
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:58,430
So then there's something to be done there based on your tendency,

819
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:03,910
your personal constitution regarding that, or others like you, which is fine.

820
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:06,870
Because it goes all the way from the palate also.

821
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:12,050
You know, like for example, someone might like Brussels sprouts and someone else doesn't.

822
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:15,110
And when they try to like them and eat them, they don't feel good.

823
00:50:15,170 --> 00:50:16,190
They might get nauseous.

824
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:17,590
You know, it doesn't mean that they're bad.

825
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:21,530
It just means that this particular, you know.

826
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:23,490
Because here's the other thing I'd like to suggest.

827
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:25,990
There's only, I wouldn't say a small handful,

828
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:28,570
but several handfuls of genetic types on the earth.

829
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:32,930
You ever heard of like, you know, look-alikes?

830
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:40,270
You know, people that are cartoonists actually get into the forms of people,

831
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:46,790
but there's only a few handfuls of maybe 100 or so genotypes that everyone sort of fits into.

832
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:49,910
You know, this guy looks like this, or this person looks like that,

833
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:51,470
or this lady looks like this person.

834
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:54,870
You know, there's a limited amount of genotypes.

835
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:59,830
And even with intermarriage and, you know, when I mean intermarriage,

836
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:01,830
I mean not marrying someone who's in your own family.

837
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:05,530
But, you know, there's still, it seems to be recurring.

838
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:10,810
So the more we know, the more we learn about how we were,

839
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:15,810
and the more as we go into the future we're going to learn more about the ancient past,

840
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:18,450
I think a lot of these things will be answered a little more readily.

841
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:26,110
Okay. Moving on to sort of another topic that's not too far off in another realm of what they call science.

842
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:32,430
You've often stated your unwillingness to give credence to prevailing orthodoxy of physics

843
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:35,830
regarding electrons and protons, what they call those things.

844
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:42,170
But you seem not to be railing with similar vehemence against other bodies of knowledge within that field,

845
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:46,730
like the periodic table, although you sometimes comment on that with regards to water,

846
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:49,790
but you're more, I feel like you're more using it to explain a point

847
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:53,450
and actually giving it some kind of credence by using it in that way.

848
00:51:54,190 --> 00:52:00,550
And you don't also seem to have anything against the existence of molecules or the phenomena of ionization.

849
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:07,110
So there's certain things that you seem to be fine with and other things that you feel is part of the cosmic censorship or the dummy load.

850
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,510
So I wanted to ask what is the nature,

851
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:15,090
what is the nature of the information that constitutes subatomic particles that make up matter?

852
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:19,090
What is it in an atom if it's not protons and electrons?

853
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:23,030
Well, there's, OK, I'm not OK with any of it.

854
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:30,610
But is all this information come from a group that has done a lot of heavy lifting for many years?

855
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:35,770
Yes. They've done a lot of grunt work, meaning that if you want to go into industry,

856
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:41,290
the majority of their physics and chemistry is that it's available,

857
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:44,790
is workable for what is now industrially and commercially available.

858
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:49,190
You know, cars, planes, whatever, you know, and all that medicines and all these other things.

859
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:53,370
Right. But are they are they beneficial now? Are they wasteful?

860
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:56,670
Yeah, very. And they're inefficient. Very inefficient.

861
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:03,890
I would suggest that even within the mainstream orthodoxy, once they start looking at things as known as an atom.

862
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:10,010
OK, even the densest material, as they get down atomic level, they find out it's all space.

863
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:17,850
Mostly in terms of the the volume that it takes up and what is there and what it can be measured as being material.

864
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:20,950
There's almost no material within the atom itself.

865
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:27,550
It's mostly all space. Yeah. So there was something in the atom.

866
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:34,550
Yeah, they they're beginning to to notice that they're not really they don't really have a handle on the material world.

867
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:41,890
Because essentially, if you go back to the sub sensible, if you go back to the aspect of.

868
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:47,990
OK, well, I want to go to an email also where it's all external input.

869
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:52,450
You know, let's just say we're censored from that right now for obvious reasons.

870
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:56,350
You don't want to give you know how you tell children not to play with matches.

871
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:02,590
So if you want to hold on, we're going to the break right now and we'll continue the subject about the atom.

872
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:09,210
Cool. Greetings and welcome back to the second hour of Uncommon Radio.

873
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:11,690
We are still on with Sam, I believe.

874
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:15,950
And we were bringing up the concept of the atom and how nothing is really there.

875
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:18,730
I think, Sam, right? Yes. We're kind of finished off.

876
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:28,470
Yeah. What is really there is the point right now, I would say, is we lack the maturity to truly know directly.

877
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:36,210
And it sounds like might be a cop out. I feel like it's a cop out for myself because sometimes I sometimes I say to myself,

878
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:39,230
you know, I'm going to take some time and figure this out.

879
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:44,250
And guess what? It just a lot of time goes by and you don't figure much out.

880
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:47,090
But you're always working with it and you're made up of it.

881
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:50,110
So it's one of those things that you kind of like set aside.

882
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:53,870
And again, go and look at all the heavy lifting that these grunts have done.

883
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:58,950
That's what they are. The intellectual elite of humankind right now, the doctors, the PhDs,

884
00:54:58,970 --> 00:55:03,450
the researchers are operating on a grunt level, at least institutionally,

885
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:09,170
because those that do make what you might call incredible, fantastic or, you know,

886
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:16,290
paradigm shifting discoveries are shunned because it's like not disturbing the convention at this point.

887
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:20,630
The other thing the other thing I want people to consider and consider this,

888
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,230
if you're going to take anything to heart from Greek speak, is this.

889
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:28,890
Currently, the most surface dwelling earthen habits and think that everything sprang into creation.

890
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:31,310
Everything I think is important less than 100 years ago.

891
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:36,510
Like if you look at the scientific field or the medical field or even the legal field

892
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:39,870
or any other important fields that are important in society,

893
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:45,630
how many of them actually go back and really use what was accumulated up until the 1890s?

894
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:50,970
Very little. Things were done very, very differently back then.

895
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:58,290
And so in essence, there's this pride of being modern and being so technologically advanced.

896
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:04,930
I think there's the topic of discovering, let's say, empirically what's in an atom is something that is unpopular

897
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:07,750
to discuss because it's really different from the convention.

898
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:11,570
And the only reason the convention is there is so industry can keep working.

899
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:16,150
Look at university training. It's for industrial purposes.

900
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:20,830
And I've also spoke about the society in darkness.

901
00:56:21,890 --> 00:56:27,270
They're in the dark, you see, by the time the way they keep time and the way they garner their main materials,

902
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:29,410
you know, being petroleum based products.

903
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:34,410
So they're very dark in terms of spiritually.

904
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:38,490
And their religions, of course, are, you know, nothing to say much about.

905
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:42,130
So spiritually, they're void or into worthlessness.

906
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:46,290
Scientifically, it's dark. Medically, it's dark. Dead, medically.

907
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:48,490
Cadaver study and all that.

908
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:56,530
But we do know that there's a certain functional efficiency and results from the use of the knowledge, as you've mentioned.

909
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:58,050
In industry?

910
00:56:58,050 --> 00:56:59,430
Yes, in industry.

911
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:09,810
And yet, if so, something is being practically applied or used to create or give results,

912
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:15,910
then we know that there has to be a body of knowledge that underpins that that can be validated.

913
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:22,730
So if you've expressed that, you know, in your talks about water or engineering or other things,

914
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:29,570
that ionization is, for example, something that actually happens, and we know that that's a process, allegedly, anyway,

915
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:36,350
by which an atom or a molecule acquires a negative or positive charge by gaining or losing electrons, if that's what they say,

916
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:41,110
then how can we also then turn around in the same breath and say that there are no electrons?

917
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:49,010
No, the electron is a form of communication that was put on the world substantially by Walt Disney, by the way.

918
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:54,810
Prior to that, it was the charge and nature of that charge was what was considered.

919
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:04,950
And positive has a little bit of negative in it, and negative has a little bit of positive in it.

920
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,510
It's kind of like the yin-yang symbol.

921
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:10,290
The black field has a little white, and the white field has a little bit of black.

922
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:12,970
Everything has a little bit of its opposite in there.

923
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:14,030
Okay.

924
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:17,330
But electricity is – here's a simple antidote for electricity.

925
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:22,190
I think I've given – do you remember the one I gave, what you learn about electricity when you go to college, right?

926
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:24,090
You get zero for university.

927
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:27,210
You learn about how to work with it.

928
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:38,730
The other one that I want to suggest is it takes roughly 2,000 or 3,000 volts to send an arc a few millimeters, okay?

929
00:58:39,210 --> 00:58:42,710
So if you set up a 12-volt device or a 9-volt device,

930
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:48,710
you ever notice sometimes when you hit the switch or a wall switch, you'll see sparking and arcing in there, right?

931
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:51,990
And sometimes it's more than a couple of millimeters.

932
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,690
Well, the entire thing is rigged up to only 9 or 12 volts.

933
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:58,770
How can you bridge a gap that requires 2,000 or 3,000 volts?

934
00:58:59,010 --> 00:58:59,910
Where is it coming from?

935
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:02,150
Think about that for a minute.

936
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:05,750
And also, just for those that are listening for the first time on this respect,

937
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:16,330
where you learn about electricity formally or in the orthodox way in university is the physics department or the electrical engineering department.

938
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:21,710
Those are two general areas where that is studied or physical parts of the university.

939
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:24,390
And they're usually across the street from each other.

940
00:59:24,510 --> 00:59:30,830
So if you walk into the physics department, they're always studying the negative path or the negative charge,

941
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:35,810
and they always mark the positive as a source.

942
00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:38,150
So we'll put a negative 1 on that building.

943
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:41,950
When you go to electrical engineering, they send the negative to ground.

944
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:46,310
They always mark it as ground, and they're always studying the positive side of the circuit.

945
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:48,450
So we'll put a plus 1 on that building.

946
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:51,570
So what do you get when you put plus 1 and negative 1 together?

947
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:53,350
You get zero.

948
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,490
And that's where you're going to learn about electricity,

949
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:58,970
but you're going to learn a lot about electrical engineering and a lot about physics.

950
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:01,450
Now, that sounds convoluted, doesn't it?

951
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:03,490
A tiny bit.

952
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:09,650
Because what they do is they hide under the rug a lot of the anomalies and a lot of the things.

953
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:12,190
I mean, for example, in religion you do that a lot.

954
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:17,270
Certain religions have certain precepts, and when they come across something in the text that doesn't agree with it,

955
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:18,310
they kind of shove it away.

956
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:22,050
They don't want to look at it or they say, well, this is how this should be interpreted, you see.

957
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:31,150
So the same thing happens in the – if you even talk to anyone in the medical community that is at the top of their field,

958
01:00:31,290 --> 01:00:35,670
ultimately when it comes down to how the human body works, you know what they all say?

959
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:39,270
They all say, well, the body heals itself no matter how well –

960
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:39,890
I just love that.

961
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:46,330
Yeah, but even the orthodox medical people say, well, hopefully he'll heal himself.

962
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:48,250
Hopefully he'll heal.

963
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:50,990
Well, what do you know about healing and how the process works?

964
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:56,090
Nothing other than time and, well, rest and hygiene.

965
01:00:56,730 --> 01:01:01,910
That's what it boils down to, but there's a lot more to know about that, and that's one of the things.

966
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:06,770
Actually, I'm glad you mentioned this, and I don't feel pressed to answer it,

967
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:09,430
but it will be answered through the future endeavors.

968
01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:14,090
I'll go into several hours and giving a little bit of history, practical knowledge,

969
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:17,230
just like, for example, a 9 or 12-volt DC circuit.

970
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:23,710
How can flipping the switch send a several-millimeter arc which requires 2,000 or 3,000 volts

971
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:26,030
when you only have a 9-volt source?

972
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:27,030
How can that be?

973
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:29,250
What's going on, you see?

974
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:35,830
We're going to talk about that in more detail, and there's a concept –

975
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:39,850
this is, again, a level of chess that most people don't understand

976
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:43,270
where one aspect of society overlaps into the other.

977
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:46,290
When you're discussing physics, science, medicine, or whatever,

978
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:51,750
guess who are the gatekeepers to what gets flooded, poured out into society regarding that?

979
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:53,010
It's the legal society.

980
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:55,570
They're the gatekeepers of that information.

981
01:01:56,570 --> 01:02:00,090
I've personally known an attorney from Europe, and I said, what do you do?

982
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:02,390
He says, I edit university medical textbooks.

983
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:04,490
I said, oh, what do you know about medicine?

984
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:05,690
He says, absolutely nothing.

985
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:09,150
So how are you qualified to edit?

986
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:11,810
He doesn't answer because he's an attorney.

987
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,610
He doesn't need to know anything about it.

988
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:18,270
He just needs to see and make sure that everything is presumptuous,

989
01:02:18,450 --> 01:02:19,290
if you know what I mean.

990
01:02:20,030 --> 01:02:24,050
That's why when you look at a gray's anatomy, it never says a kidney looks like this.

991
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:27,710
It says a kidney usually appears this way, doesn't it?

992
01:02:30,190 --> 01:02:30,650
Right.

993
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:34,070
So you just have to keep everything in the presumption.

994
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:39,970
Academic can be defined as theoretical, impractical, never leading to a conclusion.

995
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:41,590
You could look it up etymologically.

996
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:44,250
That's what it means, being of the academy.

997
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:50,650
The ancient Greek schools were basically teaching young people parlor tricks

998
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:53,950
on how to take what someone said and turn it and use it for their favor,

999
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:55,990
you know, the one who has the socratic charm.

1000
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:56,950
Right, right.

1001
01:02:57,410 --> 01:03:00,950
Yeah, there's not much part of the dummy load in the cosmic censorship.

1002
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:02,250
I get that.

1003
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:06,310
I kind of have to take off in ten minutes, so I will ask one more question,

1004
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:07,710
and then I might have to drop out.

1005
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:11,270
So changing subjects a bit to something completely different.

1006
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:16,310
You mentioned attorneys, and I think of laws and sovereignty

1007
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:18,330
and things like that in connection with it.

1008
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:19,910
When we look at certain countries,

1009
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:24,690
one comes across what initially seems to be an anomaly of sovereignty

1010
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:28,270
pertaining to small areas of land within a nation

1011
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:30,270
that seem to be operating under its own laws,

1012
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:32,950
whether it's financial districts, religious institutions,

1013
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:36,830
or seats of government that we see with the city of London and England,

1014
01:03:36,830 --> 01:03:39,830
Washington, D.C., and U.S.A., and the Vatican in Italy.

1015
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:42,950
They pop up as examples of places with their own constitutions

1016
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:44,550
and exclusive self-government.

1017
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:49,230
So what other sovereign districts within countries do you know of

1018
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:52,590
that could be pointed to as similar, aside from the ones that I've mentioned?

1019
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:54,770
Because I feel like they're the more overt ones.

1020
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:55,850
All of them.

1021
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:56,610
Yeah.

1022
01:03:56,910 --> 01:04:00,330
All of the federal districts in the world, whether it's in Russia,

1023
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:06,350
let's say Mexico, the capital of Mexico is called Mexico City DF,

1024
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:07,610
District Federal.

1025
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:09,170
That is not part of Mexico.

1026
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:10,350
The same with Moscow.

1027
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:13,990
Every federal district is not part of that country.

1028
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:18,050
It's under what's called federalism when you study what federalism is.

1029
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:21,910
You have to understand the ancient commercial codes,

1030
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:22,910
how it was all put together.

1031
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:27,750
Now, in the sense of sovereignty and freedoms and things like that,

1032
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:33,870
it's super, hyper, ultra convoluted because most jurisdictions in the world,

1033
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:37,310
sovereign or not, are under what's called a credit-based economy.

1034
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:42,310
And when you have a credit-based economy, the actual resident, citizen,

1035
01:04:42,730 --> 01:04:46,590
slave, or participant, anyone who has a credit line,

1036
01:04:46,670 --> 01:04:48,390
meaning a social security number, birth certificate,

1037
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:51,330
is the one that holds all of the credit.

1038
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:53,950
But you can't let them know that they have it.

1039
01:04:54,650 --> 01:05:00,450
And then there are organizations, agencies, institutions like the legal society.

1040
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:04,570
When I say legal society, it's everyone, the clerks, the attorneys, the police,

1041
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:07,710
the judges, the bankers that are involved with them.

1042
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:13,350
So, in other words, the legal society, the financial banking society,

1043
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:17,250
the medical society, all of the government agencies, for example,

1044
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:22,530
and a lot of the religious societies also know that the people are the ones with the credit

1045
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:25,750
and they have to get it from them without them letting them know that they have it,

1046
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:26,910
and that's what they're giving up.

1047
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:34,070
So it's a very twisted, convoluted thing in what's going on.

1048
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:39,430
So, again, you cannot escape the –

1049
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:42,570
what should be in the forefront of anyone's mind is it's a credit-based economy.

1050
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:43,530
It's a credit-based economy.

1051
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:44,930
It's a credit-based economy.

1052
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:45,670
What does that mean?

1053
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:47,530
It doesn't mean debt.

1054
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:51,130
Debt is just an option that you can go into if you like,

1055
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:57,150
but that's what they tell people because they're always going to give you the Santa Claus Easter bunny myth.

1056
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:05,710
So the thing is, ultimately, it's really frowned upon to go into a lawful –

1057
01:06:05,710 --> 01:06:10,830
if you're discussing sovereignty, it's irrelevant if it's sovereign or is sovereign.

1058
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:14,450
What's relevant, I would suggest, is is it lawful or unlawful.

1059
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:17,710
That's why there's lawful money.

1060
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:19,150
Can credit be done lawfully?

1061
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:20,850
Yes, it can be.

1062
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:22,210
But is it being done lawfully?

1063
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:25,370
No, it's not because people are told that they have debt.

1064
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:28,170
How can you have debt in a credit-based economy?

1065
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:29,230
It doesn't make any sense.

1066
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:32,150
But I guess if you have attorneys, I mean anything is possible.

1067
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:33,150
Right.

1068
01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:39,730
But with regards to something like the – you say that the federal government or the federal –

1069
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:40,610
Districts.

1070
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:45,850
Districts usually tend to be sovereign, but I guess the City of London is an exemption

1071
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:48,250
because that's a financial district.

1072
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:51,350
It's generally classed as such, although it has religious overtones.

1073
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:52,510
Yes.

1074
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:53,270
Well, they all do.

1075
01:06:53,690 --> 01:07:00,050
They're either – most of the federal or governments of – or centralized –

1076
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:01,950
federalism is just centralized, you know.

1077
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:04,730
It would be like the ruler of thousands, right?

1078
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:11,610
They tend to be necropolises, you know, or they tend to have a patron or matron deity.

1079
01:07:12,270 --> 01:07:15,650
So they all have – we recently did an interview with someone,

1080
01:07:15,650 --> 01:07:18,470
and he brought up American government buildings.

1081
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:19,510
I said, those are temples.

1082
01:07:19,690 --> 01:07:22,390
I mean, if you go look at the inscription on the building itself,

1083
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:26,330
and I pulled an inscription of a building, let's say the Lincoln Memorial,

1084
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:30,110
and on the – cut into the marble itself, this government building says,

1085
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:33,550
this temple, yada, yada, yada, yada.

1086
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,570
And I'm like, okay, there you go.

1087
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:40,250
It says it right on the building, you know, the capital buildings,

1088
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:41,990
the various monuments are called temples.

1089
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:46,130
Yeah, it sounds archaic, doesn't it, or ancient, doesn't it?

1090
01:07:46,170 --> 01:07:49,990
And not much – doesn't it harken back to think that not much has changed,

1091
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:51,510
just the perception of it has changed?

1092
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:53,030
Right, yeah.

1093
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:56,050
So do you have a –

1094
01:07:56,050 --> 01:08:00,190
Yeah, the credit-based economy needs to be considered first, you know,

1095
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:01,830
and then is it lawful or unlawful?

1096
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:04,670
And I would say that is the credit-based economy considered?

1097
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:05,070
No.

1098
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:09,190
Are all the societies on earth right now lawful or unlawful?

1099
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:11,110
I would definitely say unlawful.

1100
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:14,130
So what are you going to do?

1101
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:19,050
So if you have, for example, Scandinavian countries like Sweden

1102
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:22,710
or even other European countries like the Netherlands that have monarchies,

1103
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:25,850
what would you point to as being their version of that?

1104
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:31,250
Is it the monarchy that tends to be the self-governing thing,

1105
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:35,250
or is it the judicial system where the prime minister works?

1106
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:35,510
Sure.

1107
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:39,010
The judicial system would be if they have a separate one set up,

1108
01:08:39,029 --> 01:08:41,109
and also if they have a credit-based economy,

1109
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:45,189
you will see there's an adjunct or something operating next to them that has a presidency

1110
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:48,290
and is also not part of that country.

1111
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:49,870
It's considered some kind of a district.

1112
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:51,290
Okay.

1113
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:52,569
Yeah.

1114
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:55,050
You'll find that if you research it.

1115
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:56,149
It could even just be a building.

1116
01:08:56,670 --> 01:09:00,910
Just like – it used to be online, but if someone wants to research it, let me know.

1117
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:04,069
There's the Vatican in Rome, Vatican City,

1118
01:09:04,069 --> 01:09:05,649
and there's another building called the Vatican.

1119
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:11,590
It's a very nondescript four- or five-story brick building about 600 years old.

1120
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:17,830
What they do is if you have a state department, they subscribe to them,

1121
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:21,609
and they dictate the policy of all the state departments of the world.

1122
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:26,430
Once you join and they dictate policy for you, it's unappealable.

1123
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:32,390
So let's say they make a policy for, let's say, Ghana or Switzerland or the U.S.

1124
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:35,609
Once they make a decision and you've joined them, you cannot appeal it.

1125
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:40,250
It makes you wonder why sometimes you see certain politicians get up

1126
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:43,470
and try to make a poor excuse why they're passing a law or doing something.

1127
01:09:43,689 --> 01:09:46,890
It's like you know they're just up front as a front person.

1128
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:49,450
I'm not giving too much credence to the –

1129
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:52,229
I'm not talking about the Vatican where they have all those columns

1130
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:55,010
and the fish hat and the big penis in the middle, you know, the spire,

1131
01:09:55,770 --> 01:09:57,690
and the guy with the fish hat and all that.

1132
01:09:58,150 --> 01:09:59,290
I'm not talking about that.

1133
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:02,590
There's another building called the Vatican there in Vatican City.

1134
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:03,810
It's very close to it.

1135
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:09,890
Maybe we'll get into that on the podcast a little bit,

1136
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:13,530
but it's really irrelevant stuff on the grand scheme of things

1137
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:15,530
because if we had a lot of time to go,

1138
01:10:15,970 --> 01:10:18,630
it would be something to keep and start edifying,

1139
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:23,030
educating people about how things really work, but I don't think it really matters.

1140
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:27,570
I think it's going to be put into irrelevancy here in a minute, let's say,

1141
01:10:27,570 --> 01:10:29,730
in the next less than a decade.

1142
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:31,950
Right. I get you.

1143
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:33,370
All right.

1144
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:34,190
Thank you.

1145
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:35,170
This has been a nice conversation.

1146
01:10:35,650 --> 01:10:37,350
I have to take off unfortunately.

1147
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:40,970
Thanks for dropping by and dropping in and calling in.

1148
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:42,130
It was a pleasure.

1149
01:10:42,750 --> 01:10:44,090
Good luck with the rest of the broadcast.

1150
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:45,250
Thank you.

1151
01:10:45,430 --> 01:10:45,750
Take care.

1152
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:46,430
Have a great day.

1153
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:47,330
All right.

1154
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:48,070
Later, Greek.

1155
01:10:48,450 --> 01:10:48,650
Bye.

1156
01:10:50,670 --> 01:10:52,970
There you go, and thank you for calling in.

1157
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:55,870
I hope you folks got something out of that.

1158
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:58,330
I sure got me thinking.

1159
01:11:00,370 --> 01:11:01,170
So, okay, we're back.

1160
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:03,670
Anyone else have anything they want to contribute?

1161
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:09,990
Otherwise, what I was thinking of doing in certain fashion is going back to some of the relevant comments

1162
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:13,850
that I've gotten, let's say, either in the Greek-speak chat,

1163
01:11:13,930 --> 01:11:20,630
which there does exist just Greek-speak chatango, I believe, or the emails.

1164
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:25,910
The most recent email I was going to bring it up, I'll read it anonymously here.

1165
01:11:28,190 --> 01:11:31,330
It harkens back to much of the discussion, and I think it's pertinent

1166
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:34,850
because we only have one more Sonic solo episode to go.

1167
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:40,050
I think making this available to most people because most people tend to dream and things like that.

1168
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:43,370
Okay, it says, Hello, Greek.

1169
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:47,730
I want to thank you for, let's say, teaching on dreams, and I hope you continue to speak on that.

1170
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:48,970
Our thoughts are not our own.

1171
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:49,290
Are they?

1172
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:50,150
Question mark.

1173
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:53,490
Many times something comes into the mind, and one might say to themselves,

1174
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:53,790
What?

1175
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:55,230
Where did that thought come from?

1176
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:56,010
That's not me.

1177
01:11:56,110 --> 01:11:58,130
I didn't think like that, or that's crazy thinking.

1178
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:01,070
So are one's thoughts, whether sleeping or awake, our own?

1179
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:02,210
It seems to be.

1180
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:04,170
You have stated the scriptural men.

1181
01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:04,570
Okay.

1182
01:12:05,210 --> 01:12:07,730
All right, so let's just change this up, get into a little Book of Daniel things,

1183
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:12,390
but I just want to get back into the – there's a certain nomenclature to apply here maybe.

1184
01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:19,310
If you remember being very young, you can only go back to a certain point.

1185
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:21,850
Like you don't remember coming out of the womb.

1186
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:23,210
You don't remember suckling.

1187
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:30,150
I mean, you might because believe it or not, lawfully, in certain, let's say, what's called biblical law,

1188
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:34,650
someone was suckled until about weaned off at five years old.

1189
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:40,930
That's why the value of a male child increased after five because – well, anyway,

1190
01:12:40,930 --> 01:12:44,770
that's just another thing here, and five also comes before number six, which is man.

1191
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:50,150
So when you go back to a time period when you are very, very young,

1192
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:54,270
you notice that your thoughts are scant or minimal or nonexistent,

1193
01:12:54,450 --> 01:12:56,870
and you have thoughts of being very young.

1194
01:12:57,250 --> 01:13:02,930
You probably don't remember taking your first step or something like that,

1195
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:04,730
but you are walking for the first time.

1196
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:07,150
But you might remember, let's say, riding a bike for the first time.

1197
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:11,350
And I want to go into the riding the bike metaphor because once you learn how to ride it,

1198
01:13:11,390 --> 01:13:14,530
you never forget and you never tend to experience that similar struggle.

1199
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:17,770
Actually, you could if you've been injured a certain way,

1200
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:24,530
but I just want to say that you take walking, speaking, like learning how to speak and all that for granted.

1201
01:13:25,690 --> 01:13:27,830
You don't think about these things.

1202
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:30,550
So, okay, well, where are the memories?

1203
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:34,570
Now, I want to go back, maybe just refresh a little bit of the conversation we had with Sam.

1204
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:36,990
It was just on about science.

1205
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:42,370
If you actually look into the nether regions of what the scientists say is we don't know where memory is.

1206
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:46,790
Now, obviously, they talk about lobotomies and things like that and the brain being damaged.

1207
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:52,270
But in terms of harm being done to the mechanism, they can't see the memory.

1208
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:58,950
Now, even if you were to look at the way things are codified digitally, they need to be interpreted.

1209
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:03,210
Or this is just a matter of another way you might say it's just signals.

1210
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:07,650
Now, the word mem means water and or means light in a certain language.

1211
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:12,430
And I would beckon anyone to meditate on this.

1212
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:14,690
Meditate means think on it over and over and over.

1213
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:19,450
There are how many different ways to think about it is when it's all external input.

1214
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:25,570
Can you imagine going, let's say, walking in a park or the beach or someone's house

1215
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:28,770
and they have a table set radio playing and they're playing jazz music?

1216
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:34,210
How many people said let's take this radio apart because there's a little tiny jazz band in there?

1217
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:35,770
You know, we better get them out.

1218
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:38,150
That sounds kind of ridiculous on its face.

1219
01:14:38,190 --> 01:14:43,470
But that's how it sounds eventually when you start discussing about memories being your own

1220
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:44,710
and thoughts being your own.

1221
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:51,950
Could it be, let's just keep it framed this way, that you are receiving and you are transmitting.

1222
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:56,770
And what makes you you, by the way, the spirit, your personality,

1223
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:59,510
what makes you you is your spirit, by the way.

1224
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:01,130
The soul is interchangeable.

1225
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:01,910
That's just the breath.

1226
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:06,850
The spirit, there is a place where, let's say, for example,

1227
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:10,790
it's been memorialized in ancient texts when man dies, meaning woman as well,

1228
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:12,950
the spirit returns back to the heavenly realm.

1229
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:20,330
Now, what's interesting is, well, in animation, disanimation, it's like being asleep.

1230
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:24,290
There is no animation because at this point it requires the body to be animated.

1231
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:30,750
What's interesting about that is you also hear about a lot of other contacts on the other side,

1232
01:15:30,830 --> 01:15:36,830
like a guardian angel type thing or thoughts being put in or thoughts plucked out of people's minds.

1233
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:38,910
Could it be that what is really going on,

1234
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:43,970
we are receiving and transmitting through a certain frequency that makes us us?

1235
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:49,490
You know how certain, let's say a cell phone or most devices have a very specific frequency.

1236
01:15:49,490 --> 01:15:55,310
You know you have cell phone towers that accommodate all of the cell phones, let's say,

1237
01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:57,150
somewhere in an area locale.

1238
01:15:57,630 --> 01:16:02,290
But when you make a phone call or receive one, it doesn't ring all the phones

1239
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:08,150
because there's a way to discern the different components in the entire system,

1240
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:12,630
all the various phones, and there could be millions or billions of them that seem to be discernible.

1241
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:16,290
I would suggest there is a major hard drive or a source somewhere,

1242
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:20,750
and it's in a longitudinal way, I would say counter-spatial way,

1243
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:24,830
not measurable as we know how to measure things, meaning humans,

1244
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:27,710
and that is where everything comes from.

1245
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:29,470
So you are not on your own.

1246
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:32,510
That's why it's very easy to be messed with,

1247
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:38,530
and having those things now with psychotronics and other things like that,

1248
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:45,330
there is research on how you can actually intercept this longitudinal-type communication

1249
01:16:45,330 --> 01:16:49,390
and pump thoughts and sounds and things into people's minds.

1250
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:50,690
I'm not going to talk about that.

1251
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:54,930
In the future, I will talk more about how that is done, and it's very counterintuitive.

1252
01:16:56,430 --> 01:17:02,690
It's being done using a longitudinal technology, not transverse, which means it's instant.

1253
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:04,090
There is no wave as such.

1254
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:07,610
There's still a measurable, discerning energy field we can call a wave,

1255
01:17:07,610 --> 01:17:10,570
but it's not like a sine wave where it takes time to travel.

1256
01:17:10,730 --> 01:17:11,790
It happens instantly.

1257
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:19,570
So one of the most difficult things to, I mean, of course, because no one really thinks that way,

1258
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:25,530
that their thoughts are not their own, but we might, let's say, rest assured we'll know in the future,

1259
01:17:25,690 --> 01:17:34,150
and at this point, I find it to be very plausible and to be so plausible that once you use that methodology,

1260
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:39,250
that your thoughts are not your own, your memories are not your own, they're not stored in the head.

1261
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:42,410
They're actually stored just like on computers, on a cloud, on a network.

1262
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:46,910
You have a more usable perspective of your, quote-unquote, consciousness,

1263
01:17:47,350 --> 01:17:51,330
and of course, just like you have the various perspectives of reality,

1264
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:56,990
and it seems like the more ignorant the people are, the more emphatic they are about what they think it is.

1265
01:17:56,990 --> 01:18:02,110
So having an open discussion in a calm fashion is difficult,

1266
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:08,990
because that's what is required for each one coming with their own experiences in a rational way,

1267
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:11,790
explaining what they see is going on technically,

1268
01:18:12,370 --> 01:18:18,510
so you can put it together to advance the idea of how our thoughts and what we really are made of.

1269
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:22,010
But again, you're dealing with an irrational society.

1270
01:18:22,530 --> 01:18:25,990
What I mean by that, you have all these groups of people talking about reincarnation

1271
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:32,230
or when you die you go to heaven or hell or they can travel astrally and do all this other stuff.

1272
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:36,110
So there's no, you're not going to, that's fine to consider all of that,

1273
01:18:36,450 --> 01:18:41,770
but it has to be rationalized in a very cool, calm, let's say educated way.

1274
01:18:41,890 --> 01:18:45,790
And unfortunately, most people are bound up by these beliefs

1275
01:18:45,790 --> 01:18:48,350
and it's almost impossible to have a rational discussion,

1276
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:53,790
including what I'm being said will actually be poo-pooed or viewed as,

1277
01:18:53,790 --> 01:18:55,790
oh, that's what he says, I don't believe in that.

1278
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:59,030
This is almost, this is not the time yet for it.

1279
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:02,190
But those that consider that your thoughts are not your own

1280
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:06,710
and the memories are sort of uploaded and downloaded from a cloud, a virtual cloud,

1281
01:19:07,050 --> 01:19:11,890
and it's all instant, forget about the Einsteinian rubbish of speed of light and all this other stuff.

1282
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:15,970
And dreams are actually not your own either.

1283
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:20,850
You're being plugged by other entities that have been created to make dreams for people.

1284
01:19:20,850 --> 01:19:23,870
You will find that, by the way, in every culture.

1285
01:19:24,030 --> 01:19:29,030
But of course, if you believe that everything was created 100 years ago, you're at a loss.

1286
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:35,310
So with getting down this road, the most rational explanation, I would say,

1287
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:39,150
and the most founded explanation that can be memorialized by the ancients

1288
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:43,050
is that our thoughts are not our own, but our personality is.

1289
01:19:43,090 --> 01:19:47,050
We are granted a certain personality and unique quality,

1290
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:50,510
but yet everything else that we do is interactive.

1291
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:54,890
And just to throw something in that might make it helpful,

1292
01:19:56,050 --> 01:19:59,790
what's interesting is you're never really alone spiritually because of that.

1293
01:20:01,450 --> 01:20:04,850
Imagine however you want to imagine it, somewhere up on a cloud, somewhere,

1294
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:07,230
and when I mean a cloud, meaning not the cloud in the sky,

1295
01:20:07,330 --> 01:20:10,750
but like the computer cloud network somewhere, a server somewhere.

1296
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:13,990
Why don't you ask for help when you're looking for someone?

1297
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:17,890
Just ask someone there to go and maybe pull a switch

1298
01:20:17,890 --> 01:20:21,730
or patch you on to a body of knowledge or an ability.

1299
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:23,870
Have you ever done that? It's called prayer, folks.

1300
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:28,630
Yeah, and you don't want to do it in public because it's not that effective.

1301
01:20:28,770 --> 01:20:34,130
Now, there are entities, quote unquote, and demons and lower-level gods

1302
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:39,030
that do thrive upon public prayer. That's their MO, modus operandi.

1303
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:41,890
But when you start getting into the much higher realms,

1304
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:49,470
these things of associating with them on the conscious level by making requests

1305
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:51,030
and things like that is done in private.

1306
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:54,290
And I know this is contrary to the cultural means

1307
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:55,950
and the way that you've been taught,

1308
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:58,730
but that's something you're going to have to figure out.

1309
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:05,110
But what I can do is rationalize what is going on simply by the performance

1310
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:08,150
of what is going on. Just think about how things perform.

1311
01:21:08,150 --> 01:21:11,610
This is performance-based information.

1312
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:15,690
In other words, if you're getting an idea or a quote unquote belief,

1313
01:21:15,790 --> 01:21:18,910
which is even worse, I should say even worse meaning because belief is based

1314
01:21:18,910 --> 01:21:21,490
on something temporal that will be achieved later.

1315
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:26,890
If you're getting these concepts of what the mind is and how it works

1316
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:30,690
and all this, and it's not performance-based, in other words,

1317
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:35,270
you cannot increase your performance, meaning your specific attributes

1318
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:39,690
or benefit you, it is known as worthless information.

1319
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:42,250
Yes, so has anyone been on the Internet lately?

1320
01:21:42,850 --> 01:21:45,750
Most of you, anyway, get it, or turned on mainstream media

1321
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:47,150
or gone to church or university.

1322
01:21:47,650 --> 01:21:49,730
You get it. It's pretty worthless.

1323
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:53,570
Unless you are, again, looking for a specific performance

1324
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:56,470
and you need to gain this bit of information to work as such.

1325
01:21:56,950 --> 01:22:01,530
Now, in terms of the dreams, this is a reoccurring theme.

1326
01:22:02,470 --> 01:22:06,650
Yes, dreams are not your own, but the thing is most people are so casual

1327
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:12,310
about them, and dreams have a lot of weight in tradition and in culture.

1328
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:15,550
Think about it. When I mean a lot of weight,

1329
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:17,590
I mean people like to discuss them.

1330
01:22:18,130 --> 01:22:22,870
It's kind of like from the old wives' tales all the way to the psychiatrists,

1331
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:25,830
the spiritualists, PSY prefects, and all this.

1332
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:29,070
They hold a lot of weight when you bring up the dream world

1333
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:31,390
and interpreting dreams and what they are and all this,

1334
01:22:31,790 --> 01:22:35,550
but no one really gets down to the nitty-gritty that when you get a dream,

1335
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:36,770
you're being plugged.

1336
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:41,670
Basically, plug doesn't sound good, but it's usually not very good.

1337
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:46,070
The reason why I'm saying they're not very good is because the level of quality

1338
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:51,190
of those delivering the dream and the dream itself is so low

1339
01:22:52,330 --> 01:22:56,330
that in contrast to when there is a high-quality dream,

1340
01:22:57,070 --> 01:23:00,290
especially when you start getting up the ranks in the realm of the gods,

1341
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:05,650
they typically identify that you are being plugged with a dream, basically,

1342
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,730
on the more benevolent higher ranking.

1343
01:23:07,890 --> 01:23:12,590
But unfortunately, if you do get a dream from one of that level,

1344
01:23:12,650 --> 01:23:15,790
you may not survive it to tell everyone else that you did.

1345
01:23:18,890 --> 01:23:26,390
Just imagine having a thumb drive or a disc, using the computer analogy,

1346
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:28,430
and walking up to a machine and just putting it in,

1347
01:23:28,490 --> 01:23:31,890
and the information kind of lights up when the thing was asleep

1348
01:23:31,890 --> 01:23:32,990
or the screen was black.

1349
01:23:33,090 --> 01:23:34,690
That's what dreams are, essentially.

1350
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:38,970
But typically, at this point, most people's dreams

1351
01:23:38,970 --> 01:23:42,770
and most people's interaction with these lower-level entities

1352
01:23:42,770 --> 01:23:46,650
is for entertainment purposes, I think, both for the people

1353
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:48,490
and those plugging the people.

1354
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:51,930
But they're coming into a time period where the dreams will get more serious

1355
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:55,230
and there will be some identifiable markers behind them.

1356
01:23:57,270 --> 01:24:00,250
So, yeah, that is an interesting aspect.

1357
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:03,750
But those that are experiencing dreams in a negative way,

1358
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:07,830
where they can't sleep or rest because the body does require a certain amount

1359
01:24:07,830 --> 01:24:13,690
of rest to rehabilitate physically, the dreams can be malevolent in that case,

1360
01:24:13,830 --> 01:24:18,130
or if not just being an outright nightmare, which, you know, whatever.

1361
01:24:18,550 --> 01:24:23,210
But I believe I found discussing this with myself and others for years,

1362
01:24:23,550 --> 01:24:25,230
meaning with myself actually trying it,

1363
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:31,010
is that the more proper knowledge you gain of what is going on regarding dreams

1364
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:33,070
and thoughts, you will benefit.

1365
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:37,270
You will actually, let me just say it this way,

1366
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:42,250
when you start getting to a point where your knowledge base is proper, okay,

1367
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:47,150
your dreams will stop and you will actually have a very restful sleep

1368
01:24:47,150 --> 01:24:49,250
or they will be at an absolute minimum,

1369
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:54,070
almost as if you were aware that a dream could have been coming but it didn't,

1370
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:57,910
kind of thing, or maybe there was a dream and there wasn't,

1371
01:24:58,050 --> 01:25:00,810
or, you see, almost like a residue of a dream.

1372
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:05,010
But, you know, some people enjoy having dreams and they'll have at it, you know.

1373
01:25:05,110 --> 01:25:07,170
However, you know, it's like the vitamin C.

1374
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:10,230
There are people out there screaming about vitamin Cs curing everything.

1375
01:25:10,890 --> 01:25:13,730
Even putting it in your car maybe gives you better gas mileage.

1376
01:25:13,810 --> 01:25:14,110
Who knows?

1377
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:18,670
But, well, I know, I'm just poking fun at the way people think and talk,

1378
01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:21,810
what I hear out there, both mainstream and alternative.

1379
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:24,290
So I just wanted to bring this up.

1380
01:25:24,370 --> 01:25:25,590
This is a reoccurring theme.

1381
01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:28,670
Thank you, V, for sending that.

1382
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:34,370
And that was a reoccurring thing because people have reoccurring dreams

1383
01:25:34,370 --> 01:25:35,310
and reoccurring thoughts.

1384
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:39,390
I'm presuming most people are thinking, even though it's a – anyway.

1385
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:48,450
So I would say that regarding the biblical questions here, yeah,

1386
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:53,270
there's a time coming here, folks, where – I don't even like to use the word

1387
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:58,290
because the Bible comes from Biblos in what's known as modern-day Lebanon.

1388
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:02,490
You folks don't really have a lot of really good information,

1389
01:26:02,670 --> 01:26:07,270
at least what you've stored up in your heads about any of this stuff about the gods.

1390
01:26:08,170 --> 01:26:14,830
Why? Because it's come from religious circles, whether it's Christian, Judaic, Babylon, whatever,

1391
01:26:15,610 --> 01:26:17,070
any of these religions.

1392
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:22,610
What it shows you is how the several levels.

1393
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:29,470
First of all, the fact that humankind has been fractionalized and fractured

1394
01:26:29,470 --> 01:26:32,210
and broken up into various religions is not good.

1395
01:26:32,670 --> 01:26:36,470
Okay, now just hear me out because I'm not a proponent for a one-world religion

1396
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:41,990
because that can't really happen because every group of people have to behave differently

1397
01:26:41,990 --> 01:26:43,150
in different parts of the world.

1398
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:49,150
But you're fractionalized there and also you're fractionalized within each division,

1399
01:26:50,050 --> 01:26:55,950
within each group, whether it's the very fact that there are many different religions

1400
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:59,870
and then within those religions there are other fractures and groups there.

1401
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:07,750
I believe somewhere it was written that all of the institutions on the planet right now

1402
01:27:07,750 --> 01:27:11,310
or mankind's world are controlled by the adversary or Satan.

1403
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:15,450
It didn't say except for religions, so we have to include those as well.

1404
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:20,750
The other thing I would like to include is that another thing that was said

1405
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:23,330
was that Satan's kingdom is divided.

1406
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:28,090
So now we're actually, when you look at the religious beliefs, not some religion,

1407
01:27:28,150 --> 01:27:32,310
I'm talking about all religions now, there are several proofs in ancient texts

1408
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:37,730
that actually explain them very, very specifically as being not good.

1409
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:42,270
So anyway, that was the question.

1410
01:27:42,670 --> 01:27:43,530
I didn't get into it.

1411
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:45,050
It was regarding the Book of Daniel and other things

1412
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:49,050
because you're coming into a time period here where these things are starting to open up.

1413
01:27:49,210 --> 01:27:53,070
But the blind will have to be able to see and the illiterate will become more literate

1414
01:27:53,070 --> 01:27:57,330
and the seals will be loosened up in the future.

1415
01:27:57,710 --> 01:28:03,870
And I just want to reiterate, that's why people that are, let's say, venues,

1416
01:28:03,870 --> 01:28:10,930
whether it's alternative media, mainstream, written, print, university, new religious recruits,

1417
01:28:11,050 --> 01:28:13,610
you know, all these things, places where people go to get something

1418
01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:17,930
that is spiritual information-based or whatever are all not doing well right now.

1419
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:23,630
The ones that are still just stringing along, just giving you the same old stuff

1420
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:26,690
or, you know, let's just see what happened yesterday and talk about that,

1421
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:28,890
they're not doing well.

1422
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:34,050
The readership is down in newspapers.

1423
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:37,590
Just about everyone in alternative media is hurting.

1424
01:28:38,670 --> 01:28:41,630
Mainstream media is hurting and there's a reason for it.

1425
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:47,930
You are being sidetracked by the gods because what you are saying means nothing at this point.

1426
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:53,030
Sorry, I said it that way, but because it's all the same stuff over and over.

1427
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:56,330
It's the same dummy load over and over.

1428
01:28:56,330 --> 01:29:01,170
Or it's just so inaccurate that, man, okay.

1429
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:05,890
Anyway, yeah, so now you know how I feel about what's going on in the planet

1430
01:29:05,890 --> 01:29:08,570
because knowledge is also based on communication

1431
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:12,250
and communication is basically knowing what letters and words mean,

1432
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:16,150
you know, having a sense of communication.

1433
01:29:16,430 --> 01:29:19,210
And what you can see being communicated is not very good

1434
01:29:19,210 --> 01:29:20,970
and it looks like there might be a call.

1435
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:21,910
Wow, okay.

1436
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:26,390
Someone has been waiting, not for very long.

1437
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:30,670
Let's try them out and see if they are there.

1438
01:29:31,330 --> 01:29:31,750
Greetings.

1439
01:29:33,550 --> 01:29:34,030
I agree.

1440
01:29:35,730 --> 01:29:39,830
Sorry to hear that you are getting ready to cut it off here on the FRM.

1441
01:29:41,790 --> 01:29:45,430
It's been a real educational endeavor for me.

1442
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:47,430
Sorry.

1443
01:29:49,490 --> 01:29:51,670
I just wanted to tell you thanks.

1444
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:58,270
And also you mentioned about the goddess religions.

1445
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:02,650
I didn't write that down.

1446
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:05,990
I was trying to keep up with what you were talking about,

1447
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:11,290
but I'll certainly go back in the archives and do my homework later.

1448
01:30:11,290 --> 01:30:17,330
But I just wanted to mention this fact, a little factoid for you

1449
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:18,670
or whoever may be listening.

1450
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:22,490
I live here near Nashville, Tennessee,

1451
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:27,310
which according to the power that be is a hot city here.

1452
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:33,170
Many people in the states are coming here for whatever reason.

1453
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:36,170
I'm sure that has to do with sheep herding effect.

1454
01:30:36,170 --> 01:30:44,810
But concerning the – you mentioned repeatedly in your past conversations

1455
01:30:44,810 --> 01:30:48,410
about the revival of the goddess religions.

1456
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:55,970
And as I go back in your old conversations a couple of years ago

1457
01:30:55,970 --> 01:31:03,250
and I'm trying to catch up and educate myself about things that I suspected in my own mind

1458
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:07,730
but I didn't know how to articulate until I came across these talks that you provided,

1459
01:31:07,910 --> 01:31:09,390
and that's why I appreciate you so much.

1460
01:31:11,170 --> 01:31:11,830
You're welcome.

1461
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:14,110
There is a revival of the goddess religions.

1462
01:31:14,490 --> 01:31:20,630
And I noticed this because I work in the legal field here in Nashville,

1463
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:25,410
and I spend a lot of time in the local courthouses here.

1464
01:31:26,170 --> 01:31:32,910
And I never really paid attention to the buildings until as of recently.

1465
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:35,470
As I come across your talks and I started doing homework,

1466
01:31:35,570 --> 01:31:37,970
and I'm looking at the building, one of the particular buildings,

1467
01:31:38,030 --> 01:31:39,970
if I give you the address and the name of the building,

1468
01:31:42,670 --> 01:31:49,170
that engraved on this building, which is an actual courthouse here in Nashville,

1469
01:31:51,070 --> 01:31:52,150
is Justitia.

1470
01:31:54,210 --> 01:31:54,970
That's right.

1471
01:31:55,050 --> 01:32:00,070
And I've been living here in Nashville since I served in the military prior to moving to Tennessee,

1472
01:32:00,550 --> 01:32:07,070
active duty back during the first Gulf War when I got out of the Army,

1473
01:32:07,410 --> 01:32:09,430
and I moved here in 1992.

1474
01:32:10,890 --> 01:32:16,850
And I've been here since for the most part because I've settled down and married and raised a family.

1475
01:32:18,110 --> 01:32:22,390
But just to give you some background on how long I've been here,

1476
01:32:22,610 --> 01:32:24,330
but it's now 2017,

1477
01:32:24,650 --> 01:32:31,710
and I've never even realized that engraved on this building is Justitia.

1478
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:36,510
Which is a straight-up ancient goddess, yeah.

1479
01:32:37,370 --> 01:32:37,810
Yeah.

1480
01:32:38,250 --> 01:32:44,590
And I've been doing my own homework as I go through your previous talks

1481
01:32:44,590 --> 01:32:49,590
and creating notes for my private library for myself and my family.

1482
01:32:51,790 --> 01:32:57,150
And studying Justitia and looking back at the history of her,

1483
01:32:57,650 --> 01:33:02,750
not only in the Internet but going through local libraries here

1484
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:05,190
and universities that I've attended here and so forth.

1485
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:11,310
And as I go into this building, which is the building is the ñ

1486
01:33:11,310 --> 01:33:12,850
I'll give the name and the location.

1487
01:33:12,850 --> 01:33:16,770
It's the Justice General Sessions Court Building,

1488
01:33:16,970 --> 01:33:20,270
the Justice A. A. Berkshire Building here in Nashville.

1489
01:33:20,370 --> 01:33:23,710
And anybody can Google it, but you may not find photographs of it

1490
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:26,570
because I've looked for photographs on the Internet myself,

1491
01:33:26,730 --> 01:33:28,130
but I can't find photographs.

1492
01:33:28,730 --> 01:33:38,110
But engraved all around this building are like 30, 40-foot-tall personifications of Justitia.

1493
01:33:38,910 --> 01:33:40,550
And I'm like, holy crap!

1494
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:42,690
Yeah, yeah, it's right there.

1495
01:33:42,690 --> 01:33:46,710
This stuff that this guy's talking about is not some fabric,

1496
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:48,930
the fabrications of someone's imagination.

1497
01:33:49,070 --> 01:33:51,670
This stuff is real because I've been ñ

1498
01:33:51,670 --> 01:33:55,770
myself, I've traveled through many places around the world.

1499
01:33:56,290 --> 01:34:04,370
And, you know, it's ironic that I've really never paid attention to these things.

1500
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:17,910
Obviously, in the past, I had no idea of how ñ of the history of where things evolved from.

1501
01:34:17,970 --> 01:34:22,030
And it's only recently that I began to question where things evolved from.

1502
01:34:22,130 --> 01:34:29,430
I mean, because I've been around long enough in the world to realize that, okay, you know,

1503
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:37,770
things that I see, things that I experience, and what I interact with in the world that I live in,

1504
01:34:38,370 --> 01:34:43,470
there's no way that this stuff could have evolved just, you know, 10, 50, 100 years ago.

1505
01:34:44,430 --> 01:34:44,630
Right.

1506
01:34:45,090 --> 01:34:51,870
And as I've come across your talks, which I believe are absolutely timely in my life and my experiences,

1507
01:34:53,810 --> 01:34:57,850
I've come to realize that, yeah, that is absolutely true.

1508
01:34:57,850 --> 01:35:09,210
And that you have simply articulated what truly is reality concerning all these matters.

1509
01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:15,590
Even when it comes to the scriptures, which I myself have ñ and when I say scriptures,

1510
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:24,410
obviously living in the United States, the primary scripture from which all these versions of the so-called Bible come from

1511
01:35:24,410 --> 01:35:26,610
is King James 1611 Version.

1512
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:27,750
Right.

1513
01:35:27,970 --> 01:35:38,250
And I have questioned that, which is what I want you to elaborate on, and then I'll hang up and let you continue.

1514
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:46,110
You know, you mentioned in one of your previous talks, I believe it was the Rosetta Stone Part 2 with Ochoa,

1515
01:35:47,090 --> 01:35:53,750
about the Paleo-Hebrew, which is what I want you to elaborate on,

1516
01:35:53,750 --> 01:36:01,870
because I'm trying to figure out what was the original language that those so-calledÖ

1517
01:36:01,870 --> 01:36:04,850
Okay, I'm going to stop you right there.

1518
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:05,870
You don't have to hang up.

1519
01:36:06,030 --> 01:36:08,330
Stay on, because I want to hear your comment on this.

1520
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:14,130
Because, you know, the reason I'm speaking, by the way, is because nobody else is saying anything like this.

1521
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:15,010
Right.

1522
01:36:15,090 --> 01:36:18,130
So the thing is, you want to say it once, you want to say it twice.

1523
01:36:18,130 --> 01:36:24,750
When you're satisfied that people get it, then you can like, you know, bow down and go away, because you achieved something.

1524
01:36:24,870 --> 01:36:27,070
That's why I'm speaking, you see.

1525
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:30,730
So what I want to say is simply this.

1526
01:36:31,130 --> 01:36:38,250
It's important to be able to know the original language, only to see what the source is, right?

1527
01:36:39,110 --> 01:36:41,550
And anything, you want the original, right?

1528
01:36:41,650 --> 01:36:44,230
Because that shows you the reference.

1529
01:36:44,230 --> 01:36:50,210
And anything else that comes after that, that's not like that, is not the original, or a poor copy, or a fake.

1530
01:36:50,870 --> 01:36:51,030
Okay.

1531
01:36:51,550 --> 01:36:54,750
Now, when you look at something known as the scriptures, what is it?

1532
01:36:54,810 --> 01:37:00,470
Now, we're not talking in the pagan reality where they tell you to swear on it, or it's a talisman, or it's got some magic power.

1533
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:01,370
We're not talking about that.

1534
01:37:02,050 --> 01:37:04,610
What it is, it's a communication, is it not?

1535
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:05,490
Right?

1536
01:37:06,490 --> 01:37:11,090
You've got to read it, you've got to speak it, whether it's audio or you read it or not.

1537
01:37:11,090 --> 01:37:14,250
There's information there that needs to be communicated.

1538
01:37:14,490 --> 01:37:21,990
Now, if the information that was in the original language, or let's say the original communication was memorialized in a certain language,

1539
01:37:22,210 --> 01:37:28,750
it really doesn't matter what language you get it in as long as the communication or the information is preserved.

1540
01:37:30,350 --> 01:37:37,070
Another example of that would be, like, let's say somebody has an Apple computer back in the days, and they had a file.

1541
01:37:37,070 --> 01:37:38,990
Now, they put that file on a disk.

1542
01:37:39,110 --> 01:37:42,750
You go to Microsoft, it doesn't seem to work.

1543
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:45,570
It doesn't recognize it, or you don't get the communication.

1544
01:37:45,950 --> 01:37:51,870
But if you have a program or a way to go from Apple, let's say, to Microsoft, a different operating system,

1545
01:37:51,970 --> 01:37:56,410
and all of the information comes through, then it doesn't matter if it's Apple or Microsoft.

1546
01:37:56,610 --> 01:37:59,750
It doesn't matter if it's paleo-Hebrew or English or whatever.

1547
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:00,650
You see my point?

1548
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:09,930
So ultimately, whenever you've heard me discuss anything about what's called the Bible or the word of the gods or the Most High God,

1549
01:38:11,130 --> 01:38:17,150
I'll have the people gotten a clear, concise, accurate communication of what the gods want to communicate to us.

1550
01:38:17,490 --> 01:38:18,910
And you know what the answer to that is?

1551
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:19,410
No.

1552
01:38:20,130 --> 01:38:21,430
You still do not have that.

1553
01:38:21,570 --> 01:38:22,970
You don't have that information.

1554
01:38:23,710 --> 01:38:26,710
And then what we do is we could just backtrack and show you how.

1555
01:38:27,930 --> 01:38:33,830
You know when you go to the shops and they have these things, they've got ultraviolet light or a yellow marker,

1556
01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:37,810
when you hand them a 20 or a 50 or a 100 to see if it's counterfeit or not?

1557
01:38:38,910 --> 01:38:39,270
Yeah.

1558
01:38:39,390 --> 01:38:44,870
Okay, so at this point, if you took a King James Bible or any of the other Bibles and you ran that yellow marker,

1559
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:47,090
it won't show that it's good.

1560
01:38:48,510 --> 01:38:50,010
It's not the communication.

1561
01:38:50,590 --> 01:38:53,730
If the gods gave you one of those markers, you could do that.

1562
01:38:53,810 --> 01:38:55,270
You say, no, this is not what we're saying.

1563
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:57,090
You see my point?

1564
01:38:58,210 --> 01:39:01,710
And the only way to do that now is by using forensics.

1565
01:39:01,870 --> 01:39:02,530
What does that mean?

1566
01:39:02,610 --> 01:39:04,130
You need to go back and find evidence.

1567
01:39:04,230 --> 01:39:05,410
Forensics just means evidence.

1568
01:39:06,230 --> 01:39:11,090
So my point here is being aware of it.

1569
01:39:11,170 --> 01:39:14,770
Now, is it the time now where people will actually get the message?

1570
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:15,650
No, not yet.

1571
01:39:15,690 --> 01:39:16,330
But is it coming?

1572
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:16,730
Yes.

1573
01:39:18,050 --> 01:39:20,370
And is it going to be surprising the most?

1574
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:20,690
Yeah.

1575
01:39:20,790 --> 01:39:22,910
Well, if you know about it now, it's surprising.

1576
01:39:22,910 --> 01:39:29,410
But one thing about the gods is when the information is opened up so every man and every woman and child can understand it,

1577
01:39:29,550 --> 01:39:31,110
it's not going to be a surprise to them.

1578
01:39:31,690 --> 01:39:32,830
It's not going to shock them.

1579
01:39:32,910 --> 01:39:34,010
It's going to be like, oh, okay.

1580
01:39:35,030 --> 01:39:35,710
You see?

1581
01:39:36,250 --> 01:39:40,570
And what I'm doing is just giving a heads up right now about what's going on.

1582
01:39:40,690 --> 01:39:44,230
And I appreciate that you appreciate it because here's the thing.

1583
01:39:44,370 --> 01:39:49,210
If half the people just helped one person, that takes care of everybody, doesn't it?

1584
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:50,290
Right?

1585
01:39:50,290 --> 01:39:56,010
So if someone like yourself calling in and saying that it's helped you in just one thing, that's great.

1586
01:39:56,090 --> 01:39:57,250
I don't have to speak anymore.

1587
01:39:57,450 --> 01:39:58,610
I'm pretty much done.

1588
01:39:59,270 --> 01:39:59,390
Right?

1589
01:39:59,450 --> 01:40:01,430
That's the altruistic way of doing it.

1590
01:40:01,490 --> 01:40:07,870
But I think what you bring up about regarding going back to the paleo Hebrew,

1591
01:40:07,990 --> 01:40:16,210
which was actually in Israelite cuneiform writing, I would suggest that even if you found it, how helpful.

1592
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:20,970
You still have to translate it into English, French, or German, or Chinese.

1593
01:40:21,650 --> 01:40:25,250
And then when you translate it, are you going to be able to communicate what's there?

1594
01:40:25,430 --> 01:40:26,890
And that hasn't been done yet.

1595
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:28,430
You don't have that yet.

1596
01:40:28,470 --> 01:40:33,110
You have a general idea, but enough specifics are left out and enough mistakes are made

1597
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:37,850
that people's idea of what is going on regarding the reality of the gods is still not known.

1598
01:40:38,630 --> 01:40:41,950
So this time is coming, and it's going to be interesting.

1599
01:40:41,950 --> 01:40:47,710
Just being aware of that is a big plus, you see.

1600
01:40:48,010 --> 01:40:51,190
That's why I didn't want you to hang up, because it's not about the original language.

1601
01:40:51,350 --> 01:40:57,350
It's about do we have a delivery of the communication, and the answer to that is no.

1602
01:40:59,190 --> 01:41:03,830
The information held within has not been communicated clearly or concisely.

1603
01:41:04,210 --> 01:41:07,050
Just how many times have you heard me say if someone says do you believe in God,

1604
01:41:07,130 --> 01:41:10,430
just walk away shaking your head, because there's no such thing.

1605
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:12,870
There's a plurality.

1606
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:17,570
If you say the word army, do you just think of one guy just standing there,

1607
01:41:18,630 --> 01:41:21,830
or is it a plurality of beings, you see?

1608
01:41:23,090 --> 01:41:28,670
I mean, that's how far off people are from reality of that.

1609
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:30,970
Now, this has nothing to do with belief.

1610
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:33,350
This just has to do with the information.

1611
01:41:34,770 --> 01:41:38,550
So we're at a point right now where these things are going to be changing.

1612
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:43,010
But remember, the information that's going to be coming in the future

1613
01:41:43,010 --> 01:41:47,070
is going to come at the right time, which is not going to make people freak out.

1614
01:41:48,110 --> 01:41:51,530
If you push this information at the wrong time, you'll get people freaking out

1615
01:41:51,530 --> 01:41:52,950
and going wild on you, right?

1616
01:41:53,430 --> 01:42:00,370
So you have to understand the right time for things, and understanding time.

1617
01:42:00,630 --> 01:42:03,810
I mean, have you ever considered also the Pope's work schedule,

1618
01:42:04,010 --> 01:42:06,130
the Gregorian calendar not being a timepiece?

1619
01:42:06,130 --> 01:42:10,150
You know, when you celebrate a day every year, recognize observance,

1620
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:13,450
a day, one year, it's a different day of the week the next year.

1621
01:42:13,610 --> 01:42:15,190
I'm sure you've noticed that as well.

1622
01:42:16,410 --> 01:42:16,590
Yes.

1623
01:42:17,690 --> 01:42:21,470
Yeah, and that means that it's not really, you can't keep time with that thing.

1624
01:42:21,530 --> 01:42:22,390
It's just a work schedule.

1625
01:42:22,530 --> 01:42:24,950
That's why they call it work week weekend, you know?

1626
01:42:25,470 --> 01:42:25,870
Sure.

1627
01:42:27,950 --> 01:42:32,310
As a child growing up, that was something that always confused me.

1628
01:42:32,310 --> 01:42:38,130
I didn't understand, okay, why would this, or my birthday, for example,

1629
01:42:38,330 --> 01:42:42,030
would be on a different day the next year and a different day the next year.

1630
01:42:42,090 --> 01:42:45,830
It's like it didn't, and I had no idea because I didn't grow up in a,

1631
01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:50,330
I guess you could say for lack of a better word, educated home.

1632
01:42:51,330 --> 01:42:53,490
My mom grew up in a home.

1633
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:55,850
And I didn't understand.

1634
01:42:56,110 --> 01:42:57,490
I was like, it doesn't make sense.

1635
01:42:57,530 --> 01:43:00,090
But I had no way to question it.

1636
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:02,230
I had no foundation upon which to question it.

1637
01:43:02,350 --> 01:43:06,690
But I just, in the recesses of my mind, I was like, it didn't make sense to me.

1638
01:43:06,730 --> 01:43:08,950
It didn't make sense that all these days of the year,

1639
01:43:09,450 --> 01:43:14,510
all these celebrated so-called holidays would be on different days of the year,

1640
01:43:14,670 --> 01:43:18,390
the next year, and it's just like something's just not right.

1641
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:24,070
I didn't know what it was or how to articulate that it's not right.

1642
01:43:24,070 --> 01:43:32,510
There was just an intrinsic anomaly in the back of my mind that just said,

1643
01:43:32,630 --> 01:43:33,930
this doesn't make sense.

1644
01:43:35,050 --> 01:43:36,730
But it's not supposed to make sense.

1645
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:37,950
You're not supposed to think about it.

1646
01:43:37,950 --> 01:43:38,870
You're just supposed to do it.

1647
01:43:38,970 --> 01:43:41,410
You ever hear about that, just do what you're told, right?

1648
01:43:41,470 --> 01:43:43,410
That's what I tell people.

1649
01:43:43,630 --> 01:43:45,430
Sometimes I might be critical.

1650
01:43:45,610 --> 01:43:47,570
I say, look, just do what you're told and you'll be fine.

1651
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:48,730
Yeah.

1652
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:53,250
Because it takes, you know, this is, when people figure out,

1653
01:43:53,250 --> 01:43:54,690
I mean, you said you were in the military.

1654
01:43:54,910 --> 01:43:59,670
You know, I've communicated with people in the military, family members,

1655
01:43:59,730 --> 01:44:01,590
those in the military, especially those in the field.

1656
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:07,150
I've seen letters of officers, officers write back to their families,

1657
01:44:07,210 --> 01:44:10,430
and they say, listen, my own people or my own troops

1658
01:44:10,430 --> 01:44:12,910
and my own people are more dangerous than the enemy.

1659
01:44:13,510 --> 01:44:14,550
They shoot each other.

1660
01:44:14,610 --> 01:44:15,270
They kill each other.

1661
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:20,430
I'm afraid for my life here, not from, let's say, the Iraqis, but my own guys.

1662
01:44:21,170 --> 01:44:22,490
You know what?

1663
01:44:22,570 --> 01:44:26,650
It's ironic you bring that up because I almost ended up in the Middle East

1664
01:44:26,650 --> 01:44:30,770
some years after I'd been in the military.

1665
01:44:31,210 --> 01:44:34,850
And long story short, I didn't go.

1666
01:44:35,970 --> 01:44:40,270
But in the back of my mind, if I had gone, that was my primary concern

1667
01:44:41,130 --> 01:44:42,970
because of the mentality of the guy.

1668
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:45,370
And I was an officer, mind you.

1669
01:44:46,270 --> 01:44:49,530
And the mentality of the officers that I trained with was like,

1670
01:44:49,530 --> 01:44:50,470
are you kidding me?

1671
01:44:50,530 --> 01:44:52,030
These guys are freaking morons.

1672
01:44:52,490 --> 01:44:58,210
Do you not question what the hell they're trying to get up to try to do?

1673
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:00,990
And I was in the armor.

1674
01:45:01,170 --> 01:45:06,330
I was in armor, M1s, you know, these 80-ton vehicles

1675
01:45:07,770 --> 01:45:10,350
shooting 120-millimeter rounds downrange.

1676
01:45:10,770 --> 01:45:15,870
And, you know, as an officer, you get to see before you go to command your guys,

1677
01:45:15,870 --> 01:45:19,490
because, you know, anyone, any branch of the military can attest to an officer,

1678
01:45:20,110 --> 01:45:23,850
whatever branch they're in, they can attest to their training that they have to be,

1679
01:45:24,490 --> 01:45:27,630
before they go out and command guys, they have to go through similar training

1680
01:45:27,630 --> 01:45:29,290
of what these guys that come in are going to do.

1681
01:45:32,130 --> 01:45:35,010
And I've seen the destruction that these tanks can do.

1682
01:45:36,050 --> 01:45:39,130
And as I was going through this training, in the back of my mind, I'm like,

1683
01:45:39,910 --> 01:45:43,510
how can you do this to another fellow man?

1684
01:45:44,730 --> 01:45:48,630
Well, because it's just the way it's where humanity is.

1685
01:45:48,830 --> 01:45:50,870
The earth is a very violent place.

1686
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:53,210
Yeah, it is, it is.

1687
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:54,290
I understand that.

1688
01:45:55,470 --> 01:46:01,430
But anyway, I just wanted to, from my own personal experience,

1689
01:46:01,650 --> 01:46:04,430
I get exactly what you're trying to articulate to others,

1690
01:46:04,890 --> 01:46:07,130
from my own personal experience as a military officer.

1691
01:46:07,730 --> 01:46:09,090
It didn't make sense to me.

1692
01:46:09,230 --> 01:46:11,470
And that was just something I couldn't do.

1693
01:46:11,470 --> 01:46:12,350
And I didn't end up going.

1694
01:46:12,530 --> 01:46:13,910
I just, it didn't happen.

1695
01:46:14,230 --> 01:46:15,250
I couldn't let it go.

1696
01:46:15,350 --> 01:46:16,070
I couldn't let it happen.

1697
01:46:16,230 --> 01:46:20,330
And that was kind of a turning point for me, you know,

1698
01:46:21,510 --> 01:46:25,330
towards trying to figure out, you know, okay,

1699
01:46:26,830 --> 01:46:29,150
I'm missing a lot of information in my life.

1700
01:46:29,910 --> 01:46:31,410
There's a lot that I don't know.

1701
01:46:32,210 --> 01:46:39,230
But I'm willing to just sit back and be taught what the destruction is.

1702
01:46:39,230 --> 01:46:44,030
Yeah, and the more obvious it is, the easier it is to learn.

1703
01:46:44,110 --> 01:46:45,370
Well, the harder it is to learn.

1704
01:46:45,690 --> 01:46:46,090
You know what I mean?

1705
01:46:47,510 --> 01:46:47,670
Yeah.

1706
01:46:48,790 --> 01:46:53,950
So that's what I appreciate you appreciating the episodes and all that.

1707
01:46:54,410 --> 01:46:55,990
But I'm not going away.

1708
01:46:56,310 --> 01:46:59,950
You can go to Uncommon Radio, and I will be doing a podcast.

1709
01:47:00,650 --> 01:47:02,650
So you could dig into that.

1710
01:47:02,830 --> 01:47:05,350
And also, feel free to send an email or whatever.

1711
01:47:05,750 --> 01:47:06,550
It's on the site.

1712
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:10,390
And I appreciate you appreciating what's being said,

1713
01:47:10,990 --> 01:47:15,810
because I think as the times change, more and more will be discussed.

1714
01:47:16,150 --> 01:47:19,350
And if you've noticed, the thing about I call Greek speak,

1715
01:47:19,490 --> 01:47:22,090
it's all the obvious stuff that no one's looking at.

1716
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:25,650
Yeah, it certainly is.

1717
01:47:25,950 --> 01:47:29,670
But, you know, even, I mean,

1718
01:47:29,670 --> 01:47:35,390
repeatedly I have to listen to podcasts and study and take notes

1719
01:47:35,390 --> 01:47:42,870
and do homework and listen again and again and again to break through the

1720
01:47:42,870 --> 01:47:49,110
Pavlovian conditioning all of the years of my life to sometimes get one little tidbit.

1721
01:47:50,170 --> 01:47:50,270
Right.

1722
01:47:50,330 --> 01:47:55,610
And then it opens up Pandora's box to another bit, another bit, another bit.

1723
01:47:55,910 --> 01:47:56,010
Right.

1724
01:47:57,110 --> 01:47:57,550
Yeah.

1725
01:47:57,830 --> 01:48:00,370
I mean, your efforts are not futile in any way.

1726
01:48:00,950 --> 01:48:07,750
And I really believe that you've got some divine intervention that's placed you in this position

1727
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:09,290
to be able to impart this information.

1728
01:48:09,450 --> 01:48:09,970
So thank you.

1729
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:11,650
Thank you very much.

1730
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:15,770
And that wraps it up for Solo 11.

1731
01:48:16,130 --> 01:48:17,030
We have one more to go.

1732
01:48:17,170 --> 01:48:18,050
This is Bell Lap.

1733
01:48:18,210 --> 01:48:21,890
And we will see you folks, everything being willing, next week.
