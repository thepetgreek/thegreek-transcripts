00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,620
Greetings everyone and welcome to Uncommon Radio and this is the last Sonic episode.

2
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:10,020
I reckon it's probably the 12th solo, we might call it, and the last one for now.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,660
And there won't be a Baker's Dozen. There's probably a project in the works.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:22,000
It will be coming around. If you folks are interested, go to UncommonRadio.com or www.uncommonradio.com.

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,840
I would suggest it's around the 11th day of the third month or third moon.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:35,440
And that would be lawful timekeeping if anyone even knows what lawful even means anymore.

7
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,960
But I think we've kind of talked enough about this is planet Earth and what's going on here

8
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,760
and basically what the rules are here.

9
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,680
In other words, the descriptions that have been given on these solos are not the exception.

10
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:59,740
It's the rule, folks. So if you are listening to this and you understand 10% of what's being said,

11
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:07,100
you probably get the idea. But you're on planet Earth, so yeah, it's a pretty bad place.

12
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:14,860
Well, let's just say this. It's got beautiful terrain, lots of creatures, good produce even.

13
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:22,160
It was written in a film somewhere. But typically, it's inhabited by seven billion psychopaths.

14
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,640
But anyway, what I mean by that is psychopathic just means sick spirit.

15
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,620
So what about you, Greek? Someone might say, aren't you? Well, that's not the point.

16
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,380
The point is why isn't it being discussed?

17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,860
So anyway, the point is there is no point. It's kind of pointless and I just want to bring up the point again.

18
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:48,980
If you've ever listened to Greek speak, it's been going on for some time here on what's called AFR,

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,880
American Freedom Radio, and other places. It's kind of been public here and there,

20
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,440
kind of like a guerrilla informist in the sense for about seven or eight years.

21
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,780
But I would suggest that most of the stuff that the Greek has been discussing,

22
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,880
speaking of the third party here, has been just hints at things.

23
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,700
Yeah, there's some episodes where we kind of get into more of validating the point,

24
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,120
but it really doesn't matter. Why? Because you're living in a society where evidence doesn't matter,

25
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:26,240
where presenting the facts, which by the way, facts are not always true, by the way.

26
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,260
You want to consider that a fact is not necessarily the truth.

27
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,580
So that sounds a little convoluted to most, but you can go down the line and figure that one out

28
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,200
if you have any experiences with what's called a legal society, you'll understand what was meant there.

29
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,800
But necessarily, the condition of humanity is what has always been part of the,

30
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,780
let's say the critical end or the business end of the discussion or the sonic emanations

31
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,840
because simply why talk about things that everyone else is talking about

32
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,940
and not just for the sake of being different, but just for a qualitative sake.

33
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,380
Kind of grow up on this planet. I've been here for more than half a century plus, a few years.

34
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:19,940
And if you actually look at what is being discussed, considered, thrown about as education, culture, tradition,

35
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:26,920
you'll find it to be of pretty low quality if you're substantiating it objectively.

36
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,460
And why is there no discussion of that?

37
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,200
Now, if someone thinks I'll use the brand name McDonald's as five star meal.

38
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,520
Well, you kind of want to leave that alone, I think.

39
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,780
So you want to find maybe a more fertile ground.

40
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:47,620
Let's just say I would suggest that eventually there is going to be a time,

41
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:57,820
which I've been hinting at coming around soon, where perhaps more will be discussed somewhere by everyone.

42
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,000
But the time apparently is not now.

43
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,760
So let's see. I maybe got a message.

44
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,260
Let's see here, folks, because it's still kind of an open venue here.

45
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,080
If you folks want to call, the number has been given out.

46
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,520
But I'm looking at a Skype message.

47
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,160
Yeah, I hear you talk on.

48
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,060
Hello, Greek. Hi, Greek.

49
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,920
I was wondering if you can talk about male-female energy.

50
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,540
Well, it's more than that. It's just an energy. It's a polarity.

51
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,400
It's a potential.

52
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,900
And these practices claim we have limited essence and having sex can squander it.

53
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,860
That's kind of a dummy load.

54
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,600
But I'll get back into that.

55
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,220
Sorry, folks.

56
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,200
I just wanted to read a message if it was pertinent.

57
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,380
But essentially, this being the last Sonic episode, that means that there's going to be much more to come.

58
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:46,340
But it's not going to be done the way, you know, like I usually would call into places

59
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,520
or even do what they call a Sonic episode here at AFR.

60
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:57,820
I think it's best done more in private with a limited audience if you understand how quality works, by the way.

61
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,780
It is sort of limited for a reason because you can get more into depth.

62
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,360
And most people go around to public places to ride the bus or take a pee or whatever.

63
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,340
You've been in public places, and public places have their place, and private places have their place.

64
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:20,900
So I would suggest that, again, back to most of the things that the Greek has discussed are essentially strings of hints.

65
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,780
And very few people, I mean, have come back and tried to really piece it together.

66
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,420
When I say very few, a few half dozen or so.

67
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,780
And by the way, I appreciate all the messages and feedback.

68
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,980
I mean, occasionally you'll get another or two.

69
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:37,620
That's fine.

70
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,960
But essentially it's all been very positive.

71
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:49,380
I would suggest, though, that going back and listening to what has been said, there's over 100 hours of archives somewhere.

72
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,480
Well, specifically on Uncommon Radio website.

73
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,700
But that is not being held there.

74
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,300
That is just provided by others.

75
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,840
So if someone else wants to take down the archives, if it's at AFR or anywhere else, I have no control over that.

76
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,300
So if you do like something, I suggest downloading it.

77
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,860
And there's going to be more projects and discussions.

78
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:17,460
But I would suggest at this point, if one were to, let's say, subjectively categorize what's been said as a test,

79
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,540
just like a litmus test against society, you're all failing really miserably.

80
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:28,320
Now, I'm not in a position to degrade anyone in that respect because I believe that grading is very degrading.

81
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,620
Most people do not know what the learning process is or anything like even resembles a learning process.

82
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,640
It's just memorization and subjectivity at this point.

83
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:45,380
And like I've said before, if one presented real education in a systematic sense to humanity right now,

84
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,680
it would never work because no one would recognize it as such.

85
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:55,060
So, I mean, if you've ever listened to the discussions, it's very easy to see the terminal state of humanity.

86
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,540
And basically, people are unrehabilitatable.

87
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,020
Basically, they're all on a truck.

88
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,600
And if you tell them where they're going to the dump, they don't want to believe it.

89
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,740
And that's just their problem.

90
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,800
So, this goes for the entire group.

91
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:21,940
But there's always a very small exception that has looked for clarity amongst the vileness that has been on this planet for so long.

92
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,460
And inherently, people were made a certain way.

93
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,320
It's their behavior and their influence that they have allowed upon themselves that have allowed them to go down the path that they are.

94
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,960
Let me give you a couple of examples.

95
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:40,560
When you go to the various media and educational streams, informational streams, whether they be religious,

96
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,240
mainstream media, alternative media, formal education, informal education,

97
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:56,580
the level of discussion and subject matter is so trivial and so far away from what is really affecting the reality that you partake in,

98
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,780
meaning food, clothing, shelter, your very existence, your history and all that.

99
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:09,360
It's so far removed that it is just – one has to consider with amazement that anything still at all functions and there is any rational thought at all.

100
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,980
And I can say that sarcastically.

101
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,400
There's very little rational thinking at this point.

102
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:22,000
But the various hints that have been given have been taken to heart by some, meaning that's how you remember things.

103
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,140
And mostly, I would say it's just not time yet.

104
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,460
But that's an interesting thing also because you are in that time right now.

105
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:33,780
How many people even know what time is?

106
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,960
Don't even bother, right?

107
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,679
But here's the thing.

108
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:45,140
You are in a time period right now where you're probably going to have till next spring what you call 2018 on the Pope's work schedule,

109
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,120
a situation where you will see it is not much different than the past seven years.

110
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,300
But it will go by very quickly.

111
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,180
I've described to a few in private why.

112
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:01,360
It's a very interesting thing, almost like reading tea leaves in a sense, how this could potentially be the fastest year in history,

113
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:09,560
starting another cycle, a double cycle, which will pretty much lead to the – let's see.

114
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,220
How would you say it?

115
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,660
Admittance of the mop-up crew.

116
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,260
So who's the mop-up crew, right?

117
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,780
It's funny sometimes having discussions with people.

118
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:24,180
If they really guard what they think they know emotionally, whatever crap it is,

119
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,460
whenever you start bringing up something that kind of cuts through that crap, they stop listening like,

120
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,160
well, where did you get that?

121
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,840
Where did you get that?

122
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,620
Who told you that?

123
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,200
It's like they just can't sit there and even have the information communicated.

124
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:43,440
Or on the other hand, it just comes out like the Peanuts characters, Charlie Brown, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah,

125
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,920
like it hurt my brain, Greek.

126
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,280
So again, much of what has been said over the years has been to a very, very small group of people,

127
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,260
I'd say a few thousand people on the entire planet,

128
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:01,140
which is not deemed or does not deem any sort of, let's say, functional institution or venue for this kind of information.

129
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,480
It is not for these surface-dwelling earth inhabitants,

130
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,800
even though there is some, let's say, substantial response momentarily, but they just hear it.

131
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,460
They like it.

132
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,100
They just touch themselves and forget about the whole thing, talking about a very base existence right now.

133
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:28,320
But I just want to bring up the – there's an issue that is going on where there's a level of hypocrisy to a point where –

134
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,040
let's just use industry as an example.

135
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,260
See, in industry, when they pose a public problem, they do it just to satisfy some emotional outcry,

136
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:45,080
but they really don't want the solution because there's no, quote, unquote, gain in having the solution.

137
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,560
You see, it's much better to keep the problem going on.

138
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:56,120
So what you typically are going to find, again, using the educational alternative mainstream streams, university, whatever,

139
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,120
the things that come up of concern that get people's brows raised are the ills of humanity,

140
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:10,780
and they're always blaming politics or some bad chemistry or what else would it be?

141
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:18,040
Whatever other reactionary cause du jour of the day, and it's just funny to see that.

142
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:24,220
There's an old Texas saying, they couldn't even pour piss out of a boot if there was instructions on the heel.

143
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,300
Think about that.

144
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,920
That's like for you guys or gals with King James.

145
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:33,220
Well, if King James Bible was good enough for the apostle Paul, it's good enough for me.

146
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,040
Yep, that's the mentality.

147
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:41,240
So you're not going to do well as a society, but you're being taken for a ride by the gods,

148
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:47,560
and I want to talk a little bit more about that because there's something discussed in some ancient writ about

149
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,040
there's nothing new under the sun.

150
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,740
All things that are, were, and just memory of them have has been lost.

151
00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:03,360
So there is a unique aspect to communication when it's done by the gods, and by the way, there is a struggle with that,

152
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,080
but with that meaning information that comes from a higher source, and of course you've got the ridiculous aspect of it.

153
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:17,100
It essentially comes from the new age of your pagan aspect of reality that mankind's been under for thousands of years.

154
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,500
Pagan just means ignorant, by the way, or lately it's been this fashion cause.

155
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,780
You wear dark sunglasses at night and paint your fingernails and toenails black,

156
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,780
and you wear your hair a certain way and you're pagan.

157
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,220
It's great.

158
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,560
It gets the girls just like the polyester bell bottoms did in the 70s, and they like that.

159
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,880
But I'm not talking about that.

160
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,120
I'm talking about the reality of the duplicity of things.

161
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:47,540
But there is a struggle to get information from what has been, let's say, from a higher vantage point from the gods.

162
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,860
It's all been memorialized, but I find that people like to invent things about it

163
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,840
because they just fail to admit or are not aware of the cosmic censorship,

164
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,260
and I keep, lately I've been giving more in-depth analogy about it.

165
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,180
But it's better to know that you're censored and not know than just to say that no one knows

166
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,460
or this is what I believe or these are the facts.

167
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,800
Just think about that for a moment.

168
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,220
If you don't understand what I just said, you catch it on archives and rewind it a little bit,

169
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,560
if there is such a thing as rewinding digitally.

170
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,580
But typically, what you're going to see in the world, whether it's your college professors,

171
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:30,300
your mainstream or alternative media pundits, your newspapers, your little preacher or imam or rabbi down the street,

172
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,620
what they're discussing is basically irrelevant and reactionary,

173
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,340
and typically you will find them to be a poor character.

174
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,500
If you want to define what poor character is, go ahead and do your own search on that.

175
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:57,060
And this gets a little tiring after a while where you find that this subjectiveness of just poor quality tripe everywhere you go wears you down.

176
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,620
So I would just say that I want to thank people also.

177
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,340
I've got a bunch of emails, and when I get the same message repeated several times, I just bring it up.

178
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,240
I've got a couple of messages that alluded to,

179
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,640
thanks for bringing some fresh air to this garbage can they call the internet or whatever, and that's true.

180
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,120
I mean, if you enjoy it, that's good.

181
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:27,640
I enjoy showing up and imparting and giving a good report if possible or trying to, but it is quite a trash can, I should say.

182
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:34,880
And you once gave an analogy that it's really unnerving, especially if you tell someone who's never eaten at a fine restaurant,

183
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:42,320
you're going to go take them to eat there, but on the way to the fine restaurant, you can't stop them eating out of a garbage can.

184
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:42,980
What do you do?

185
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:48,820
Eventually, you're like, maybe I shouldn't be taking this person to that five-star restaurant anyway.

186
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,120
So there's a lot of interesting analogies.

187
00:14:52,940 --> 00:15:00,860
But I think can't pour piss out of a boot even when the instructions on the heel is the best one informationally that you folks are getting right now.

188
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:09,860
So what I want to just do maybe is connect a few dots and show maybe a few perceptions that could be garnered as help,

189
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:17,580
so let's say because you're in a sea adrift of just nonsense at this point still, and this is nothing new.

190
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,340
I'm not either happy or unhappy about it.

191
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,720
I know the way things are supposed to be until they're not.

192
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:30,580
But going back to the way things are, were, but memory of them has been lost.

193
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,960
People think that this is fairly new, the situation that they're in.

194
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:46,460
And by the way, shame on the elders of your society and shame on them because they're not providing any workable experience or knowledge as they could have in the past.

195
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:55,400
Not that they did in the past, but the elders are supposed to be collected enough good information and imparted it.

196
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:02,360
Anyway, if you've been around any of them, you know now why they slap diapers, drugs, and throw them in a nursing home.

197
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,700
It's sad, but is it well-deserved?

198
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,880
Yeah, I'd say it is at this point.

199
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,120
You're not getting much from your elders anymore, and it's just really sad from that point.

200
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:22,960
But the things that are coming back is this world concept dominance, and I'm going to discuss it a little bit more because everything is sort of global.

201
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,240
And a lot of the hints that I've been giving over time, maybe I'll just piece a couple of things together.

202
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:40,920
Now, the reoccurrence of things, when you look at, for example, ancient writs, it is not exactly how it's being done, but that it's being done.

203
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:47,980
So when you look at something like, for example, the internet, what is it?

204
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:54,220
It's pretty much very rapid communication, audio and visual, pretty much throughout the planet.

205
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:02,000
This was done before, but not necessarily the way it is being done now, but the end result and the end product is the same.

206
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:17,440
For example, when you read in a war of high casualties in ancient battles, or you read of high casualties in modern battles, the way the casualties were rendered are different.

207
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,380
You might have projectiles fired chemically with high-speed chemistry known as bullets and gunpowder,

208
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:29,100
and in the past you might have had still some high-speed chemistry, but typically bows and arrows and spears and things.

209
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,900
But the casualties are the same.

210
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:45,200
So when you look at things that have been memorialized, they are more result-oriented than what you might call reactionary detail, but there is also both.

211
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,940
But I would suggest the latter, meaning that the end result is what you're looking for to be memorialized.

212
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:58,100
So one thing that you will find in this time that humanity is in right now, I would suggest, is the credits part of humanity.

213
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:08,120
What's interesting, again, just to give the metaphor, during the credits part of the movie, no one gets really upset when people are talking or blocking their view of the screen,

214
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:15,300
and pretty much you get to see a lot more than you did before, but it seems like no one really cares about what's going on anymore, and this seems to be the idea.

215
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:21,200
Now, this is not a reflection on your leadership, because your leadership has always represented the people.

216
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:27,380
The gods put the leaders over the people, not the people.

217
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:33,500
It just gives the illusion as such, and even on a secular level, which is what I'm going to discuss right now,

218
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,860
how it parallels what the gods are basically instilling on humanity.

219
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:50,400
And if you are of any conscript or of any religion at the moment, you will not understand anything I say, I assure you of that.

220
00:18:50,440 --> 00:19:01,880
So if you consider yourself Jewish, Catholic, Buddhist, New Agey, Muslim or whatever, you will not understand a dang thing I'm saying, because you are – anyway, you get the picture.

221
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:12,980
Or Christian or any of those major religions, you won't understand anything, because in order for you to pick that and go down that route and be devout and allegiant to something like that,

222
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:19,260
you are way far beyond the tide, because those institutions are set up to distract you and dummy load you,

223
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:28,320
because simply your purpose in life for most people is just to show up to fulfill a number, and the thing is what you do with it is something different.

224
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:38,780
So that's why, for example, if you try to have a discussion, of course it will be – people that are interested in politics and all that are of poor character.

225
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:49,320
So you have to remember that you're going to be going into that kind of feeding trough, and if the swine swaller isn't good, they complain, but they'll eat it anyway.

226
00:19:49,320 --> 00:20:01,380
But if you go into what's called a political discussion today and you try to discuss the state of the nation as it is legally and lawfully, you will lose the morons you're discussing anything with,

227
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,460
and they're just going to wonder if you're a Republican or a Democrat, if you get that metaphor.

228
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:14,860
I'll give you an example. The US has been in receivership since the 30s. It's bankrupt. How come there's no discussion on that?

229
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,840
We're not talking about debt. There are a lot of idiots out there talking about money as debt.

230
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:24,900
But I think I said earlier what's going on in this planet Earth. You've got 7.5 billion sick spirits.

231
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:38,280
I want to get back to the parallels that mankind is manifesting as end result terminals of things and how they parallel other things and maybe give some insight.

232
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:46,980
Before I do that, I want to give an analogy I gave on an interview recently regarding an old Persian story about water.

233
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,940
There was a man who was visited by an angelic being and told him,

234
00:20:53,040 --> 00:21:02,500
�You better start storing up water from the spring in some cisterns and vases because soon the water will be removed from the Earth and everyone will be thirsty,

235
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:10,880
but when the waters are brought back, anyone who drinks those waters will go insane, so you should drink from the water that you stockpile now.�

236
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:17,600
So the man did that, stockpiled water, and he noticed that all the waters on the Earth had receded and gone away, all the drinkable water,

237
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:25,780
and everyone was quite thirsty for a few days, and then the waters came back, and he noticed that whoever had drank those new waters had gone insane.

238
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:33,580
But when he had gone into the world to deal with these people who had all drank this water, who had not stockpiled, let�s say, water that wouldn�t make you insane,

239
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,900
they thought he was insane, so he kind of got a little belabored and tired of being in that status,

240
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,420
so he drank some of the water that they did, and now he was considered fine.

241
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:52,340
So I think it has a little more oomph in the original language, but you get the picture.

242
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,980
So I just want to go back to the things that are going on today that no one is really discussing,

243
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:10,940
but it takes a certain character that will find things are questionable or right and wrong or of good taste or of bad taste,

244
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,300
and right now it seems like that has gone away and anything goes.

245
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:29,100
There�s a technical term called Coprophagia, and that�s what you�re running into when you are on this planet these days.

246
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,820
So I�m not going to get into what that means, but you could look it up.

247
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:40,580
But what�s interesting here is what you will find is you�re going into a paradigm shift that everyone has been talking about,

248
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:46,020
but of course if they read the instructions, they�d know when it was or how it was.

249
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:51,660
It�s not the way it�s been discussed, and the shift is going to be what you�re going to be focusing on.

250
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,060
But in the meantime, what you�re being set up on is quite interesting,

251
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,260
and I�ll be just bouncing around various aspects of society,

252
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:08,680
but one of the things to look at is, as I said earlier, do you recall when I said that evidence doesn�t matter anymore?

253
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:14,320
It seems like having to convince someone of the evidence is ridiculous.

254
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,520
People will like to just go where it is reactionary and emotional, and it�s just quite lovely.

255
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,640
I do like the way that makes me feel. I believe in that.

256
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:30,460
So if you�ve had anyone or any dealings with the legal society, they don�t care about evidence.

257
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,700
Now I�m not talking about the duplicity and the satanic aspect of it,

258
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,220
where of course everything is just twisted and just downright evil.

259
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,260
I�m talking about on a cursory level, people just don�t care about evidence,

260
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,160
and the next thing is they don�t care about testimony at all.

261
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,860
He said, she said, well, that�s your opinion. It doesn�t matter.

262
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,020
So what�s been going on with what is called, for example, the legal society,

263
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,100
which is tied into the medical society, which is tied into the scientific society,

264
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,160
is discrediting human testimony.

265
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,980
They have lie detector tests. My favorite is DNA testing and genetics.

266
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,480
Now most people are so naive that they actually think that is a true science,

267
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,920
DNA and genetics and chromosomes and all that.

268
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,560
What�s interesting is I discovered the majority of people who put faith in that

269
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,360
don�t know anything about it, just like everything else apparently.

270
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,400
Just because I�ll give the analogy here and I don�t want to go into the scientific fraud of it,

271
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,060
because anyone who�s worked in the field wants to protect their job,

272
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,040
because they don�t know how anything works anyway, so they want the security.

273
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,420
But the majority of them, especially near retirement, will say,

274
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,280
it�s my whole life, everything I�ve been working is a fraud, but I made good money at it,

275
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,680
so it doesn�t matter. Very few of them will actually admit it that way,

276
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,900
but enough do it that you know that that�s what�s going on.

277
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,940
If you have two brain cells rubbed together, you could read the paperwork that the scientists put out

278
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,360
and you�ll see that it�s irrational and just made up.

279
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,660
But the thing about DNA and genetics and things like that that are being used against the people,

280
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,660
basically have just been planted and lodged in the legal society.

281
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:19,560
It almost has no effect in any other aspects of science in terms of being the markers that they say they are.

282
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,560
Now you might say, well, Greek, what about the genetic manipulation for crops and things like that?

283
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,160
I�ll give the analogy of what they�re doing.

284
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,340
A certain group of people with white lab coats can go to a house and break all the windows

285
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,240
and put a big hole in the roof so no one wants to live there anymore.

286
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:41,260
But they don�t know how to build a house, if you see the analogy.

287
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:45,560
Just because they can alter the mitochondria enough,

288
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:49,040
actually they�re reviving ancient methods, they don�t know it,

289
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,420
doesn�t mean that they know what they�re doing.

290
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,800
There�s people putting their faith in this ridiculous stuff like black holes and the cosmology

291
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,060
and the worldview that�s being put out by the scientists.

292
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:04,420
There has never been a darker group on this planet other than the legal society,

293
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,740
the medical society and the scientific society.

294
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,460
When I mean darker, I mean dark.

295
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,280
You folks will discover it, but when you do, it�ll be kind of late.

296
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,840
You�ll have other problems to deal with that those things will be of irrelevance.

297
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,040
I just want to keep the thought going.

298
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:27,120
No one is actually making a point that why is human testimony,

299
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:31,900
like when someone says something as testimony, let�s say,

300
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:36,360
or evidence is provided, why is it not being considered?

301
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:41,840
Now, I�m not saying it is being done every time, but I�m saying most of the time.

302
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,420
Why is it that what�s called opinion is rationalized as truth or fact?

303
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,240
Think about that because you�re going into a time period.

304
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,060
That time period, by the way, let me just sum up a few concepts here.

305
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,600
What all of you humans consider sacred, the gods think are totally shit.

306
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,680
Not because I�m speaking for them, because I�ve looked into it.

307
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,680
Think about it for a minute.

308
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,640
Whether you�re banging your head in Jerusalem against a wall,

309
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:16,040
which you think is a temple, but is actually an ancient Roman Syrian fort,

310
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:23,300
or whether you�re reviving an ancient sex temple with a long-haired guy nailed to a cross wearing a diaper,

311
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,740
or whether you�re bowing down and praying to a cube somewhere,

312
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,760
or a little fat man that you burn incense to,

313
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,160
and all this stuff you guys have been doing, the gods are sick of it.

314
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,820
How do I know? The same way you know.

315
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,840
Look it up. It ain�t got nothing to do with faith.

316
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,440
Just stop being so reactionary.

317
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,940
You guys, here�s the thing.

318
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,660
You could lie to your children. That�s not really good.

319
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,100
You could lie to each other and inject each other and kill each other,

320
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:57,440
but the minute you step into the spiritual realm and start misrepresenting the gods,

321
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,240
you�ve kind of like changed the venue and the severity of things start to change.

322
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,280
But no one wants to really talk about that because you don�t even know it exists.

323
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,760
You have no access to that.

324
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,220
Of course you do.

325
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,880
But you�re censored.

326
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,460
Anyway, it sounds kind of complicated.

327
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,040
But the main thing that people have not been able to discuss for some reason,

328
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,960
I�m bringing these things up now for the first time after years,

329
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,060
but I�ve just been thinking about these things and wondering.

330
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,720
I�m tired of talking publicly.

331
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,740
There�s no intelligent life here at all.

332
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,140
Seven and a half billion psychopaths you�re going to get through?

333
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,100
Nah, ain�t going to happen.

334
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So no one is really discussing why human testimony and evidence has been discredited wholesale.

335
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,400
Why? Think about it.

336
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,640
I mean, several examples.

337
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,340
I�m not talking about assassinations who shot Roger Rabbit or all this other stuff,

338
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:58,320
but you can get something even talked about, 9-11 movement and all that.

339
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,000
Forget about it.

340
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,140
I mean, I�ll just say this.

341
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,500
I don�t say it often, but human society is so pathetic at this point

342
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:11,360
that a certain group can get away with exploding 350 kiloton underground nukes in New York City

343
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,100
in broad daylight on TV, broadcast to the whole world, and hardly anyone noticed what happened.

344
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,440
I mean, think how ridiculous society is at this point.

345
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:27,720
So anyway, just the very aspect that the reality that�s been created,

346
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:34,700
let�s say the monumental civilization on this planet, whatever you�ve built and all that,

347
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:41,700
but the value of your testimony and evidence, whether to prove something false

348
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,720
or whether to prove something true, is irrelevant.

349
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,620
You don�t have much of a future based on that kind of a posture.

350
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:55,300
The other thing I want to bring in is, do you ever notice there�s this thing called security?

351
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,480
In the �90s, I was told by someone to make sure you got a good credit score

352
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,480
because the security industry in the next decade is going to be booming.

353
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,360
I�m like, �What are you talking about?�

354
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,720
I�m like, �Well, you better make sure that if you want to make some good money in the 2000s,

355
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,080
you better get into the security business.� Well, how did they know?

356
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,200
So the interesting part, when you hear the term security,

357
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,680
it has nothing to do with someone breaking in or hurting someone.

358
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,940
It has to do with money, securities, because it�s a credit-based economy.

359
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,760
What everyone is looking for, meaning those who know how the credit-based economy works,

360
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:37,020
which is pretty much no one on the internet, by the way, is looking for securities constantly.

361
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,260
So whenever you hear about national security, it has nothing to do with what you think it is.

362
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:47,340
You can thank the legal society for the play on words because it�s based on the love of money,

363
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,920
and there is no money. It�s the love of money.

364
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,040
But the thing that ties into the security concept, which seemingly no one can discuss,

365
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,980
well, why would you?

366
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,800
You ask anyone what money is and watch that blank stare,

367
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,580
and if money is debt, how can you pay a debt with a debt?

368
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:08,920
And then they get the look on their face like a baby seal right before they get clubbed.

369
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,700
Yeah, welcome to planet Earth.

370
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:18,720
Now, this security thing has been tying into what people are calling the surveillance society.

371
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,700
Yeah, it�s like, oh, we�re living in a surveillance society.

372
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,800
I think England rates really high or London, like everyone there gets their picture taken a few hundred times a year.

373
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:28,540
Okay.

374
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,240
Do you think this is going to lead into anything, folks?

375
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,460
Is it going to be like a 1984 reality, some draconian spy thing or whatever?

376
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,820
Nope, it�s not.

377
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,180
I mean you have a lot of parallels to something like 1984, actually Brave New World even,

378
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:49,000
and I�ll talk about the babies coming into this world soon if I can be reminded of it.

379
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:56,840
But the interesting part is that what no one is noticing at all about the surveillance society is, well, here�s the thing.

380
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,500
How can they notice when they don�t have any concept of the gods?

381
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,080
Let�s just keep it really simple, like second-grader stuff.

382
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,420
You have humankind and you have the gods, right?

383
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,940
And by the way, for you Christian folks, I don�t think you want to listen to this because you think there�s only one, right?

384
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,620
Sorry.

385
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,020
There�s a hierarchy there, and you�re not going to get it out of KJV or any of those other English translations

386
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,780
because why would they give it to you?

387
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,360
Don�t you think they actually evaluated the people before they put those documents out?

388
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,580
But anyway, let me ask you, can you do anything in private when the gods are around?

389
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,080
You might think you are, but you can�t.

390
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:41,740
So what you�re being prepped for, I think if you�ve ever heard any kind of Greek speak,

391
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,960
you�ve got roughly about a decade and a half left before the mop-up crew comes in.

392
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:50,120
Mop-up crew just means they�ve put 10 surface-dwelling earth inhabitants in a room right now.

393
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,540
Only one of you is going to be around, right?

394
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,300
And then you�re not going to be special.

395
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,140
They just take a representative sample.

396
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,600
So I wouldn�t say it�s random, but I wouldn�t say you�re that special either.

397
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:11,120
So what you�re being prepared for is eventually, and this is not doom and gloom, folks.

398
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,520
Eventually, you�re going to have the overt presence of the gods and angelic beings on the earth.

399
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,160
You�re being prepped for that.

400
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:24,580
Now if you think you are going to a police state that is being dragged into some form,

401
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:30,180
let�s say some inertia into this cosmic dictatorship or whatever,

402
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,480
yeah, it is, but it�s not going to turn out that way.

403
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:42,780
But is the future open for having private affairs and doing what you want because it feels good

404
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,260
as long as you don�t hurt anybody else?

405
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,140
How many times do you hear that?

406
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:45,740
Nope.

407
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,660
That�s not in your future, humanity.

408
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,260
Sorry.

409
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,260
I�m not asking you to believe it.

410
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:56,780
But I want you to hear it and file it away because you can�t say later, I didn�t hear it.

411
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,200
So the interesting part here is this.

412
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,640
What you are being shown are precursors of a future society.

413
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,140
Yeah, you�re going to get a little bit of dictatorial,

414
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,600
which means to basically tell someone else something.

415
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,420
Dictatorship isn�t bad unless it�s a bad dictatorship.

416
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,860
It�s called dictation.

417
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,520
It means it�s kind of taken from the word despot.

418
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,739
Well, it�s not taken from a word.

419
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,420
Another word would be despotic, meaning bad.

420
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,900
That just means bishop in Greek.

421
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:30,520
But anyway, there�s a level here of lack of objectivity on what�s going on

422
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:37,280
because the purpose of what you folks see as the cause does not exist

423
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,440
because the key motivation behind most of what you are witnessing is the credit-based economy.

424
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,239
All the people have the credit.

425
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,960
None of the agencies or corporations or leadership does,

426
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,639
and they need to get it from you without letting you know you have it.

427
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,340
So they�ll make up anything.

428
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,139
It�s a debt, it�s a this, it�s a load, it�s a whatever.

429
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,760
Here�s the thing.

430
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,940
You�re never going to understand how money works,

431
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,680
but fortunately, never will be up over soon.

432
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,420
You�re never going to understand how the human body works

433
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:08,600
and you�re never going to understand how the physical world works

434
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,580
and you�re never going to find out what�s in outer space.

435
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,380
And I mean never meaning in the measly little society that you have right now.

436
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,880
Very simple to see that.

437
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,300
So back to the surveillance society, you notice how there�s a lack of privacy now.

438
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,780
If it�s important to be private amongst humans,

439
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,280
but you cannot garner privacy through the gods, then what the hell does privacy mean?

440
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,940
I think the gods are a little more important than humans.

441
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:41,540
So you�re being shown this evasive aspect.

442
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,920
By the way, most of the world, by the way,

443
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:52,280
has accepted a law form from a revived goddess religion known as justice or justicia.

444
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,260
What do you know about the revived goddess religion?

445
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,520
Nothing, right?

446
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,120
Yeah, I know.

447
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,040
And you probably won�t know much either about it until never is over.

448
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:01,620
Why?

449
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,780
Because you just have to pay attention to what�s obvious.

450
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,520
I think the last thing to discover is the obvious.

451
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,240
So what you�re being essentially just a couple of points here

452
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:15,020
where your testimony means jack shit, evidence means jack shit,

453
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:20,320
and you�re under a surveillance society, right,

454
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,500
which you don�t know jack shit about as a human race

455
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,600
because you don�t know jack shit about the money system and you never will

456
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,680
or the human body or this or that.

457
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,960
Yeah, it�s a jack shit planet, isn�t it?

458
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,460
But the thing is to say this because I know there�s a few people out there,

459
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,000
a few or four or five out of the 7 billion or so that might be helped by it.

460
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,420
What you�re being shown is a precursor of man�s society to come but in small steps,

461
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,440
kind of like a child.

462
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,860
You don�t go to the hardware store and get him a full 16-ounce hammer.

463
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,200
You give him a little plastic one so he can hit you on the head with it.

464
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:53,640
It�s okay.

465
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,280
That�s what you�re getting right now.

466
00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:00,180
But when you have an overt presence after the mop-up crew on this planet

467
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,860
of angelic and spiritual beings,

468
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,700
it will be a police state that you could never imagine,

469
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,180
meaning you will be policed in very high order

470
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,400
because the earth is kind of tired of your crap.

471
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,140
Now, the reason why your environment is in such poor shape

472
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,440
is not because you pollute rivers and make a lot of plastic things.

473
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,720
It�s because the way you behave to each other

474
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,040
and that�s what�s going to be policed.

475
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,740
So you�re being set up and you don�t see it.

476
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,100
It�s just pathetic how you don�t see it.

477
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:29,980
I mean as a race.

478
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,300
And here�s the thing.

479
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,860
It�s not a matter of blaming the people.

480
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,660
Everyone wants to represent the people and say,

481
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,180
�Well, they don�t know. Their leaders have been misled.�

482
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:38,880
That�s not the point.

483
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,820
I�m just stating the condition of it.

484
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,320
And yes, of course, there should be a repugnant feeling

485
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,080
towards those leading you and educating you spiritually

486
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,620
and secularly and scientifically, legally and medically.

487
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:50,720
Of course.

488
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,980
But they don�t know either and they don�t care.

489
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,180
So you�re all apathetic to the cause.

490
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,160
But I would say that most of the stuff

491
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,640
that you folks are complaining about,

492
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,880
which you will never know anything about,

493
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,060
is kind of being described here as a precursor

494
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,460
to how man�s society will be in the future.

495
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,840
And when I say the surveillance society

496
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,100
and you will have no privacy,

497
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,780
you do not understand really what I�m discussing

498
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,240
because the light in which those topics have been put in right now

499
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,840
is not the light that it�s going to be in in the future.

500
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,360
It�s going to be in a much different sense

501
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,100
because at that point you will no longer be subject to death

502
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,680
and entropy as you are now.

503
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,140
In other words, when a baby is born,

504
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,320
you will be going through puberty.

505
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,300
That child probably won�t get its second set of teeth or puberty

506
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,500
until it�s 40 or 50 or late 30s or something like that.

507
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,120
And life expectancy will be in the 100s.

508
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:45,920
So this is not anything to really go down that road.

509
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,240
More details on that will be discussed in the future in private.

510
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,900
That�s the purpose of a podcast or something like that

511
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,900
which you should look for if you�re interested

512
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,120
on probably the next moon, the fourth moon,

513
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,760
which is the middle of the year by the way.

514
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,980
So remember it might be the fastest year in history.

515
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:08,880
But the other thing that you�re not considering at all

516
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,060
is this waiting room status by the way.

517
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:13,720
You know what I mean?

518
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,720
You ever go to a place that�s important

519
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,860
and they never take you when they tell you they will

520
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:21,460
so they have you sit and wait and you flip through a magazine?

521
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,420
You ever notice how people sit at a waiting room,

522
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,380
they pick up a magazine and they always flip it

523
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,640
from the back to the front.

524
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,560
It was actually a magazine marketing company

525
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,600
that discovered this phenomenon that was quite consistent

526
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,680
and the magazine was Tassi, T-A-X-I.

527
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,020
It was out of Italy and they decided to have two front covers.

528
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,840
I guess you could sell more premium advertising that way

529
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,060
because they noticed people flip from the back to the front.

530
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,580
It�s not like reading from right to left

531
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:54,260
or going from the back to the front and no one is noticing.

532
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,560
But the waiting room is interesting because you know you�re there.

533
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,840
You�re not complaining about your time being wasted

534
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,900
because you�re there because there�s something important coming next

535
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,820
and this is the situation that you�re in right now.

536
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,660
In the meantime, you�re being dummy loaded.

537
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,940
If anyone that�s gone to university,

538
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:15,480
by the way if you know anyone who is a product of that system

539
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,580
called university or a professor,

540
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:20,940
do me a favor and have a little conversation with someone there.

541
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,360
Don�t be too serious.

542
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,800
Don�t let them know that this is not a setup,

543
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,780
but don�t let them know how you feel just about anything.

544
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,240
Just be neutral and say,

545
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,760
�Is it possible that anyone with more than an 8th grade education

546
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,580
has done irreparable damage to themselves?�

547
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,040
99.9% of the time or all of them that I�ve ever met say yes

548
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,720
and they don�t even realize that they have more than doubled in that.

549
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,520
Here�s your evidence, but it doesn�t matter what they say

550
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,500
because I think I just went through the suggestion

551
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,280
which is more than a suggestion in air quotes

552
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,860
that evidence in human testimony means nothing.

553
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,400
It�s been substituted with scientific fact which is fraudulent.

554
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,420
You�re not going to do very well.

555
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:09,620
Of course, those points I wanted to bring up

556
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,880
because these things are in society and that are completely misunderstood.

557
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,720
The thing I don�t want to harp on but I�ll bring up again

558
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:19,240
is the credit-based economy and you will never understand it.

559
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,160
How do I know that?

560
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,140
Because I listened to all the idiots talking about money on the internet

561
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,320
and in university and none of it is true.

562
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,580
How do I know none of it is true?

563
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,720
All you have to do is functionally examine it, but no one does.

564
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,540
What does that mean?

565
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,500
It means that it goes back and hearkens that the love of money

566
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,600
is the root of all evil, not money.

567
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,620
What the gods did is they took money away,

568
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,680
left you with a credit economy and you�re still going after it

569
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,440
as if it has something of value.

570
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,600
What the value of the credit-based economy is

571
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,820
that you�re all supposed to work together,

572
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,480
but no, you can�t do that because you need law for that.

573
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,820
But how are you going to all work together

574
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,320
when you�ve been pranked in the crib?

575
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,880
Crib is really where they put animals,

576
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,400
but let�s just say when you�re still in swaddling cloth,

577
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,060
your own parents have pranked you,

578
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,800
but then you want to get a microphone

579
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,600
and talk about how the politicians are bad?

580
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:15,640
Okay.

581
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,920
Anyway, I think we went back to the PSY prefix.

582
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,480
So, or write a newspaper about that?

583
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,960
I don�t think so.

584
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:30,260
I think a little bit of self-examination maybe on the information.

585
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,220
Don�t examine yourself.

586
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,740
That gets pretty scary, but examine what you�re thinking about.

587
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,220
That gets even scarier sometimes,

588
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,860
but at least it�s once removed.

589
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:47,640
Now, the thing about what do you do with this information?

590
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,420
Well, ultimately, do you know what efficiency is?

591
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,640
It�s the opposite of losses, right?

592
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:58,340
Now, how efficient is it to look at the dummy load

593
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,420
that you folks look at where you get your information,

594
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,160
whether it�s university media, any media,

595
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,420
or written word, or parents, friends, or whatever?

596
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,600
When you�re getting dummy loaded,

597
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,180
you have this esoteric feeling called worrying.

598
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,920
Have you ever heard of worrying, I�m worried?

599
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,020
I mean, it�s sort of in the same category as love.

600
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,920
People don�t know what to do with that.

601
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,020
It�s like, well, let�s just go ask somebody what that means.

602
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,720
Oh, really? You�re going to go far with that on this planet.

603
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:26,260
But I would suggest that these esoteric feelings

604
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,380
that you folks kind of get entangled in

605
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:29,740
and you like to talk about and vent,

606
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,700
I mean, esoteric is more than just touching yourself

607
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,140
and go, �Ooh, I like that.�

608
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:34,980
I�m not talking about that.

609
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:37,020
I�m talking about going to the next level with it and like,

610
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,640
�I don�t know why I feel this way, but I don�t like it.�

611
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,180
Or, �I don�t know why I feel this way, but I like it.�

612
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,980
Right, that�s not efficiency, folks.

613
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,080
So give me an example on that.

614
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,560
It�s established that there�s a Middle East union

615
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,380
that�s coming into the world

616
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,880
where everything is going to be based, sort of a hub out of it,

617
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:59,460
and the entire world is going to be able to supply material

618
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,680
and moral support and financial support, ethical support,

619
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,540
meaning they�re all going to pretty much give the nod that,

620
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,520
�Yeah, this is the way to do it.�

621
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,880
How is a country like, let�s say, the U.S. or Russia or whatever,

622
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:16,740
how are they going to provide support and backing

623
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:19,960
for a functional, let�s say, loose confederacy

624
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,280
of ten nations in the Middle East

625
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,900
when they�ve just finished World War III

626
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,300
and they�re all destroyed or governments have collapsed

627
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,200
and society has collapsed?

628
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,480
How can they do it? They can�t.

629
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,980
So there ain�t going to be none.

630
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,000
There ain�t going to be none.

631
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:34,100
There ain�t going to be no collapse like you guys have been primed for.

632
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,320
Fortunately, that�s gone away a little bit more lately than it�s been around.

633
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:45,820
So how are you going to be in complete catastrophe

634
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:49,100
and support a rise of ten nations in the Middle East?

635
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,060
Can it have both?

636
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,320
So if it�s been established in the past

637
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,520
that this loose confederacy of ten nations is coming,

638
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:01,600
you ain�t going to get much, let�s say, substantial destruction

639
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:02,940
until after that�s formed.

640
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,600
So now you can live a little more efficiently, I would suggest.

641
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,200
So we�re going to be coming up on a break in about 15 minutes,

642
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:15,480
but I�m going to give you folks a little bit of a music break right now

643
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,160
and let�s just see if it comes through well.

644
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,560
I will be back in one minute.

645
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,040
Sunday, Monday, happy days

646
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,520
Tuesday, Wednesday, happy days

647
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,000
Thursday, Friday, happy days

648
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,500
The weekend comes, my cycle hums

649
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,640
Ready to race to you

650
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:35,940
These days are ours, happy days

651
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:41,340
These days are ours, share them with me

652
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:44,220
Red light, grey sky, yellow, blue

653
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,800
There�s nothing can hold me when I hold you

654
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,240
You�re so right, you can�t be wrong

655
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,700
Rocking and rolling all week long

656
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,220
Sunday, Monday, happy days

657
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,740
Tuesday, Wednesday, happy days

658
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:09,240
Thursday, Friday, happy days

659
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,660
Saturday, what a day

660
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,740
Grooving all week with you

661
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,480
These days are ours, share them with me

662
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,520
These days are ours, happy and free

663
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,160
These happy days are yours and mine

664
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,980
These happy days are yours and mine, happy days

665
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,880
That�s a happy days theme by Trap Music Now.

666
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,260
It�s a YouTube video, and there you go.

667
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,740
If it sounds good, it is good.

668
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,140
I hope you enjoyed that.

669
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,060
Essentially, why aren�t things being put together?

670
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,180
I don�t want to keep going down this list

671
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,980
because I think more of the hardcore stuff

672
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,840
which should be done in private,

673
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,340
but I would suggest that the majority of you

674
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,360
are so dummy loaded and so pranked

675
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,660
by your own people, meaning your family,

676
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,640
your friends and all that,

677
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,140
whatever institutions you have allegiance to

678
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:07,660
and all that, that you can�t see straight.

679
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,940
You�re going to have to figure that out.

680
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,700
You�re so cross-eyed and bow-legged

681
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,880
that you can�t go down the street

682
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,880
and even read the sign.

683
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:21,880
There�s really not much to do to the public at large.

684
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,660
You pretty much got what you deserve

685
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:24,540
because you deserve it,

686
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,760
and the gods have put it in place.

687
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,160
All of your world leaders are fine.

688
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,080
The toxins in your water, your skies being sprayed,

689
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:33,680
all this stuff is because of the way

690
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,380
you treat each other.

691
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,060
It�s not being done to you out of the blue,

692
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,960
but you don�t know what that means

693
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,760
and you never will.

694
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,140
I don�t want to say the never

695
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,620
that you�re existing in right now

696
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,900
or the ever that you�re existing in right now.

697
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:49,660
You won�t see clearly, but that�s fine.

698
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:51,600
You just pretty much came here

699
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,620
and you got your job done.

700
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,560
You showed up, didn�t you?

701
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:56,580
It�s 90%, but you don�t know

702
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,700
where the ship is going, do you?

703
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:01,380
I would suggest that there�s an aspect of reality.

704
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,400
Let�s just say it backwards.

705
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,360
The majority of the aspects of reality

706
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,780
have still gone unnoticed

707
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,480
because the last thing for people to discover

708
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,340
is the obvious.

709
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,280
You�re not going to pretty much discover much

710
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,300
because of just simply the poor character

711
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,480
that�s been lodged into humanity right now.

712
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,100
How do I know humanity is a very poor character?

713
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,440
The same way you know, by examining it.

714
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:25,680
It�s very simple.

715
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,620
I would suggest at this point

716
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,400
maybe changing the subject matter slightly

717
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,320
only because there�s just so much to discuss

718
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,460
to go down this road.

719
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,860
Again, like I mentioned,

720
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,500
you�ve been so subject to the dummy loading

721
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:42,920
and the pranking.

722
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,680
One aspect of that would be,

723
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,440
the dummy loading is just useless information

724
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,440
and typically it�s what people of poor character

725
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,140
are interested in.

726
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:53,720
The pranking is typically ludicrous tricks

727
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,600
that have been put on you

728
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,720
and you can also include in that

729
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,560
the slightly esoteric concept

730
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,100
of motivation by penalty.

731
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,560
Oh, if you don�t do that, you�re going to jail.

732
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:07,360
Have you heard that?

733
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,120
Now, here�s the other part about it

734
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,800
that makes it just really difficult.

735
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,740
Right now, you�re at a point

736
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,060
that one-third of the population on the earth

737
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,460
is just downright either pranksters

738
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,120
or supporting the pranksters,

739
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,200
being it Millie, in full allegiance.

740
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,720
The other third are doing all the work

741
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,300
and trying to figure out

742
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:33,340
how to keep things organized

743
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,940
through their daily chores or whatever.

744
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,180
And the other third are just here taking up space.

745
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,640
So we�re talking about, I don�t know,

746
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:46,180
roughly $2.5 billion taking up space,

747
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:47,700
$2.5 billion doing all the work

748
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,020
and $2.5 billion pranking.

749
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,220
Do you see much of a future or hope in that?

750
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,320
You�re funny.

751
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:55,860
Anyway, if you think you do.

752
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,680
Let�s say we got a message.

753
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,660
Let�s see from Skype.

754
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:02,220
This is also from, I think, Mr. M.

755
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:03,860
Thanks for reading out.

756
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,020
I know there�s a lot of dummy load info in this.

757
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:07,740
Any clarity in this helpful?

758
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,960
The reason there�s so many experts out there,

759
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,060
okay, for doing, okay.

760
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,220
Let�s just take a second here, folks,

761
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,260
and pull the good stuff out.

762
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,320
Maybe it�s all good.

763
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,980
Okay, this person is just thankful.

764
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,660
I would just say that the definition

765
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,880
of an expert or professional

766
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,320
is someone who�s always learning more and more

767
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,600
about less and less.

768
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,680
The problem that I see with humanity

769
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,240
is they can�t notice the obvious.

770
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,920
I think I mentioned again,

771
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,740
just to divert from the previous subject matter,

772
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,880
the cosmic censorship,

773
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,780
which I even had a discussion with someone today

774
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,360
that I frequently speak to.

775
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,420
They wanted even more clarity on it,

776
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,240
and that�s really interesting.

777
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,040
I said, well, you�re going to have to settle in on it

778
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,840
because it�s better to know that it exists

779
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,280
and not know much about it

780
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,480
than not know it exists

781
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,140
and know anything about it even.

782
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,080
Well, how can you know anything about it

783
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,280
if you don�t even know that it exists?

784
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,480
But the latest metaphor that I�ve been given,

785
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:02,260
and I�ll give it again,

786
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,240
which reminds me of an email

787
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,580
that was attached to this question,

788
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,580
is cosmic censorship would be a reality

789
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,920
that is obvious in front of you,

790
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,920
information, let�s say processing ability,

791
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,020
perception, and the gods have sealed it,

792
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,940
and they put a seal on it.

793
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:19,180
Remember those old wax seals

794
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:21,520
or just imagine tying it closed or sealing it,

795
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:22,960
and you bring it to someone

796
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,420
and you suggest they look at it,

797
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,300
and they say,

798
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,700
�Well, I can�t see it because it�s sealed.�

799
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,440
But then you bring it to someone else

800
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:29,980
and they say,

801
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:31,400
�Well, I can�t read it anyway

802
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,300
because I�m illiterate.�

803
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,380
And then they bring it to someone else

804
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:34,520
who says,

805
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,460
�Well, you know, I can�t see.

806
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:36,900
I�m blind.�

807
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:39,140
So what I try to give by that metaphor

808
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,060
is that it�s not that simple.

809
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,600
There are many types of people

810
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,200
and different types of conditions.

811
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,040
There are those that cannot see at all,

812
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,380
and then there are those who can see

813
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,600
but cannot discern,

814
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,960
and then there are those that can see and discern,

815
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:54,960
but they cannot discern because of the block,

816
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,620
the actual block,

817
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,420
and they see that it�s stopped at this point.

818
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,160
What�s interesting about it,

819
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,760
a very healthy prediction,

820
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,820
is this is the last year of business as usual

821
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,980
for the past seven years.

822
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:12,180
What I mean by that is the past seven years,

823
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:12,480
let�s see,

824
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,640
you�ve had in the media dummy load

825
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,960
and also the educational dummy load

826
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,380
kind of factors in current events,

827
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,060
and you had missing airplanes,

828
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,040
complaints about corrupt politicians,

829
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:25,620
threat of economic crash,

830
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,860
and also someone I recently did an interview with

831
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:28,580
says and rape.

832
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,200
So this has been the reoccurring themes

833
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,120
for the past seven years if you look at it.

834
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:34,440
So this year you might have

835
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,120
a couple more political controversy.

836
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,000
Of course, the people of poor character

837
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:38,780
are going to love that.

838
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,080
It�s food for them,

839
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:41,960
and then you�re going to have, of course,

840
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,600
the missing airplane again.

841
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,220
I suggest there might be another one,

842
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:50,140
and the category again of some idiot

843
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:52,760
talking about a financial collapse by midsummer,

844
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:53,140
I bet,

845
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,200
and if you ask them what money is,

846
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,360
all they say is debt,

847
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,980
because they go into this catatonic state

848
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,900
like someone who has severe brain damage,

849
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,260
which anyway,

850
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,760
I just don�t want to describe everyone

851
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,760
on the planet now, do you?

852
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,860
So you�re going to have some time this year

853
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,300
to pretty much sit back

854
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,000
and look at all the dummy load,

855
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,940
and yes, you will be dummy loaded.

856
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:16,840
It�s planet Earth.

857
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,940
I�m thinking of doing a rating.

858
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,420
It�s pretty simple,

859
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:24,060
a rating where the rating will be dummy load,

860
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,320
DL like in the movies.

861
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,800
They have the two-letter rating,

862
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:27,400
one-letter rating.

863
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,540
Then we�ll have the DLF rating,

864
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,140
which is dummy load free rating for the internet,

865
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,080
but you don�t really need to do that

866
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,800
because if you said it�s all a dummy load,

867
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,380
it�s pretty accurate at this point.

868
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:39,920
I just want to state something about that.

869
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,780
Back in the early days in the internet

870
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:44,260
when there was more just HTML and all that stuff,

871
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:46,960
you could go back and if you have an old computer,

872
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,900
fire it up and try to see how most of that stuff is gone.

873
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,800
Yeah, forget about Wayback Machine,

874
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,300
a lot of computer programmers say,

875
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:54,160
�Oh, I�ll find it for you.�

876
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:54,860
They can�t find it.

877
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,700
Yeah, there�s some really good stuff on the internet at one point,

878
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,720
but that purpose of the internet is not to inform you.

879
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,900
How are you going to be informed

880
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:06,140
if you have no credence in what anybody says anyway?

881
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,700
Anyway, one thing I want to bring up also beside the dummy load

882
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,340
is what you will be noticing

883
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:18,470
is the loosening of this consistent stupidity

884
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,420
for the past seven years

885
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:24,100
into another level of stupidity coming in the next seven years.

886
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:26,000
We�ll talk a little bit more about that

887
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,220
when we come back from the break.

888
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,980
Greetings and welcome to the second half

889
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:35,300
of the twelfth solo episode

890
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,820
and the final episode of Public Speaking,

891
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,800
let�s say, of the Greek on American Freedom Radio.

892
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,200
For you folks out there,

893
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:43,920
I know that the majority of the people do

894
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,140
get this signal and this transmission

895
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:49,080
and this archive and this episode

896
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,160
somehow down the line on what�s called an archive.

897
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:54,040
If you are hearing this sometime in the future

898
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,040
and you do feel generous,

899
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,260
and if you feel even overtly generous,

900
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,400
go ahead and send them something.

901
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:02,580
American Freedom Radio is looking for donations constantly.

902
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,120
They are funded basically by whatever means

903
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,120
they can find from the listener

904
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:11,520
and maybe some endorsements here or there,

905
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,980
which I�m not sure even funding,

906
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:16,940
but send them at least a going-away present

907
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,060
or a gift of appreciation

908
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,900
for having the sense of having the Greek

909
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,440
on Common Radio.

910
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,100
Here�s the thing, folks.

911
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,600
The only reason I�m saying what I�m saying

912
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,000
is because no one else, A, is saying it,

913
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,620
and B, if later on some of the things

914
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,540
are found to be critical

915
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,920
and people find out that,

916
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,120
�Greek, you knew this and you didn�t say anything,�

917
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,220
well, I�m kind of clear of that now.

918
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,140
In the meantime, you guys are on your own,

919
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:42,040
but in the meantime,

920
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:43,780
we don�t want American Freedom Radio

921
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,620
to be on their own,

922
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,060
so please go ahead and send a donation.

923
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:49,500
I know that the listeners that listen on Common Radio

924
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,160
tend to be of the generous sort,

925
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,040
so if you find that this has helped you in any way,

926
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,720
you can return the favor because, remember,

927
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:01,080
it�s being done on American Freedom Radio.

928
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,860
Like I said, thank you very much

929
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:10,360
for all of the contributions you folks have made

930
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,200
to American Freedom Radio in the past

931
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,020
and for those that you will make,

932
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:19,060
and also thank you for the feedback that you�ve sent,

933
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,680
both good and bad,

934
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,240
even though there�s been very little on the negative side.

935
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,160
I mean, why should they?

936
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:28,460
Because the interesting aspect about this kind of discussion

937
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:31,780
is that, in a cosmic sense,

938
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,700
most people can�t hear what�s being said.

939
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:36,400
Well, they kind of hear it,

940
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,660
but they can�t listen to it.

941
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:41,000
It�s a very interesting thing.

942
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,300
It�s almost another language.

943
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:45,680
It kind of ties into a different part of the brain,

944
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,320
if that matters at all.

945
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:52,940
But nonetheless, especially on archives,

946
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,880
if you hear this again and again and again,

947
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,860
throw a couple of shekels towards American Freedom Radio

948
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:00,380
and we�ll see how they pan out in the future.

949
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,240
I wish them the best of prosperity

950
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,020
and the best of good fortune in this field,

951
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:09,820
which I�ve talked about many times.

952
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,140
With that said, I just wanted to go back.

953
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,340
This is the last hour, I should say,

954
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,640
or what�s left of it by the wind-up toy known as the clock,

955
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:23,300
which no one seems to have figured out

956
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,560
or in any objective way either.

957
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,960
Now, I just want to mention this.

958
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,780
These things are obvious,

959
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,260
but you folks don�t discuss them at all.

960
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,400
I don�t know why.

961
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,580
You folks meaning the 7 billion lot of 7.5 billion.

962
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:40,260
It�s interesting how the inventory of the space heaters,

963
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:42,020
I�ve defined what a space heater is before,

964
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:44,780
and if you�re listening to this in archives,

965
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,920
it is sort of cumulative.

966
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:50,140
But the space heaters are inventoried by the World Bank,

967
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,740
if you ever wonder, which is not a bank either.

968
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:54,280
Yeah.

969
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:57,640
Okay.

970
00:57:58,180 --> 00:57:59,980
You know, you are biological creatures.

971
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:06,180
In other words, you have a container that makes you you.

972
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,120
Visibly, you look different.

973
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,180
Everyone looks slightly different or very different,

974
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:14,900
but your internal organs tend to be pretty close matches

975
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,940
except for other things known as blood types and things.

976
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,180
But there is very little discussion on the biological

977
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:24,720
or the zoic or bios or living aspect.

978
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:28,500
There�s only discussion about the dead chemical aspect of it.

979
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,180
Let me just say what that means.

980
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:38,440
Your knowledge base of the human body is based on a bunch of devils

981
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:43,240
in white lab coats in ivory towers telling you that you�re made up

982
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,680
of a chemical soup and cells.

983
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,240
Yeah, you get the point.

984
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,080
Where do they get that information from?

985
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:53,740
From studying life or studying death?

986
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:54,960
The latter.

987
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:00,460
Don�t they take samples and cells and things in the lab

988
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,640
and aren�t they removed from a living host?

989
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:03,760
Yep.

990
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,680
And you say, �Greek, are you saying that they shouldn�t do that?�

991
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:10,700
Well, no, they can do that, but they shouldn�t only do that.

992
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:14,800
Ask any of these scientific morons what it takes to get up

993
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,840
and walk across the room.

994
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:18,740
I�m not talking about building a robot with hydraulics, but you.

995
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:20,280
And they don�t know.

996
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,640
And they won�t know until the society wraps up.

997
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,740
So let me just give an example.

998
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,020
Some of the things that are going to be discussed in the future in private

999
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:33,340
is can you imagine grabbing a red-hot piece of iron where your flesh

1000
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:36,900
is ready to fall off and do a couple of things where the next day

1001
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,220
it just looks like you basically got a little bit of a sunburn?

1002
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:40,740
Think about it.

1003
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:46,260
Or being able to go into an ICU, intensive care unit of a hospital,

1004
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,360
and having someone go home the next day?

1005
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:49,700
Think about it.

1006
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,100
I�m not talking about making the cripple walk in the blind sea,

1007
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,120
but that�s possible too.

1008
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,400
But could you imagine if you talked about how to do this publicly?

1009
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,780
All hell is going to break loose, right?

1010
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,420
Anyway, I just want to put it out there that these things are possible

1011
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:04,840
and will be discussed.

1012
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,420
And why is there an exclusivity on the way the human body works?

1013
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,280
And why is there no discussion on how the human body works?

1014
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,300
How come a shame on all the medical doctors and the alternative media,

1015
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:21,460
shame on you, should be a shame to yourself.

1016
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:22,900
Why?

1017
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:24,120
Two reasons.

1018
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:27,800
One is you show up with the title, which is ridiculous.

1019
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:28,960
It�s a social rank.

1020
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:34,480
And second, if you�ve worked in the medical field as a doctor,

1021
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:38,880
haven�t you had at least two brain cells to rub together to figure out

1022
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,540
that things don�t work the way you�ve been told?

1023
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,680
Show me how the body absorbs anything through the intestines.

1024
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,800
Anybody could do rudimentary research on that and see.

1025
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:55,140
Go to anatomy on whatever search engine and study a drawing of a drawing,

1026
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:58,940
right, of the human intestine or any animal intestine.

1027
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:00,640
Show me how anything gets through those walls.

1028
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:07,680
So shame on all you alternative types where you�re offering your social ranks

1029
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,120
of ridiculousness.

1030
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:13,580
All you do is cry about vaccines and stupid stuff.

1031
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:15,520
Dummy load.

1032
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:16,680
That�s okay.

1033
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:17,620
I mean, that�s fine.

1034
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,080
Does that social rank require respect?

1035
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:23,860
Yes, it does.

1036
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:28,380
And credence, if someone says they�re a doctor or whatever, yes, it does,

1037
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:30,200
but objectively.

1038
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,220
But if you subjectively look at it, which you folks like being subjective,

1039
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:39,780
and you actually start looking at it, you�ll see that it�s just pulling rank

1040
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:40,140
on you.

1041
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:44,160
But if you go back to it objectively again, you�ll see that they�re talking

1042
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:44,780
nonsense.

1043
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,380
They don�t know anything.

1044
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,200
And they�re showing up offering you guys alternatives.

1045
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,160
It�s supposed to be better.

1046
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:51,820
Alternative means a better choice.

1047
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:57,680
You have none at this point regarding that field, and it�s just shameful.

1048
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:03,560
So anyway, I just thought I�d put that out because occasionally,

1049
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:06,120
I try to look up current events.

1050
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:11,360
I�ll go to alternative radio and alternative websites and that thing they call

1051
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,840
YouTube and all that, and it�s just trash.

1052
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,800
Sorry, guys, on the level of information.

1053
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:21,920
So if anyone out there has the ability and the training in the medical field

1054
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,340
and knows really how the human body works or can at least discuss it in simple

1055
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:29,380
terms where it could benefit others, please do so because it�s not being done

1056
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:29,860
right now.

1057
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:32,260
It�s just a suggestion out there.

1058
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:40,160
All of your health websites and all this other stuff, not going anywhere with it.

1059
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:41,640
There�s no future in that.

1060
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,640
And I think that people are getting tired of it.

1061
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:48,160
An interesting thing that I also do in current events is the aspect of religion.

1062
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:51,260
What�s interesting, I brought this up in comment with someone in a recent

1063
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:51,720
discussion.

1064
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:55,480
They noticed it as well, how many people are going away from the religious

1065
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:59,900
aspects, and I think I�ve discussed this, the religious institutions and aspects of

1066
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:01,280
society, all of the religions.

1067
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:04,680
I mentioned this almost a decade ago how this will be happening.

1068
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,040
Before we went to the second hour, I said, �Well, you�re going to be going into

1069
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:14,740
another dummy load starting after this year, and the dummy load is going to be

1070
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:20,360
particularly part of the setup.� In other words, you�re really going to be

1071
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:27,960
tossed about certain geopolitical events beyond what�s going on right now.

1072
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:32,240
Let�s say a level of carnage that you�re not used to in what�s called the Levant

1073
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:38,400
area or the Middle East, which is going to be put on you by the gods, of course, so

1074
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:41,840
things can start changing even more at a rapid pace there.

1075
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:46,440
The reason I�m calling it a dummy load is because you, earth inhabitants, are going

1076
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:50,400
to get your panties in a wad and wrapped up in a tizzy about what�s going on, and

1077
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,060
I really don�t want to be around to hear any of that bullshit because the hypocrisy

1078
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:59,760
on that, like for example, you Americans, you have at least half a million children

1079
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,780
gone missing every year without a peep from the authorities or the people, very little,

1080
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:09,740
and you have about a million plus people being basically exterminated by the medical

1081
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:12,640
community and not a peep about that directly.

1082
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:18,780
You�re looking at a minimum of a million and a half people in the U.S. alone that are

1083
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:23,300
pretty much thrown in the trash and no one really cares because that�s anyway.

1084
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:31,720
You�re going to be crying about tens of thousands next year or the year after, so just

1085
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:36,480
think about that for a minute, but actually don�t think because it�s something new

1086
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:36,740
to you.

1087
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:46,600
Anyway, the prospect of the dummy load for the next seven years is going to be the willingness

1088
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:53,680
and acceptance of peace and what�s called peace and prosperity in the Middle East and

1089
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:58,760
a loose confederacy of ten nations, which only nine exist right now, and if you�ve

1090
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:02,720
heard any cumulative discussions from the Greek, one of them is missing and it�s coming

1091
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,660
on the scene in northern Iraq.

1092
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:09,400
It�s going to take a little bit of land from Syria and Turkey, yes, and it�s going

1093
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,440
to be called Assyria.

1094
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:17,380
You�re going to see some very dynamic relations between what�s called Israel and Persia or

1095
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,580
Iran, which are the two superpowers.

1096
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:24,920
A lot of people like to bring up Saudi Arabia, but they are of irrelevance at this point.

1097
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,180
They really are if you look into their history.

1098
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:36,140
Now, there�s another aspect of it is that cosmically, meaning the world, you are also

1099
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:42,340
going to be set up with a level of optimism that you have never had before and that kind

1100
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:47,900
of optimism only comes when the perceived trial and tribulation or again that esoteric

1101
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:50,500
feeling called worry has run out.

1102
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:54,680
You�ve run out of energy and you just can�t worry or stress anymore.

1103
01:05:54,680 --> 01:06:00,720
You could call it a breaking point where you just don�t want to do that anymore, be

1104
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:06,540
under stress or lies or whatever and you start getting this optimism because you feel like

1105
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:13,640
it�s all behind you and that will take hold in human consciousness and that will be in

1106
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:18,620
full swing by the mid-2020s, roughly around 2025 on Pope�s work schedule.

1107
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:23,380
By the way, you folks will be not in mass right now, but in the future, you�ll be

1108
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:28,560
questioning that as well, what is lawful timekeeping because just to go back to what I was discussing

1109
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:33,220
about the ridiculousness of how the human, you�re basically not getting information

1110
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:37,960
on how the human body or anything living works, mainstream or alternative university or anything,

1111
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:46,560
that it has a bearing on biological timekeeping or biological or real timekeeping.

1112
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:54,440
I recently had a discussion with a typical human moron and they were talking about all

1113
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:57,340
this stuff that was supposed to be really good information.

1114
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:58,460
I was like, �Wait a second.

1115
01:06:58,540 --> 01:06:59,520
That�s not going to help anyone.

1116
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:03,700
Do you even know what day it is?� They were like, �Well, just because I don�t know,

1117
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,040
I don�t do it the way you do it.� I�m like, �Wait a second.

1118
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:12,620
The way I do it?� I mean, it�s the way I do it because the whales, the tigers, the

1119
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:16,800
ants, the moon, the stars, the planet, the ocean, the fish do it.

1120
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:17,760
That�s my way now.

1121
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:19,280
What are you talking about?

1122
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:26,580
This is the type of idiocy that you�ll find still and that will go away to a certain point.

1123
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:31,540
People are going to start to realize that events on the planet cannot be measured using

1124
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:33,180
the ridiculous Pope�s work schedule.

1125
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:40,560
By the way, people haven�t really been thinking.

1126
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:45,300
Maybe it�s a little too much, but when I say the Pope�s work schedule and the timekeeping

1127
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:49,060
will be considered, let me just give a little hint because it doesn�t seem like the hints

1128
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:52,580
a little bit more than a hint because hints don�t really work anymore it seems.

1129
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:58,960
I think you just got to come out and say it over and over, but when the Pope�s work schedule

1130
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:03,420
known as the Gregorian calendar starts to go adrift and people start to realize that

1131
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:07,000
it�s kind of a fraud, what else is attached to it?

1132
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,580
Do you guys want to maybe think about that for a minute?

1133
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:16,600
What else is attached to that funny work schedule thing, Monday through Friday, January through

1134
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:17,000
December?

1135
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:19,140
Think about it.

1136
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:20,859
I just have to bring it out.

1137
01:08:20,939 --> 01:08:24,160
I�m not going to talk about it, but there�s a lot of attachments.

1138
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:24,979
Do you know what I mean?

1139
01:08:24,979 --> 01:08:31,040
That�s not computer lingo, but other things are measured by that arbitrary system.

1140
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:36,140
I didn�t quite say it, but I just expanded the hint.

1141
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,060
Combine that with what people consider to be the abandonment of their religious causes.

1142
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:49,300
When I say religious causes in the Middle East right now, there�s the �Muslim terrorists�

1143
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:49,720
and all that.

1144
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:55,279
Those guys are all drugged up and brainwashed or in it for the money.

1145
01:08:55,899 --> 01:08:57,819
They basically steal from each other.

1146
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:04,899
I think I�ve also mentioned in an interview recently that that is a world war that�s

1147
01:09:04,899 --> 01:09:06,140
going on right there right now.

1148
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:09,479
It is not a Syrian revolution or civil war.

1149
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:14,420
You have loosely a dozen countries involved.

1150
01:09:15,180 --> 01:09:18,760
The way it�s being packaged and sent to you, but you�re so apathetic, it doesn�t

1151
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:19,060
matter.

1152
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,740
Actually, you�re in the world war right now.

1153
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:28,000
It�s like all these things happening and it doesn�t really matter.

1154
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:34,960
You�re going to see this dummy load that�s coming on is going to guide your attention

1155
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,819
towards that part of the world.

1156
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:40,200
You�re pretty much going to run out of steam with all the bullshit that you�ve been fed

1157
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:41,500
for the past few thousand years.

1158
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:44,660
I�m not that old, Greek.

1159
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:45,680
What do you mean a few thousand years?

1160
01:09:45,779 --> 01:09:46,600
You get the point.

1161
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:51,500
The infrastructure is going to start to not crumble but change.

1162
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:57,300
Remember, folks, this is all a setup because before the mop-up crew comes back and does

1163
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:00,320
due diligence, they have to do it lawfully.

1164
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:05,380
If you folks don�t know why they�re doing it or not in accordance, like in other words,

1165
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:13,780
you�re not situated in a way that they can�t perform the mop-up here, the cleanup, it doesn�t

1166
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:14,160
happen.

1167
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:19,740
Anyone who rides the trains or the public works, usually when the train or the bus reaches

1168
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:27,020
the end of the line, there�s pretty much no one on and then the crew comes and cleans

1169
01:10:27,020 --> 01:10:27,280
up.

1170
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:33,860
But this one, imagine where the crew comes to clean up the bus while the people are still

1171
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:34,360
on it.

1172
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:42,960
In other words, what you are going to be is kind of how you were in the beginning.

1173
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,920
The power base of humankind is going to be in the center of the earth where it used to

1174
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,920
be and you know where that is, Middle East.

1175
01:10:52,100 --> 01:11:00,460
Now, in the meantime, what�s very interesting to watch are the very subtle plays, power

1176
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:05,140
moves, political, geopolitical, financial and when I mean financial, I�m not talking

1177
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:06,680
about what you think money is.

1178
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,520
It�s not debt.

1179
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:10,300
I�m talking about the credit aspect of it.

1180
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:14,000
By the way, wherever you go in the world, it�s interesting how all humans have this

1181
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:14,480
in common.

1182
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:17,320
They don�t understand what credit is.

1183
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:24,180
One of the main things is the cosmic censorship, the aspects to block you from understanding

1184
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:24,920
what money is.

1185
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,720
It�s just fantastic to watch because it�s just like such proof positive that you�re

1186
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:32,340
being blocked by non-earthly forces.

1187
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:42,480
It�s very simple once you�re made aware of it but those that are on the heavy end

1188
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:46,060
of the cosmic censorship, it just doesn�t even come through like any language they can

1189
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:49,120
hear and that�s the majority of the people.

1190
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:50,840
Anyway, you�ve been around people before.

1191
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:52,140
You know what I�m talking about.

1192
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:58,600
The power plays and the geopolitical moves that you see right now like I mentioned financially

1193
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,680
also that are happening in Asia.

1194
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:05,600
When I say Asia, the entire Pacific Rim and let�s say what�s called Mainland China

1195
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:10,000
and all that, this will also come into a deeper understanding in the future.

1196
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:16,860
When I say that the middle of the world, meaning the center mass of the earth is the continent

1197
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:24,940
of Africa, Eurasia and India, that entire mass there is going to pretty much support

1198
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:30,860
in a satellite fashion a loose confederacy in the Middle East.

1199
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:36,780
You�re going to see this accelerating as time goes on but things are being put in place

1200
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:37,140
right now.

1201
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:42,600
For example, China is almost reviving a new Silk Road or an old Silk Road or something

1202
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:50,220
and you will see support mechanisms being put in place, not just what�s called financial

1203
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:53,940
but also ethical and moral support.

1204
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:01,300
Whatever that means to you, I mean it loosely meaning it�s even less tangible support

1205
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,080
than financial support and material support.

1206
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:09,460
There will be in the minds of the people when this loose confederacy of ten nations just

1207
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:12,020
come around, they will get the thumbs up.

1208
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:17,260
They will not be opposed to by the majority and you�re all being set up for it which

1209
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:18,760
is kind of funny to watch.

1210
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,340
Now, how much of this can change?

1211
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,380
Well, there could be a lot of changes on a reactionary level which we don�t really

1212
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:30,520
know because the interesting thing that�s conveyed to us about what�s going to happen

1213
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:35,220
in the future which anyone can access, memorialize in ancient Ritz, is that we�re always given

1214
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:45,780
either the sum result or we�re given very little on the causes but let�s say of other

1215
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:52,520
cumulative results into a big sum result and that�s why it�s easy to garner what�s

1216
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:53,420
coming in the future.

1217
01:13:54,560 --> 01:14:01,080
I just wanted to suggest that anyone is a prophecy buff or whatever, if you want to

1218
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:04,140
know what�s coming in the future and you think you�re going to get it from a psychic

1219
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:07,460
or whatever, you�re not really going to get it.

1220
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:13,420
All you religious types that are talking about prophecy just need to do something else, go

1221
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:17,860
to the movies or whatever because if you�re subscribed to any of the world�s religions,

1222
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:22,300
you will not comprehend any of the ancient Ritz.

1223
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:23,660
That�s an assurance.

1224
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:25,600
It�s very simple.

1225
01:14:26,180 --> 01:14:32,540
Also, there is a tangent community that is going away finally, I see in prominence and

1226
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:34,080
of course, it�s part of the dummy load.

1227
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:39,840
Have you heard of the Zeitgeist stuff like the son of God is the sun in the sky or astrotheology

1228
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:48,420
or astrology or the Mayan prophecies or all this just rubbish stuff that�s just going

1229
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:48,880
away.

1230
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:51,220
Thankfully, you can see it has no prominence.

1231
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:57,860
It�s perfect for the typical human but not good for those that are seeking objectivity.

1232
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,340
Anyway, Gnosticism, by the way, is another one.

1233
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:11,300
I just wanted to bring up a couple of other points.

1234
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:12,760
I don�t remember what they are.

1235
01:15:13,120 --> 01:15:16,660
I think they jotted them down somewhere and I can�t find the list.

1236
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,540
I think it was just stuff from the emails.

1237
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:25,020
Instead of cutting a swath through everything there, I think I made some notes and I just

1238
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:25,740
can�t find them.

1239
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:28,140
That�s probably okay.

1240
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,100
Let�s see if someone is sending a message.

1241
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:35,120
I want to remind you about babies and Brave New World you talked about in the first hour.

1242
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:36,840
Thank you very much, DT.

1243
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:40,960
Jack shit everywhere.

1244
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:43,100
Where can I find a place where there is no jack shit?

1245
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,660
I don�t know what to say.

1246
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:46,960
I want to throw rocks.

1247
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:47,300
All right.

1248
01:15:47,780 --> 01:15:49,980
I�m not the one throwing the rocks at the geneticists.

1249
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:50,740
Okay.

1250
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:56,880
The babies, what�s interesting is consider this to be the last generation, folks, but

1251
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:01,280
not the way that you religious types � well, forget about the religious types.

1252
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:06,020
If you�ve gone down the religious road, anyway, you won�t understand anything I�m

1253
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:06,300
saying.

1254
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:11,660
But this generation right now that�s being born in the middle, the little young ones,

1255
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:15,580
the ones that are even six months old now, let me just come out and say it.

1256
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:21,600
This is contrary to the � by the way, they call them the astral children and all this.

1257
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:26,460
These little children that are being born now, they have some very, very special qualities

1258
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:26,900
all right.

1259
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:31,300
Let�s just come out and say they�re probably going to be the most evil manifestation of

1260
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,920
humanity that this world has ever seen.

1261
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:38,900
Now, it doesn�t mean in a Hollywood type of evil because most people don�t even know

1262
01:16:38,900 --> 01:16:39,840
what good and evil is.

1263
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:41,240
They don�t even know what love is.

1264
01:16:41,240 --> 01:16:45,940
They don�t even know why in nature and living things, cold rises and heat descends.

1265
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:53,900
They�re going to be evil in a way that when this society goes into a fervor by the late

1266
01:16:53,900 --> 01:17:00,500
2020s where you�ve already all believed this thousand-year golden age is going to

1267
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:03,880
be going on, that�s what you�ll be convinced of because you�ve already achieved world

1268
01:17:03,880 --> 01:17:05,480
peace, many other things.

1269
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:12,520
These young, let�s say adolescents are going to be kicked up and moved up into positions

1270
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:17,180
of prominence and they�re going to be implementing things that you only considered adults would

1271
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:19,980
before and I just wanted to bring that up.

1272
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,400
So, the little prick that you see in the crib right now is going to probably try to cut

1273
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:26,080
your head off with a butter knife in 10 years.

1274
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:26,900
What did I just say?

1275
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:27,620
Never mind.

1276
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:28,700
Scratch that from the record.

1277
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:33,320
Yeah, it�s going to get pretty silly and pretty sad and you�re not going to have some

1278
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:36,220
government crackdown or whatever.

1279
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:39,860
It�s going to be family against family within the family.

1280
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:42,120
That�s going to be one hell of a sight to see.

1281
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:47,280
I don�t want to be around when that�s going on by the way, when you folks decide that

1282
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:48,980
it�s a good idea to start killing each other.

1283
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:56,340
That�s why sometimes when I give a metaphor like around that time, you want to be at least

1284
01:17:56,340 --> 01:17:58,820
three days walking distance from everyone.

1285
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,620
It�s not what you think it is.

1286
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:09,280
Actually, having discussions and putting out information and people looking at things lawfully.

1287
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:14,220
I�ve had people even come back and say, �Listen, what you�re saying is true and

1288
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:17,120
correct because I see it right now.� I�m saying, �No, no, no.

1289
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:19,600
You�re seeing the precursor to it right now.

1290
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:23,860
You�re not seeing what I�m saying right now at all.� I�m not asking anyone to

1291
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:24,800
believe what I�m saying.

1292
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:27,740
I�m just saying that file it away.

1293
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:28,900
That�s all it is.

1294
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:30,620
I�ve done my due diligence.

1295
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:34,320
You can�t come back later and say, �Greek, you knew about this and you didn�t say anything.�

1296
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:38,360
At this point, if you folks want to make paradise on earth, you�re all on your own.

1297
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:40,420
I�m still going to stay away from you.

1298
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,520
If you all want to kill each other, you�re all on your own.

1299
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:43,660
I�m going to stay away from you.

1300
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:50,920
I�m telling you right now, there is no objectivity out there in the world, none, none at all

1301
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,380
regarding things that matter.

1302
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:53,640
How can you?

1303
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:56,620
The character of humanity is so poor.

1304
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,480
Those that you look up to have very poor character.

1305
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:02,700
You can�t even make sense of even how your money system works.

1306
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,900
You don�t even know how the human body works.

1307
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:10,620
You can�t even discern natural energies that are formative between those that are

1308
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:16,680
decomposing, meaning a cold that rises and a heat that descends is a characteristic of

1309
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:18,680
natural formative energies.

1310
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:24,840
A heat that rises and a cold that descends is a characteristic of disintegrating energies.

1311
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,180
You can�t discern anything, folks.

1312
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:28,940
You don�t even know what day it is.

1313
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,800
So that�s why, let me just go back.

1314
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:37,200
I�ve had discussions with people and say, �So, Greek, that�s our culture that you�re

1315
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:41,300
talking about there.� Yeah, that�s your culture that�s going to destroy you, but

1316
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:42,140
it�s not going to destroy you.

1317
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:43,020
The gods are going to do it.

1318
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:47,120
The reason why they�re going to interrupt, by the way, is because if they don�t, in

1319
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:51,480
less than 50 years, anyone that tries to have a baby is just going to give birth to this

1320
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:52,500
lump of cancer.

1321
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:55,080
This is the rate that you�re going.

1322
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:59,720
You don�t see it now, and you probably never will because thankfully or unthankfully, you

1323
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:00,520
will be interrupted.

1324
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,540
Now, this is not doom and gloom.

1325
01:20:02,860 --> 01:20:05,600
This is just kind of like having a tooth pulled, by the way.

1326
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:10,760
You kind of don�t want to have the tooth pulled because it kind of hurts, but if you

1327
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,320
leave it in there, it�s not good either.

1328
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:20,220
So you�re not in a situation where you can comprehend what I�m saying in the import

1329
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:23,800
of its terminalness because you don�t understand anything.

1330
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:26,920
You never will, by the way, anything around you either.

1331
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:32,300
When I say you, meaning this is the population at large, if we�re speaking through a bullhorn

1332
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:37,360
like this cosmic bullhorn to 7.5 billion people, what I�m saying is extremely accurate,

1333
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:43,800
but there are a very, very, very few 4, 5, 6, maybe 10 people that could probably get

1334
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:46,320
what I�m saying and do something with it.

1335
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,880
The main thing is to live a life of efficiency.

1336
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:52,140
Don�t spin your wheels.

1337
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:57,040
You ever notice, by the way, it�s really easy to crap on the religions of the world

1338
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:01,420
and the institutions because that�s what they�re made of, but you ever notice that

1339
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:06,020
these people that have all these altruistic concepts and they�re so spiritual, you ever

1340
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:09,980
notice how they always give either a political reason for their flaws?

1341
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,860
You ever notice how Christians in America are so political?

1342
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,740
What happened to their god?

1343
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,840
It doesn�t even have a name.

1344
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,140
They can�t even go down that route or any of these religions.

1345
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:22,840
They�re just idiotic to the max.

1346
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:27,140
You ever notice how they always blame some chemical for their problems?

1347
01:21:28,240 --> 01:21:30,880
Like they�re being sprayed in the sky like roaches.

1348
01:21:30,980 --> 01:21:34,380
You ever think if you stop acting like roaches, you may not get sprayed like roaches?

1349
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,780
Anyway, what does that mean?

1350
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:39,400
You�re scurrying about in the dark, aren�t you?

1351
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:43,340
Even in broad daylight, you�re in the dark because everything you think about is dark.

1352
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:45,320
Your time is based on the dark.

1353
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,800
Everything you�re interacting with is garnered from materials in the dark.

1354
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,720
You start your year in the dark.

1355
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,300
Your moon is dark.

1356
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,240
Your day starts in the dark.

1357
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:04,120
Anyway, so at this point, it�s just useless, but what is useful about � well, it�s

1358
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:08,820
useless to discuss the useless, worthless aspects of society which is pretty much where

1359
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:09,200
it�s gone.

1360
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:13,300
The most useful thing to do is be efficient about it.

1361
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:17,180
Look, if you went on a field trip to the landfill, you�re not going to bring suntan

1362
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:20,980
lotion and lay down on top of fish skeleton and banana peels, are you?

1363
01:22:21,500 --> 01:22:25,160
I think you�re going to wear some protection and if you�re walking on a lump of garbage,

1364
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:28,860
you�re going to want to clear off, take notes or do whatever you do that you�re

1365
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:30,280
there and make the best of it.

1366
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:32,320
Hopefully, you can take a shower.

1367
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:38,660
So essentially, now that the earth has become a spiritual landfill, how are you going to

1368
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:39,780
be efficient about it?

1369
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:45,840
Do you think that if someone says, �Well, we�re going to hope this landfill becomes

1370
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:49,920
a bed of roses on its own tomorrow and you�re going to believe an idiot like that?� Well,

1371
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:54,860
that�s all you hear, but actually, you don�t hear much of that anymore, but live a life

1372
01:22:54,860 --> 01:22:55,560
of efficiency.

1373
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,640
You�re not going to have the doom and gloom that�s manifest and by the way, statistically,

1374
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:05,660
even in these idiots on Wall Street, they use statistics, they look at charts and things,

1375
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:06,800
see if there�s a pattern.

1376
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:11,260
Have you folks figured out there�s a pattern that you�ve been pressed on doom and gloom,

1377
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:17,660
financial collapse and whatever, how much of that has come around in the Western world?

1378
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:23,760
Yeah, and it won�t and I�m giving more specifics on how it will, but not now.

1379
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:30,640
By the way, when your societal collapse comes around, you�re not going to be concerned

1380
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:36,980
about it because you�re going to have slightly bigger concerns like a really big rock hitting

1381
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:39,560
a certain part of the world and I�ve gotten into the specifics.

1382
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:44,280
And another really big rock hitting another similar part of the world, but you�re not

1383
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:47,540
going to be shown that one for a specific reason.

1384
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:51,560
The first one they might show you, it�s going to look like the typical asteroid looking

1385
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,100
lumpy potato crater thing.

1386
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:58,480
Second one, they�re not going to show you for sure, yeah, we�ll talk about that in

1387
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:02,960
the future why they�re not going to show you, who�s they, whoever, it�s got cameras

1388
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,060
eyes in the skies.

1389
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:09,000
And the next thing you�re going to experience perhaps thrown in there is it�s going to

1390
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,120
get really, really hot.

1391
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,420
You ever hear of global warming?

1392
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:17,880
You ever notice how you can debate that or argue that or not, but they never tell you

1393
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:21,020
which globe it is, I mean, wink, wink, get it?

1394
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:26,200
Well, it�s not really a globe either, but yeah, you�re going to have a solar event,

1395
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:29,580
not a solar flare, a solar event, an unprecedented one.

1396
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:36,140
Just imagine, what kind of temperature does it take to slow roast a chicken?

1397
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:42,340
Like slow roast, really like how white people like to do crock pot cooking, that stuff,

1398
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:48,040
tasteless food, anyway, that slow cooking stuff, that�s what your environment will

1399
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:50,180
be like for about a week and a half or so.

1400
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:54,460
You won�t have any plants left, any plant life on the earth after that event.

1401
01:24:54,780 --> 01:25:00,280
It�ll come back obviously, but you�ll be able to cook a chicken in a broad daylight.

1402
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:06,340
Let me just throw something in there in perspective for you.

1403
01:25:07,260 --> 01:25:11,540
The sun is going to get so bright that the full moon will look like the noonday sun.

1404
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:16,100
It�s going to be a little hot under the collar, I should say.

1405
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:20,300
This is where your societal collapse comes around, folks, but you�re not going to be

1406
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:23,080
thinking of it as such by then.

1407
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:28,180
Then of course, throw in, you all want to pretty much get into this fervor for a little

1408
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:31,080
while that you�ll think it�ll be really fun to cut daddy�s head off with a butter

1409
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:36,160
knife while he�s sleeping, and a lot of other stuff going on.

1410
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,700
I think I�ll get more into specifics.

1411
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:44,220
For example, you ever notice how people have been, I�ve also talked about this way before

1412
01:25:44,220 --> 01:25:48,700
it started, is there�s a big fad about people getting tattoos.

1413
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:53,160
You ever wonder why they�re all sort of getting tattoos, like a pretty big amount

1414
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:57,360
of the population just marking up their skin and all that, like it means something?

1415
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,620
Yeah, it means a lot, not what they think though.

1416
01:26:01,020 --> 01:26:05,460
Just think of it, they don�t really come off that easy when you get them, if you know

1417
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:05,940
what I mean.

1418
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:16,100
All of these trends, it�s just really like watching a train wreck, so why do you want

1419
01:26:16,100 --> 01:26:17,240
to get caught up in that?

1420
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,360
Here�s an interesting concept, folks.

1421
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:26,300
You can actually be on a train, as long as it�s long enough, enough cars, and even

1422
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:34,580
if the front train hits a block of 20-foot-thick concrete wall or another train, that reaction,

1423
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:38,000
by the time it gets to the back car or wherever you are, let�s say hopefully you�re not

1424
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,880
near the front and you�re beyond the middle, let�s say the last third, you can actually

1425
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:47,400
hear it and see it and not feel it for a few seconds or more because these things take

1426
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,580
kilometers or miles to stop and start.

1427
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:53,160
You can get off to a certain point.

1428
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:56,960
I�m not saying that there�s a physical way to avoid all this stupidity that it�s

1429
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:57,460
going to take.

1430
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:00,280
Well, it�s not stupidity, actually, to clean up the stupidity on this planet.

1431
01:27:00,820 --> 01:27:06,100
This is not doom and gloom, by the way, because remember, you folks won�t know what�s going

1432
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:07,620
on, so it doesn�t matter.

1433
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:14,380
Anyway, you ever heard of something called awful timekeeping?

1434
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:15,520
Isn�t it interesting?

1435
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:17,240
But you don�t care.

1436
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,600
That�s the other aspect of it.

1437
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:25,580
Again, just imagine a long train and you can imagine the front of it getting smashed to

1438
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:27,340
bits and you could see the wave coming.

1439
01:27:27,460 --> 01:27:29,340
You could just jump off the last second or so.

1440
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:33,500
Think about that in terms of the way the information works also.

1441
01:27:34,940 --> 01:27:39,560
One thing maybe about Greek-speak is what does Greek-speak and heavy artillery have

1442
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:40,000
in common?

1443
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:42,660
Well, once you hear it, it�s too late.

1444
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:47,080
Anyway, so again, this is solo12.

1445
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:51,220
I just want to give another � it�s sort of got about a half hour to go.

1446
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,820
Do the right thing for AFR if you�re listening to this down the stream and you got a few

1447
01:27:55,820 --> 01:28:03,020
shekels to rub together or more, send some to AFR to give them a little donation or a

1448
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:08,240
big donation or whatever you see fit as long as you send something, it is fit.

1449
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:13,260
The only reason I�m suggesting this is I know that with the Greek-speak, this is a

1450
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:18,960
fact that when we did the experiment at the beginning of the solo experience, I was just

1451
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:26,820
curious if there is, let�s say, a public want to � financially support what the Greek

1452
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:27,220
is saying.

1453
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:31,980
Since we�re AFR, I said, �Why don�t you folks donate to AFR and see what we can

1454
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:40,960
garner and there was a very good, let�s say, support given and it would be good to

1455
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:46,260
keep that going and it probably won�t because I won�t be here, but on the other hand,

1456
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:53,080
it probably could because I was here, however you want to do it, and I�m just saying that

1457
01:28:53,080 --> 01:29:00,740
humbly and I just from the point that Danny and the rest of whoever is behind the scenes

1458
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:05,580
understands that the Greek-speak is something original, something new, something different

1459
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:11,400
and it ain�t a dummy load and I think that those that are listening to it require it not

1460
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:16,400
to be a dummy load because the reason you�re listening to the Greek is because it�s not

1461
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:21,900
a dummy load, hopefully, and you are more discerning than the rest and which I have

1462
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,620
found people to be as well.

1463
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:28,700
So again, I�ll just be ranting and raving for the little bit that we have left and we

1464
01:29:28,700 --> 01:29:37,840
have a couple of emails that I�d like to perhaps go through and one of them was a fellow

1465
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:45,780
I wanted to send out, thanks, you know who you are, this is regarding a message he sent

1466
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:52,020
about when I was on with Seth regarding the people that were exposed to a certain amount

1467
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:56,340
of information and they wanted it stopped and I didn�t look up the exact specifics on that,

1468
01:29:56,340 --> 01:30:02,480
but I would suggest that was a certain group of people that was gathered at the Sinai at

1469
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,720
a certain time in history.

1470
01:30:04,840 --> 01:30:08,300
So we will probably get into that. I�ll try to answer that email more specifically.

1471
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:14,060
I just want to bring up another point which I brought up before. I would say the majority,

1472
01:30:14,180 --> 01:30:18,780
the great majority, 9 out of 10 messages that I get are regarding scripture or what�s called

1473
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:19,200
the Bible.

1474
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:26,000
Now fortunately, I don�t get the mainstream Republican, Democrat, Christian, Jewish,

1475
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:30,980
Muslim mainstream kind of view on it. These are people that realize there is something

1476
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:36,680
important there and they haven�t gone down the ladder or down the hole where they feel

1477
01:30:36,680 --> 01:30:41,720
like they have to make up stuff about it. They just honestly want to know more about

1478
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:47,300
it and they know that it�s lacking. There is no information regarding the gods at this

1479
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:54,360
point that is cohesive and put out together. Unfortunately, I don�t get too many people

1480
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:59,260
on what�s called the Bible belt or the buckle of that belt because that is a very, very

1481
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:04,240
difficult place. I don�t envy anyone that lives anywhere near there or anything like

1482
01:31:04,240 --> 01:31:09,740
that, beautiful land by the way, or any religious types.

1483
01:31:10,260 --> 01:31:15,240
The reason I�m bringing this up is because most of the project that we�re going to be

1484
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:22,760
going into in the future on the podcast will be discerning and discussing ancient writs.

1485
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:28,180
If one is going to pursue something of quality, it is going to be obviously what�s known

1486
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:33,200
as the biblical text or scripture. Why does that make it the highest quality text is not

1487
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:37,480
because the stuff that you guys have in your Bibles and your drawers, that is not of quality

1488
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:44,140
at all. What we�re going to get into is the source documents of that and what could

1489
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:48,480
be garnered. We don�t have anything that�s considered an exact original or we�re going

1490
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:54,000
to go back as far as possible and actually discuss sort of a plan that has been put in

1491
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,860
place for humanity. If you want humanity, by the way, to sit

1492
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:03,300
still for 6,000 years like a turkey in the oven, because you�re all a bunch of turkeys

1493
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:09,140
at this point, I think you�ve figured out or not, without building too many towers of

1494
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:13,400
babbles and trying to figure out how to get off this rock, you kind of censor them to

1495
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:18,540
keep them still. You�ve got to still give them all the info, so why don�t you give

1496
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:24,060
the info to a group of people that they find very distasteful and misunderstood, if you

1497
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:29,580
know what I mean, and give those people that are giving this information and preserving

1498
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:35,240
it a really, really hard time. On top of that, actually, like I said, make everyone else

1499
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:41,000
around hate them. What a better way to preserve and hide the information in plain sight, if

1500
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:47,100
you know what I mean. There�s going to be much explanation and

1501
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:54,100
discussion and reading out of it instead of reading into it and we�ll see how that

1502
01:32:54,100 --> 01:33:00,540
goes. I think as time goes on, myself and others, actually there are no others at this

1503
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:05,400
point maybe than a few here or there, will be able to collect the thoughts enough and

1504
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:10,420
put together some really good presentations of things that haven�t been shared or shown

1505
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:16,440
for over 2,000 years. I think that will be a very exciting time and hopefully that will

1506
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:21,200
start in the next moon or so when I get pretty much everything together and ready to start

1507
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:26,960
doing presentations because it ain�t what you think. I don�t do this to rub people

1508
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:34,880
the wrong way, but there are gods, plural. There is nowhere. I have not found any set-apart

1509
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:42,940
writ or ancient writ anywhere that stated just one god. Just like you never pick up

1510
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:50,380
an army manual and it�s only really basically discussing just one soldier because army is

1511
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:54,780
a plurality. That�s why I often say there is no information

1512
01:33:54,780 --> 01:34:00,500
that is rational, true and accurate about the gods that is being put out in one place

1513
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:07,980
accurately. It�s been tried. You might find some good and rational information in some

1514
01:34:07,980 --> 01:34:13,880
places but not consistently. The thing is to be consistent about it. Of course, you

1515
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:18,280
want to be impeccable as possible, but if you can�t be perfect, admit when you make

1516
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:26,580
a mistake. I think as time goes on, as more things are exposed, in other words, things

1517
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:32,600
that are there will be seen, that�s going to be a real interesting path to take.

1518
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:38,220
There are a lot of presentations regarding these subjects. Also, folks, remember there�s

1519
01:34:38,220 --> 01:34:42,380
going to be discussion about how the human body really works, how the planet works, how

1520
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:47,140
nature works, not because I say so, but because you will say so once you�re made aware of

1521
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:52,920
it. It�s very, very simple stuff. By the way, I just want to bring up a couple

1522
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:59,080
more points regarding the gods. You�ll be hard-pressed to find any ancient writ, biblical

1523
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:06,540
included that says anything good about mankind at large generally in any culture. There�s

1524
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:11,120
going to come a time here where you�re going to have to pick sides, pick sides meaning

1525
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:15,680
spiritually in your mind. Are you going to allow yourself to be dragged along with the

1526
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:19,340
bullshit, which is by the way a scriptural term. It�s called dung. It�s used even

1527
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:24,720
in your King James stuff. They use the word dung. You�re going to be dragged along with

1528
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:31,480
this � I wouldn�t even call it fake. It�s just downright maliciously stupid information

1529
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:38,520
that�s being put out or are you going to be more efficient and go back to primary movers

1530
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:46,600
and primary source stuff? That�s the question. Anyway, because right now as you stand as

1531
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:53,740
a society, there is a complete disregard for life. It�s so much so that you will justify

1532
01:35:53,740 --> 01:36:01,220
esoteric things in the name of what�s called rites for people to commit that are actually

1533
01:36:01,220 --> 01:36:12,200
on a human planetary level. The level of subjectivity and lack of objectivity has reached a peak,

1534
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:22,480
but it�s going to be a little higher tomorrow. This year is still not over, quite a bit of

1535
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:26,900
censorship still, but it will start to loosen up. When I say the censorship will loosen

1536
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:30,200
up, it will be regarding things about the gods, plural.

1537
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:36,280
The interesting thing about speaking about the gods, they have a hierarchy and what most

1538
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:42,620
people tend to be drawn to the subject and refer to that subject is because within that

1539
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:47,680
hierarchy, there is a most high god who is actually the god of gods and that is the one

1540
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:54,580
that is implied. Anyway, when you have a planet full of space heaters that are wondering,

1541
01:36:54,580 --> 01:37:00,800
�How am I going to get my wheel fixed and my cord is bent and my switch don�t work?�

1542
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:05,300
I guess space heaters have those kinds of concerns. You plug them in, they give off heat, I think.

1543
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:13,800
Anyway, it�s going to be a very, very difficult, let�s say, way to reckon the two realities,

1544
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:20,720
meaning the reality of the common man or the average space heater or surface-dwelling earth

1545
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:27,740
inhabitant with the obvious reality. It�s very difficult to reckon because within the

1546
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:32,400
standard society that you folks consider to be your society and the way you do things,

1547
01:37:32,980 --> 01:37:39,260
you pretty much have everything in place, whether it�s medical society, legal society,

1548
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:47,160
scientific society, religious society. You�ve gotten all the categories together, put together,

1549
01:37:47,160 --> 01:37:52,700
bridge builders, shoe shiners. You�ve got all the various aspects of it pieced together,

1550
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:57,580
but what it�s manifesting is malevolent. Why? Because it�s being controlled by a

1551
01:37:57,580 --> 01:38:03,680
malevolent force and forces and you don�t realize it because in other words, in order

1552
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:10,280
to propagate a malevolent deed or plan on a very large scale for a very long time, the

1553
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:14,720
only way that could succeed is if it is always presented as being beneficial and good.

1554
01:38:15,860 --> 01:38:25,860
You have to combine that with a species that is arrogant, selfish and rebellious. There you go,

1555
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:32,780
and that�s the perfect cocktail for explaining mankind on earth. Now, throw in all the other

1556
01:38:32,780 --> 01:38:37,720
varieties of humanoids that are appearing and someone had asked me, �Can you please name

1557
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:43,160
the fourth type of humanoid?� Maybe, perhaps, that is actually something that is still being

1558
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:49,800
inquired upon, but initially, it�s very easy to do a stat one. There are three types

1559
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:54,520
of humans on the planet and there could be a fourth, so let�s just leave it at that

1560
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:59,060
because we want to do a little more due diligence before we start discussing it.

1561
01:39:01,060 --> 01:39:05,880
When you mix these malevolent cosmic forces, meaning the spiritual forces that are lodged

1562
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:11,680
cosmically on the earth, taking control of all of your religions, all of your institutions

1563
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:17,400
and even most of your thoughts with a creature or species of human that is inherently stubborn,

1564
01:39:17,820 --> 01:39:23,860
rebellious and arrogant and selfish, that is one hell of a cocktail for the society

1565
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:31,220
you have today and that is the truth about this society. The variety is incredible, but

1566
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,520
in terms of what makes everyone the same and the situation the same, I�ve just laid it

1567
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:40,800
out for you folks. It�s what you all have in common, both in the spiritual realm and

1568
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:45,780
in the physical realm. In the spiritual realm, I mean the manifestation of pretty much the

1569
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:51,500
earth in your society and humankind being handed over for a short time to the most

1570
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:56,320
malevolent creatures in the universe that are non-physical. Obviously, they haven�t

1571
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:59,620
killed everyone yet. I don�t think the authority has been granted to them and I don�t think

1572
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:10,780
they want that. It�s always the good guys doing all the killing and damaging. You ever

1573
01:40:10,780 --> 01:40:17,420
hear that? It�s so funny and ironic when the hypocrisy of the human, they value life

1574
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:21,940
and they can�t even define what it is. They preach love and they can�t even define

1575
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:28,800
what it is at all. They even say God and they can�t even tell you which one. I mean it�s

1576
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:33,420
just pathetic. This is on a global level. It doesn�t matter if you�re in Russia,

1577
01:40:33,980 --> 01:40:41,220
Iraq, Honduras, America, Canada or U.S., Canada, France, Italy. You want to go through

1578
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:48,700
all the countries? The thing that�s going to change, like I mentioned earlier, why not

1579
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:53,660
hide it? Hide the infrastructure and hide the information by giving it to a group of

1580
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:57,920
people that everyone will hate and also make that group of people a life of living hell

1581
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:03,580
on earth. Do you know who I�m talking about by the way? Yeah, I�m not going to use the

1582
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:11,180
term. It starts with the letter J. What�s interesting is do you know how to observe

1583
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:17,080
those people? No, you don�t. We�re going to discuss that because they�re sort of like

1584
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:25,760
a clock. Because your thoughts and your culture has put such a bad taste in your mind about

1585
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:32,260
it. You are completely blinded to what is going on, you humans and you never will know.

1586
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:37,820
By the way, when I say never, I mean we�re talking in the next 15 years or so. You don�t

1587
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:44,700
know how to discern the cosmic clock. In the future, the next few weeks or so, we get this

1588
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:48,600
thing going. We�re going to talk about discerning the cosmic clocks and things like that. It�s

1589
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:53,380
not the crap that you�re used to hearing. This is the stuff when you hear it, you will

1590
01:41:53,380 --> 01:41:59,120
know it. It�s because it�s based on the obvious things. If you can count how many

1591
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:05,060
digits you have on your hand or how many steps it takes to go up a ladder or you know when

1592
01:42:05,060 --> 01:42:08,840
it�s hot and when it�s cold, that�s all that�s required to pretty much see the

1593
01:42:08,840 --> 01:42:15,940
obvious. But if you come and say, �Well, the voice is in my head disturbing you.�

1594
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:22,540
Well, that�s a different thing if you�re that off, which is most people. We�ll see

1595
01:42:22,540 --> 01:42:29,720
how discerning of a bunch will appear. Again, maybe a couple of times, I want to thank

1596
01:42:29,720 --> 01:42:39,500
AFR and the crew for pretty much doing what they did by having the Greek on here. If you

1597
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:42,780
guys can garner some support like you did when I first came on, that would be really,

1598
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:43,300
really good.

1599
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:48,000
Let�s see. I have a couple of questions here on the emails and just a little bit to

1600
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:52,280
go. After the cataclysm, three main ones, how many people will be left on earth? They

1601
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:59,560
will pretty much be reduced down to the 10% by then. Actually, wholesale one third also

1602
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:03,000
want the powers that be have a much easier time defending themselves for these disasters

1603
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:11,460
since after all the access to the credit system. No, it will be very different then. They�re

1604
01:43:11,460 --> 01:43:15,680
actually going to run and hide. They�re not really going to be defending. The credit

1605
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:21,080
system is going to get very mixed by then. But that�s a good question. Holy smoke, so

1606
01:43:21,080 --> 01:43:26,980
the God�s coming malevolent. That�s another question. Should I start training, grab my

1607
01:43:27,620 --> 01:43:28,600
defense training now?

1608
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:33,060
But here�s the thing about malevolent and benevolent. I�ll just give you a typical

1609
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:38,360
slave analogy. A guy puts on a ski mask and a gun and he goes to rob the bank, shoots

1610
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:43,080
a couple of people, he�s running with the bag of money and the cops throw him down and

1611
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:51,060
arrest him. Now, to the guy who did all that, the cops are the bad guys to him. To the guy

1612
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:56,760
the rest of everybody else, that guy is the bad guy to them. So let�s say the cops are

1613
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:59,760
the cops, the good guys are the bad guys. Are they malevolent or benevolent? It depends.

1614
01:44:00,940 --> 01:44:05,220
It�s not like hot or cold because if you have an extreme of each one, it�ll kill

1615
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:06,540
you. It�s different.

1616
01:44:08,580 --> 01:44:15,640
Let me give the light and dark as an analogy. Darkness is created but light is formed. Think

1617
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:22,800
about that for a minute. Good is created but evil is formed. So if you look at all

1618
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:27,960
the ancient writs, most of them, when I say mopping up, is reducing the population down

1619
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:34,520
to 10% or less of what it is. That is going to be done by the benevolent gods by the way.

1620
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:38,740
You could look at any of your ancient writs. It�s always the good guys doing the cleaning

1621
01:44:38,740 --> 01:44:45,020
up. The bad guys want you around. See, leeches don�t kill you. Actually, as a matter of

1622
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:49,440
fact, the leech, when they released their victim, they even put a coagulant on there

1623
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,060
so they could come back and bleed you again.

1624
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:59,080
It won�t get into what�s malevolent and benevolent but right now, as a matter of existence,

1625
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:05,820
there are no benevolent gods because if the benevolent gods appear to you in the physical

1626
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:12,980
realm as they are, you will probably disintegrate and not painlessly either.

1627
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:20,760
So, as they are, they will do harm to you. All of them will. It�s the ones that have

1628
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:26,480
the aspect of creation and why they have formed mankind and created mankind because there�s

1629
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:36,280
two types there. How they�re going to execute this plan is what makes their intent benevolent

1630
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:37,080
or malevolent.

1631
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:43,760
I�ll give you an example. The chief malevolent deity that is over the earth has got countless

1632
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:48,740
other malevolent ones, countless to us, but it rations off as one-third, that control

1633
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:53,200
all of the earth, all of the earth�s religions, all of the universities, all of the governments,

1634
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:58,800
all of your churches, all of your synagogues, all of your mosques, all of your libraries.

1635
01:45:59,180 --> 01:46:03,800
You want to go down the line, all of your holidays, your calendar are controlled by all malevolent

1636
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:09,480
forces right now. Every single one, not a one is spared. It�s very easy to discern

1637
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:15,160
that once you have that ability to discern it. Is it a criticism? Yeah, you can take

1638
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:20,900
it as such. Is it a fact and is it the truth? Yes. How do they get away with it? By presenting

1639
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:27,280
it as good. What they�re doing is they�re relying on your ignorance and people are very,

1640
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:32,960
very, very reliable. Have you tuned into any media lately? Have you gone to university

1641
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:39,960
lately? Why do you think they�re relying on your ignorance? You�re so reliable. Can

1642
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:47,120
you imagine a small percentage of humanity became unreliable? Boy, oh boy, but you ain�t.

1643
01:46:47,940 --> 01:46:54,180
You�re going to stay very reliable as a group. Those that know, by the way, don�t talk about

1644
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:57,780
making the world a better place because they realize it�s too far gone. It�s worse

1645
01:46:57,780 --> 01:47:02,860
than Humpty Dumpty. There�s nothing to fix, by the way. There�s nothing to make it better.

1646
01:47:02,980 --> 01:47:06,880
It has to go through what it�s going through. Obviously, it�s going to take a level of

1647
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:11,140
maturity that most people lack to be able to see that or even discuss it. Most people

1648
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:15,960
would rather make bullshit up than go and look at what�s been preserved. Most people

1649
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:22,160
that exist today would rather go take a dump and a pee on everyone that came before them

1650
01:47:22,640 --> 01:47:29,280
than lift a finger and see what was written. Most people would. Most people think that

1651
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:34,880
all of this came into creation less than 100 years ago. Why is it easy to say that? Well,

1652
01:47:35,500 --> 01:47:39,560
look at all your science and all your stuff that you�re putting out as pride as how modern

1653
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:45,360
you are. How much of it goes back more than 100 years? Almost none of it. So, you�re

1654
01:47:45,860 --> 01:47:50,800
pretty sorry lot on this planet. It doesn�t mean that anyone is going to do anything to

1655
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:54,980
change it. Oh, yeah, you�re going to get changes, all right, but those that realize

1656
01:47:54,980 --> 01:47:59,620
it and can do it rationally and with efficiency will leave it alone and set themselves apart

1657
01:47:59,620 --> 01:48:02,360
from it. Hopefully, that will come around.

1658
01:48:02,760 --> 01:48:07,560
Just to give a last word, I want to again, we have just a few minutes or less. I want

1659
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:15,880
to thank everyone at American Freedom Radio for providing the time slot and allowing Greek

1660
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:20,480
to show up in the chat room and whatever else. If you folks want to garner some support

1661
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:28,880
for doing this, it will be memorialized hopefully in some archives or just even send an email

1662
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:34,720
thanking AFR for having the Greek on. So, with that said, Final Solo 12 and thanks all

1663
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:36,760
for coming and listening and be well.
