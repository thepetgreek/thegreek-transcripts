00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,930
Greetings, everyone, and this we could call the second installment of Uncommon Sense with

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:06,290
the Greek.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:11,430
And what you might see that is different than the last time is that the Greek is solo now.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:16,350
So we're going to keep trying to try to have the word failure built into it, but we're

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,390
going to see what kind of success can be gotten.

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,350
And that's always the question.

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,290
What is success?

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,470
So maybe we'll talk a little bit about that, but let's just give a little bit of a time

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:26,810
marker.

10
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,570
And I want to talk about that as well, because it's around the significant time of the year.

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:38,550
It's what they call the third month of the ninth day, 2017, or March 9th, 2017, according

12
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,350
to the Pope's work schedule.

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,770
Yes, you heard me correct.

14
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,390
And if you've heard Greek speak before, this is one of the key points that is always discussed.

15
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:52,730
It is not a time piece, no matter how much you believe in it or whatever faith you are

16
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,490
or technical knowledge of it.

17
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,490
It is a work schedule.

18
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,489
And that if you ever heard of something called the sun, if you've ever heard of anything

19
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:05,630
called the moon, well, guess what?

20
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,330
The sun reckons a day and the moon reckons a month.

21
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,990
And the year gets a little more complex, which involves the movements of the earth, the sun

22
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,830
and the moon together.

23
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,230
But with that said, guess what?

24
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,450
What's coming up with the next full moon?

25
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,290
Well, let's not guess too much, but let's just say it.

26
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,850
The next full moon is going to be the first day of the first month.

27
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,490
OK, boys and girls, you've always been told something is called a certain thing when

28
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,590
it's the first day of the first month.

29
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,390
Yes, I won't say it.

30
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:44,930
And there ain't no ball dropping in Times Square and anything like that, because this

31
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,530
has to do with being in the light, not in the dark.

32
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:51,410
Now, how many times have you heard something like that?

33
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,250
Probably none.

34
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,430
So thank you and welcome all to Greek speak.

35
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,150
And it's actually uncommon sense.

36
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,710
But yes, you are going to be welcomed or unwelcomed by the Greek speak itself.

37
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:10,250
So before we continue on tonight, I'd just like to say that this is also participatory

38
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:16,350
on your end. So if you have what is called a telephone, there is a telephone number at

39
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,890
AFR that you can call and join and participate.

40
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:24,930
And that would be 2 1 8 3 3 9 8 5 2 5.

41
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,710
I'm going to say it a little slower and one more time, which also it can be gotten on

42
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,110
the American home page.

43
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,310
It is there on the left.

44
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,150
Yes, your other left in a red box.

45
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,550
It is on the left.

46
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,470
So it will say call a number with a border on it in red.

47
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:47,370
And that number one more time is 2 1 8 3 3 9 8 5 2 5.

48
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:54,670
Now, if you like using the Skype convention, you have to consider also there is a

49
00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:03,530
website called Uncommon Radio dot com and the email on that website, which is a

50
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,730
courtesy site.

51
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:11,570
The email for that site is Uncommon Sense Radio one at Gmail dot com.

52
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,290
And the number one is a numeric one.

53
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:20,050
And that is also what you would type into the search query box for contacts in the

54
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,850
Skype. So if you're interested in coming on using the Skype search for contacts and

55
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,890
put in Uncommon Sense Radio one at Gmail dot com.

56
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:34,770
And when you search, you will see Uncommon Radio, the Greek and the request for that

57
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:40,470
convention. So please, if anyone does feel like they have a voice and want to

58
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,110
participate, that is open.

59
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,350
Now, one of the things that we used to discuss with previous Sonic episodes when we

60
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:52,290
decided to do the reload with Ocelli and the Greek, it was in jest, of course, you

61
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,930
know, but all in jest, half in earnest, the two the two things about calling in.

62
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:01,190
And I think it's just an interesting reflection on the human consciousness.

63
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,430
Well, the first one, let's do it backwards.

64
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,790
The second thing we used to say is if you're under the influence, you may not think

65
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,710
like you sound that you are, but everyone else knows that you do sound that you are

66
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:16,610
under the influence. So if you're under the influence, whatever that might be, refrain

67
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:23,270
from calling. And the other thing is when you call in, impart and share things that

68
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:29,810
can apply to anyone, pretty much use it as an open platform of communication.

69
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,550
Typically, when people discuss their own personal matters, you're sort of raised in a

70
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,730
culture where it's polite to act like you're listening.

71
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,670
But when you're discussing your own personal stuff with other people, they're

72
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,250
basically wondering when you're going to shut up so they can tell you what they want to

73
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,010
say. So the thing is about, you know, when you do things in public, make it publicly

74
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:55,030
applicable. So those are the two things, perhaps, and not and not just the only two

75
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,510
about calling us. Let's make it participatory if you so choose.

76
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:04,290
And speaking of being participatory, I want to thank everyone who has been sending some

77
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:10,630
form of exchange or some contribution slash donation, let's say in accordance with

78
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,770
the, well, let's just use the common word, the plea, the asking, the mini beg-a-thon,

79
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:23,430
perhaps, maybe not, that the Greek did last week about seeing what kind of support can

80
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,510
be garnered for this kind of a project.

81
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:31,730
And the reason why is because ending the last sonic event, there was a contemplation of

82
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,050
perhaps starting a member's area.

83
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,730
And when I looked into what it took to do something like that, it was quite an

84
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:40,510
undertaking in terms of time and all that.

85
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:45,890
So many people always say they want to participate, but essentially when it comes down

86
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,430
to doing it, very few appear to do so.

87
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:55,910
So but I wanted to thank everyone who has sent a donation to AFR and the concept here of

88
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:03,910
a member's area is perhaps a concept of exclusivity, you know, but I think that if

89
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:08,010
you're tuning in to this and you're listening to Uncommon Radio and what's dubbed as

90
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:14,530
Greek speak, there is a sense of exclusivity on its own there, because what you will hear

91
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,810
are things that are not being said anywhere else.

92
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,890
And as a matter of fact, that's one of the reasons why the Greek is speaking.

93
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:28,030
I don't consider myself to be in any way a public figure or want to be a public figure,

94
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,930
but for years I've been contemplating the things that I have been emanating sonically on

95
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,830
various platforms or especially this one.

96
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,230
And no one else is saying anything even close.

97
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:46,370
So the point is, if it can be said, it should be said responsibly, of course, and

98
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,950
accurately and with precision.

99
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:54,590
So I'm kind of dubbing, like, let's say perhaps the next this time around and the next

100
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:59,310
two, which would be the first four of Uncommon Radio, the members area open.

101
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:06,830
And again, I want to thank everyone who has contributed based on what was mentioned last

102
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,870
week regarding this.

103
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:14,190
And I would like to see perhaps even more, because as it is so far, would it would it

104
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:20,510
actually deem setting up a separate area, an endeavor as such, what is called the

105
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,970
members area on someone's platform?

106
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,570
Let's say no, it wouldn't be at this point, but pretty close.

107
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:32,890
So if support can be garnered for AFR regarding at least what's being said on

108
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:39,310
Uncommon Radio, that would still be appreciated and still needs to be seen.

109
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:44,430
And so let's just dub the next three, including this one, let's say would be the

110
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,890
next two. So four, let's do four weeks of pretty much answering questions.

111
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,030
I'm going to be going back to emails and pretty much discussing things a little more

112
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,930
openly than you're used to hearing.

113
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:04,030
And unlike many, many, let's say, groups or sonic figures that do provide a members or

114
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,630
exclusive area to their sites, I do find it to be somewhat distasteful.

115
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,550
I mean, there's no need for exclusivity.

116
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,230
So if there is a need for it, that will be communicated to some extent.

117
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,190
And there is, for example, a right time and a place to say things.

118
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,490
And right now, clearly, is still not the time.

119
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,410
But it is fast approaching, meaning in about a year's time or this would be the last year

120
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,530
of this seven year period that you folks have been experiencing.

121
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,990
So let's just make this the members, the open members area on AFR.

122
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:39,530
And again, send some support.

123
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,850
Let's just see what can be done about this.

124
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:48,250
You know, years ago, a brick and mortar facility was a place where people gathered and

125
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,530
shared things. But, you know, here's something to consider.

126
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,150
Universities have been around for, let's say, an eon or two, and they still operate under

127
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,050
the Greek Convention.

128
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:05,530
But people were supposedly going to learn things, real knowledge and real information

129
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:10,350
was actually shared at the open market, the Agora, the Agora, which is a Greek

130
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:16,130
pronunciation. That's why, for example, you've heard like the soapbox concept, you

131
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:21,690
know, soapbox where it was typically political views, but not always.

132
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:27,190
But in the open market, one of the first things to sell out was soap because it was

133
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,750
difficult to make, was sort of limited.

134
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,390
And all these empty soapboxes piled them up and spoke.

135
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,750
This was pretty much in a Western society type thing.

136
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:42,370
So that wouldn't say this is particularly a soapbox, but it is a place to impart things

137
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,170
that are just not being imparted.

138
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,310
And I just put this out there.

139
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:55,350
If there are people out there, yes, I know there are, that can stay and keep and carry

140
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,350
these subjects forward.

141
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,370
Like what is lawful?

142
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,690
You know, what is real?

143
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,970
What do things really mean?

144
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,830
Please come forward and start speaking.

145
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:07,370
I'm sure here at AFR they will give you a time slot and or anywhere else.

146
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,950
Do a website, do something, please.

147
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,890
I would like to take a break from it, not that I need to be doing it, but actually

148
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,670
being able to bounce things off of someone else.

149
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,610
And I know you're out there.

150
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:23,570
In other words, if anyone approaches a topic, let's say the concept of religion.

151
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:28,050
You've heard the Greeks say there's not one religion on the planet, bar none, that

152
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:32,150
does anything or knows anything that's in the text that they allegedly subscribe to.

153
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:37,110
Or comprehends it the same with science, the same with medicine, the same with the

154
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,390
financial industry, the same with what's called government agencies.

155
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:47,010
No one or the legal society, no one really seems to care or know about what they're

156
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,290
supposed to be doing.

157
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:56,710
Right. So, you know, there's pretty much an abandonment of accuracy and precision in

158
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,290
conversation, in communication, every social aspect.

159
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:07,390
If I send them a message and say the Greeks said I should call in or get into the with

160
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,890
AFR and perhaps do what's called a show or a sonic event of some sort, because I would

161
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,690
like to see that.

162
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,630
I would like to see that as well.

163
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,170
So I just this is the first time I've actually put something like that out there.

164
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:26,010
I also want to pretty much mention I do not partake much in what's called Internet radio

165
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,430
or the news or the show they call the news or websites they call the news and things

166
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:36,690
like that. But I do have to see or look at it to see what state because remember, folks,

167
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:42,310
it's all about mindset and it's still the same stuff, still the same rubbish talk,

168
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,330
rubbish mentality.

169
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,450
You ever heard of something called taxpayer dollars, right?

170
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,490
These people are like saying, oh, no, all this money was wasted and it's tax payers

171
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,190
dollars. Well, that's the mark of a moron.

172
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,330
Why? Because it's a credit based economy.

173
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,070
Everything is running under economic theory, you see.

174
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,610
So whatever is called taxes, excise law, that is still a theory.

175
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,270
None of that pays for anything.

176
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:13,230
What is called money is based on the monetization of hedging transactions.

177
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,250
That's all it is.

178
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:21,410
You know, we can get more into this about the credit system when I used to speak with

179
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:26,210
others before. I had to keep it limited because even they were limited in their ability

180
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,110
to relax into the subject.

181
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:33,790
You see, if you discuss anything, for example, with the legal society, they know no law.

182
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:39,730
You know, can there be precision and discussion to say to impart what is going on

183
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,090
regarding the legal society or the medical society?

184
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:47,370
And I'm not discussing, oh, vaccines are bad or this is a corrupt judge or anything

185
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,230
like that. Nothing in that capacity at all.

186
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:54,350
What are they supposed to be doing and is there any discussion on what they're supposed to

187
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,090
be doing? And the answer to that is no.

188
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,330
There might be some actually recently I've been discovering a few people that are

189
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,310
actually coming out of, quote unquote, the woodwork.

190
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:10,030
That's an old pagan term. Actually, I'll describe that maybe someday and bringing forth

191
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,930
what people are or these groups are supposed to be doing.

192
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:19,330
And that is basically the alignment of thought that is required to have clear, concise,

193
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,190
accurate and productive communication.

194
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,190
Let me just bring up a point.

195
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,750
I had an email recently.

196
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,590
And it was perhaps a greeting type email.

197
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:37,610
And this person supplied the information that they were in the art field.

198
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,410
They had gotten art training and pursued that and found it to be, let's just say

199
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,530
several paragraphs of the email, just to boil it down to saying they were sort of dismayed.

200
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,270
Everything from the training to the practice to how to proceed.

201
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:55,590
And the whole thing about this, for example, discussion that can be had about what art is

202
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,130
ultimately, what is it?

203
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,210
It is a communication.

204
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,610
It is visual.

205
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,710
It is audio.

206
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,390
It could be sense.

207
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,270
It could be touch.

208
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:08,450
Because whenever we look at things or people look at things that are considered artful, there

209
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,470
is a certain aesthetic that garners as such.

210
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,710
Now, for example, I'll give a quick personal quip on this.

211
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:18,670
You know, when we do some manufacturing or let's say prototyping, if it doesn't work

212
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,450
out and it's worth keeping around, we throw it in the back of the shed.

213
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,890
You don't want to throw it away, let's say if it's welded titanium or something.

214
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,270
So when it just sits there and that's called the art department, right?

215
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,370
There's a film by Stanley Kubrick.

216
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,690
I think it was Full Metal Jacket.

217
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,790
And one of the quips there was I think the drill sergeant called someone as ugly as a

218
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,710
modern art masterpiece.

219
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:41,530
So I can see how there's a lot of negative relation, but I see the positive relation

220
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,690
also being in the same category because everyone is missing the point.

221
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,830
It is a form of communication.

222
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:52,410
And just as an open thing here, whether you're an artist in terms of painting,

223
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:56,910
sculpture, writing, music, you're communicating something, right?

224
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,850
It is affecting the senses of the individual.

225
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:04,410
And that is ultimately a limiting factor as well, because these things are also considered

226
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,950
part of certain social conventions based on fashion and what's fashionable.

227
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,130
So a lot of the discussions and a lot of the things that are being discussed transcend

228
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,750
that. So.

229
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:20,170
So I'm told that the sound is cutting out every 20 seconds or so, I don't know if it's

230
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,870
on the receiving end of someone, but thank you for letting me know.

231
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:31,130
OK, so we took a little pause there in case the studio wanted to edit that out, if

232
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,390
there was any disturbance.

233
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:39,550
All right. So the again, being the second time around, so there's a lot of fat to chew,

234
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,650
as they say, and there are many things to be said, but most of it might sound like a

235
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,110
commentary on society.

236
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,170
And it's not necessarily a commentary.

237
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:52,090
Well, it could be garnered as such, but it's a commentary viewed on what is objective

238
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,230
and what can be seen.

239
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,470
So I just want to go back to tying things together.

240
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,810
You know, we kind of mentioned that it's the Pope's work schedule.

241
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,570
Yeah, you know, it's pretty obvious by now.

242
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,110
If you've heard any kind of Greek speak, you know that.

243
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:10,590
Well, you know, it's the calendar is pretty debunked as a timepiece, but it works well

244
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,630
as a work schedule or a timekeeping schedule.

245
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,670
But it is not lawful, just like very little is.

246
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,090
And what's the interesting thing?

247
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,910
I didn't say New Year because it's not really dubbed as New Year because it kind of

248
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:25,590
still is being the first day of the first month lawfully.

249
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:30,230
What is meant lawfully is, you know, well, lawfully it's based on something.

250
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,350
Right. It actually comes from the gods, believe it or not.

251
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:39,510
Yeah. Those imaginary friends again, that dumb people or crazy people are dubbed to

252
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,230
believe in. There's nothing to believe in regarding the gods.

253
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:48,090
The only thing that when you hear the word belief that should come up is that something

254
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:52,030
that has not happened yet, but you can't really believe in the gods.

255
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:58,330
You might believe that at one time you will be more, they will be more tangible, but

256
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,290
themselves an intangible society is quite different.

257
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:06,869
But when we bring up the concept of lawful timekeeping, it's just like anything else.

258
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,290
I recently was exposed to someone before I say what they said.

259
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:17,609
They pretty much have discussed anything mathematical and someone says, well, hold on.

260
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,829
I'm not really into math.

261
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,569
OK, fine. Or discuss something, let's say financial.

262
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,069
And the person would say, well, you know, I'm not into money or finances.

263
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:29,050
OK, well, you discuss law.

264
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:34,010
I recently discussed some lawful timekeeping with someone and I had to kind of have them

265
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:38,110
say it twice because what they said was, I'm not really into lawful timekeeping.

266
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,490
Think about that, folks, for a moment.

267
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:47,850
Yeah, if it sounds ridiculous, it is, but that's your typical human convention here.

268
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:51,330
It's ridiculousness. So let's just carry on.

269
00:17:51,330 --> 00:18:00,850
And so I see some, I see again that maybe we'll clean up the audio somehow if there is any other way.

270
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:11,810
OK. Again, I'll bring up the call number again would be 218-339-8525.

271
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:19,990
And the Skype convention, if you'd like to join this, is UncommonSenseRadio1 at gmail.com.

272
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:25,790
And you will find that is the email that you will find on the UncommonRadio.com site.

273
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,810
That is also the Skype contact.

274
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,010
OK, hopefully the audio is better.

275
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,730
So we shall see.

276
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,610
OK, I'm getting messages that it is.

277
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:47,470
All right. So again, folks, what is interesting here is there's many, many things to say and they all tie in together.

278
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:53,410
It's really difficult to pick a subject because there's something called a boundary layer effect, right?

279
00:18:53,950 --> 00:19:00,710
You know, you've heard as a child, you know, the neck bone is attached to the arm bone and it's just attached to the back bones, attached to the hip bone and the leg bone.

280
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,530
You know, everything is sort of attached.

281
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:06,710
Even physically, you have a boundary layer.

282
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:11,070
You know, you have the body, let's say, and you're standing on the earth, which is also in the air.

283
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,350
You're part of your body is touching, you know, most of it is in the air.

284
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,310
And the air is a material, even though it's a gas, is touching the tree.

285
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:24,570
And so everything is connected and you have one membrane or a boundary layer where everything is touching.

286
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:31,370
And certain things transverse those boundary layers, like, for example, electricity can go through the air, right?

287
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,330
Lightning and sparks and things like that.

288
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:40,850
So when you're discussing one subject, there's a boundary layer to everything else.

289
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:47,530
You know, you imagine anything and everything that can be thought of or discussed in this big soup or this big tapestry.

290
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,190
And you just focus on one thing.

291
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:53,730
You can't deny that it's not on this in the soup or in the tapestry connected to the rest.

292
00:19:53,870 --> 00:20:06,030
And the culture that has emerged in the past century or so, especially with the forms of entertainment and education, which has been dumbing up people and people like to call it dumbing down.

293
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,790
It's really dumbing up because the dumbness is going up.

294
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,170
It's actually censorship.

295
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:27,410
But to discuss, let's say, for example, the credit system or the legal society or the medical society and all these other things, it's not to be critical, but to discuss the fields that they should have been discussing or should have been imparting more properly and more accurately.

296
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:35,230
I just want to share with everyone that some of the private messaging that I've been getting, especially, let's say, on Skype groups or email.

297
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:44,370
The majority of the commentary has been regarding questions of scripture and questions regarding how the body works.

298
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:53,810
So let's just, in air quotes, say, well, if this is going to be done democratically, then, Greek, you have to do what the people that are communicating with you are requesting.

299
00:20:54,670 --> 00:21:01,210
Yes. But when you're speaking publicly, you know, if you start discussing scripture, there is an attachment right away.

300
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,990
You know, it's called the Bible right away.

301
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:17,990
It's sort of a revolting subject to people because of what groups that allegedly are supposed to be subscribing to it have done with it and how they presented it.

302
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,070
It makes it very distasteful.

303
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:27,550
The same way when you discuss the human body, when you discuss how the body works or not just the human body, anything living.

304
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:40,810
Right. It ends up becoming very distasteful because if it sounds contrary to what the entitled classes are imparting, meaning universities, doctors, scientists and all that, it can't be true.

305
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:57,250
Even though you have a body that you can examine objectively, what is being said or heard by most people cannot be true because I have put so much, quote unquote, faith and trust into these semi superhuman demigods

306
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,490
known as doctors and universities and scientists with a language that I can't quite comprehend.

307
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:11,790
Right. So how can this, you know, even though you have a body, right, you cannot most people cannot delve into the subject matter objectively.

308
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:24,330
And to prove this recently, I was on a Skype group call and there are questions that were asked by people hadn't spoken to in about a year as if I had never said anything.

309
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,350
So I guess it might be the censorship aspect again.

310
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:38,830
But to just share with everyone democratically in their quotes again, demos is an interesting word and cross is another part of the word that needs to be examined.

311
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:46,910
But discussing scripture on on an open platform like this is will be found to be distasteful.

312
00:22:46,910 --> 00:23:00,690
I'm saying, again, by many that do listen to it because it's very, very difficult to reckon what is being put in what is being and has been put into the into people's minds and what the truth of the matter is.

313
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:06,650
The truth of the matter means a rational information thing that you can access at any time that anyone can see.

314
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:12,150
Oh, I have a question, by the way, here just for everyone else.

315
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:19,190
I'm getting some feedback or something, but can you please explain the credit system and its tenants?

316
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,870
Well, that is, yes, it's very simple.

317
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:28,210
The simple way to explain that is very simple.

318
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:35,990
The credit system, let's just say not the way that the people are should be relating to it.

319
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:49,430
But the way that it's operating right now is that the behavior and the movement, the actual dynamic, the movement and the behavior of those that have a credit line is being monetized.

320
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:59,590
OK, another way to say it is that there imagine two people betting that the guy across the street is going to cross the street or not cross the street.

321
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:04,310
So it's ten bucks if he crosses for one guy and ten bucks for the other guy if he doesn't cross.

322
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,410
So he ends up crossing the street.

323
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,010
So now one guy has to give the other guy ten bucks.

324
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,390
And that's what the credit system is based on.

325
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,670
It's just betting on what's going to happen.

326
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:18,530
But the thing is, in a credit system, the ten bucks does not exist until the guy who's crossing the street signs his name on a piece of paper.

327
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,730
I don't know if it sounds confusing.

328
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,190
It's designed to be such.

329
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:34,470
And the tenants of the credit, the simple aspect of the credit system, it's based on faith, faith that something that everything that requires money needs to go on.

330
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,850
Even when there is no money.

331
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:39,490
All right. Think about it for a moment.

332
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:52,850
So essentially, the systems that have been put in place through most countries in the world since the 1930s up until the 1950s, is that most of what you call the government,

333
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:59,130
not the agencies, but the actual function of the government, which is another discussion.

334
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:02,810
I'm being told that I'm cutting out.

335
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,610
I don't know why.

336
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,370
And I'm stationary and everything is good.

337
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:11,570
Maybe we will try it after the break or right now, another type of headpiece or microphone.

338
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:18,250
But most of the country's folks are in receivership or which is what comes after bankruptcy.

339
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:26,930
So if anyone wants to look into what bankruptcy reorganization is, there's various chapters in it based on IMF conventions.

340
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:35,350
What you call it, say, America or Australia, Europe, Japan, all these are they're all in receivership of some kind.

341
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:40,650
All right. So if you want to study how that works, but the people still need to eat, things need to be made.

342
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:45,390
So you're given a credit line or actually it is a credit line, not a line of credit.

343
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:48,330
This is the legal community playing with words.

344
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:51,050
Again, the credit line and a line of credit are two different things.

345
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:59,310
Just by switching the words around slightly, just like the state of New Jersey is not New Jersey state, right?

346
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,170
It's one is an entity, right?

347
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,630
Like copywritten things sort of.

348
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:17,690
So when you're born and this goes counter to pretty much a lot of the, quote, unquote, radical law groups that talk about how bad the birth certificate is and it's a slave document and all this and the other.

349
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,030
Well, it doesn't say that it is.

350
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,670
So we have to take it that it's not.

351
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:35,150
What I would suggest is considering that when you are born into a jurisdiction or born, but naturalized or brought into that jurisdiction to function and by various ways of description, you're given a birth certificate.

352
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:39,630
And all that is, is a credit line, right?

353
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,510
That's all it is.

354
00:26:41,510 --> 00:27:06,330
Now, what what the majority of the effort of all of the institutions in place and, you know, let's say churches, synagogues, mosques, government agencies, universities, the legal society, the Bar Association, let's say, from the smallest little petty attorney all the way up to the city of London, Hollywood TV radio, even alternative radio.

355
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:17,350
The entire purpose of all this regarding the credit system is that the people never find out that they're the ones with all the, quote, unquote, money and all of the governments and corporations have no money.

356
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:24,150
And what the governments and corporations want to do is get the money from the people without letting them know that they're the only ones that have it.

357
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,070
So it's kind of like a pickpocket tactic.

358
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:37,150
So you're being robbed if you catch someone picking your pocket, but if they pick it properly, you'll walk away and not know that it's gone until much later.

359
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:42,410
But to add insult to injury, the legal society now says that you actually owe them again.

360
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,510
So that's the pranking aspect of it.

361
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:52,930
So perhaps if anyone could message me if the audio is still good, that would be great, but it seems like it is.

362
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:59,790
Okay, which agents are primarily responsible for instituting and maintaining the credit system?

363
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:04,670
Also, who determined the world's countries are in receivership and how do they have the authority to do that?

364
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:12,250
They do it. Okay, the legal society is responsible for instituting and maintaining the credit system as a form of trusteeship.

365
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:18,830
And I would say that who and how do they have the authority to do that?

366
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:24,830
Well, they're in the seat of authority, but they have to garner the authority from the people and they do that through the administrative process.

367
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:34,830
Have you ever seen like someone post a notice and it's acted on after a certain amount of days, whether it's 72 hours or a month or so?

368
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,710
This is exactly what's been going on and no one realizes it.

369
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,210
The only thing, though, is that you're dealing with pranksters, right?

370
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:52,590
Imagine going to a planet where, okay, there was an entire industry with Kevlar underwear, okay?

371
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:57,670
And you're wondering, okay, why is this Kevlar underwear industry so big here?

372
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:04,270
Well, you found out that everyone was raised into believing that it was proper to put a thumbtack on a chair before you sat on it.

373
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:17,170
It sounds pretty ridiculous, but that is a metaphor of what is going on here with the legal medical societies and the informational societies that you call professionals and you always look up to or told to look up to.

374
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,430
And all of this has started with the parents, of course, because the parents are pranking the shit out of their children.

375
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,130
And I should say sometimes they do that.

376
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:33,610
But, you know, how many times have you heard a parent say, well, I know the education system isn't worth diddly squat, but, you know, you have to go because I went.

377
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:40,730
Right. I recently heard a young lady, a young, let's say more than a girl, less than a lady, about 14 or 15.

378
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,030
I want to get this car and drive it because, well, you can't drive.

379
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,570
Mom said you can't drive that without a driver's license.

380
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,090
Why do I need a driver's license?

381
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,910
The child asked because if you don't get one, you go to jail.

382
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:56,270
OK, so now we're having motivation through penalty.

383
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,510
We have to do things because if we don't do them, you get penalized.

384
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,370
Right. And that's the only reason to do them.

385
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:07,210
Right. So what does that do to your perception of nationalism, patriotism and all that other stuff?

386
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,090
If this is the norm, I don't know.

387
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:16,270
I think, by the way, if anyone thinks it's a good idea to start a factory producing Kevlar underwear, just send an email or so.

388
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:23,270
Maybe we can do an SEC filing of some kind and get some vulture capitalists and get that going.

389
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,250
No pun intended. That's kind of a joke.

390
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:30,790
So. Let's see how most countries of Federal Reserve.

391
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,670
So they in the same boat as us.

392
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,430
OK, us, U.S., perhaps.

393
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:36,890
Yeah, of course. Yeah. This has been going on.

394
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:50,930
You see, when people are in a in a in a position where they are, quote unquote, running and what's called a government, whether it's a monarchy or or dictatorship, let's say, or democracy, socialist or whatever.

395
00:30:50,930 --> 00:31:00,970
The first thing you come into with having a corporate body like that is that you'll notice what kind of budget or what kind of access of wealth do you have to do what you want to do?

396
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:07,130
And anyone in that kind of position always wants unlimited access to what's called money.

397
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:19,850
You see, so that's why, for example, recently in the American administration with the, quote unquote, new president, he says he's going to increase the size of the military and everyone thinks that it's coming from taxes and it's not.

398
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,410
Let me just throw in something here.

399
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,130
Have you guys ever heard of the Miller process or Miller bonds?

400
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:33,150
You know where, you know, when you have a bid, let's say a construction company bids on building a bridge, there are three bonds.

401
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,890
They have to put in a bid bond, a performance bond and a surety bond.

402
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:43,950
And but no one ever asks, you know, the the institution that is putting out the idea to have this bridge built.

403
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:47,510
Where do they where did they get the money to pay the construction company to build it?

404
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,790
Right. No one ever asks that.

405
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:56,010
I mean, no one when, for example, a government says we're going to build a highway and we need it's going to cost a billion dollars.

406
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:00,370
They use the term and a construction company bids on that project.

407
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:09,770
They supply three bonds, a bid bond, performance bond and a surety bond, and each one will have the billion dollar value on it.

408
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,050
What happens is when the.

409
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:18,250
Well, before anything happens, there is the money to pay that construction company does not exist.

410
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,250
Where does that come from?

411
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:31,430
When the construction company enters the bid, the three bonds are taken and let's say the bid is awarded and they're deposited through the Federal Reserve and three billion is created based on what's on the bond.

412
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:41,170
And the three billions put aside and one billion that was created out of that was given to the construction company based on whatever schedule of payment to build that road.

413
00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:46,730
Right. So the actual company that is bidding on the work is financing it itself.

414
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:50,250
But the people there think that we better win this bid because we need the money.

415
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:53,450
How twisted is that? I would recommend some Kevlar underwear.

416
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,430
But anyway, this is how the earth is functioning right now.

417
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:58,050
This is everywhere. This is in Iran.

418
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:58,910
This is in Russia.

419
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,930
This is in Italy.

420
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,070
This is in Canada.

421
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,150
This is in Bogota.

422
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,190
This is in Japan.

423
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,670
This is the same system all throughout.

424
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:07,690
Yes, it is.

425
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,750
This is what's going on because you are so heavily pranked.

426
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,550
You can't see straight.

427
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,650
And well, anyway, maybe that's why there's so many curves in the road.

428
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:30,150
But these are questions that I'm just throwing out little tidbits, trying to be poignant as possible that are in the chat right now, because I find that, you know, real time questioning can enrich the conversation or the, you know, the sonic event.

429
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:31,610
Then here we have another.

430
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:35,590
Who are the legal society acting as trustees on behalf of?

431
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:41,830
Well, that's the that's really funny to ask, because the legal society is pretty much a monopoly right now.

432
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:52,530
At least the one that has been given legitimacy is what's called the Bar Association, and they're pretty much started in ancient Greece on one of the previous sonic events.

433
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:59,090
I explained how they got started and they had gotten that from a book written by a retired judge that wrote it, I think, in the 70s or 80s.

434
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:06,530
And I sorry, folks, I didn't write down references or the author, but it was it was that part was interesting.

435
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:14,250
But anything that is written by these people, I kind of like feel like I have to take a shower after I just read it or touch it because it's a really nasty group.

436
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:18,230
And they did come out of ancient Greece, by the way, not out of England as well.

437
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:22,790
The contemporary aspect of it is out of England, as you can imagine.

438
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,929
And you will find a bar association in every country in the world.

439
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:32,610
And they still whatever corresponding language they have when you pronounce that particular title, it sounds like bar.

440
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:37,510
And I brought this up once to someone recently that names are exempt from language.

441
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:50,050
Right. So let's say if you say IBM or Microsoft or Bar Association or Tom or Jim or anything that is a name, regardless of what language it is spoken in or written, it sounds the same because names are exempt from language.

442
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,650
They do not change from language to language.

443
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:55,290
So this legal society has been pretty much installed.

444
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:59,990
And by the way, I have also mentioned many times before that law comes from your God.

445
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:07,550
This is one of the Greek maxims that someone mentioned to me a few days ago that they have a list of Greek maxims.

446
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,050
OK, like fine, that your law comes from your God.

447
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:16,630
It's very simple. And if you don't have a God, then if you follow the laws of the state, the state is your God.

448
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,930
And April 1st is your holiday.

449
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:21,190
It's very simple. This is just the way things are set up.

450
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,990
And no one is objectifying it.

451
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,610
Well, I mean, we are now, let's say it's very, very simple.

452
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:31,610
Now, if you look at what's called the Bar Association, they set up what's called justice departments everywhere.

453
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:36,730
Justicia, Justinian was the name of a lot of the later Roman emperors, early popes.

454
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:42,610
Let's say that comes from it's the goddess revived goddess religion from Greece known as D.K.

455
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,210
D.I.K.E. She didn't like men, by the way.

456
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,150
That's why women that don't like men today are still called D.I.K.E.

457
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,930
Anyway, keep going on and on from Mott.

458
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:53,050
This is the revived goddess religion.

459
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,770
And it's it's very cruel.

460
00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:04,110
It's indifferent. And it but it tends to be it upholds its supporters quite well.

461
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:07,950
I mean, those that prescribe it, not those that ask for it.

462
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:11,310
It's kind of confusing. I think I have mentioned on previous sonic events again.

463
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,910
I shouldn't be doing that too much thing on previous sonic events.

464
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:21,550
But but if anyone I implore anyone to well, actually, if anyone wants to really get a background of what can be said there,

465
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:25,590
go to Uncommon Radio and you'll see there's about 80 hours of archives there.

466
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:32,310
But for those of you listening to this in real time, what is the problem with the revived goddess religion?

467
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:41,250
This particular goddess, not all goddesses, but this specific one, let's say that is not so specific in terms of persona yet.

468
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:47,630
But I assure you, it is what is put the spiritual cast over mankind right now.

469
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,130
She is anti-life.

470
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,270
Think about that for a moment.

471
00:36:51,830 --> 00:37:01,450
That's why you wonder about chemicals and food, the encouraging of male with male unions and female with female unions,

472
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:06,530
this genetic thing, gender bending chemicals, the genetic thing.

473
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:10,430
What I mean is splicing and all this humanism stuff that you hear about.

474
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:16,070
And by the way, none of that's going to really take place as you're being told, by the way, the future stuff.

475
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:24,190
And, you know, one simple way to pretty much see that, folks, and I'm just going to divert here for a moment,

476
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:30,710
is if anyone does a little bit of a study, just do a cursory examination of the world's fairs in various nations from,

477
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:35,070
let's say, the turn of the century till the mid 20th century.

478
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:38,250
They had these things called the World's Fair, a world's fair.

479
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:44,010
And if you see around the 30s, 40s or so, you're going to have flying cars by the 1990s,

480
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:48,230
there's a hotel on the moon by 2000, right, and all this stuff.

481
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,630
Have you gotten any of it?

482
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:57,390
No, no, you still don't have, you still have a reciprocating engine that wastes 80% of all the fuel you put into it,

483
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:02,630
turns it into heat, right, and it's got, it runs on Satan's energy drink.

484
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:09,690
So anyway, and no one really cares because they, well, first of all, they still haven't figured out how to build them right.

485
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,250
If you go into a new car dealer, let's just say you're visiting this planet and you want to take notes,

486
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:20,430
and you've been watching this manufacturing process and design work of what's called an automobile,

487
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,690
which is not an automobile because it doesn't go on its own.

488
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:26,210
It's a engine driven wagon, right?

489
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:35,090
But if you ask them, you know, go to a car dealer and say, hey, this model year is different than the last model year, isn't it?

490
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,030
Oh, yeah, yeah, it is.

491
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:41,530
So I guess you made it different because you still haven't figured out how to make it right.

492
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:45,810
Isn't that why you have a different model every year?

493
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,170
Wouldn't that be the rational thing to say?

494
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:54,210
Well, you know, if you buy a hammer or a saw or a chair or a table, the design is,

495
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:57,950
and the efficiency of the design is essentially the same, is it not?

496
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,150
But these automobiles keep changing.

497
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:04,430
But maybe it has nothing to do with whether or not they figured out how to make them.

498
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:09,590
Maybe it has to do that someone who gets it says, ha, I have the newer one and you don't.

499
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:13,850
Hmm. OK, that's another level of human condition.

500
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,570
So again, we're about 40 minutes in.

501
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:24,070
If anyone would like to call and join this monologue, which can turn into a conversation,

502
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,470
it would be 218-339-8525.

503
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:34,790
And the Skype convention would be UncommonSenseRadio1 at gmail.com.

504
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,050
And then one is numeric.

505
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:39,330
And that also happens to be the email for UncommonRadio.com.

506
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:43,050
But you see, there's there's much to do and how it's all connected.

507
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:51,250
And just to keep making the connections essentially is the is the way to relax into the subject.

508
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:57,110
So you don't get someone putting a ring into someone else's nose and dragging them around

509
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:02,230
with their methodology or what they think or forming some kind of group, of course,

510
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:05,050
which has some radical concept to it.

511
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,090
I just want to throw in again, since we were asking about the money here.

512
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:13,530
And so there's this another fellow or whoever it is still asking another question.

513
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:16,170
So the trustees are not banking dynasties.

514
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:19,710
Well, yeah, they are. But but no, they're not.

515
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,770
They have the attorneys do the work for them.

516
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:24,210
Right. Yeah, they are.

517
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,670
And here's the thing about the banking dynasties.

518
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:32,470
And that's their global, let's say, or world world based, let's say, you know, there's

519
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:33,650
multinational.

520
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:38,850
Recently, I've heard in many times in the past, I've heard people complaining about

521
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:44,370
globalists, you know, running their country or a globalist agenda.

522
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,750
How many times have you heard that?

523
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:51,470
You know, it's like some strange form of activism, because in case you folks haven't

524
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:56,390
noticed, you know, if you buy clothing, you know, you really like the clothing you wear

525
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:59,910
and you don't mind buying it again, but it's probably made somewhere across the planet.

526
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:07,710
Right. You know, many of the things, especially, for example, if you're functioning in

527
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:12,690
the information venue aspect of things, you might be getting your information from

528
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:15,690
someone on the Internet that's on the other side of the planet.

529
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:20,170
I mean, you like using browsers that are global.

530
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:24,950
You like using, you know, financial things that are global.

531
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:30,650
You know, all these other things, you know, but oh, we're going to have someone that's

532
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,670
going to run our country that is globalist.

533
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,430
OK. Yeah. Uh-huh.

534
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:40,130
Of course, they better be a globalist, they better understand how small the Earth is

535
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:44,950
right now. You know, the thing, the question of discussion that is never brought up is

536
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:48,530
that what is the quality of the rule and what is the quality of the character of this

537
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:52,270
individual based on their performance of their position?

538
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:58,510
I would actually prefer someone who is pretty much intent on and I should not do what I

539
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,530
prefer, but what can be preferred, let's say.

540
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:05,910
As someone who is intent on understanding how small things are on the planet right now

541
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:10,970
or things, meaning transactions and dealings and whatever, years ago, if you wanted to

542
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:13,350
go from one side of the planet to the other, it took months.

543
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,810
Now you can do it in less than a day.

544
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:21,790
So there's this not necessarily rapid, but it is rapid growth or connect connectivity

545
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:26,250
and it is good to have people that are familiar and even foreigners at this point

546
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:30,930
because it seems like all of your government's in receivership, if you know what that

547
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,490
means, as long as it is benevolent.

548
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:39,470
So the point here is, is any kind of rulership or leadership or guidance benevolent or

549
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,150
malevolent? Right.

550
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:47,090
And I would suggest that if if you did some research, you would find that it's

551
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:49,830
malevolent, pretty much all of it.

552
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:57,870
And is a terminal, yes, meaning it will come to a not a good end, of course, but the

553
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:03,070
thing is, it's it's termination is sometimes brought quickly, sometimes

554
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,210
multigenerational.

555
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:09,210
But what is going on on this planet with by, let's say, you folks, you know, humans

556
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,650
and myself included, is is not good.

557
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:14,270
It's terminal and it's malevolent.

558
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:20,430
And let's not forget, let's put the Hollywood and religious iconography and and

559
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,990
creative writing and stuff aside.

560
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:28,050
When something is truly malevolent, it always appears as being malevolent.

561
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:30,270
Right. Rat poison appears as a delicious meal.

562
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:35,110
Right. Counterfeit, let's say, notes always appear to be non-counterfeit notes.

563
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:41,990
Right. Things they tend to mimic what something of a better quality or

564
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:44,710
benevolence that people are typically pursuing.

565
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:51,350
So be aware of when when people say that these are the good guys and those are the

566
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:53,950
bad guys. You know, how many times have you seen that, by the way?

567
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:56,350
You know, good guys and bad guys.

568
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:58,210
And what are we like five years old?

569
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:02,510
Yes. Pretty much nine years old mentality right now.

570
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:08,230
Can can you imagine going to a planet where you see some anthropomorphic figures that

571
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:14,590
have been granted directly through external input, the ability to work with their

572
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:20,990
environment, how to work with stone, how to work with metal, how to weave fabrics, how

573
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:25,970
to actually build edifices and buildings and things like that and work on what's called

574
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:29,030
chemistry and other things and various forms of engineering.

575
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:34,390
And they tend to to make things that could be helpful and things that could be very

576
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:37,610
dangerous. But they're pretty much locked into a nine year old mentality.

577
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:40,230
I'm just going to say this once.

578
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:44,530
I rarely say it. But when you look at these people of great authority, because the

579
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:49,490
covenant that I live by, it's not to curse or badmouth the leadership because the

580
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:53,570
leadership is there. The gods put them in place based on what they think of you, the

581
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:55,090
people as a whole or as a group.

582
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:58,030
And it doesn't take much to spoil the whole bunch.

583
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:03,070
But anyway, when you look at these people, these multiple star generals or these old

584
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:07,830
captains of industry and all these tough looking guys, I assure you and gals.

585
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:12,990
No matter how many degrees they have after their name or how many stars on their

586
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:16,830
shoulder or whatever experience they've had, they have not matured beyond the nine

587
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:17,790
year old mentality.

588
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:20,570
Ten, if they're fortunate.

589
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:25,150
And this is the status of humanity right now.

590
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:29,250
And why do I say that? Because if you have the maturity of a 12 year old, you will be

591
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:35,130
fired. You will show up whatever institution you're working and you will say, what the

592
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:36,270
heck is going on here?

593
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:38,430
Let's do it the right way.

594
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:44,550
Right. So and by the way, folks, I don't discuss the military much, but there's no

595
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:48,650
need to discuss it because it's what the gods use also, by the way.

596
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:54,010
But what's interesting, I remember once very young getting a job at what they call a

597
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:56,310
job. It could have been a job also.

598
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:04,710
With a convenience type store 30 plus years ago, and the manager met me and he said,

599
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:07,170
you know, it's like $2.50 an hour and all you could steal.

600
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:09,530
And I looked at him, I was like, what?

601
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:13,270
OK, what's going on here?

602
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:17,370
That was like a taste of the real world, you know, it's all you could steal.

603
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:22,190
I see. So here's the here's someone who's supposedly minding the store, has a new

604
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:26,190
hire and says it's X amount per hour, you know, wage and all you could steal.

605
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:29,290
All right. OK, this is what's going on.

606
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:34,630
Right. When you're brought in to one of these institutions, military type, the

607
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,170
doesn't matter what country you're in.

608
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:40,810
It's basically that we have all these armaments, you know, you could do what you

609
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:41,950
want. Just don't get caught.

610
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:47,110
All right. I hope that gives a little bit of insight into what's called the news.

611
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:51,430
And whenever you hear the good guys and the bad guys and all that stuff, that

612
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,590
ridiculous crap, this is a human condition.

613
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:58,910
Doesn't matter if you're in the military, in the legal society, medical society or

614
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:00,610
prankster in the religious society.

615
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:04,630
When I say the religious society, it doesn't matter what religion, because none of

616
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:08,810
them know or do anything that's in any of the texts that they alleged to subscribe

617
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:13,990
to. So ultimately, I've been kind of going on here for almost an hour.

618
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,810
Well, what I'd like to say is that Greek, you know, you don't have any solutions.

619
00:47:19,070 --> 00:47:21,370
You know, no one's ever really said that to me, by the way.

620
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:23,210
The solution is very simple.

621
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:24,770
It's set yourself apart from it.

622
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:30,330
First, you ever notice in certain conditions that could be a calm condition looking

623
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:33,950
for a solution. You take a little more time and then you might have more of an

624
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:39,250
emergency type condition, like let's say a really bad what's called a car accident.

625
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:42,530
And the people on the sidewalk are panicking or throwing up because of the

626
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:47,230
dismembered bodies. And here comes the emergency crew and they're as cool as a

627
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:51,750
cucumber. And they just, you know, put all the intestines in a bag and discuss what

628
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,170
they're going to have for lunch in an hour.

629
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:57,350
All right. You know, like emergent people that are have training in emergency

630
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,290
situations tend to keep their cool.

631
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:03,010
But there's always some kind of solution, you see.

632
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:04,530
And it's so simple.

633
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:10,770
You know, the problem is not how would you say, OK, institutionally, what is being

634
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:13,070
put out there regarding problem solution?

635
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:16,690
You're not going to get any solution because there's no way to monetize that kind

636
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:21,530
of behavior. We just spoke about how the credit system is monetizing behavior.

637
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:26,530
Right. The solution is time based.

638
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:31,590
It's a terminal one, meaning you are actually as a human group and animals as

639
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:35,350
well that are here to accompany humans in their environment.

640
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:38,650
You're in a terminal condition where you're going to go to the next level.

641
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:43,170
And essentially, based on all the questions that I get regarding scripture, this

642
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,990
might tie in for you guys, because I know you're thinking about it, at least, you

643
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:48,530
know, privately, the emails I've been getting in private conversations.

644
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:55,950
One of the qualities of the termination of this condition and leading to the next

645
00:48:55,950 --> 00:49:02,550
condition, the main thing is the elimination and the existence of something

646
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:04,770
called death, entropy.

647
00:49:05,930 --> 00:49:12,550
Yes. Can you imagine a world or a universe where there is none or very little or no

648
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:15,950
death? Yeah, I say, can you imagine?

649
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:19,710
Right. Or you notice I didn't say, would you or may you?

650
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:22,230
It's can you? And the answer to that is very difficult.

651
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:24,170
It's very difficult to imagine that.

652
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:31,230
Right. And that is the so, you know, why is it that there is no accurate discussion of

653
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:32,870
things to come? None whatsoever.

654
00:49:33,370 --> 00:49:35,510
Why? You ever think about that?

655
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:37,790
Don't. Because you'll go nuts thinking about it.

656
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:42,490
Right. Because the only way to actually see that is when you're given.

657
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:45,370
Well, first of all, you have to be inspired to have the interest.

658
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:49,950
Second of all, you have to be given the information that satisfies that interest.

659
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:53,090
And you have to have the ability to validate and verify it.

660
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:58,930
But right now, perhaps the status of the mindset and it's all about mindset, not

661
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:00,530
information, by the way.

662
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:09,310
Right. The status of the mindset is so piss poor, qualitatively, that the quantity of

663
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:11,510
what is being discussed is absolute rubbish.

664
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:16,370
Absolutely. Now, just because everything that's being discussed is everything, mostly

665
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:22,530
in media and alternative media and university and the pulpit and underground and behind

666
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:24,450
closed doors is absolute rubbish.

667
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:27,030
Why? Why is it rubbish?

668
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:33,690
Think about it. Anyone want to answer why pretty much everything that is being discussed

669
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:34,670
and thought of is rubbish?

670
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:36,810
And I mean, absolute rubbish, total garbage.

671
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:38,770
Why? Think about it.

672
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:41,570
Sounds like a big, tall, arrogant, dogmatic statement.

673
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:45,750
But see if I could get an answer from someone in chat or call and we'll get let that

674
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:49,770
fly for about 30 seconds while I take a drink of some of this delicious water.

675
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:55,530
OK, why is everything that is being discussed garbage?

676
00:50:55,670 --> 00:51:00,550
No answer yet. But before that, let someone think about it, perhaps if they can't reach

677
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:01,750
out, I will answer that.

678
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:04,830
Sounds like we need. Here's a question from Chad.

679
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:07,970
Sounds like we need to guard our loins against the circumstances.

680
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:09,730
Earth here. Now we can't escape.

681
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:11,330
Setting apart won't change the world.

682
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:12,650
But sounds like it'll change us.

683
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:14,850
Right. Well, no, it won't change you.

684
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:15,930
It'll change your mindset.

685
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:18,710
You'll still be the same, but your behavior will be different.

686
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:23,290
Remember, tying this into the credit based economy, they're betting on your behavior.

687
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:26,610
For example, we'll just go back to the credit just for a moment.

688
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:30,610
Banks don't loan. There is no such thing as a lending institution.

689
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:31,890
You show up, they have nothing.

690
00:51:32,470 --> 00:51:37,750
You sign a piece of paper, they deposit it and the money, whatever funds were on the

691
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,970
paper with your signatures created out of thin air.

692
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:44,450
And they're betting on you believing that that is a debt and you have to pay it back.

693
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:47,190
And that's how they put it on the secondary market.

694
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,090
That's how they make their living.

695
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:54,290
The banksters were pretty, were pretty, were pretty smart.

696
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:57,830
They said in order for them to do the receivership, they have to get at least one third of the

697
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:01,410
population approaching half if they could to get on board.

698
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:04,530
In other words, they make their living by pranking everyone else.

699
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:10,290
One of one one indirect comment, I think it was JP Morgan or someone else.

700
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:15,830
He was asked later on in life, what are you going to do if the people find out the

701
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:20,550
let's say pranking and deceit that is involved in this banking system?

702
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:21,850
He says, oh, that's really easy.

703
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:26,350
I'll just print enough money to hire half of the people to kill the other half.

704
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,890
Right. So it's very simple.

705
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:35,110
Any any any government or institution, even corporate or whatever that is in

706
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:39,730
receivership, they try to get as many people as their employees as possible, because

707
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:43,010
once they got you as an employee, there's no way you're going to anyway.

708
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:48,090
So here I'm getting some answers on regarding why everything everyone is discussing is

709
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:50,610
rubbish. Is it rubbish because everyone is deceived?

710
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:55,570
Yeah, pretty much. But the deception can come only when you're there's lack of validation.

711
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:59,590
Right. And responsibility in this cosmic censorship.

712
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:03,890
Yes, that's tied into it's rubbish because it's based on the lies deception.

713
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:07,430
We're going to answer back why everything being discussed is rubbish.

714
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:08,870
And I think you will find it interesting.

715
00:53:10,290 --> 00:53:17,890
Greetings, everyone, this is Uncommon Sense with the Greek, and it's also

716
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:20,350
Uncommon Radio at Uncommon Radio dot com.

717
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:27,090
But in terms of discussing Uncommon Sense, before we went to the break, I pretty

718
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:31,230
much made a statement, let's just say, however it could be described that pretty

719
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:34,690
much everything that is being discussed is rubbish and why.

720
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:37,350
And there were some pretty good answers actually coming around.

721
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:38,850
But this is going to be very, very simple.

722
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:46,070
Folks, I gave a little bit of a metaphor earlier about how one of the financial

723
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:51,310
moguls was asked if the deception of the money system were to be uncovered, what

724
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:54,610
would he do? He would hire half the people to just kill the other half of the

725
00:53:54,610 --> 00:54:00,010
people simply by just printing, you know, fungible assets, right, or money, what

726
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:01,970
they call. So here's the interesting thing.

727
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:06,350
If you listen to people forming groups and by the way, there's something called

728
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:11,650
The Crowd. It's a book or you could it's the best way to engage with a book, by the

729
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:15,770
way, is through audio, because years ago people didn't read silently.

730
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:19,950
So anyway, that's perhaps something we can discuss again in the future.

731
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:22,610
An audio book is the way to go.

732
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:27,830
But Gustave Le Bon, L-E-B-O-N, is someone who wrote something called The Crowd.

733
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:31,490
And he tries to, let's say, objectify why these crowds form.

734
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:34,790
Right. And there's always an idea behind it.

735
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:41,230
Now, if you listen to the various groups and the various ideologies, whether they be

736
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:48,170
political, scientific, religious or whatever, the people treasure, treasure these

737
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:53,530
things. Right. And they blindly and wholeheartedly, they have to be wholeheartedly

738
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:56,730
into it, because if there's doubt, they don't really they're not consistent about

739
00:54:56,730 --> 00:55:01,330
joining the group. So why is everything out there that's being said is rubbish?

740
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:05,830
Because one man's rubbish is another man's treasure.

741
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:14,270
And this is where the entire concept of disinformation and misinformation has evolved

742
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:18,870
and unraveled into being the state of affairs in human society today.

743
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:24,110
By the way, disinformation is done by or disinformant is done by someone who knows that

744
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:28,770
it is untrue, but they're putting it out in terms of false information because that's

745
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:33,730
their job. Misinformation or the misinformed are those that receive it and think that

746
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:38,730
it's true. So you have the disinformers, which are very few, and the misinformed, which

747
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:45,550
are the many. And what has been going on is that just about every subject that is being

748
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:51,130
sonically experienced and in writing pretty much in the past, don't know how long, but

749
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:55,250
a very long time. And if you want to look at your religions, it goes back thousands of

750
00:55:55,250 --> 00:56:00,430
years is rubbish because it's rubbish on one end and treasured on the other, because

751
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:05,990
one person's rubbish is another person's treasure or one man's rubbish is another

752
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:11,410
man's treasure. Just like if you look at architecture, one man's floor is another

753
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:15,130
man's ceiling, unless you're on the top floor, of course.

754
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:22,510
So with that said, I just wanted to put that out as a loose commentary that strictly

755
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:29,350
applies to what is going on. What did he just say? That's half in jest, all in earnest,

756
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:34,130
perhaps. Start listening to what's going on, folks. Start listening to what you're

757
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:41,570
being dragged in spiritually, spiritually meaning of the mind. Right. So and with that

758
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:45,690
said, being dragged in, let's see if we can have, I think we might have someone coming

759
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:55,050
in via the Skype convention here and perhaps we will have him here momentarily. We have

760
00:56:55,050 --> 00:57:00,190
someone that has joined us on Skype. Greetings. Greetings. Hello there.

761
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:07,220
Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Yes. And you're on AFR,

762
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:14,240
Uncommon Sense. I believe this is Sam. Yes. Yes, it is. What's on your mind?

763
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:19,400
Well, forgive me for diverting a bit from what you were previously talking

764
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:27,600
about. I had a pre-written question that I wanted to throw out concerning some of the

765
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:33,580
things that you've said previously about deities and supreme beings and also certain

766
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:41,080
concepts connected to that. One of them was concerning this idea or this, what you would

767
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:48,560
probably call a truth or a fact, that the claims that are made by the supreme being

768
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:53,600
concerning creation and his supremacy have remained unbutted, sort of like a stop sign

769
00:57:54,260 --> 00:58:00,320
that somebody's put up, that nobody's contested. And so it remains until further notice.

770
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:08,660
That's right. But what you will find when you discourse with people in society is that there

771
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:16,480
is this recurrence of people daily denying the existence of the supreme being or what they think

772
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:21,360
is a supreme being. And they craft theories and narratives and claims that are meant to discredit

773
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:27,820
him and keep afloat the persistence of other religions that make contrary claims of what

774
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:35,080
the nature of reality is. So don't doesn't this collective body of contrary information constitute

775
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:42,260
a rebuttal of some sort? No, it doesn't, because it has to be done in kind. Let's just use the

776
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:46,780
legal society, for example, when they have a court case and there are filings that are being done.

777
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:53,180
If you're going to rebut one of the filings, you have to do it in the form that the court accepts.

778
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:59,940
But doesn't that validate the court to begin with? Yes. Well, it validates the jurisdiction

779
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:06,040
and the procedure, because you can go into another thing now that a court can be held anywhere. Do you

780
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:10,360
know courts are being held in people's kitchens and living rooms and out in the street all the

781
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:16,180
time? Right. But this is this is a certain methodology here. And the methodology also

782
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:22,540
applies to those. Your question is very pertinent. But but the example you gave regarding is it being

783
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:27,440
rebutted? No, that is not being rebutted in like because no one is coming forward and directly

784
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:33,040
rebutting, for example, saying, no, you didn't create it. I did or no, you didn't create it.

785
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:40,380
It wasn't created. You see nothing in like against like saying that my God created it or my deity

786
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:45,800
created it. They can't give you specifics and they can't back it up. And how is it backed up,

787
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:50,540
by the way? That's an interesting question, isn't it? Because, again, I always like to preface

788
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:55,860
several things regarding what's called the biblical text. And one of them is it leaves a

789
00:59:55,860 --> 01:00:00,100
bad taste in people's mouths, not after they hear it sometimes, but when the subject is brought

790
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:04,480
because most because of what the mainstream religions and the academics have done with it.

791
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:10,360
Right. And the other thing is that what's called the scripture or the or the Bible is not a

792
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:14,320
translation of what has been memorialized or preserved through time. It is a version.

793
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:20,080
Right. It would be like the yellow journalism versus a true account, let's say. Right.

794
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:29,360
So regarding all of these matters, it takes a lawful mind, you see, to take interest.

795
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:37,640
Most people don't have lawful thinking abilities. They just think everything is a joke and for

796
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:44,320
right reason. Right. Because they've been raised in a society that is full of pranks, pranksters

797
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:48,660
and prankster ease, let's say the pros doing the pranks and those accepting the pranks.

798
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:53,920
And also motivated through penalty where they can't see straight, just can't think clearly.

799
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:58,060
And anyone with a lawful mind will look at any claim and examine it.

800
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:04,620
And what makes the the claim just to tie back to the to the the crux of the matter is what

801
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:10,540
makes the claim within the document itself to validate the claim. It says that no one or no

802
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:16,840
else, nowhere else can you find such accuracy of things to come. Right. Other than here,

803
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:20,920
this is what's going to validate. It's one of the main validations of what's called the

804
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:27,740
scripture or the biblical text is that claims of things to come will happen. And that proves

805
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:32,780
the text. Right. Well, we're talking about specifics now. And the irony of that,

806
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:38,820
maybe throw in cosmic censorship on how, again, people are avoiding this is that it that would

807
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:43,020
be called prophecy. Right. Things to come. Right. How there is very little understanding

808
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:51,440
about, quote unquote, biblical prophecy. You'll hear a million reasons why there's prophecy is

809
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:58,980
real and other million reasons why it's not. But no one is addressing directly the prophecies that

810
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:03,700
are in scripture directly. You will hear people say there is antichrist everywhere.

811
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,520
Well, you know, so so go ahead. I sounded like you want to interject some. Yeah,

812
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:14,040
because once to come back to this idea of rebuttal, it does, at least what you're describing,

813
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:23,240
it does seem to require that the objector still validate the being in question or the scripture

814
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:30,200
in question by engaging it or perhaps even subjugating his will or understanding to it

815
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:37,240
in order to engage it lawfully or committing committing a certain part of their time to it.

816
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:44,580
Well, not this time, but also but also acquiescing to those laws, the laws under which that text

817
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:49,840
functions in order to rebut it in a way that's lawful to the being associated with that text.

818
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:56,300
And to me, that sort of feels like if I'm opposed to it or I'm an enemy of it, why would I

819
01:02:56,300 --> 01:03:03,860
want to subject myself to what it claims is the ruling understanding or the sort of constant

820
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:10,400
understanding so that I can discredit it? Why not just try to blow it up from outside externally?

821
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:14,580
Right. I mean, if I'm going to war with you, I'm not going to come into your city and sit

822
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:18,680
in your courts and try and tell you why what you're doing is unlawful. I'm going to send

823
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:22,920
a missile into your city or I'm going to lay siege to the city. I don't want to discourse.

824
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:26,720
Right. Right. Right. In other words, extend to the other aspect. Right. But

825
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:32,360
OK, there's several levels to that. And here's a few of them. Let's just bounce them around. One

826
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:38,500
is you're dealing with a non tangible in the state that we are in right now, a spirit animated

827
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:43,920
through material. Their existence is not solely dependent on our existence. In other words,

828
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:48,860
we are solely dependent on being animated through flesh and material. They do not require that,

829
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:54,080
as we know. So lobbying the missile or doing the physical destruction and in reciprocation

830
01:03:54,080 --> 01:04:01,300
doesn't work too well. Also, there is a big time difference. A thousand years for us is one day

831
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:08,720
for them. Right. So a seven thousand year reality on Earth is only seven days for them. So no matter

832
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:14,380
how much frustration or what is going on here doesn't seem like a long time on the other side,

833
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:22,040
you see. So there's that aspect to the other aspect of it. Perhaps is a commentary on the

834
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:29,840
piss poor evaluation of the information when you compare it to the level of quantity of people

835
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:34,400
that are on the planet. There are millions of people, if not billions, that have, I wouldn't

836
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:39,940
say directly examined it, but indirectly examined or know of it. And no one is putting it together

837
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:45,700
in a clear, concise way. And when I say no one, I mean, there are those, but they're not public.

838
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:51,120
Right. Because I'm saying it statistically, statistically, we don't know anyone who has

839
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:58,800
so openly. And there's a lot of pieces being put together, but it's not being holistically or

840
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:04,940
as a whole explained very simple. That's why one of the things I like to discuss is the purpose of

841
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:11,480
that. And but also keep it short and minimal, because the time for this is going to be coming.

842
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:17,960
Right. And the other interesting thing is you notice how much contention is brought. And even

843
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:21,560
those who don't know anything about it, which is the majority of the people on the planet,

844
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:26,360
meaning the document, the scripture or what's called the Bible and other things like that.

845
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:32,260
That is the main thing of contention. Other holy writs are not right as much. I mean, they might,

846
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,140
you know, depending on the fad, you know, like right now there's a big problem. A lot of

847
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:42,940
fundamental Westerners believe that Islam or the Koran and all this stuff is a problem because of

848
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:47,800
certain political issues. But throughout history, it's always been the biblical text. The other

849
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:55,280
thing about it is that regarding the time that's coming is the whole crux and the whole element of

850
01:05:55,280 --> 01:06:02,160
time. Right now, we're talking about a mindset for conservatively and most rationally,

851
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:06,800
since the Popple Bowl in the 1500s, this Gregorian calendar, which is, you know,

852
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:10,800
modification of the Julian calendar, which is another five or fifteen hundred years before that

853
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,980
is the only way that people have been considering time as a convention

854
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:21,720
or some kind of twisted, indirect, unlawful way. Like, for example, Asia has their own timekeeping.

855
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:26,560
Certain other places have forms of timekeeping, but they're not cohesive and they don't know

856
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:33,160
why they're doing it. So when we look at how time is being measured and when these things are being

857
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:38,900
told to happen, that has been abandoned. That's why when you study, for example, things to come,

858
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:44,240
it's always events. When you see this, you see that, right? Not using the ridiculous Pope's

859
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:49,320
calendar or something else. It's always, and I think we might have had a discussion

860
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:53,760
off-air once about there's a lot of contention about something called the chosen people,

861
01:06:53,960 --> 01:07:00,400
why Israel are called chosen. And most people are too immature and they think it's an elevation,

862
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:06,740
like they're better than everyone else. It's actually not the case. They're actually there

863
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:12,740
as a clock, right? Just like if you and I decide to have coffee somewhere tomorrow at 3 p.m.,

864
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:18,380
according to the wind-up toy known as the clock, we have chosen the clock. So when you hear about

865
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:24,320
Israel being the chosen, it is because of you watch them to see what's going to happen next,

866
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:30,060
you see. As a matter of fact, it's quite the opposite. When the gods choose you to do something,

867
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:40,120
it's going to rain trouble on you as a group. Go back to the original question, please.

868
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:47,780
Do you believe, let's just say at this point, it has been rebutted? Or are you stating this because

869
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:55,580
why the question? I don't feel like it's necessarily been rebutted from within,

870
01:07:55,720 --> 01:08:01,540
as you seem to be describing it as having to be in order to be lawful. But I think that people

871
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:07,560
lobby critique and theories and narratives against the scriptures and the biblical text and that

872
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:11,620
understanding. I think they've been lobbying critique at it for a very long time. Some of

873
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:17,120
the critique is arbitrary, some of it is immature, but also some of it sounds to be thought out,

874
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:23,740
invalid. And granted, I would probably have to look into it a bit more to be able to ascertain

875
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:28,760
how valid it is. But it certainly does sound as if people have made cases against it for a very

876
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:34,319
long time, to the point where it's now culturally trendy to just turn away from it. And any mention

877
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:39,720
of religion whatsoever. Well, there's a double there's a double level to it. Yes, I do suggest

878
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:44,240
people turn away from it, because what it is right now is what's called the King James Version,

879
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:49,720
or the New International Version, or all these versions. Yes, they will turn away from it.

880
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:54,000
And they're going to go back to, you know, it's the same thing with the medical field,

881
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:59,620
the legal society, science, or whatever. What is being spoken of in circles or groups or in

882
01:08:59,620 --> 01:09:05,359
the media or in university is not what's memorialized about that subject. And for example,

883
01:09:05,479 --> 01:09:09,960
the King James Version is not a memorialization of the scriptures. It is a version that has been

884
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:16,399
bantied about for political reasons, obviously. But for the average layman, these things would

885
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:20,420
still be interchangeable. Yes, erroneously so. But they wouldn't be able to tell the difference

886
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:25,160
between the King James Version and the actual text. To them, it's the same thing. So yes,

887
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:30,380
the outwardness of their attitude is, to me, still the same. They don't have anything to

888
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:36,020
do with it, because they don't see how it's valid. They will in the future. But most of them,

889
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:42,319
when I say the average, this is one thing to consider. And this is what I've deduced this to,

890
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:46,700
and anyone can if they take their time. There's a simplicity. It's not really like Occam's razor,

891
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:52,560
but you can consider it along the same mindset. When you consider what we mentioned about the

892
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,980
gods do not require material to be animated as we do, and also the time difference,

893
01:09:57,560 --> 01:10:05,220
1,000 years for us is just one day for them. OK, let me just give it another way. There is a ratio

894
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:14,600
of 360,000 to one, right? If there are 360 days in a year, do you see my point? I just gave a

895
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:21,100
little bit of a hint there. So if you're studying, you'll see the numbers divisible of 360,000 come

896
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:30,100
up quite often. It's a proportionate thing. Think about that for a moment. Recently, I had a call

897
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:34,480
with someone, and I said, look, have you ever heard of what is the meaning of life? What is

898
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:42,600
the purpose of this? And we have philosophers and academics and writers, and it's become an art to

899
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:47,120
describe the meaning of being here. It's very simple. And again, not to deduce it to oversimplify

900
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:54,260
it, but something simple enough that anyone can think. Let me give you an example. Sit down at

901
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:58,360
this table here, and I want you to sort out 7 billion of these handkerchiefs, and when you're

902
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:07,820
done, call me, and we'll go to the next level. It's very simple. We don't know what a bear is,

903
01:11:07,900 --> 01:11:11,600
but we know enough about a bear that we can discuss we know what bears are. But we really

904
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:16,020
don't, unless you sit down and have an 8-hour conversation with one. But we do know enough

905
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:20,060
about them that commonly we refer to them as bears when we know what we're discussing.

906
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:25,980
When it comes up to the society of the gods, from the low tier up to the highest,

907
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:30,760
one thing regarding their product of creation is whenever they create,

908
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:35,560
they always create in very large numbers. Everything they do is in very large numbers.

909
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:40,760
Stop being impressed by the quantity. And I've said this many, many, many times before. I call

910
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:46,460
the earth right now as inhabited by space heaters. What I mean by that is this. And this is very high

911
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:50,920
value, space heaters, because the gods say that man has a very high value. But the crux of the

912
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:56,060
matter is this. People take up space. By displacement, you could use the Archimedean

913
01:11:56,060 --> 01:12:00,020
method. You could dunk someone in a tank of water and make a line, and you could measure

914
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:04,700
how much volume they take up. So they do take up space. And also, when they're alive, they give off

915
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:09,080
heat. People, when it's cold, they huddle together to get warmth and all this, right?

916
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:15,040
The majority of people that have come to this planet are space heaters. They're smart space

917
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,340
heaters. You know how you have smartphones that do more than one thing? You'll have some

918
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:24,340
space heaters that sweep streets, others that put on uniforms and lead other very dangerous,

919
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:29,020
ignorant people. You have others that tell you to worship a Coke bottle or whatever.

920
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:34,480
You have others, right? These are intelligent space heaters. But ultimately, they're space

921
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:39,420
heaters. And a certain number of them have to come through before you go to the next level.

922
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:43,860
It's very, very simple. It's almost to the point where it sounds indifferent.

923
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:49,320
But many times I've said that all the gods are malevolent to humans or mankind in their

924
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:54,300
condition right now. All of them. There is no such thing as a benevolent god in itself,

925
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:59,800
because if any of them showed up, benevolent or malevolent, as they are, you will disintegrate.

926
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:06,080
So they have to go do it by proxy. And what makes them benevolent is they control the plan,

927
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:11,760
and they are high up on the tier, which is actually, again, I've described before that

928
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:17,260
the man's world is a vertical one. The street sweeper at the bottom and the king or the

929
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:22,900
president at the top. The world of the gods, their society is a lateral kingdom. It's in or out. It's

930
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:29,840
left or right. That's why you sit at the left hand or the right hand. When Solomon was asked to

931
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:35,320
whatever he wanted, he would be granted. He asked for wisdom. And the reason why was so he would

932
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:41,360
know how to go in and how to go out. He didn't say up or down. It's a very little, short,

933
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:47,160
little thing there. So the interesting thing here is, like I've always deduced it again,

934
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:53,480
this will tie it back to the original. You're here for three basic things. To fulfill a number

935
01:13:54,080 --> 01:14:00,400
of bloodlines, right, of this family should come through, let's say. It's not what you believe or

936
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:05,940
your political affiliation or whatever. It's what's running through your blood that the gods

937
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:11,440
are concerned through your veins, where your hereditary is, right, that they're concerned with.

938
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:16,640
A certain amount of people have to come through here and animals, by the way,

939
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:23,460
in all of creation that you see alive. And that's pretty much it. So when you understand that,

940
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:29,280
the three most important things are food, clothing and shelter. And then when you have those things

941
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:35,080
qualitatively, let's say, put together, then you can assemble a lifestyle or a behavior pattern,

942
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:40,360
which then you see what's going on amongst the rest. And you have a choice to do what they do

943
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:46,520
or set yourself apart from it based on a law form. And this is very simple. This is the purpose of

944
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:51,780
life here on Earth. And it's very simple. Now, it's not easy because try to pursue the highest

945
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:57,400
form of food, clothing and shelter that you can. It's a very simple idea, but it's not easy, is it?

946
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:03,260
All right. And the same with your behavior. So I have to go in like ten minutes. I'll try

947
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:07,640
to squeeze in two more questions. Well, I'll start with the shorter one first. You mentioned

948
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:16,380
earlier death and it caused me to think about certain verses in what's called the Bible regarding

949
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:24,980
that. And I wanted to ask death and what is called Hades. Are these angelic beings? Are there entities

950
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:28,560
that are in charge of these things? Because it mentions that they will also be thrown into the

951
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:36,100
so-called lake of fire. Right. Well, death will. Yes. And it's agents. At that time, there was going

952
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:41,700
to be a slightly different manifestation of it, too. But Hades is the Greek word for meaning empty

953
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:47,480
audio, like like, for example, heresy is another word that's used in these circles. Heresy is a

954
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:51,900
Greek word meaning what you just personally prefer. Like if you were to go to an ice cream

955
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:56,260
shop and someone's what's your heresy? In other words, I like strawberry or I like chocolate or

956
01:15:56,260 --> 01:16:01,860
vanilla. It's a personal liking. Right. Where Hades or if you go to the ice cream shop and there's

957
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:07,600
no ice cream, you say, well, the ice cream shop is Hades means it's empty. It's emptiness. That's

958
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:12,980
all that words that word means. But it's been a lot of poetic license has been granted to it,

959
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:20,080
hasn't it? Mm hmm. Right. And it's been turned into a thing or a place that's a terminal form

960
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:27,020
of existence. I assure you that. And let's just share this publicly. When when people die,

961
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:32,660
everyone goes to hell. Right. Which is Hades or it means the grave. There's several words, shale,

962
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:39,760
Tartarus, let's say. Hades, everyone goes there, you die, you know, unless you're cremated,

963
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:45,820
that gets a little more technical and no one goes to heaven. No one goes to heaven at all. Only one,

964
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:51,240
the prototype, the Christ and the rest. Why? Why does no one go to heaven? Because heaven is coming

965
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:56,460
here. It is a realm. The earth is going to be turned into, let's say, a Grand Central Station

966
01:16:56,460 --> 01:17:00,800
or a central universal hub. Here's an interesting thing to consider for all the listeners as well.

967
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:05,680
Even these new age idiots, you know, that are into this love and light and intention and

968
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:13,560
the ETs are going to come and save us and all this stupid stuff. Right. They even talk about how

969
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:20,040
the earth is being focused on. Right. So the malevolent, low level entities that are pumping

970
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:26,080
these people with these thoughts are still explaining how important humanity is. I'm just

971
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:30,360
going as a far stretch there not to be berating of the new age people and all these other

972
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:36,300
quote unquote spiritual idiots is what they are. But but, you know, it's just they deserve it

973
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:43,400
because it's just so ridiculous. Even they are professing that the importance of the position

974
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:49,320
of the earth and all the other beings in the universe. Right. You know, I've many, many times

975
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:54,500
given examples of how all of these signs are around us, but no one's paying any attention to

976
01:17:54,500 --> 01:18:01,700
them until until they're brought up, of course. So. So regarding the Hades and death, are they

977
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:08,100
can they be represented by singular angelic beings, spiritual beings? Yeah. So here's an

978
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:13,520
example in, I guess, in Western culture, you have the Grim Reaper. Right. Right. The character

979
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:18,420
personification. A lot of things in art, which is a form of communication, let's say,

980
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:25,540
are actually based on the truth. They could be a diversion or corruption of something or inaccuracy.

981
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:32,440
But very little is really. For example, I once did one of the first sonic things that I did

982
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:38,800
with Ocelli was 100 percent external input. We humanity has gotten to the point right now where

983
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:42,760
they think that their thoughts are their own, where everything is streaming in. You're actually

984
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:47,760
receiving and you're broadcasting. There's really nothing in you. And of course, there's the

985
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:51,460
misinterpretation of, you know, the kingdom of heaven is in you. It doesn't say that it says

986
01:18:51,460 --> 01:19:00,800
it's beside you. So so the thing is, yeah, you should you should be enticed by the concept of

987
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:07,820
death because it's very difficult, difficult to imagine. Right. But if death can be, let's say

988
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:16,540
if there is a Grim Reaper or some version of that, if, as you've mentioned, if gods or spiritual

989
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:20,980
beings manifest physically and you kill them and that takes them out in the spiritual realm,

990
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:25,580
if death were to do that, would that mean that it's now no more death because you've destroyed

991
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:30,900
that being? Yes. Yes. Well, it's there's certain things, you know, how there's like double negatives,

992
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:35,740
you know, it works in mathematics to a certain degree. When death is put to death, there's no

993
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:42,400
more death. And and the supreme being is not subject to death. Death is subject to him.

994
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:51,000
Right. And he has another. He does everything by proxy. Right. Like imagine you were an emperor.

995
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:57,000
You know, he doesn't do he doesn't run the nation on his own. He's got a multitude of of agents to

996
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,200
do it. So this sounds, you know, what's interesting, Samuel, is having this discussion in an open

997
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:07,260
forum is like these guys are crazy. They're talking about, you know, unseen. These guys have

998
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:13,140
friends that they talk, you know, we don't talk, but, you know, they believe in things that we

999
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:16,840
can't see right now. Yeah, of course, because it's all information based at this point. And one thing

1000
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:21,580
I've actually mentioned before that the entire what you everything in the universe. And by the

1001
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:24,560
way, whenever you hear people say, well, the universe where there's nothing in the universe

1002
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:30,120
is just the space part. But everything that you see, whether it's the table in the room, the floor

1003
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:35,740
yourself, the through a telescope, the galaxies and all that is information based, not material

1004
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:41,000
based. It's information that holds everything together. And it's a longitudinal, not transverse

1005
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:48,820
form. It's all instant. You can travel any amount of time instantly. So so you see how the the

1006
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:55,200
boundary layer on such a question how expansive it can be? Yeah. I'll try and squeeze in my last

1007
01:20:55,200 --> 01:21:02,500
question here. You've said previously also that people bear the guilt of their wrongdoing once

1008
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:09,580
they've been made aware of it. Yes, that's right. Yeah. So that's the law aspect of it. So then

1009
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:16,760
going off that, one could say that and this is kind of a popular phrase that ignorance of the law is

1010
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:25,820
an excuse. Yes, it is. OK, but it doesn't sound a lot. Judging by, you know, and I'm I'm looking at

1011
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:31,500
it perhaps from a superficial point of view, but judging by your tone and some of the criticism

1012
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:36,920
that you love and mankind in general, it doesn't really sound that way. It almost sounds as if you

1013
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:41,640
would find them guilty of their stubbornness and their ignorance. Sure. Sure. Because they

1014
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:46,440
actually admit it. Have you ever run into someone and bring up something that is of importance,

1015
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:51,340
not just because someone thinks about it, it is objectified as an important topic and say, well,

1016
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:56,980
you know, I didn't know about that. And you know what? I don't want to know and I don't care.

1017
01:21:57,660 --> 01:22:03,520
Right. Now, the other reason, but this is shorthand for something else like you said

1018
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:06,400
yourself, that people don't say what they mean and they don't mean what they say.

1019
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:10,380
So when they say they're not interested, I don't think it's tantamount to a

1020
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:15,200
to disinterest. It's still a part of that internal confusion. That's just an input.

1021
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:19,680
Disorientation. Right. And they're also being influenced by an input that allows them to be

1022
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:24,440
in that position. But the reason perhaps you would have heard the Greeks speak in such a tone and in

1023
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:29,640
such context is because when they do find out later, there's going to be gnashing of teeth,

1024
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:35,180
so to speak. There's going to be a very, very deep regret when everything is exposed.

1025
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:40,880
Right. So it's right now it might sound like the tone of the Greek is kicking them in the shins,

1026
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:44,940
but later they're going to be getting a little bit more than that. And of course,

1027
01:22:44,940 --> 01:22:49,660
it's all going to end up in a benevolent fashion. It's all going to end up beneficial for everyone.

1028
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:55,580
By the way, folks, if you subscribe to any one of these ridiculous religions or whatever,

1029
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:59,600
and you've been told to believe in an eternal, by the way, there is no eternity

1030
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:05,680
or a very long time of torment, that is not true. You will not find that. And when you read,

1031
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:09,180
when you hear about eternity or forever, you will not find that memorialized anywhere.

1032
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:16,560
What they're translating into that word is the word a eon or Olam, right, which are given slots

1033
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:23,760
of time. So, but yes, the thing isn't ages yet. Typically, they're chunks of 2000 years,

1034
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,880
typically. And though I say typically, meaning it's typical to note that astronomically,

1035
01:23:29,660 --> 01:23:36,760
right, the the ages come around every 2000 years, every 1960 or so to 2100 years.

1036
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:44,560
Okay, last question, and then I got to run because I need to get to work. But it's regarding this

1037
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:50,820
input, this hundred percent input thing. And I wanted to ask, how can a person,

1038
01:23:51,620 --> 01:24:00,840
as you've described, be 100% external input or be animated by that when he has his own agency

1039
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:06,060
and his own autonomy over the expression of his character and his personality, both of which seem

1040
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:10,980
to be considered a part of an inner intangible being through which emotions and pros and

1041
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:16,520
convictions are manifested? Yeah, on one hand, you have free will, which is harnessing an application

1042
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:21,720
of one owns sovereignty in order to act. And you have the aforementioned mechanisms of self

1043
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:26,540
government. And you seem to reside inside a person, but you feel yes, though, because we

1044
01:24:26,540 --> 01:24:31,520
have to receive the information and instruction that this constitutes 100% dependence on input.

1045
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:36,400
What about imagination, you use imagination to transmit one piece of information into another,

1046
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:42,580
but you own that imagination? Well, you own it, you own it as much as it is displayed,

1047
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:48,360
that it is being emanated from you. Here's an archetype way to look at it. There's an archetype

1048
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:53,020
for mankind, right? Meaning we have an anthropomorphic form, a spirit and a soul,

1049
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:57,700
okay? That is the archetype, basically the three year, you know, the body's animated through the

1050
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:01,180
mind and the soul keeps every, you know, it's the pulsing breath that keeps everything going.

1051
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:08,160
And one day I'll keep repeating the definition of those things. But the archetype there,

1052
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:13,020
it would be the same as the archetype, let's say, of a television or a radio. There are many,

1053
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:18,580
let's say, radios, let's say, give some brands here, we don't have to give brands. They have

1054
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:24,320
circuitry and form, right? And when you turn them on, they hiss, right? Unless they have a signal,

1055
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:29,780
like a what's called a television or a monitor. They all have their little alien sequences,

1056
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,960
meaning like, you know, you can have 1000 computer monitors built and run for 10 years,

1057
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:39,760
but they're all going to break down a little differently, right? What these radios and monitors

1058
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:45,080
and things are is they, to themselves, or let's say a computer doesn't have much,

1059
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:51,580
they require input, right? A monitor is monitoring the video signal, a speaker or audio is monitoring

1060
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:58,100
an analog projection of the sound. You know, it's the same thing that I've given the analogy,

1061
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:03,400
imagine someone sitting at a beach with a portable radio listening to jazz and, you know,

1062
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:08,000
the concept of opening up that radio and there's a little tiny jazz band in there that's being

1063
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,060
amplified is ridiculous, isn't it? Now, the ridiculousness of thinking that there's stuff

1064
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:20,180
in us is also, if you confide temporarily into the scientific community, what they keep kind of hush,

1065
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:25,940
but can be discovered, is they have discovered with all of their devices that there's nothing

1066
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:30,820
in the brain. They're trying to find memory, they're trying to find, there are impulses in

1067
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:34,420
the neurons and things when there's speech and thought, but they don't see it and they can't.

1068
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:40,380
Another example of it would be the Egyptians would mummify the bodies and various aspects

1069
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:44,720
of the organs based on their importance, but the brain they threw away because it had no purpose,

1070
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:51,400
you see. It's very interesting. What happens is we take it for granted. Like right now,

1071
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:56,220
you could be speaking or walking or tying shoelaces, you don't think of it

1072
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:03,580
very much. The thoughts, the imagination, and what makes us us, what comes out of us,

1073
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:10,500
let's say, what we think, is all external. But what makes us us, our spirit,

1074
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:15,580
like our fingerprint, things like that, that is unique to us, just like an archetype of

1075
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:22,020
manufacturing a monitor. So you would say that the imagination and personality and character

1076
01:27:22,020 --> 01:27:26,400
and things of that nature are a product of the spirit. A product of the spirit that's been,

1077
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:32,320
let's say, manufactured or the archetype of each individual. Like no two loaves of bread are baked

1078
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:38,280
alike. No two radios or no two monitors are exactly the same. The tolerances that make humans

1079
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:45,560
humans are still there. Like for example, everyone has the same intelligence. The discernment and

1080
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:55,400
ability to project it and use it are different. So that's the functionality of it. And that's the

1081
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:59,800
aspect of it. There's an archetype. See, if you start looking into archetypes, what is the base

1082
01:27:59,800 --> 01:28:06,860
aspect of things? All machines have archetypes. All living things have archetypes. What is the

1083
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:10,840
basis of them? And this is something that is, because we're taking things for granted. For

1084
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:17,500
example, I give this metaphor. If you were a spirit being and you were not familiar with the

1085
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:22,960
anthropomorphic form and you were given anthropomorphic form as an adult, you would be

1086
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:28,640
laying down on the floor wondering why you can't stand up because you have to learn how to walk.

1087
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:35,800
Right, right. Okay, well, thank you, Samuel. Sounds like you're getting ready to get going.

1088
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:40,660
I appreciate you calling in. Thank you. Thank you so much. Okay, thank you. We'll speak again.

1089
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:48,980
Thank you. Definitely. Bye then. Bye. Okay, folks, so we had someone giving some input. Again,

1090
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:56,220
hopefully it didn't labor anyone listening. But again, from most of the private messages that I

1091
01:28:56,220 --> 01:29:01,600
do get, there is a desire to discuss these matters. And one of the things that I've been saying for

1092
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:07,500
years is that starting, let's say, about six or seven years ago, what I started saying with

1093
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:12,060
there's going to be more and more interest on things, quote unquote, biblical or about the

1094
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:16,740
scripture, increasing interest, none of it or very little of it will be accurate. But the focus

1095
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:22,380
and the interest will start going there, you hear more of it being used metaphorically, and being

1096
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:28,920
brought up, but none of it is accurate, that is being given, let's say, to the masses. So I'm

1097
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:36,300
going to maybe look at the chat just for a minute here, because this is a way to interact live with

1098
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:45,280
people here. When Okay, his question, what happens when you're cremated? Why? Why would it make any

1099
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:50,580
difference? That's more of a cultural thing that nothing is too difficult for them to do. So if

1100
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:56,420
you're cremated, they can still still reassemble you or assemble you. It's just that traditionally,

1101
01:29:56,420 --> 01:30:02,200
in older cultures, a garbage was burned, and people were buried, things that people loved

1102
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:08,340
were buried. And if you look at, you know, very different cultures have their own views on that.

1103
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:13,780
So that that's something that wouldn't be too difficult if you're cremated to be reincarnated,

1104
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:18,780
let's say again. And when God's day do they reincarnate? Yes, possibly they could be granted

1105
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:24,440
that but they could also be just left downloaded in the hard drive is from what I've gotten.

1106
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:29,060
Let's see. I'm interested in your thoughts and insights concerning art. I'm an artist,

1107
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:34,980
perhaps I will email. Okay. Yeah, well, art is a form of communication. Right? Think about it.

1108
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:40,860
You know, there you have, let's just use music. For an example, you have many genres of music,

1109
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:47,060
right? And why like quoting, I think it was Satchmo that once said, they asked him,

1110
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:52,900
what music do you like? What's good music? And he says, if it sounds good, it is good.

1111
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:57,820
Right? And that's like beauties in the eye of the beholder. It's not like a rose is a rose by any

1112
01:30:57,820 --> 01:31:03,600
other name. For example, if you listen to some of this music that just if you could call it music,

1113
01:31:05,660 --> 01:31:09,920
certain genres, you know, I usually criticize it, I call it Oh, that's a love song, you know,

1114
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:15,220
or whatever, you know, it just kind of makes people rethink what they're listening to. But

1115
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:21,420
there is an aspect to it. There are aspects to it, where some things can be destructive,

1116
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:27,440
some things can be productive. But I would suggest that if you guys are familiar with

1117
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:33,880
someone called Nikola Tesla, what he was discussing regarding electricity or electrical

1118
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:40,660
fields in the universe and how man can use them, his counterpart in music would be JS Bach. And

1119
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:46,380
I'll just leave that for now. Another couple of questions here is people stubborn rejection

1120
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:50,420
of truth and valuable matters will be held accountable for the rejection future once

1121
01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:55,120
they've been told Yes, they will. But it won't be to a degree for those that know it and deny it

1122
01:31:55,120 --> 01:32:00,660
like the misinformed will not be held to the level that the disinformers are. Despite their saying

1123
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:06,640
that they didn't know or don't care. Yeah, they will be held accountable. But on accordingly.

1124
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:11,360
Another question is, I'm thinking they're responsible for what they're told despite

1125
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:16,480
rejecting. Okay, it's pretty much a same kind of thing. I have no clue their mindset or

1126
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:21,460
God standards. Yeah, it's about knowledge again. Sorry, I murmured that question out. But okay,

1127
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:31,710
not at all. Okay. Okay, there's loud mystery booms and trumpet sounds. Are they written about? Yes,

1128
01:32:31,770 --> 01:32:38,610
but not yet. And Wilhelm Reich, and armoring. Yeah, okay. That could that could be discussed

1129
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:44,550
also. This is the thing, folks. Some of these questions here were about holding people

1130
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:47,770
accountable for what they say. Do you know that in certain cultures, for example,

1131
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:55,310
if you profess publicly, and it was memorialized that you said this, for example, this being like

1132
01:32:55,310 --> 01:32:59,130
something's going to happen, and you gave a specific and it didn't happen. Do you know it

1133
01:32:59,130 --> 01:33:03,670
was like off with your head or you were thrown into a muddy pit to die or something like that?

1134
01:33:03,690 --> 01:33:08,650
You know that these things were taken very, very seriously. In previous and other cultures,

1135
01:33:08,730 --> 01:33:13,690
let's say of previous days right now, what I've noticed and one of the reasons why abstain from

1136
01:33:13,690 --> 01:33:22,850
the media, all media is that given example of financial moron, we'll make some financial

1137
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:27,710
moron as he says that he's a consultant. But anyway, he says, Oh, yeah, there's going to be

1138
01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:33,950
a financial collapse in March 15. Okay. All right. This idiot doesn't know that all financial

1139
01:33:33,950 --> 01:33:40,930
collapses happen in the fall. Oh, boy. All right. So there's a, you know, people's espousing days

1140
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:44,890
and dates and things like that. And none of it happens. And they're not being held accountable,

1141
01:33:45,290 --> 01:33:50,570
which shows that there is no quote, unquote, form of policing, or the people just don't care,

1142
01:33:50,850 --> 01:33:54,110
right? Why? Because they're being censored. They really, here's the thing, you shouldn't do

1143
01:33:54,110 --> 01:33:59,990
anything at this point. Because if you're setting yourself apart, you're watching it from from afar,

1144
01:34:00,030 --> 01:34:04,930
you just want to pray that their violence is not brought on their foulness and their violence is

1145
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:10,410
not put upon you, which is quite easily done. And I tell people, look, if you're complaining

1146
01:34:10,410 --> 01:34:14,410
about this, this or the other, you're really not paying attention, because you should be

1147
01:34:14,410 --> 01:34:18,310
appreciative that you're able to speak right now. And they're like, Well, why do you say that? I

1148
01:34:18,310 --> 01:34:22,350
said, because you should be appreciative that no one came in to where you were sleeping last night

1149
01:34:22,350 --> 01:34:26,890
and rip the liver out of your body. And they spared you then. So what do you mean? That sounds

1150
01:34:26,890 --> 01:34:32,890
kind of harsh. Yes. Are you? The earth is a very violent and harsh place. And by the way, if

1151
01:34:32,890 --> 01:34:37,910
someone tried to come in, where you were sleeping last night and try to rip out an organ out of the

1152
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:42,790
body, and you ask them why they were doing that, they say, I don't need any reason, I just feel

1153
01:34:42,790 --> 01:34:48,130
like it. And this is basically the concept of what it means to be on this planet, folks, think about

1154
01:34:48,130 --> 01:34:55,010
it. You know, that's why perhaps maybe getting into details on sort of criticizing what is being

1155
01:34:55,010 --> 01:34:59,970
said out there. One thing that I've never really gone into is discussing current events, whether

1156
01:34:59,970 --> 01:35:06,930
it's a scientific current event, or a political one, or what have you, other than the main mass

1157
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:12,970
nations and the big thing, the big things that are coming, and actually being you're being set up

1158
01:35:12,970 --> 01:35:21,830
for right now, as we speak. But anyway, you know, you know, we're, who are you going to address with

1159
01:35:21,830 --> 01:35:27,650
things rational, that's, that's the thing, maybe the best way to do it is with a, maybe some kind

1160
01:35:27,650 --> 01:35:34,270
of two hour show on a minor internet radio platform. So, yeah, let's get back to the

1161
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:40,630
thank you, I guess, again, and I'm grateful for for people participating. And folks,

1162
01:35:42,010 --> 01:35:46,070
I just want to recap here, for the purpose of doing this,

1163
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:54,470
uncommon sense is that two hours a week, you could come and be dummy load free. And the thing about,

1164
01:35:54,570 --> 01:35:59,710
well, it's two hours, it takes about an hour to undo the dummy load that that's been put on you

1165
01:35:59,710 --> 01:36:06,990
from all the other stuff. And it is not a criticism directly, but indirectly to everything

1166
01:36:06,990 --> 01:36:17,010
else out there. One way to discern what is being said is to just see where liability is being shed.

1167
01:36:17,850 --> 01:36:22,410
Folks, you ever hear people say, you know, they're critical about a subject, whether it's

1168
01:36:22,410 --> 01:36:31,470
whatever, and say, well, our banks are doing this, our military, our courts, and this is just,

1169
01:36:31,630 --> 01:36:35,090
you know, we're not talking about, you know, the person speaking that you're hearing this from now

1170
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:40,910
is either a host or a guest or writing an article or has a website or something or even on mainstream

1171
01:36:40,910 --> 01:36:46,490
or in the movies. These are not people that are in that society, and they're still calling it

1172
01:36:46,490 --> 01:36:51,230
theirs. Be careful with that. But by the way, other than that being the mark of a moron,

1173
01:36:52,030 --> 01:36:57,410
that is the mark of, there's a spiritual, let's say, quote, unquote, karmic

1174
01:36:58,490 --> 01:37:03,390
evolution. When you become part of that and you agree with that, now you're taking liability

1175
01:37:04,370 --> 01:37:09,010
for that. So, for example, I've heard recently someone say, our military. I'm like, oh,

1176
01:37:09,070 --> 01:37:13,590
wait a second. Okay, this person is not in the military, you know, whatever, you know,

1177
01:37:13,650 --> 01:37:18,770
and they profess not being, but they're calling it our military. What they are doing when they do

1178
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:23,850
that is that anything that the military does, they now attach the liability to them or whoever

1179
01:37:23,850 --> 01:37:31,230
says it's ours. You see, liability meaning you take the hit spiritually, and you see, our banks,

1180
01:37:31,390 --> 01:37:35,930
our government, our this, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second. So, be careful and listen

1181
01:37:35,930 --> 01:37:43,350
to whenever you hear liability being put on you, the listener. That is an initial mark that this

1182
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:53,290
is a lazy, spiritual, lazy, sonic emanation, and it's just blazing, lazy goop, but I just want to

1183
01:37:53,290 --> 01:38:00,670
go back to the idea of doing a two-hour, presumably dummy load free for whoever's tuning in,

1184
01:38:00,790 --> 01:38:05,450
and especially down the stream with archives as well, is that there is still the possibility of

1185
01:38:05,450 --> 01:38:11,370
the Greek doing other projects that are on the inane net or internet. Discussing many of these

1186
01:38:11,370 --> 01:38:15,270
matters. It seems like two hours is just a matter of getting, you know, warmed up before you run

1187
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:21,470
around the block or something, but the idea of a members area, the idea of getting into more detail

1188
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:27,450
or the idea of just showing up here two hours a week solo and speaking. What kind of input can

1189
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:33,810
you folks give to AFR? What kind of input can you folks just send? Send whatever you think,

1190
01:38:34,090 --> 01:38:40,010
whatever you deem is worthy to AFR, and just go to the home page and donate something

1191
01:38:40,010 --> 01:38:46,950
and put in the subject line, this is for uncommon sense, so we kind of know what kind of input

1192
01:38:47,550 --> 01:38:51,430
can be brought and what kind of resources can be gathered.

1193
01:38:52,370 --> 01:38:57,970
What's interesting is discussing how the credit system works and based on whatever law you live

1194
01:38:57,970 --> 01:39:03,350
by, it could be viewed as I don't care or it's really deceptive, evil practice, which is most

1195
01:39:03,350 --> 01:39:08,730
likely the latter. This is what we've got, and if there's any other way, I mean if you want to

1196
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:14,570
send a pound of corn or some potatoes or a live goat or whatever, I don't think the live goat works

1197
01:39:14,570 --> 01:39:20,730
well, but the easiest way to do it now is electronic convention and there are ways, by the

1198
01:39:20,730 --> 01:39:26,930
way, of doing it conditionally. If you folks understand unconditional and conditional, that's

1199
01:39:26,930 --> 01:39:31,810
a whole other discussion, but if anyone wants to understand the money system a little bit more and

1200
01:39:31,810 --> 01:39:37,470
how topsy-turvy and how crazy this world is, all the countries have a similar code or tend to.

1201
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:51,310
Go into a browser and type in USC12 section 411. It's just one paragraph. It would be United

1202
01:39:51,310 --> 01:39:57,330
States Code section 411, Title 12 section 411. It basically tells you that these Federal Reserve

1203
01:39:57,330 --> 01:40:01,730
notes are only to be used by Federal Reserve agents and no other use is authorized.

1204
01:40:02,650 --> 01:40:10,070
So, we're kind of like in this screwy kind of, really, it's a dirty system. Now, whether it's the

1205
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:17,430
money system or whether it's the religious system, all of them, whether it's the medical system,

1206
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:21,650
the legal system, even sports. By the way, when you watch something like the Stupid Bowl,

1207
01:40:21,810 --> 01:40:26,450
that is completely fixed. All the stuff is fixed. Not everyone in there knows it, but the key people

1208
01:40:26,450 --> 01:40:33,270
do. All the systems right now are just to keep everything going because a certain number of

1209
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:38,710
space eaters have to come through. Sorry, folks. You know, there was something interesting to be

1210
01:40:38,710 --> 01:40:43,870
garnered from all the popularity that's gone to the movie known as The Matrix and the series there.

1211
01:40:47,470 --> 01:40:51,570
There's some interesting points there and most of it, I would say, the gist is true,

1212
01:40:51,990 --> 01:40:55,330
but the interesting thing is if you're killed in The Matrix, you're killed in real life,

1213
01:40:55,330 --> 01:41:01,490
and I like to use that metaphor because that's also a commentary on the realm of the gods and how

1214
01:41:01,490 --> 01:41:06,910
they exist also when they manifest. If anyone is familiar with the Mahabharata, there's a story

1215
01:41:06,910 --> 01:41:11,610
there about a prince shooting, I believe it was an antelope or a deer that was a god that had

1216
01:41:11,610 --> 01:41:20,270
been manifest and he's in big trouble. You know, you can see how these films somehow do copy and

1217
01:41:20,270 --> 01:41:24,790
do project the sense of what is going on, but I don't like to use them as references like many

1218
01:41:24,790 --> 01:41:29,350
people do because I think there are things that have been memorialized of higher significance that

1219
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:37,390
can be. So again, things of higher significance, I just wanted to say that it's best to discuss

1220
01:41:37,390 --> 01:41:41,690
what can be discussed and of course, I am still curious and we're probably going to make it a

1221
01:41:41,690 --> 01:41:48,090
project here for the next two weeks, so it's four weeks total of Uncommon Sense to see how much

1222
01:41:48,090 --> 01:41:54,770
public support can be garnered from the quote-unquote public and it would be towards AFR

1223
01:41:54,770 --> 01:42:01,770
to see if Uncommon Radio, which is put together by the Greeks, should assemble a members area or

1224
01:42:01,770 --> 01:42:09,450
someplace where things can be just a little bit more in depth based on different matters. And

1225
01:42:09,450 --> 01:42:14,330
again, I just want to thank everyone who has reached out and sent emails and also in the

1226
01:42:14,330 --> 01:42:19,370
chat or anything else because coming here for two hours a week and just openly discussing anything

1227
01:42:19,370 --> 01:42:25,110
is great, but it also requires some feedback and I want to thank whoever calls in or even anyone

1228
01:42:25,110 --> 01:42:31,930
in the chat because especially what I have found out at the public at large is just ridiculous and

1229
01:42:31,930 --> 01:42:36,430
vile and just however you want to comment on people and what they have their hope in

1230
01:42:36,430 --> 01:42:42,770
is completely fruitless. Their desires are completely just off the mark. I mean, they're

1231
01:42:42,770 --> 01:42:48,430
just existing, but what I have found out is that when this type of conversation is instigated,

1232
01:42:49,450 --> 01:42:54,210
the feedback that I get is always very positive and very pertinent and it comes from almost

1233
01:42:54,210 --> 01:43:02,130
every aspect of young, old, international. It seems like there is an interest and

1234
01:43:03,090 --> 01:43:09,550
something to look for that I've been saying for over a decade is that if you just study

1235
01:43:09,550 --> 01:43:15,110
what things should be based on, like the lawful pretext of something, and I'm not talking about

1236
01:43:15,110 --> 01:43:19,650
the legal society because there's not one attorney that knows any law because if he did study law

1237
01:43:19,650 --> 01:43:25,090
in context, he would go to work or his friends in the bar association would have him disbarred,

1238
01:43:25,150 --> 01:43:29,450
period. That is the truth of the matter. Now, there might be some of them that do it privately,

1239
01:43:29,570 --> 01:43:33,590
but I'm sure they're grinding and they're trying to figure out how to get out of that field and

1240
01:43:33,590 --> 01:43:38,450
a lot of them do, but there are no attorneys that know law because if they profess to know law

1241
01:43:38,450 --> 01:43:47,010
and operate lawfully, they will lose their position. When I say law or lawful, it means

1242
01:43:47,010 --> 01:43:55,990
what things should be based on by the way that we exist. For example, if you go somewhere and buy

1243
01:43:55,990 --> 01:44:03,710
mashed potatoes to consume as food and you look at what's called the ingredients and you see a list

1244
01:44:03,710 --> 01:44:10,470
of 50 items there and it's hard to find where the potatoes are, can you say those are lawfully

1245
01:44:10,470 --> 01:44:18,470
mashed potatoes or are they in name only? Anyone that is pursuing anything than just beyond what

1246
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:26,690
is in name only and what is it based on, you're going to have an advantage in this society whether

1247
01:44:26,690 --> 01:44:31,610
you're set apart or not in the future because people are going to start going back and all

1248
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:37,350
of these things that you're being influenced with, political or however they are, are always

1249
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:42,790
temporary and fall by the wayside, but once you get a grip on what is the foundation and what is

1250
01:44:42,790 --> 01:44:49,710
lawful and what is tangible, that stays and you use that as a judgment or a ruler to see the

1251
01:44:49,710 --> 01:44:56,170
quality of what's being discussed or what's being presented and that is ultimately where mankind

1252
01:44:56,170 --> 01:45:05,490
should be or will be. So again, let's just consider this sonic event, the next and the

1253
01:45:05,490 --> 01:45:11,070
next two episodes to be what would pretty much be presented in a member's area and also

1254
01:45:11,070 --> 01:45:16,290
as an experiment again to see how much support can be garnered from Greek speak or

1255
01:45:16,290 --> 01:45:23,350
Uncommon Sense and I'm sure it will be appreciated at AFR because also they've been providing the

1256
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:29,330
platform for the Greek to come consistently and do sonic events with others or just

1257
01:45:29,330 --> 01:45:37,530
solo as he is right now. So in essence, it is sort of an experiment to see how much

1258
01:45:37,530 --> 01:45:42,590
support can be garnered for both, but at this point I want to also thank everyone who has

1259
01:45:42,590 --> 01:45:51,030
sent some support and because obviously you deserve it and thank you and again as time

1260
01:45:51,030 --> 01:45:56,970
goes on we'll see what kind of projects can be in garnered but to be developed, but as it

1261
01:45:56,970 --> 01:46:03,370
stands so far not much support has been sent for creating a member's area or something too

1262
01:46:03,370 --> 01:46:11,850
specific. So we'd like to see a little more in number if possible or a quantity of some kind of

1263
01:46:11,850 --> 01:46:20,150
something because it takes quite a bit of effort to do a more of an exclusive information

1264
01:46:21,050 --> 01:46:26,030
informational base. Otherwise we'll just keep showing up and discussing what can be done here

1265
01:46:27,150 --> 01:46:35,490
every week for two hours. So let's see if there's anything else here that anyone wants to

1266
01:46:36,130 --> 01:46:43,490
ask. Not really. We just have a few more minutes left and I just want everyone to consider

1267
01:46:43,490 --> 01:46:49,090
that no matter where you are in the world, if you get up early enough and you notice the sun

1268
01:46:49,090 --> 01:46:54,350
is rising, you notice that the past few days and perhaps tomorrow it is going to be rising

1269
01:46:55,110 --> 01:47:00,270
cardinal east and I mean due east. If you look at how the light comes into a room or a house,

1270
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:09,250
notice how much different it is if you can. So it'll be the first week of the first month the

1271
01:47:09,250 --> 01:47:12,690
next time we come around and I want to thank everyone for coming around this time

1272
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:15,890
and thank you again and for Uncommon Sense.
