00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,770
Greetings everyone and welcome to Uncommon Radio, Pagan Time, it's March 16th, 2017.

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,550
Yes, I did say that P word with a capital G, yeah, just for time marking.

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:16,250
It seems to be a courtesy that helps people when they're looking at archives and things

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:22,230
or knowing if you're getting it somewhere streaming later or live, and this is live

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,750
or as live can be, let's say, but in terms of real things, things that are substantial

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:34,690
and lawful, yeah, that's, of course, a foreign term and concept to your average surface-dwelling

7
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:35,490
earth inhabitant.

8
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,710
Yes, you heard me correct.

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,850
It appears to be the seventh day of the first month.

10
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:42,770
Why does it appear to be?

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,090
Now, here's the thing about being lawful, yes, that's a very foreign word and no, it

12
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,430
has nothing to do with any legal society or anything.

13
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:54,010
Lawful is just what things mean or what things are based on.

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,090
For example, I once saw an unlawful carpenter.

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,090
What does that mean, unlawful?

16
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:06,570
He was doing his job unlawfully because carpenters are supposed to build things and this guy

17
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,490
couldn't get stuff built and I was wondering, maybe I'll go talk to him because he looks

18
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,070
kind of dismayed.

19
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,510
He was always either depressed or very happy or always talking about what everyone else

20
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,510
was talking about, but he wasn't good at putting stuff together.

21
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,310
So I said, well, why are you so dismayed?

22
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,370
He says, well, you know, I cut this board three times and it's still too short.

23
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,230
Yeah, that's not very lawful, is it?

24
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:37,130
Well, if you're looking at stuff, by the way, you ever notice how the sun rises?

25
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,570
Yeah, it's a thing that brings light and heat to the earth.

26
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:46,910
Yes, it rises in the east in the morning and if you were paying attention, let's say maybe

27
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:51,730
the way things are lined up or squared, you would have noticed that the sun was rising

28
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,110
cardinal east and I mean due east.

29
00:01:54,330 --> 00:02:00,250
If you live or are familiar with objects that are, let's say, aligned with the cardinal lines,

30
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,550
you know, like north, south, east, west, the sun was very squarely coming up in the east

31
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:10,370
and so was the moon and you will notice that it will start to drift off of that position

32
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,390
as the year progresses.

33
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:19,590
So one can say also, if you have these critters or species running around the planet known

34
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,210
as meteorologists and they have websites and they give little courtesy bits of information,

35
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:31,110
one of them is dawn and dusk or sunrise and sundown and you will notice that even according

36
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,370
to their half-assed averaging system, because they don't give accurate information even

37
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:41,570
with that, you will find that the days are pretty equal right now and the equinox actually

38
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,070
happened seven days ago.

39
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,510
Equinox, by the way, equi meaning to measure or equal and nox meaning night.

40
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,810
So it has to do with something that has to be measured at night.

41
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,270
Think about it for a minute.

42
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,490
Okay, well, maybe thinking will get people into trouble and we don't want to do that.

43
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,690
So how about we just say it this way.

44
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,330
You know, there's something called the sun and there's something called the moon and

45
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,710
the sun rules the day, like the day starts at high noon.

46
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,550
Look it up.

47
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,970
Have fun with that.

48
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:13,230
And by the way, when you do discover that the day starts at high noon, who are you going

49
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:13,870
to tell, right?

50
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:19,070
But the other aspect is, you know, the moon rules the month.

51
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,290
You know, that's why, you know, for example, if you studied history in some capacity, cultural

52
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,970
history and such, you notice I didn't say anthropology, but you'll find that people

53
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,550
settled their debts with the full moon.

54
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,910
That's why today they try to settle debts with you on a monthly basis.

55
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,290
Don't you get a monthly bill?

56
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:45,490
So what I like to do is discuss these things and what is lawful and what is real.

57
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,230
You know, here's the thing, folks.

58
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,150
You can approach any topic, even something you don't know anything about.

59
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,330
First go to the source.

60
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,650
Go look at its foundation.

61
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,290
Go look at what it's supposed to be based on, not how it's being, let's say, propagated.

62
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:09,970
Which speaking of propagation and other things that are proper in their term, not as proper

63
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:15,970
as in proper as in eubonics meaning proper, but propaganda and other things like that.

64
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,390
By the way, if you're in Europe, propaganda just means any kind of advertising.

65
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:26,690
But there's a thing that I've noticed, actually maybe, well, I haven't really noticed it because

66
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,710
it's quite invisible.

67
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:28,830
Let's just put it this way.

68
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,930
It's a ring and it's a ring through people's noses.

69
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,810
It's a ring through your nose, folks, yes.

70
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,150
Now you, you know who you are and you who don't have it know who you are also either way.

71
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,070
Now what this is, it's perhaps maybe, let's call it, let's dub it a cosmic ring.

72
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:50,430
And if you want to know more about this invisible ring in your nose or through your nose is

73
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,770
probably more derogatory.

74
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,190
That is known as the group mentality, crowd speak.

75
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,730
Ooh, yeah.

76
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,350
What do we have in the news this week that everybody's discussing?

77
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,670
I don't want to get into it because it's all absurd and it has been absurd ever since I've

78
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,510
been on this planet for more than half a century.

79
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,370
But let's just say this way.

80
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:16,150
Lately, I'm not going to get too specific, but this is maybe thought for food.

81
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,030
Let's just think about it this way.

82
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:23,090
There's a group of people that have been touted to be in intelligence.

83
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,310
And there's another group that is perhaps taking leaks, right?

84
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,810
And now none of this makes any sense as if it's any news.

85
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,810
I mean, is this idiocracy, folks?

86
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:44,190
You know, I mean, okay, so you have one organization that is, let's say, relies on the same medium

87
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,990
that's controlled by the other organization.

88
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,690
And this organization is supposed to be giving viable information to the people.

89
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:56,790
And it's telling you that a bunch of professional panty sniffers are listening and spying on everyone.

90
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,870
That's like what everyone's concerned about.

91
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:06,950
It's definitely a planet full of morons, times whatever morons with a capital R.

92
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,630
But here's the thing, folks.

93
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,550
I brought this up just as an example recently.

94
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,630
And think about it.

95
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,830
If you ever watch one of these old movies, yeah, old movies, you know, like when Hollywood

96
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,250
really was sort of rational.

97
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,230
I mean, even then it was maybe, well, it's just sort of rational.

98
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,490
Now, Hollywood is just stupid people making movies for more stupid people.

99
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,790
And I have firsthand experience about that in terms of meeting many of them.

100
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,030
So so here's another way to think about it, folks.

101
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:43,410
You can pretty much say that at some point or whatever, you might have seen a black and

102
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,090
white movie and you might have had a switchboard operator.

103
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:51,550
And what they did back then is they you called the main switchboard operator and they

104
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,670
patched you into where you wanted to call to until it became more automated.

105
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,930
And they were always able to listen.

106
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,370
As a matter of fact, I was mentioning with someone through history, if someone of great

107
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,730
importance, let's say a president or something, called his hometown, it was very

108
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:09,310
difficult to get phone calls in and out because all switchboard operators gathered around

109
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:15,990
to listen in to that one conversation and not manning or womaning their positions.

110
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,310
Right. So so this is very simple.

111
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:24,230
Also, if you have what's called a cellular phone contract or cellular phone legal

112
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,050
disclosure of any provider, go read it.

113
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,250
It's about five or six pages long.

114
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:30,950
Very fine print, of course, doesn't matter.

115
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,530
And you will see that they disclose many, many things in there about what is considered

116
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,590
private. And by the way, folks, what you do in private.

117
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,730
You will be rewarded for publicly anyway.

118
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,210
So I don't understand.

119
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,190
I don't want to understand.

120
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,510
And I don't see that anything can be understood through what people are discussing.

121
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:54,830
And that's just maybe let's just call it Greek speak commentary for the day.

122
00:07:54,950 --> 00:08:01,310
So if speaking of commentary, if you would like to join in some of this commentary or

123
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:06,750
have a comment on your own, this will this is a participatory event, a sonic event.

124
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:13,890
And you can call AFR in at area code two one eight three three nine eight five two

125
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:18,750
five. And it's two one eight three three nine eight five two five.

126
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:24,090
You will find that number on the left left hand side of the home page in a red box.

127
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,190
And yes, if you don't see it on the left, it's your other left.

128
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,309
So let's do also the Skype convention.

129
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:37,669
If you do like using something of greater fidelity and you have access to a keyboard

130
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,990
and a headphone and all that other good stuff, you can use the uncommon radio dot com

131
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,270
email. That is the Skype contact also.

132
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,270
So uncommon radio dot com would be the website.

133
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,610
It's a courtesy site that the Greek has for everyone.

134
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,590
So he just kind of looks prepared.

135
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:58,330
If you're discussing that, you do things about talking at people and they ask if you

136
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,570
have a website, it would be uncommon radio dot com.

137
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,230
It's just a courtesy site with archives.

138
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:07,250
And the email on that would be uncommon sense.

139
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,330
Radio one at Gmail dot com.

140
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,050
And that also happens to be the Skype contact.

141
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,410
If you put that in Skype, you and in the search context, you will find that and I will

142
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,910
bring you in perhaps and we could probably enrich the discussion hopefully.

143
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:29,410
So let's just say and also, by the way, there is a chat at American Freedom Radio, which

144
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,830
seems there seems to be eight or so people on right now.

145
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,710
And we're pretty much going to take feedback from that as well.

146
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,210
Let's hope hopefully it'll be a fortunate type of thinking there.

147
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:49,130
So again, folks, this invisible ring, I kind of threw this a few things out there, lawful

148
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,330
timekeeping, which I'll bring up.

149
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:55,730
By the way, all of you new age people, these people that you think are so awake and all

150
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:59,590
this other stuff and you're so knowledgeable and conscious.

151
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,610
Yeah, it's getting kind of old and tired, you know, keep it to yourself because it's

152
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,110
pretty obvious the minute you open your mouth, you don't know anything.

153
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,630
But anyway, let's just keep going.

154
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,070
And all you spiritual types and contemplatives and meditators as well.

155
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,950
So so just go away and you will in the future.

156
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,110
This is not necessarily a commentary that the Greek doesn't like.

157
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,030
Those types is that no one will like those types and there will be a lot of self-loathing

158
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:29,470
when things are revealed. So what what will pretty much.

159
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:36,890
Let's just say this as a as a surface dwelling earth inhabitants.

160
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:42,650
Yes. Yes. You tend to have desires and wants and you think about things hopefully.

161
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:48,430
And by judging and looking at what is being discussed and what is being what you are

162
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:53,950
being accommodated with on all of the various, let's say, media outlets.

163
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,370
Right. They could be Visual Sonic, some in print as well.

164
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:03,870
I think they're left. It's if you look at the information and qualitative

165
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,070
form, what quality is that?

166
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:10,490
And also, you know, use some discernment and rationalization.

167
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,790
And I don't want to this is the last time I'm going to bring this up.

168
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,930
But if a bunch of professional panty sniffers are being ratted on by someone stuck in some

169
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:23,510
embassy in another company, country, and it's a big surprise or a big thing for people

170
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,310
to discuss, you're all a bunch of morons.

171
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:29,630
Yes. And that is the mark of a moron discussing what is in the news.

172
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:33,470
But anyway, why am I saying those things?

173
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,250
Maybe because they're true. OK, so let's continue.

174
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:42,910
There are things that that are going to be happening and you may not be aware of it

175
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,830
if you got that invisible ring in your nose, because that ring and that invisible ring in

176
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:51,850
the nose, I think, is part of the cosmic censorship and you're not paying any

177
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,470
attention. At least it's not missing airplanes and corrupt politicians this time.

178
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,410
Right. Yeah.

179
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,430
Start learning how to think, folks.

180
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,370
You know, it's like a concept of like love.

181
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,050
People say they want love or love is good.

182
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,070
No one can define it.

183
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:12,570
Try to find find an average surface dwelling earth inhabitant, ask them what love is and

184
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,630
what you're going to walk away is everyone's going to be scratching their head.

185
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:21,070
Well, I guess it's some esoteric emotion you have to feel, man.

186
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,110
Yeah, right. Try to define something for for for starters.

187
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,610
You know, that would be real interesting to see on this planet.

188
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,410
It's you know, here's the interesting thing.

189
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,750
And I'll just bring up a little bit of politics for a moment.

190
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,390
And in the American what they call the United States of America, which is a defunct

191
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,750
corporation in receivership.

192
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:44,830
And if you understand bankruptcy law, you could look up what receivership is and the

193
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,770
trusteeship and all that, how all that works.

194
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,730
And you'll figure some things out.

195
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,670
Maybe they have something called Republicans and Democrats.

196
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,710
Now, why?

197
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,150
Why are these political parties the only thing that are discussed?

198
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:01,850
When is the let's say the founding documents or even statutory and codified laws ever

199
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,770
discussed? Uh huh.

200
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,530
Yeah, that was a rhetorical question.

201
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:08,050
But I paused like I was waiting to hear an answer.

202
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,330
You would have paused for a really long time, folks, because it's just a show.

203
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:18,110
Now, by the way, one thing I like to call this Greek speak on common radio, on

204
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,110
common sense. These are sonic events, episodes and such.

205
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,350
I like don't like calling them shows, because if you say what you mean and mean what

206
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:29,990
you say, look up what etymology etymologically what a show means.

207
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,670
And I know there's someone I'll just give a shout out to Blarg in chat.

208
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,310
Yes, I'll just mention that.

209
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:39,910
I'm sure it might be the first time someone gave him a shout out sonically.

210
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,730
He's been a wordsmith of to some degree.

211
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:49,710
Maybe he could throw in the definition of or the etymological meaning of a show.

212
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,650
You'll be surprised, folks, not what you think it is.

213
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,490
So there are many, many, many shows.

214
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,410
As a matter of fact, most of it is a show, but I try not to do it.

215
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:02,750
So anyway, let's just throw in maybe we'll do it, maybe he can't do it.

216
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:04,890
So let's just bring up etymology.

217
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:09,870
And by the way, just put in etymology and etym online.

218
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,190
I'm not promoting it or anything.

219
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,930
It's just convenient. It's not the best.

220
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,210
It seems to be the only one as well.

221
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:17,390
Go in the search box and put in the term show.

222
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,270
Now, it's a German word from what I remember.

223
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:24,790
OK, thirteen hundred exhibiting a review appearance put on with intention to

224
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:31,230
deceive. Yes, recorded from the 1520s, meaning display spectacle, so on and so forth.

225
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,770
It gives certain examples.

226
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:38,330
It hasn't really. Now, then there's, of course, as in a in a basic metaphor, non

227
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,930
metaphorical sense, let's say material sense.

228
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,290
It would be to gaze, behold, inspect, examine or choose.

229
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:48,890
But it seems like it's interesting how the deception part comes in very well.

230
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,490
There's a lot of people having shows which are very misinforming, by the way.

231
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:58,330
So anyway, let's just not be so harsh on reality, but it is a harsh reality.

232
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,170
With that said, by the way, speaking of a harsh reality.

233
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:07,670
I want to just thank everyone who has taken heed to certain requests, requests that have

234
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,550
been made in the past couple of weeks with Uncommon Radio, but perhaps doing a little

235
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:18,410
experiment to see how interest can be conveyed in the form of, let's say, exchange

236
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:25,850
and more directly would be going to the AFR homepage and contributing something and

237
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:30,330
putting in the box or the title or subject that it is for Uncommon Radio.

238
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:31,350
That would help quite a bit.

239
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:38,270
And the reason we're doing this experiment is because I like to do sonic events that

240
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,630
have that have a limited, let's say are terminated.

241
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,010
I don't like to keep things ongoing.

242
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:49,410
And after the previous one, I was considering doing a membership area or something more

243
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:54,070
exclusive. And once I discovered the amount of time and effort and cost it would take

244
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,630
to sort of assemble it properly, I was wondering it would be really funny if you did

245
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,010
something like that, like three people showed up.

246
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:08,190
Right. So how about doing an experiment where people can, let's say, have a pseudo

247
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:13,790
membership for four weeks openly on AFR with Uncommon Radio and go ahead and donate

248
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,090
what you think listening to the Greek is worth.

249
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,390
Yes. And at least you'll be getting fresh corn here.

250
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,990
You won't be having to sift corn out of anyone's poo.

251
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,470
So hopefully we'll be serving whole wheat, not puffed wheat and whole rice and not

252
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:34,310
puffed rice. So in this case, the experiment so far, we're about halfway through.

253
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,610
We said we're going to do it about four weeks.

254
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:40,390
And that experiment is just to see how much attention, let's say, quote unquote,

255
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,590
credit where the financial attention can be garnered and sent towards AFR.

256
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:50,850
So we have a kind of speaking to AFR and management there and I set a goal for the

257
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,050
four weeks, just a roundabout figure.

258
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,730
And I want to thank everyone because we're about halfway there.

259
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,250
I just pulled a figure out and I said it would be great in four weeks if we could

260
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,310
raise this amount. And I'm not going to say what it is, but I would suggest that

261
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,450
we're about halfway there.

262
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:11,390
So whoever has sent something, I want to thank you.

263
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:17,710
Thank you very much, because really at the point that we are right now, let's say

264
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:22,589
whoever we are, let's say the Greek, on getting things organized to do something

265
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:27,030
more exclusive, it's not going to happen as I see the input that's coming.

266
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:32,750
Yes, you sending emails and feedback on everything that's being sent is very

267
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,710
gracious, but it takes a lot more work than that.

268
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,930
So anyway, I see there's a couple of things, your average comments in the chat

269
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:45,250
and also there's a question, would you briefly discuss fermented food?

270
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,990
Just a moment. Let's just keep that there.

271
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:54,790
So I just wanted to extend thanks to everyone who has and I wish at some point

272
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,290
something can be done just for those people, because it takes a lot of effort

273
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,230
to go ahead and even just send it, even though it's digital currency that's being

274
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,510
created on the way.

275
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:07,870
Well, anyway, it just shows that the intent is there at least.

276
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,770
And there's something can be garnered to be used.

277
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,390
But I don't know.

278
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,490
I just want to say we're about halfway at the point where I'd like to be.

279
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:20,350
And I'd like to see if we can complete the other half tonight and next week, if

280
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:25,950
not sooner. And that would actually put everything in a place where maybe more can

281
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:30,910
be done. But there's nothing, no loss there, because I would say that if you've

282
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,310
ever heard the Greek speak for years, I'm saying it's not time yet.

283
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:39,310
That time will start rolling around, around what you folks call 2018 or commonly

284
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:43,530
because you folks are not everyone I have found out through communication on email

285
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:48,430
and things is even considering the calendar as being real anymore.

286
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,850
They've kind of seen things for what it is.

287
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,950
In other words, when it comes to keeping time, the emperor has no clothes in this

288
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,470
case. And these are things that will be considered.

289
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,770
By the way, I just want to bring something up.

290
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,070
I'm going to go to questions and emails and things tonight.

291
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,270
I was recently on a private Skype call, and it was very interesting because there

292
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,350
were I just want to comment on this very quickly.

293
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,730
There was a if you ever heard me say how people that are profess a certain religion

294
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,330
don't know anything about the book that they supposedly study, I had quite a bit of

295
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:24,050
that and a discussion with someone regarding that and just proving that was true

296
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,130
again. And someone else who was an older person, I'm not going to mention who it is,

297
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:32,650
who has garnered quite a bit of attention on the Internet regarding certain fields

298
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:39,350
and also who was very easily complicated with some of the very basic stuff that

299
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,270
you've heard out of Greek speak that should be taught to children when they're at

300
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:45,670
least eight years old about how to keep time and how everything is kind of skizzy

301
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,910
wonkus and no one is paying attention to anything and there's no accuracy and

302
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:55,250
precision. So I just wanted to state that I did a little more, quote unquote,

303
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,450
socializing this past week than I normally do.

304
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:03,230
And I still see that the world is still in a very sad state of affairs, which it

305
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,550
doesn't disappoint because it just has been that way for a very, very long time.

306
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,950
So unless you're over twenty five hundred years old, you haven't missed anything

307
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,010
worthwhile, let's say. So let's just see here.

308
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:18,550
There's a there's a question just before I wanted to get into emails and questions

309
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,970
as well. But let's just do the question for us to see.

310
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,610
Hi, Greek. Would you briefly discuss fermented foods?

311
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,590
I've heard you mention that fermented foods are very active in adverse effects

312
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,710
on a being's comfort during digestion.

313
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,410
Oh, not really. No, I haven't said that.

314
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,110
But I haven't heard that there is effect can be medicinal.

315
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:39,650
No, I've never said that if what I would say is the Greek hasn't said that.

316
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,990
Let's just say the the adverse effects aspect.

317
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:47,170
The only thing that I've noticed other than if you pass gas, it just means the

318
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,990
body's telling you, you know, don't eat that.

319
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:55,050
But the adverse effect, I did not mention anything about fermented foods being

320
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,110
adverse. I'll give the example.

321
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,010
Let's do this backwards.

322
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,990
Let's see. The first part was fermented foods and it's adverse.

323
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,910
And then digestion, the comfort for digestion and all that.

324
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,010
The adverse would have been raw foods, for example.

325
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,870
There's there was a raw diet practitioners.

326
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,070
And yes, it's it's live food.

327
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,450
It's it's very beneficial if you're active.

328
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,590
You know, look at the animals that eat raw foods all day and coarse things that

329
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,150
people wouldn't eat high in fiber and such.

330
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,690
And they're very active.

331
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:25,390
Like for an example regarding people surface dwelling earth inhabitants, let's

332
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:30,790
say you're you're a construction worker, a delivery driver, very active on foot

333
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,950
all the time, aerobics instructor or whatever.

334
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:37,070
You can you can you probably would enjoy a benefit from a raw food.

335
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,870
But if you are sedentary sitting in an office for eight hours a day, you will be

336
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,870
miserable because just sitting there.

337
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,990
And there's many other aspects to that.

338
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:48,290
By the way, when you're eating food, speaking of raw, the mastication or

339
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:52,570
chewing, there's an old saying in certain circles that says you should drink your

340
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,830
solids and chew your liquids.

341
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,230
Yeah, you heard you heard it correctly.

342
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,430
I'll say it again. Drink your solids and chew your liquids.

343
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,610
What does that mean? Well, drink your solids means that when you put food in the

344
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:08,210
mouth, chew it, chew, chew, chew, chew, chew until it becomes liquefied.

345
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:12,070
Right. And then swallow it because that's where digestion begins in the mouth.

346
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:18,310
The the the chewing the solid liquids, it would be don't guzzle drinks, mix them,

347
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,730
swish them around in the mouth because digestion begins in the mouth again.

348
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:26,350
When liquids are mixed with saliva, they tend to be accepted by the body in a more

349
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,150
favorable fashion.

350
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,510
So let's say we're addressing the question backwards.

351
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:33,030
Those are the things. But fermented foods would not necessarily.

352
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:38,210
They actually aid certain digestive processes.

353
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,070
And are they medicinal? Can they be medicinal?

354
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,430
Yeah, well, all of it's medicinal.

355
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:46,310
For example, if you had aspartame, that is medicinal like a medicine.

356
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,130
It's it was a witch doctor.

357
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:53,030
Would you give you that to put put to make your brain into Swiss cheese?

358
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,710
Maybe it's some alchemy, too.

359
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,070
Right. I'm just no, I shouldn't say that.

360
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,650
But yeah, medicinal to what kind of a doctor?

361
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,050
Yeah. Let's say you went to this witch doctor.

362
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,570
He might want to give you strychnine.

363
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,830
They might find it very medicinal for you or a poisoner.

364
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,870
Right. A pharmacist.

365
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:13,170
The word pharmacy means poison, by the way.

366
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:16,530
Pharmakia or pharmacopeia means to poison.

367
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:22,770
Yes. That's why they have the little crosses or the hatch hash mark through the R.

368
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,970
Because that's the Rosicrucian symbol, the double cross.

369
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:32,690
Anyway, look, these people, look, these Illuminati, Illuminati's are going to get us, man.

370
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,390
Right. Uh-huh.

371
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,370
No, they're just accommodating you.

372
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,550
When you change, they will change or go away.

373
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,970
Whenever you see stuff you don't like on a social level, folks,

374
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:47,610
none of that stuff can exist unless it's accommodating someone.

375
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,710
And they're into volume.

376
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:56,170
In other words, they like building institutions and things that accommodate many, many, many people.

377
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,230
They won't go after one at a time.

378
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,470
Well, they want to kind of like enforce certain things.

379
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,970
They'll try to come after you one at a time sideways.

380
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:06,030
But anyway, so the fermented foods.

381
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,870
Now, the thing that I've discussed always or the Greek has discussed on fermented foods,

382
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,530
it's a form of transmutation based on seasonal eating.

383
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:17,930
And by the way, this is a lengthy, you know, it's more than just asking what time it is

384
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,310
and telling you how to build a clock.

385
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,710
These are things that need to be considered practically and try to give a practical and

386
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,670
rational explanation.

387
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:32,010
But I think perhaps let's just shoot perhaps the next episode for being a live cooking episode

388
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:36,490
in the kitchen, making rice and potatoes and roasts and various things for two hours.

389
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:41,390
And we'll see how they come out because they've gotten very good reports on the two previous

390
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:44,890
episodes I did about a year ago with Seth Michael regarding food.

391
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:52,050
So let's just see in terms of fermented foods.

392
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,130
Let's just backtrack even further.

393
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,190
That's not in the question.

394
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:59,270
You know, when you eat seasonally, like, for example, if you live in a cold climate or cold

395
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:05,170
weathered place and you eat food that is grown in the tropics, excuse me, you will

396
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:09,330
experience your body changing to living in the tropics.

397
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:15,670
And what will happen there is you will feel cold and you might get sick and vice versa

398
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,870
if you're in the tropics and eat food that's grown in a cold place.

399
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,090
And this is an extreme example.

400
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,870
That's why you have people getting the cold in the winter when they're eating all these

401
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,450
quote unquote pagan holiday foods and things like that.

402
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:33,930
So when you actually have a food that is fermented, you know, I mean, something like a pickle

403
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:38,790
that in many cultures considered put in their hamburger or a sandwich that is a cucumber.

404
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:43,170
And when you ask for a cucumber and ask for pickle, you see that they are two very different

405
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:43,430
things.

406
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,430
But you rationalize that the cucumber is a pickled.

407
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:49,090
The pickle is a pickled cucumber.

408
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,410
You'll see that they're extremely different.

409
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,890
And pickling or fermenting is a form of transmutation.

410
00:25:54,890 --> 00:26:00,050
You'll see that with the dairy products, meat products, vegetable products, fermentations

411
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:01,090
change things.

412
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:05,490
It's, let's say, a mild form of transmutation and it changes the thing.

413
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:08,550
So you probably could eat it out of season if it's fermented.

414
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:12,650
And that's the short, long-winded answer to that question.

415
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:18,690
And food is very important to discuss because it's about food, clothing and shelter.

416
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:21,850
Let's see.

417
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,450
There's, we're offering samples of the cooking episode.

418
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,150
All right.

419
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:33,870
So the reason why a discussion of food is important is because it is one of the most

420
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:39,070
importance for being here on the most important things that you can do being on this planet.

421
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,770
You know, here's the thing.

422
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,450
And you might say, well, Greg, that sounds kind of petty or whatever.

423
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,970
You know, food is one of the most important things you do on this planet.

424
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:47,870
Yeah.

425
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,390
You know why I say that, folks?

426
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:54,110
Because I've been watching what kind of news and media you've been indulging in.

427
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,050
Yeah.

428
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:55,670
Uh-huh.

429
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:56,370
Sure.

430
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:57,230
Uh-huh.

431
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:57,830
Yeah.

432
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,850
Every week, it's just another ridiculous thing.

433
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,290
So you're going to have to get over it and you will because you're being set up.

434
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,590
And here's the thing.

435
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:10,690
I wanted to go to this email that was sent.

436
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,750
I said I was going to answer a few things on air.

437
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:19,750
And many of the responses that I give on emails perhaps have already been answered.

438
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:26,710
But I think that when the questions are brought so directly, that answering them as they come

439
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:30,950
in perhaps rehashes and re-invites more thinking on these subjects.

440
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,330
And by the way, folks, in case you don't know and you wouldn't know unless I told you,

441
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:39,570
the majority of the private messaging that I get is regarding things spiritual,

442
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:43,010
meaning of the mind and of scripture and of law.

443
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,990
There's many things to discuss.

444
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:52,590
But I would say that the majority of it is regarding ancient holy rites,

445
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,390
let's just say, in common vernacular.

446
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,230
But I love to discuss that.

447
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,990
I personally like to discuss those things with accuracy.

448
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:05,490
But I found that the public at large, they still find it in bad taste.

449
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,150
And for example, when you bring up something out of what's called biblical

450
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:11,810
or scriptural or whatever, most people say, well, I'm not religious.

451
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:17,510
When you hear that, let me translate what that means when someone says I'm not religious.

452
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,730
Because everyone is religious.

453
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:23,170
If you brush your teeth or tie your shoelaces or anything you do regularly is religious.

454
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:26,410
So what they are really saying when they say I'm not religious,

455
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,370
I'll translate that for you, in essence is,

456
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,790
I don't want to discuss that because that topic has been made so disgusting

457
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,530
by watching what everyone in mainstream religions do.

458
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,530
And I'm too sensible to be that stupid.

459
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:40,610
All right.

460
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,510
So that's what they're really saying.

461
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:46,890
So this is still the point until these mainstream institutions

462
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:49,350
start falling off to the side a little quicker.

463
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,370
They are right now.

464
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:54,110
They're all being sort of people just do it in rote.

465
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,590
They don't know why they're doing it.

466
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,250
They just do it.

467
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:59,390
And I have never heard anyone, by the way, in private,

468
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,130
ever praise the religion that they were a part of.

469
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,710
Whether it's Islam, Christianity, Buddhism or whatever.

470
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,670
In private, they'll always say, oh, yeah.

471
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,330
My parents said, oh, yeah, they're all a bunch of whatever's.

472
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,870
But, you know, but in public, it's like, oh, yeah, I'm this.

473
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:16,190
I'm this.

474
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:16,690
I'm that.

475
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:20,090
Yeah, this is Gustave Le Bon, because, you know, you know,

476
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:23,150
there could be there could be the guerrilla aspect of it.

477
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,930
Also, where you hide out, you know, when in Rome do like in Rome

478
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:30,150
or some kind of cosmic spy, you know, you want to mix in with the morons real well.

479
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:33,010
But but either way, this I just wanted to share that with everyone.

480
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,130
So if you feel that way, you feel like you're thinking that way.

481
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,810
Also, it's totally normal.

482
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,910
So that's that's one way to consider it.

483
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:46,390
But the email again, the subject is regarding many of the things I've discussed

484
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,810
regarding the subjects of the gods.

485
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,670
When I say spiritual, that is of the mind.

486
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,270
And by the way, folks, I mentioned earlier, you know,

487
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:56,610
how shameful it is to listen to these new age folks.

488
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,570
The love and light, the intent matters.

489
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,770
The you know, they're just the new age crap.

490
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,130
You know, it's just junk.

491
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:03,770
And you all know it.

492
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:05,110
Even those that do it know what it is.

493
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,290
But anyway, they can't define anything.

494
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,730
All these people think they're so spiritual, you know,

495
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,450
the reincarnation ones and all that, you know, they're so yeah.

496
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:16,970
OK, ask them to define spirit and soul.

497
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:21,890
And you'll see that they can't or they'll tell you it can't be defined.

498
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:22,470
Right.

499
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,590
They can't.

500
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,770
They don't want to.

501
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,510
They're lazy because here's the thing, folks.

502
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:34,430
The people that you're looking up to, unfortunately, are relying on your ignorance.

503
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:39,010
And they have found you to be so reliable that they're not going to change what they're doing.

504
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:44,110
So, you know, I spoke earlier before the episode started.

505
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:48,110
This chapter, let's say a sonic event to one of people at AFR.

506
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,370
And I said, you know, I don't have to speak the way I do.

507
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:54,810
You know, like I got some messages saying, you know, Greek, you got great info, great stuff.

508
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:55,830
And really, it's not about the info.

509
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:56,550
It's about the mindset.

510
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,850
Because I don't have to be this way.

511
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,650
But I don't want people to really listen because they like me.

512
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:02,070
I've seen that too much.

513
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:05,570
I've seen too much where, you know, have you listened to this person?

514
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:06,730
I said, well, what do they talk about?

515
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,050
Well, I really like them.

516
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,130
I'm like, yeah, OK, you really like them.

517
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:10,910
What are they talking about?

518
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:11,970
I really like what they're saying.

519
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,010
OK, like, what are they saying?

520
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,070
Well, I don't know, but I really like them.

521
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:16,930
Yeah, uh-huh.

522
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,910
No, no, you're all a bunch of morons.

523
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:19,970
Sorry.

524
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:25,670
And, you know, you statistically, you know, there are a few that are not, but, you know, few.

525
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:30,950
So the thing is, you've got to latch on to something that is going to create a direction,

526
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:36,030
maybe that, how about getting an invisible ball cutter to remove that invisible ring

527
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:40,630
through your nose that gets everyone to sway back and forth about what everybody else is

528
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,670
talking about and not paying attention to what is going on?

529
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:44,750
Think about it.

530
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:51,470
Anyway, so, again, regarding the spiritual aspect, when I say that, it means the mind,

531
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,870
like the PSY prefix.

532
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,510
It would be good to actually bring this up every time I would come around here for two

533
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,290
hours because, you know, I found what's interesting.

534
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:03,850
I once gave the analogy where we're working with someone part-time and they work somewhere

535
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:08,450
else full-time, and when they came to work with us, it took them about half the day to

536
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:13,630
get into the schedule of the program that we had, which was always quality-based, and

537
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,670
because they were real crappy because they just came from a regular crappy production

538
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,430
type place.

539
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,090
So really, they're only good for half the time they were there, even though we're part-time,

540
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:25,430
because it took them half the day to realize that we do things differently, let's say.

541
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,830
But then one day, I ended up speaking to someone who worked at the production place.

542
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,330
I said, I don't know what you guys are doing, but this guy, when he works with you, he comes

543
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,690
back, he's really great, you know?

544
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,030
And I'm like, oh, really?

545
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,690
Because when he comes to us, he really sucks, you know?

546
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,710
Now I realized it.

547
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:46,910
So what's going on is you folks are being dummy-loaded all week, night and day, everywhere,

548
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,270
and you tune into something like Uncommon Radio.

549
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,930
The first hour is just like getting the dummy load off, you know?

550
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:59,010
It's like if you have a spouse who teaches grade school children, when they come home,

551
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,690
they continue speaking to you as if you're in grade school or something or you're eight

552
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,750
until they kind of get that out of their system.

553
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:09,970
So I noticed a lot of the thinking questions and stuff in the beginning, even people that

554
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:13,370
email, they know there's something wrong.

555
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,430
Well, I wouldn't say it's wrong.

556
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,410
It's definitely not wrong because everyone's doing it.

557
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:22,110
But I'll tell you for sure what's going on.

558
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,130
It ain't right, that's for sure.

559
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:31,850
But I wouldn't say it's wrong because what is being done with all media streams, all

560
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:38,550
media shows, mainstream, alternative, yes, all of them that you have access is they are

561
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:45,930
accommodating a certain mindset and accommodating a certain audience, yes.

562
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:50,990
So when you ask one of these spiritual morons to find the spirit or the soul and they can't

563
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:55,930
and they don't want to, they're accommodating that ignorant mindset, right?

564
00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:01,930
So look, I've had on previous discussions, people go by what's fashionable.

565
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,630
And if you don't think it's true, if you don't have any relatives or old enough yourself

566
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,949
to remember looking at photographs in the 1970s with those tacky polyester patterns

567
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:14,370
and the wide lapels and bell bottoms, come on, you put that on because you thought it

568
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:16,650
was good looking or because everyone told you it was.

569
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:24,190
So anyway, this week, it's not so good because I'm actually looking at what you folks are

570
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:24,530
doing.

571
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:27,690
You folks meaning you know who you are and you folks who are not, you folks know who

572
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,670
you are also.

573
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:32,650
It's ridiculous and it still is and it's going to be for a little while yet.

574
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,550
In about a year, it's going to start changing.

575
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,730
And let me just give a little bit of information here again because it seems like redundancy

576
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:43,290
and repeating is important because it seems like a lot of the commentators that talk about

577
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:47,810
the panty sniffer, I mean the intelligence agencies, I mean the propagandists, I mean

578
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:53,750
the disinformists, they seem to one of the criticisms that is rational is that they always

579
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,270
repeat.

580
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:57,930
When you keep repeating a lie, it seems to be buried into people's heads, right?

581
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,130
Think about it.

582
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:04,170
So the thing is, if it keeps being repeated, it gets in people's heads.

583
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,090
Interesting.

584
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,510
Well, I'm not here.

585
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,730
The Greek isn't here to put anything in anyone's head.

586
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:14,150
But what bears repeating is this, just for the sake of efficiency, think about it.

587
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,510
Let's be efficient.

588
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,510
What is efficient?

589
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,650
It's the opposite of waste.

590
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:21,150
And by the way, when you're not efficient, the gods take it away from you.

591
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,110
So anyway, let's just look at it this way.

592
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:30,330
Very simply, what you are witnessing right now is the precursor to the formation, not

593
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:36,970
the formation, the precursor to the formation of a Middle East Union, not like the European

594
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:42,510
Union, but the power base of the world, whether it's economic, judicial, social, political,

595
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:49,950
industrial, intellectual, entertainment, religious, it's all going to be focused out

596
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:56,010
of the Middle East, what is known as Western Asia, the center part of the center mass of

597
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:56,690
the earth.

598
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,570
Yes, you may not know it.

599
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,330
You may not like it.

600
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:04,430
You may not want to like it and you may not want to know it, but sorry folks, it's

601
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:04,870
coming.

602
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:10,390
And if you know about it, you know how to make better decisions, right?

603
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,090
So it's about decision making.

604
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:18,170
Good decisions lead to good outcomes and that's called being efficient because there's

605
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,230
not a lot of waste.

606
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:24,270
What makes something considered a bad decision perhaps is that it's wasteful or you wasted

607
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,310
time and energy.

608
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:29,630
And right now is the way that I see it, all of the media that's out there, all of it

609
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,710
is just spinning your wheels.

610
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,590
It's what's called a dummy load.

611
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:36,530
Now a dummy load is something, it's an engineering term.

612
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,330
I know it's got a cutesy little kind of name.

613
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:43,590
A dummy load is a load that you put on an electrical system to see if it'll handle

614
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:45,950
what it's designed for, its capacity in the field.

615
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:51,750
So if you have an amplifier or a light or something in the bench, you load it up like

616
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:55,390
you would before it goes out in the field just to see if it works according to its design

617
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:55,850
parameters.

618
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:01,250
And right now, everyone has been dummy loaded for over, let's say a few thousand years,

619
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:05,470
but right now it's being done very quickly and very masterfully through what's called

620
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:09,610
the streams through smart devices and computers and stuff like that.

621
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:17,510
But anyway, so you are, keep in the back of your mind, you are witnessing the precursor

622
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:23,610
to the formation, not the formation but the precursor to it, the next seven years of all

623
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:30,490
eyes on a certain part of the world and you're going to be looking there and you have been

624
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:33,310
looking towards that part of the world almost every day.

625
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:39,370
Let's say on the world scene or in discussions, but you don't know why or you think you

626
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:46,510
know why because it's evoking or eliciting some emotional thing to you like, oh, look

627
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,550
at all the killing there.

628
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,530
Oh, look at all the war there.

629
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,610
Look at all the suffering.

630
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:51,690
Yeah, that's all going on.

631
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,130
But that's part of being on this planet, by the way.

632
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:59,270
And by the way, also, none of this happens without the gods allowing it to happen.

633
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:06,170
Yes, so yes, and we're not really crazy because I have imaginary friends or anything.

634
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,510
Yes, so the gods, you heard me correct.

635
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:09,690
There is no god.

636
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,190
It's all gods, plural.

637
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:17,130
And amongst them, there is a head god, supreme deity.

638
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:21,750
Yes, sorry to tell you, but that's how it works, folks, and you're going to find out

639
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,050
later.

640
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:25,690
But everything is going to be going towards what's called the Middle East.

641
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,210
And in the near future, we're going to be discussing greater detail.

642
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,810
But we might actually opt to do some of it now because I kind of mentioned this is an

643
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,030
open members area, and we have 20 minutes before the break.

644
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:37,750
So how about maybe doing a little bit of that right now?

645
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:43,870
Because this really just ties into answering what's into this email that I wanted to get

646
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,430
into, perhaps one or two or three.

647
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:55,250
And they all kind of go around the whole notion on how there's more than just political or

648
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,550
scientific reasons for why things are happening.

649
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:00,570
And scientific is supposed to be knowledge.

650
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:04,850
And it's just like any other group that professes something.

651
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:05,810
There is no knowledge.

652
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,890
And I have someone who would like to call in.

653
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:19,950
So before I start on that thought, how about I bring them in before we change another

654
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,910
thought and go into another thought.

655
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,210
So let's just see, folks.

656
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,230
I'll bring him in right now, perhaps.

657
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,210
And I believe he's been on before.

658
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,430
Let's see if he picks up.

659
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:33,670
Excuse me.

660
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:38,670
So there's much to discuss and much that can be done accurately.

661
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:43,310
But the thing is, again, folks, I've been watching what you folks listen to and pay

662
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,910
attention to, and it's just laughable.

663
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,370
Otherwise, I want to cry.

664
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:46,890
Greetings.

665
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,510
OK, I believe it's Sam, right?

666
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,370
And you want to come inside.

667
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:51,970
Greetings.

668
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:52,350
Hello.

669
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,570
Welcome to Uncommon Radio.

670
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:53,970
Greetings.

671
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:54,930
What's on your mind?

672
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:55,330
How are you, Greg?

673
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,070
Sure.

674
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:59,430
Well, I'm sorry that I interrupted what you were about to go into.

675
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,510
I did think that that was interesting.

676
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,530
Perhaps I should have waited a few minutes before.

677
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,010
No, that's all right.

678
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:11,030
But I did have a question concerning something slightly off topic, perhaps not

679
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,790
slightly, significantly off topic.

680
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:13,970
That's OK, go ahead.

681
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:17,590
I will say that it would be nice if you could come back to what you were talking

682
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,630
to later when I hang up.

683
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:25,730
But I wanted to ask a question concerning the biblical text and try to connect that

684
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:33,050
to today's times in an attempt to understand how the Christ related to certain

685
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,570
characters at that time.

686
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:43,310
So when I examine the key, many of the key characters in what is called the Old

687
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:47,330
Testament, they seem to have a common thread that runs through their narratives in

688
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:52,550
terms of how they relate to the Christ in the sense that their lives were meant to

689
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:58,290
serve a purpose in his plans in as much as their positions, wealth, influence and

690
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,610
choices advanced the kingdom of Israel.

691
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,270
Hold on, stop one minute there.

692
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,190
Did you say Old or New Testament?

693
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:05,870
Which one?

694
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:06,710
Old, old.

695
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:07,610
OK, gotcha.

696
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:08,070
OK, go ahead.

697
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:13,790
So it seemed as if those characters were very much used to advance the kingdom of

698
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,930
Israel and foreshadow the coming of the Christ himself.

699
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:23,710
And as much as the example that they set, but it doesn't seem as if the Christ put

700
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:27,470
that much of a premium on their character or morality.

701
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:30,710
And I say it seems that way anyway.

702
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:36,270
The idea of creating or molding those people into exemplary models of lawfulness

703
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,470
seems somewhat absent.

704
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:44,950
And by lawfulness, I mean that word as it is used in King James speak, thou shalt love

705
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,790
the Lord thy God with all thy heart, mind, soul.

706
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,510
The first greatest commandment.

707
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:50,370
And the second is love thy neighbor.

708
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:54,830
These two commandments on these two commandments hang all along the prophets.

709
00:41:55,330 --> 00:42:02,250
And if lawfulness is actually summed up as love thy neighbor, then it kind of feels like

710
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:06,370
a lot of those Old Testament characters fell short, even the so-called patriarchs.

711
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:10,610
Yeah, there's many aspects to it, but you have to realize what was dictated to them.

712
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:14,330
And by the way, folks, before we answer this, I just want to state that Sam, what he just

713
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:18,750
asked represents 90 percent plus of all the private questions that I get, because people

714
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:23,390
that are thinking about what's being said have some background in this.

715
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:27,690
This is not a quote unquote Christian or religious as people would take it.

716
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,270
This is just inquiring on things that are important.

717
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:34,750
I just want to say, folks, to everyone that's listening, Sam, that this is about 90 percent

718
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:38,610
of what I get behind the scenes through emails and other messages.

719
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,250
So I'm very happy to discuss it.

720
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:46,510
First of all, the interesting thing is when you look at the entire text as being holistic,

721
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:52,590
the dictation that these patriarchs or men in the Old Testament prophets and so on were

722
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:55,670
getting, it was coming from the Christ himself, right?

723
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,150
First of all.

724
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:02,290
Second of all, you'll notice that there is an irony that is displayed throughout the

725
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:04,370
history of mankind in this book.

726
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:08,410
You'll see that there's always the rights of inheritance come to the firstborn son,

727
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:12,330
but how many of the firstborn sons actually got a real right to inheritance?

728
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:17,510
It seems it's either the youngest one or the second one that gets it, right?

729
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:19,650
There's just a tremendous sense of irony.

730
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:27,550
Now, the time of discussing the neighbor, if you look at that neighbor, that word actually

731
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:30,030
means people that live in the same covenant as you do.

732
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,890
It's not just someone like a neighbor.

733
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:35,490
There's an old saying, I guess, in Western culture.

734
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,210
It says that good fences make good neighbors.

735
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:44,050
I find that to be the best saying regarding that if you're living in a mixed group, right?

736
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:48,250
This is a neighbor when you're not in a mixed group, right?

737
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:50,510
When you're not setting yourself apart from them.

738
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:51,650
Think about it.

739
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:55,890
For example, if you live in a big city, there are people that live in big cities, apartment

740
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:59,650
complexes for years and decades, and they don't even know the name of the person that

741
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:02,150
lives next to them, if you've heard this before, right?

742
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,070
I've seen that.

743
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:09,650
I would suggest that also looking into the term of what love is.

744
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:11,550
I think I brought that up earlier.

745
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:16,570
When you discuss love with people, they can't define it, just like most people can't define

746
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:21,050
spirit and soul, all these things that should be defined before we go on to the endeavor

747
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:24,390
known as life because we can use them properly once we know how to define them.

748
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:30,590
I would suggest that what you will find when you discuss things like love or what that

749
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:36,150
word evokes is some esoteric emotional feeling, right?

750
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,650
They don't know how to use it practically.

751
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:40,010
That's why you see they fail in it.

752
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:43,710
That's why you hear falling in love or why would you want to fall?

753
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:46,890
That doesn't sound good, right?

754
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:48,930
And also when people are infatuated, you know?

755
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:57,250
So the love aspect is there's the agape, the erota, and the philia, and there's other

756
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,930
aspects of it in the Hebrew.

757
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:03,630
But basically, essentially, when you're reading the ancient writs, love means doing the right

758
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:06,020
thing, even though you don't feel like doing it.

759
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:13,550
And by that definition, we can say that a lot of those people fell short, if not all

760
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:13,810
of them.

761
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:18,850
And I did want to point to a particular example that for me is a bit of a conundrum that perhaps

762
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:19,870
you could shed some light on.

763
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:27,690
And that is the character of David, who is constantly cited as one after God's own heart,

764
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:32,930
which I think is almost verbatim of what it says in the Book of Acts, and at least in the

765
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:33,570
King James Version.

766
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:38,910
And the same highlights are used to lionize him repeatedly, slaying Goliath, refusing

767
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:42,710
to kill Saul, writing the Psalms and being a mighty warrior and things of this nature.

768
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:46,750
Most of those narratives conveniently glaze over his atrocities.

769
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:49,830
He had no control over his lusts, had multiple concubines.

770
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:54,750
Unashamedly, he lied to the high priest Ahimelech about being on business from Saul when he

771
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:57,870
was actually running from Saul, causing the priest and his colleagues to be killed.

772
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:02,070
He deserted the Israelites, defected to the Philistines, the absurdity of which should

773
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:02,970
be lost on no one.

774
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:08,570
He went to live in Gath under King Ashish with the Philistines, became a bandit, raiding

775
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:10,990
the Gezerites, the Gerzaites, and the Amalekites.

776
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:12,850
And he also feigned being insane.

777
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:13,890
Right.

778
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:20,390
And, you know, he would kill the towns, everybody in the town that he'd raid and things.

779
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:20,550
Sure.

780
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:24,590
Let me just stop you right there, because this is the point also that I want to bring

781
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:24,810
up.

782
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:27,750
Remember how there's an irony I've brought up.

783
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,030
There's an irony in these things.

784
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:32,190
And the irony is that mankind is still in an unfinished state.

785
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:38,450
But what made David so elevated in terms of his persona to the most high that whenever

786
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:43,130
he realized he had screwed up, he didn't go to anyone else first.

787
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:44,870
He went to the most high first.

788
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:47,670
You see, that's why.

789
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:51,630
So, you know, that's I think I might have mentioned to you or someone else recently

790
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:56,310
that I even once had a discussion with a, quote, unquote, orthodox priest discussing

791
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:57,850
political and economic stuff.

792
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:00,690
And I brought up how this is all being put on by the most sizes.

793
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:02,050
Oh, this has nothing to do with God.

794
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:04,930
This is coming from your religious people, by the way, folks.

795
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:10,070
So this is to show you the opposite of David.

796
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:14,830
In other words, most people, even then in that culture, if you read about a lot of the

797
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:17,430
calamities that were befallen in Israel, they had many other blames.

798
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:18,350
It was the Assyrians.

799
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:19,930
Oh, it was the Babylonians.

800
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:20,590
It was this and that.

801
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:24,590
And the prophets trying to let them know it's your behavior, right?

802
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:26,430
That's doing it.

803
00:47:26,570 --> 00:47:29,170
And it's the it's the creator that's doing it, not them.

804
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:30,290
Right.

805
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:35,330
You see, so the thing about what you will get out qualitatively out of deciphering,

806
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:39,650
getting information out of it is that man is in an unfinished state that will do

807
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:45,250
what the spirit is solely when the spirit is solely manifest through material.

808
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:45,750
It does.

809
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:45,970
Right.

810
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:46,750
Because it gets corrupt.

811
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:47,170
Right.

812
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:52,870
But the thing that elevated the position honorably of David and others that do this, by the way,

813
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:58,590
not just David, but David is the one that is cited the most or the best citing would be that

814
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:04,850
when you notice something either good or bad or questionable, you go to the spiritual high

815
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,290
ranking first.

816
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:07,990
That's what it is.

817
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:12,570
It's kind of but it feels a bit unlikely that he wouldn't have known what he was doing over

818
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:13,450
the course of a year.

819
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:15,350
I mean, he lives with the Philistines for a year.

820
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:18,970
He went with the best Hebrew thing for more than a year, I think.

821
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:19,310
Yes.

822
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:22,310
Well, yeah, it's likely that he knew what he was doing.

823
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:23,370
Yeah.

824
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:26,110
Well, no, I didn't say that he didn't know what he was doing.

825
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:32,410
There's a there's a persistent there's a persistent, I would say, motivation or drive

826
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:37,790
that the physical body has, you know, the various aspects of the body has upon the

827
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:38,950
spirit, upon the mind.

828
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:44,690
How many times have you heard people having or doing things in private that they don't

829
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:47,990
talk about publicly or that's very common?

830
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:52,690
And people, you know, having different personas, you know, when you get to know them?

831
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:53,690
Yeah.

832
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:54,070
Right.

833
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:55,010
Why?

834
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:57,010
Because because there's so many ways to be.

835
00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:00,310
It's more interesting that way to them, it seems, or what if for whatever reason they're

836
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,050
doing it, it's being done at this point.

837
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:07,010
Because there's another thing that it's granted that people are not omniscient.

838
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:11,470
If they don't find or if the information regarding someone else's behavior and secret,

839
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:16,610
whether it's good or bad, is is communicated to them, they don't find out because they

840
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:19,270
don't have the ability to to find you see.

841
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:21,910
So they think because no one can see them in a human agency.

842
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:23,030
They're OK.

843
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:27,970
Like, for example, when you brought up with what David was doing through human agents

844
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,430
and him being a human agent with other humans, right?

845
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:34,770
He found that it would be it's what he wanted to expedite at the moment.

846
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:40,890
And if you'll notice, if you read between the lines and read out of it, he was not I

847
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:45,930
wouldn't say short tempered, but very dynamic, very energetic and actually thought about

848
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:49,230
it as he was doing it versus thinking about it and then doing it.

849
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:49,450
Right.

850
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:54,910
He was very much like into the moment, but but not, you know, he still understood what

851
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:57,790
was right and wrong, but he just went ahead with many things.

852
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:00,810
Also, you have to realize the dynamics of the situation at that time.

853
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:03,050
That was the height.

854
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:07,930
I would say, well, it was pre height of Israel in terms of because really they didn't

855
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:10,770
have their height till Solomon came when everyone did a tribute.

856
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:11,130
Right.

857
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:12,450
Very much.

858
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:17,610
But they were building up to their height and also the surrounding nations at the time

859
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:18,910
were almost at their height.

860
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:19,230
Right.

861
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,110
They were very powerful.

862
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:21,670
They weren't in a weakened state.

863
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:26,650
They had not been in a state where, let's say, later on, you'll notice historically

864
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:31,770
what happened is the predominant forces were Egypt, Assyria and Babylon, and everyone

865
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:33,570
else was subsided or subdued.

866
00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:38,650
This was a time before those forces were risen to subdue the others.

867
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:40,970
In other words, there was no real superpower at that time.

868
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,490
Everyone is vying for some position.

869
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:43,490
It's very, very dynamic.

870
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:49,130
I think of it as the dynamic city states in ancient Greece before the Athenians and

871
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:50,390
the right took over.

872
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:52,530
So you have to also look at the conditions.

873
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:58,570
You know, you also if you look at many of the things that were discussed regarding

874
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:00,930
David, it was a matter of life and death, just about all of them.

875
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:03,990
Even Bathsheba's husband was sent to.

876
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:04,570
Right.

877
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:07,890
It was very convenient because there was always war going on.

878
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:09,050
There's always battles going on.

879
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:12,690
And when he went to the priests and said he was on business from Saul, he actually not

880
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:15,330
only got them killed and all that, but what did he do?

881
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:20,430
He took the vestment, the ermine and to communicate whether he should fight with the

882
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:21,210
Philistines or not.

883
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:23,270
And he was told, yes, you will prevail over the Philistines.

884
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:25,110
Why wasn't he corrected then?

885
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:29,710
You see, because he had divine intervention, by the way, folks, I've mentioned this

886
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,250
before on air and I'll say it again.

887
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:35,430
These things you call this thing you call prayer or whatever, that is a technical

888
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:35,850
thing.

889
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:40,610
In other words, it's just like the radio officers in the military.

890
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,850
You know, the officer has a radio person next to him.

891
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:43,550
It's very technical.

892
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:45,090
There are technical aspects to it.

893
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:50,030
And if you look at the holy writs of the world, they tell you the technical aspects

894
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:50,710
to prayer.

895
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:53,050
It's by the way, why do they bring this up?

896
00:51:53,230 --> 00:51:56,570
It's because what you're being shown in the mainstream religions is the opposite of

897
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:58,570
what you should be doing, by the way.

898
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:00,490
So anyway, so I throw that.

899
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:02,070
No, let's get let's let's get into that.

900
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:06,390
How do you pray in a way that's acceptable to the Elohim today?

901
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:09,210
Do you direct your prayer to the Christ or to the father?

902
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:09,910
Does it matter?

903
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:12,510
That's for the members only area, man.

904
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:13,970
I'm just joking.

905
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,670
This is this is the aspect.

906
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:17,470
I said it would get more juicy, right?

907
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:19,650
These these next steps.

908
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:21,230
This is how I would consider it.

909
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:23,150
We don't need to make stuff up.

910
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:25,610
If you have access to the information, just read out of it.

911
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:26,750
Don't read into it.

912
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,410
It is to be done in private.

913
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:35,150
For example, if we look historically, let's go with the biblical convention.

914
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:37,350
There was no prayer being done at the temple.

915
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:37,750
Do you notice?

916
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:39,750
There were offerings.

917
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:44,110
The temple, by the way, let me just bring this up, because this is the way it could

918
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:44,790
be thought of.

919
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:48,130
Let's just I'm going to discuss church because that's the circus.

920
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:48,890
It means nothing.

921
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:51,510
It's very important in certain cultures.

922
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:54,590
If you look at Rome and Greece, so the circus was a central aspect.

923
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:58,390
If you said anything bad about the circus or don't go to the circus, you were viewed

924
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,230
on very negatively, just like today.

925
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:06,070
That has that thing you call C-H-U-R-C-H is not in the biblical text, not even close.

926
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:07,490
It doesn't exist.

927
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:09,370
Only they just put that word in there.

928
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:11,430
Somehow doesn't even come close.

929
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:15,630
So forget about all the stuff that you're you're being told and what you believe in

930
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,970
means absolutely nothing at this point.

931
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:21,910
You know, meaning the listening audience, what you've been told about it because it's

932
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:23,990
you can trace its roots where it goes back to.

933
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:26,930
What we're discussing is what can be traced from the founding document.

934
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:28,210
Let's say the biblical text.

935
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:32,850
When you say the temple, people equate it with churches and places of worship.

936
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:38,810
They was not every the temple is every city has a temple, but it's disbanded.

937
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:45,210
If you had like every city has a major library, a court and a place where judges are.

938
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:49,650
And we're going to complete this thought and definition when we come back.

939
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:56,230
Greetings and welcome back to Uncommon Radio, and this is the second hour and we still

940
00:53:56,230 --> 00:54:01,010
have our caller Sam and we were discussing the technical aspects of prayer, were we not?

941
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:02,330
Yes, we were.

942
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:03,790
Yeah, and this is not real.

943
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:04,910
We're not religious, man.

944
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:06,930
You know, I don't like to talk religion right now.

945
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:09,710
I'm just on a side note that this is still what you get in commentary.

946
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:11,290
It's not time yet, by the way, for this.

947
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:15,530
But what I was discussing was the definition of these these ancient temples there.

948
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:18,030
Every city still has them, but they're fragmented.

949
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:23,130
So if you have a court building, a library and a university, if you were to put all those

950
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:27,090
three aspects of a society under one roof or one complex, that would be known as a

951
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:27,350
temple.

952
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:29,110
Think about it.

953
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:32,230
And also you had the place where the priests were doing offerings.

954
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:37,430
OK, which is basically the court building still where the priests are wearing black

955
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:38,610
robes in the anyway.

956
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:42,250
Anyway, that's the situation you're in.

957
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:45,690
They're doing offerings to the justice God, the Babylonian revived anyway.

958
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:47,390
So why am I bringing this up?

959
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:50,630
Because most people have still been duped into thinking that they pray.

960
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:51,570
You've heard this in public.

961
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:52,030
Let us pray.

962
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:52,250
Right.

963
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:54,570
It's like, oh, you want to run away from that, you know?

964
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:58,330
And by the way, when I hear about all these different groups praying, I'm like, you know

965
00:54:58,330 --> 00:54:58,590
what?

966
00:54:58,950 --> 00:54:59,890
Let's be rational.

967
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:01,830
Things just seem to be getting worse.

968
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:05,010
So why don't you stop praying for a little while and see how things get?

969
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:07,970
Anyway, I was just a little private thing there.

970
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:09,610
There's more to be discussed about that.

971
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:13,690
The other thing about that is what you will notice that these temples, they had little

972
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:16,130
private booths just like the libraries did.

973
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:18,650
Everything was read out loud and done in private.

974
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:19,930
It wasn't a big open area.

975
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:20,770
It wasn't silent.

976
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:25,670
So some of these private booths were also used for quote unquote prayer.

977
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:30,290
Now, another thing you'll notice is that the Christ said, don't do like the pagans where

978
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:32,430
you go into open areas and do all this stuff.

979
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:33,690
Go into your private room.

980
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:39,610
And by the way, whenever anything is brought up that is contrary to the churchianity in

981
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:42,310
the King James, it's translated as something distasteful.

982
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:47,170
That's why they translate it as go into your closet because that's where the skeletons

983
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:49,770
are and that's where bad people come out of, right?

984
00:55:49,830 --> 00:55:52,930
You came out of the closet where skeletons in the closet, right?

985
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:57,570
So you'll always notice that King James always uses those negative connotations to things

986
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:01,770
that are lawful because, you know, remember this is a political document that people are

987
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:02,410
studying.

988
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:05,810
So you would go into a private place.

989
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:12,650
Now, another thing that I would suggest is that when you're asking, you are going in

990
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:16,610
spirit longitudinally, meaning instantly, no distance.

991
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:20,490
In other words, distance is not an object.

992
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:24,310
No matter how far away something or someone is, it's instant.

993
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:28,850
Okay, that's what longitudinal means versus transverse where you have what they discuss

994
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:30,230
speed of light and things like that.

995
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:37,450
So with that said, instant communication, the Supreme Being has an entourage around

996
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:38,450
him, okay?

997
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:41,790
And there are many layers and he tells you how the prayers come to him just like you

998
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:44,590
would send a message to an emperor, right?

999
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:46,070
It goes through many layers, doesn't it?

1000
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:51,910
And typically it's viewed based if it's against his will or for his will or whatever and it's

1001
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:53,930
viewed and previewed, right?

1002
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,130
And many of them are not listened to.

1003
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:56,730
How do I know?

1004
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:58,470
Well, it states it in the text.

1005
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:00,070
So I don't listen to you, right?

1006
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:09,970
So now, let's say, for example, if I were to say, we're going to go meet the emperor

1007
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:15,450
later and you're there in a t-shirt and sweatpants, barefoot and sandals.

1008
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:18,690
Are you ready to go or are you going to put your best clothes on?

1009
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:24,090
Most likely, because if you show up with sandals and sweatpants and barefoot, probably

1010
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:25,450
the guards won't let you in, will they?

1011
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:26,910
There's a dress code.

1012
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:28,230
There's a dress code.

1013
00:57:28,230 --> 00:57:30,330
The dress code here would be the state of being.

1014
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:33,630
And what is, let's say, clean and unclean.

1015
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:37,270
This might sound dogmatic to people, by the way, because a lot of people in various religions

1016
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:38,510
say, well, I pray and I get answers.

1017
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:38,910
Well, fine.

1018
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:39,390
Good for you.

1019
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,930
So I'm not addressing you.

1020
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:47,730
I'm discussing the aspect of what's been memorialized that can be technically accessed,

1021
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:52,290
not some cult or whatever that's been going on for thousands of years that everyone tends

1022
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:53,810
to group together about.

1023
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:59,050
The other thing that you see, and I'm doing some thesis and antithesis here about both

1024
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:01,850
of the aspects of what to do, what's being done, what not to do.

1025
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:02,970
It's all mixed up.

1026
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,450
So you want to be in a clean state.

1027
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:10,810
Now, how are you in a state that is acceptable?

1028
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:13,030
Well, he tells you, my people will do these things.

1029
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:18,010
Now, it doesn't matter what you believe in or what you think it's done away with or whatever.

1030
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:19,150
That's just what's stated.

1031
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:20,090
Okay.

1032
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:23,830
And if you want to learn about what that it's like what you eat, what you wear and days

1033
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:25,590
and time and all that stuff, right?

1034
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:26,610
That's pretty obvious.

1035
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:29,450
If you want to go to the next level with that, right?

1036
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:32,290
What I mean, obvious is if you eat certain things, you're not in a proper state.

1037
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:34,910
If you wear certain things, you're not in a proper state, right?

1038
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:35,650
Like mixed fibers.

1039
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:36,570
I'll just give it out.

1040
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:39,890
He says, my people will not wear mixed fibers, right?

1041
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:41,390
You familiar with that?

1042
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:41,750
Okay.

1043
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:46,570
So, you know, when you go to buy a shirt, you know, it's like 20% polyester, 80% cotton

1044
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:46,850
or whatever.

1045
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:48,950
It's either 100% cotton, 100% polyester.

1046
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:51,630
I had someone once say, well, polyester is no good, right?

1047
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:54,170
I said, no, no, it doesn't matter if it's synthetic or natural.

1048
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:56,750
It just should be woven with like.

1049
00:58:57,850 --> 00:58:58,050
Okay.

1050
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:59,390
So, you consider all these things.

1051
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:02,730
You also consider the time of day and things like that because there's a time of cleaning.

1052
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:05,410
You know, you are clean until evening, which is noon, by the way.

1053
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:09,470
When you read evening in what's called the King James, it means noon.

1054
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:13,950
It's not evening when the sun goes down because you can't measure sundown.

1055
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:15,910
It's sundown is actually the last hour.

1056
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:20,870
There's no measurement there other than a general, you know, division of the sky.

1057
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:23,910
And also think about it in the desert.

1058
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:26,570
It's warm or hot in the day and at night it gets really, really cold.

1059
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,430
Colder than more temperate places, right?

1060
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:34,210
So, imagine washing, doing all this washing at night and then, yeah, right.

1061
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:34,710
Uh-huh.

1062
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:35,470
That can happen.

1063
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:41,110
And the word that's being translated as evening is the word edeb, which means, edeb means

1064
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:46,590
to emanate from the top of the house, meaning the sky, you know, the, okay.

1065
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:49,110
So, we can go on from there.

1066
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:52,590
There's something else that's being shown to people about prayer where they put their

1067
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:53,450
hands together.

1068
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:54,510
You ever see that?

1069
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:57,490
You see a lot of iconography and you see them doing that.

1070
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:58,810
Excuse me.

1071
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:05,230
That is a Hindu convention and that's the left palm is man, the right palm is God and

1072
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:05,970
you put them together.

1073
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:08,890
That is a pagan convention, right?

1074
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:14,910
They usually, when iconography in a lot of the Catholic convention, they have a iconography

1075
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:18,770
of Mithra or Serapis, the guy with long hair kneeling.

1076
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:21,390
He's got a red robe on and he's got his hands together, right?

1077
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:23,730
He's kind of bearded and long hair, right?

1078
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:27,490
The Serapis or the Aescepulus is the other one that they show doing that.

1079
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:29,770
Those are ancient cult symbols.

1080
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:31,790
Has nothing to do with scripture.

1081
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:33,190
Has nothing to do with the Most High.

1082
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:37,910
And it sounds dogmatic when you say it that way because it sounds like, oh, if you don't

1083
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:42,110
believe what I believe, you're not doing it.

1084
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:42,850
You're not saying it.

1085
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:44,650
You know, it's dogmatic.

1086
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:46,850
No, I don't believe in any of this.

1087
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:51,930
The thing is, you either know it or you don't know it because there's nothing to believe

1088
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:52,230
in.

1089
01:00:52,570 --> 01:00:55,990
These are things and directions and things that are memorialized in information, the

1090
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:58,950
things you can grasp and know and do now.

1091
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:04,410
Belief is something that you are given information on something that will happen later.

1092
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:06,810
There's no belief in any of this stuff.

1093
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,150
You either do it or you don't do it.

1094
01:01:08,650 --> 01:01:09,290
And it's voluntary.

1095
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:14,670
And here, I think we had a discussion once, Sam, off air, where you ever notice how in

1096
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:15,910
scripture there is no oppression?

1097
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:17,570
Right.

1098
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:21,770
But all of these religions tend to oppress other groups, you know, the Inquisition, you

1099
01:01:21,770 --> 01:01:25,630
know, every religion has a form of oppression on another, even the Hindus and the Buddhists

1100
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:29,450
and that if you look, if you know anyone who's Punjab, you know, they've been oppressed by

1101
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:30,090
these other groups.

1102
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:34,910
So there's in law, there is no oppressiveness in lawfulness.

1103
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:36,930
This is lawfulness.

1104
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:38,770
It has nothing to do with what you believe.

1105
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:40,770
There's a lot to believe when you study scripture.

1106
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:43,750
In other words, prophecy, things that have not happened yet.

1107
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:49,050
That's the only belief that you can have and faith and things that have not happened

1108
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:49,490
yet.

1109
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:51,030
But most of it is very practical.

1110
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:52,170
And it's not to be forced.

1111
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:54,830
It's not to be imposed and not to be convincing to anyone.

1112
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:56,670
It's to be edifying.

1113
01:01:56,790 --> 01:02:00,430
In other words, if someone, you ever see people standing on street corners and stuff

1114
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:02,650
trying to convince other people to convert to something.

1115
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:06,030
They knock on dark home in the Jehovah's Witness Protection Program.

1116
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:09,570
You know, those guys, all these people, that's completely unlawful.

1117
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:10,490
All that stuff is.

1118
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:16,410
So it has to be through genuine inquiry and edification and impartment.

1119
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:18,170
There is no convincing of any of this.

1120
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:21,530
That's why it sounds dogmatic, because most people have that pagan mindset.

1121
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:23,870
And by the way, there, let me just define one thing.

1122
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:27,070
There's this thing called paganism now that's supposed to be popular.

1123
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:29,170
That's just another level of stupidity.

1124
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:34,010
It's a fashion thing where you paint your fingernails black and you wear dark sunglasses

1125
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:36,490
and long coats and get a bunch of tattoos.

1126
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,030
It has nothing to do with anything.

1127
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:40,870
The entire world is either pagan or atheist.

1128
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:45,970
There is very little knowledge of the gods that is being discussed or accessed publicly.

1129
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:52,410
Now, there are still a lot of divine intervention by lower entities and demons that pretty much

1130
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:54,550
everyone seems to become expert in.

1131
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:58,750
If you look at the mainstream religions, it's all demonology of some respect to

1132
01:02:58,750 --> 01:02:59,290
another.

1133
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:04,990
And actually, if you have a discussion with a senior level Catholic bishop, they'll tell

1134
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:06,870
you, yeah, we basically practice demonology.

1135
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:08,270
We won't tell the people that.

1136
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:13,830
But anyway, so basically, in short, I gave a mixed bag of stuff there.

1137
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:17,790
But in order to be in a proper state, there are rules.

1138
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:18,710
Depends on what deity.

1139
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:22,490
If you want the deity that the scripture talks about, it tells you, my people will do that,

1140
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:23,210
do those things.

1141
01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:24,190
They're still accessible.

1142
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:31,530
And the other thing is be private, be vocal, and your hands are open, palms facing up,

1143
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:32,730
not closed.

1144
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:33,990
Right.

1145
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:35,010
And here's the thing.

1146
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:40,970
You know, when you have a spouse, they are, you're considered one, by the way.

1147
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:46,750
So if you're a woman and you have a husband and a man and you have a wife, when you go,

1148
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:49,990
you can go into prayer together because you're considered one flesh.

1149
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:55,490
Like, for example, one of the ordinances is on a certain day, if you do any cooking, it's

1150
01:03:55,490 --> 01:03:56,090
just for yourself.

1151
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:57,970
Don't cook for a group or cook for other people.

1152
01:03:58,110 --> 01:04:03,770
And once I was cooking for myself and let's say the wife, and someone says, well, that's

1153
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:05,090
not really the ordinances.

1154
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:07,790
Well, yes, it is, because we're considered one flesh.

1155
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:13,890
You see, there's definitions here, you see, right, that need to be observed.

1156
01:04:14,310 --> 01:04:18,270
You can't say, well, it says do this, and then, well, I'm going to go do this now, which

1157
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:22,530
is all this churchianity, all this institutionalized stuff.

1158
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:27,650
Now, there's nothing wrong with institutionalizing something if it's lawful and positive.

1159
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:34,310
But if it's unlawful and negative, you see, that's why when you hear the term institutional,

1160
01:04:34,550 --> 01:04:35,970
it sounds negative, doesn't it?

1161
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:38,130
It's not a negative term.

1162
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:42,770
It's negative because it seems like mankind has taken things that are unlawful, low quality

1163
01:04:42,770 --> 01:04:48,310
and negative and made them far-reaching, far accessible and overbearing in society.

1164
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:50,250
That's why institutional sounds bad.

1165
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:56,690
So in essence, folks, yeah, this is the open secrets area.

1166
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:58,310
Prepare yourself.

1167
01:04:58,450 --> 01:05:01,530
You do that by reading what it takes to be clean and prepared.

1168
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:06,350
It's what you eat, what time, your clothing, all that stuff.

1169
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:13,090
And hands not closed, but open palms up, and you talk, you speak, and in private.

1170
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:15,870
And who are you directing these prayers to?

1171
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:17,750
Is it the Christ or is it the Father?

1172
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:18,850
Does it matter which one?

1173
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:19,670
They're one, they're one.

1174
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:21,270
Think about it this way.

1175
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:25,590
You know why he's called the son of God?

1176
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:28,730
Let's just use the regular term that most people use, right?

1177
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:31,010
The son of Elohim, Ben Elohim, let's say, right?

1178
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:34,070
The son of the Elohim, plural, or of the Father.

1179
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:38,170
Because this is a communication to man, right?

1180
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:42,930
And in the system that was set up for men, which is sort of copying the heavenly realm,

1181
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:46,270
look at the corporate system, okay?

1182
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:50,750
For example, let's say you start a corporation with a board of governors and all this other stuff,

1183
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:55,170
and it's been around for 20 years, and these are older men and all that.

1184
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:58,110
And here's your son that was born around the same time.

1185
01:05:58,170 --> 01:06:00,150
He now is 20, which is age of majority.

1186
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:05,330
He walks into the room, and here are all these boards of chair people and all that.

1187
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:06,890
They're twice or three times his age.

1188
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:10,550
Do you know that your son, who has just reached age of majority,

1189
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:14,350
has more authority over all those other people that helped you start the company

1190
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:17,850
while he was still in swaddling cloth, right?

1191
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:20,990
Because he has the authority, right?

1192
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:21,330
You see?

1193
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:25,410
Look how many times you see the son of a corporate, right?

1194
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:29,550
Because this is corporate, meaning it's a group of people coming together to achieve something.

1195
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:31,550
That's another thing that's achieved.

1196
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:33,830
When you say that's corporate, it's bad.

1197
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:38,870
No, it's just that people, corporations have taken on the suit or the clothes

1198
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:42,710
that basically it's people that want to do things to have...

1199
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:45,350
Basically, what's been going on with corporations

1200
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:48,770
is they've set up corporations to make the innocent pay for the guilty.

1201
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:49,850
You see it all the time.

1202
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:52,650
This is, again, unlawful the way they're being run.

1203
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:56,290
Just saying corporate is being negative right now is, again, another stigma

1204
01:06:56,290 --> 01:07:01,790
of proof positive that the way man is doing stuff is not correct, unlawful.

1205
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:04,190
So that's all it is.

1206
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:09,530
It's not a literal son in the sense that we see being born from a woman in that realm.

1207
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:11,070
You see, right?

1208
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:14,310
Because things are made there.

1209
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:16,630
You don't have to be born from a woman.

1210
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:23,370
So basically, just to top it up, you will see that they're the same in authority,

1211
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:26,030
especially at this point.

1212
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:27,610
Think about it for a minute.

1213
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:29,850
I'm not going to get into that.

1214
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:32,410
At this point, they are for sure, right?

1215
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:33,610
Right, right.

1216
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:34,410
In history.

1217
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:37,070
So these are things.

1218
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:43,330
So basically, in private, be vocal, palms up, be proper, be fit and proper.

1219
01:07:44,370 --> 01:07:50,030
Now, there are other gods, by the way, that you can pray to that are in groups, by the way.

1220
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:52,210
But those are different gods.

1221
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:55,170
There are many gods, by the way.

1222
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:56,170
And that's the main thing.

1223
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:58,890
You know how young children are told lies?

1224
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:02,030
And then at some point, the parents never say, well, we told you lies.

1225
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:03,130
Now you're too old for that.

1226
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:08,770
Why would you raise someone from a very young age about lies about these spiritual things

1227
01:08:08,770 --> 01:08:10,630
like Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, all that crap?

1228
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:12,510
And then you never apologize.

1229
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:13,290
You just continue.

1230
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:14,170
They're setting you.

1231
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:17,630
You ever notice if you're to objectify what's going on on this planet,

1232
01:08:18,729 --> 01:08:25,130
you're being raised with lies because everything else you're going to be told is a lie.

1233
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:26,850
You ever think about it that way?

1234
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:31,840
Just just think about it.

1235
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,279
All right.

1236
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,080
One last thing on the prayer thing.

1237
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:41,520
So this Christian tradition of praying in the name of such and such in the name of what

1238
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,640
they call Jesus, is there any validity there?

1239
01:08:43,939 --> 01:08:45,399
No, it doesn't exist.

1240
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:46,479
It doesn't exist.

1241
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:46,819
Yeah.

1242
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:50,720
No, that's in some cases you get a lot of people writing.

1243
01:08:50,859 --> 01:08:51,220
You do that.

1244
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:54,620
You go down to the what's called the Bible Belt or the belt buckle of the Bible Belt.

1245
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:57,020
Boy, you can't get out of there fast enough.

1246
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,240
Talk about a vile place.

1247
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:02,020
You know, this on this planet.

1248
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:02,340
Yeah.

1249
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:08,020
I mean, this is really we're talking about look, this is a very Earth is very dangerous.

1250
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:14,359
And what the people have you look at how people react when you say certain things that are true.

1251
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:16,060
Right.

1252
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:19,080
They're all vile.

1253
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:22,680
All the religions on the planet right now are vile, downright vile.

1254
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:23,939
All of them.

1255
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:26,220
Think about it.

1256
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,540
Now, on the surface, they might seem pleasant.

1257
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:32,460
But when you start to look at what they're supposed to be based on, they're actually

1258
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:33,359
doing the antithesis.

1259
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:36,859
They're actually doing everything that's in the abominations or don't do category.

1260
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:38,220
All of them.

1261
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:43,740
So let me just all of them before Islam, Buddhism, all that stuff.

1262
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:45,000
It's all the same.

1263
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:46,640
They're all this is why?

1264
01:09:46,819 --> 01:09:48,680
Because this is known as the man.

1265
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:51,859
Social order on the surface of the planet is known as the world.

1266
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,040
Who is the God of this world?

1267
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,120
The adversary.

1268
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:56,920
Yeah, right.

1269
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:02,420
But when in King James speak, it says, and I will do whatever you ask in my name.

1270
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:04,900
What does that translate to in reality?

1271
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:06,180
Correct.

1272
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,900
Yeah, but there is no Lord in scripture.

1273
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:18,000
Lord is ball, which is the balls or or form of elementals or lower imps and demons.

1274
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:21,780
Let's say that, like, you know, sun gods, sky gods and all that.

1275
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:25,960
So the Lord, when people you hear people using the term Lord, they don't know when you hear

1276
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,540
people using G.O.D. solely.

1277
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:29,760
They don't know or J.E.S.U.S.

1278
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:31,500
Those are people that don't know.

1279
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,740
Right, so right there, when you encounter someone like that, it's a crossroads time.

1280
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:43,700
You know, it's either do you edify, you know, discuss, see if they're ready for more than

1281
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:45,600
just, you know, 19 Arabs with box cutters.

1282
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,160
You know what I mean?

1283
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:51,420
I'm just bringing in another thing where Oswald shot Kennedy kind of thing, because that's

1284
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:51,960
what it's like.

1285
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,200
You know, you've heard of, oh, you're a conspiracy theorist.

1286
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:00,720
You know, most people see when they're really ignorant, they're ignorant for a reason.

1287
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,840
When you think about it, think about it.

1288
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:05,320
Why are there why they're held ignorant?

1289
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:06,220
Because they're dangerous.

1290
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:11,640
And you have to give them guidelines, you see.

1291
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:18,430
So anyway, if you don't think people are dangerous, you ever see cars with flashing lights and

1292
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:19,910
men in uniform with guns everywhere?

1293
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:25,310
I mean, and major where you have concentrations of people in every city in the world, pretty

1294
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:25,570
much.

1295
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:28,210
Why would they exist if the people weren't dangerous?

1296
01:11:29,930 --> 01:11:30,790
Think about it.

1297
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:36,250
Why would they have cages for people if they weren't dangerous?

1298
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:39,570
You don't think they have cages for people?

1299
01:11:40,650 --> 01:11:41,450
Sure, they do.

1300
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:45,490
There's something to be said for the fact that they are engineered to be dangerous also.

1301
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:46,430
That's right.

1302
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:47,570
But it doesn't matter.

1303
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:50,170
It doesn't matter the objective report.

1304
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:53,550
If you were to come to this planet just for one day and report back, that's what you would

1305
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:53,850
say.

1306
01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:57,550
Of course, they've been led into that position because who's the god of this world?

1307
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:58,610
It's very simple.

1308
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:00,170
All of this stuff is so simple.

1309
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:01,790
It's very simple.

1310
01:12:01,870 --> 01:12:06,990
Having discussions regarding law, regarding the gods, regarding the human body, regarding

1311
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:11,770
what's called science, which is knowledge, the cosmos, let's say, or the cosmos actually

1312
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:16,030
means the earth, but let's say what's out there, it's not feasible at this point.

1313
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:23,010
Because people have been fed a bill of goods, which is a lie, pretty much everything that

1314
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:26,590
they've been told, or it has a little bit of truth in it, just like something that's

1315
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:27,050
counterfeit.

1316
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:28,070
It appears to be true.

1317
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:32,970
So they're going to always be comparing that.

1318
01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:34,090
They hold on to that.

1319
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:39,050
The plausible deniability or the cognitive dissonance, anything that comes in after 12

1320
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:43,090
years old is compared to everything that has come in since you were 12.

1321
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:47,310
You see, it's constantly being compared.

1322
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:55,470
But the thing is, right now, you have to realize that being in such an adversarial situation,

1323
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:59,990
you know, where mankind is adversarial, look, even man is adversarial to man, right?

1324
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:01,150
Right.

1325
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:03,790
And so spirits are adversarial to man.

1326
01:13:04,730 --> 01:13:08,790
You have a lot of adversarial conditions right now on this planet.

1327
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:11,450
Now, it doesn't mean predatory.

1328
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:13,290
That's different, you see.

1329
01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:17,670
But there's also a lot of predation, there's a lot of pranking.

1330
01:13:19,450 --> 01:13:21,050
So there's many aspects.

1331
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:22,270
Here's the other thing also.

1332
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:25,890
Let's say we consider this is the third episode we're coming around and considering it like

1333
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:30,590
open members area to see what kind of support we can garner for perhaps doing something

1334
01:13:30,590 --> 01:13:34,010
like that, which I find distasteful, but I'd like to keep it all open.

1335
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:38,630
But let's just see what kind of support we could garner, by the way, and send a donation

1336
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:43,890
to American Freedom Radio at the homepage, if you will, if this is any if helpful.

1337
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:49,290
And if it's not helpful and you don't like what's being said, send a donation also so

1338
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:50,330
you could keep it going.

1339
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:54,210
So you could always go to a place where you could say, I don't like what they're saying

1340
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:55,290
and support that too.

1341
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:57,030
So.

1342
01:13:58,130 --> 01:13:59,550
So anyway, anything else, Sam?

1343
01:14:00,270 --> 01:14:00,790
Yes.

1344
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:02,430
One last question and then I'll take off.

1345
01:14:02,650 --> 01:14:07,610
So I'll sort of just pivot into something completely different from the previous question,

1346
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:09,750
which is the subject of AIDS.

1347
01:14:10,330 --> 01:14:13,050
You've talked about the virus being a fiction.

1348
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:15,430
So we know that HIV doesn't cause AIDS.

1349
01:14:15,470 --> 01:14:16,890
So what exactly causes AIDS?

1350
01:14:17,150 --> 01:14:19,950
Is it a disease that existed historically called by another name?

1351
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:22,230
Or did it really pop up in the 80s?

1352
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:24,270
And does it have any relation to the homosexual community?

1353
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:25,190
Yes.

1354
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:29,490
No, it's well, it's when you said the homosexual community is the lifestyle, not all quote

1355
01:14:29,490 --> 01:14:34,390
unquote, homosexuals or sodomites have gotten that because they didn't all go through that.

1356
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:39,030
Do you know how I mentioned there was fashions and trends where certain groups excel in

1357
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:39,870
certain behaviors?

1358
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:43,670
Yeah, there's quite a few people out there that have written about this.

1359
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:50,270
And also, when you look at the story behind DDT or what causes polio, see when polio, when

1360
01:14:50,270 --> 01:14:52,650
DTT stopped being sprayed, polio went away.

1361
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:55,870
And then at the same time, the medical community said, oh, it's the vaccine.

1362
01:14:56,690 --> 01:14:59,550
And there's doctors that went to Congress and testified about this.

1363
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:02,090
There's a lady who wrote a book about it and all that.

1364
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:07,890
So what is called a virus is simply a form of mitochondria, cell tissue that's broken

1365
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:11,550
up and it's produced and gone through the liver back into the bloodstream, just waste

1366
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:11,870
product.

1367
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:17,710
If anyone can go do a general cursory study on virology, it is a branch of toxicology.

1368
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:22,590
OK, and in toxicology is a branch of the study of the liver function.

1369
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:24,330
There's a lot.

1370
01:15:24,570 --> 01:15:28,870
There's actually, I wouldn't say prominent, but semi-prominent German researcher who's

1371
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:30,850
been in virology for 20 something years.

1372
01:15:31,070 --> 01:15:32,050
He just threw up his hands.

1373
01:15:32,090 --> 01:15:32,850
This is all fraud.

1374
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:34,590
No one's ever seen one.

1375
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:38,190
It's only computer graphics and pictures that are described, but they have no effect.

1376
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:39,890
And he actually has a website.

1377
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:42,370
If you could put in medical viruses or fraud, I forgot his name.

1378
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:43,190
He's from Europe.

1379
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:45,910
And it's a big thing to do that in Europe because they have socialized medicine.

1380
01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:47,510
Right.

1381
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:49,850
So there's no reason for him to buck the system.

1382
01:15:50,450 --> 01:15:50,890
Right.

1383
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:52,990
I mean, because it's not predatory.

1384
01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:58,110
You know, so there's many aspects to this that understanding how the body is in a sealed

1385
01:15:58,110 --> 01:16:03,510
condition, the only openings from the mouth all the way down through the anus, right?

1386
01:16:03,570 --> 01:16:05,470
The two openings, a tunnel in and out.

1387
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:08,510
And the group we mentioned before, they go reverse too.

1388
01:16:08,590 --> 01:16:08,730
Right.

1389
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:14,870
But anyway, so the thing is, I would say this is the thing to consider.

1390
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:18,690
If you look at all the layers in the intestine, of course, you know, how does anything get

1391
01:16:18,690 --> 01:16:19,070
through there?

1392
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:23,750
Something passing through that tunnel could influence through induction and other things,

1393
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:24,350
the body, right?

1394
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:28,190
Something through the skin can influence the body through induction, can't it?

1395
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:33,210
Something going into the cul-de-sac of the lungs can influence the body, you see?

1396
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:37,910
So there are contagions, yes, but they don't operate and function the way you've been told.

1397
01:16:38,550 --> 01:16:42,030
Like earlier on, like I don't have audio listening to AFR.

1398
01:16:42,030 --> 01:16:45,150
Someone had put in the chat earlier something about immune, whatever.

1399
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:47,250
There is no such thing as an immune system, period.

1400
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:49,650
What's the organ for the immune system?

1401
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:54,270
You have circulatory system, nervous system, eliminative system, nutritive system.

1402
01:16:54,830 --> 01:16:57,530
And the lungs and the skin are both eliminative and nutritive.

1403
01:16:58,190 --> 01:16:59,170
Where's the immune system?

1404
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:03,750
These are things that are developed for communication purposes.

1405
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:07,490
And then they take on a life of their own, like they exist.

1406
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:08,990
And people are so lazy.

1407
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:10,170
They say, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1408
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:12,890
Because remember, there's a guy called Gustave Le Bon in the crowd.

1409
01:17:13,690 --> 01:17:15,030
You've got to come up with an idea.

1410
01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:18,290
And people, you know, they just, oh, this is a great idea.

1411
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:22,310
But the thing is, you can't convey the idea to the people because they're too simple to

1412
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:22,910
comprehend it.

1413
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:23,830
It'll bury them.

1414
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:25,330
So you have to oversimplify it.

1415
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:29,630
And when you oversimplify the idea, very little of it resembles the original idea.

1416
01:17:29,710 --> 01:17:36,230
And now you're off into la-la land, which is what you see, you see?

1417
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:39,850
So the interesting point is there is no point to any of this.

1418
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:40,850
It's just taking up time.

1419
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:44,830
That's why the three most important things are understanding what your mind is or the

1420
01:17:44,830 --> 01:17:48,710
spirit, understanding your soul, which is the breath and the metabolism, the function

1421
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:50,450
of the body and the body itself.

1422
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:52,750
And then it's food, clothing and shelter.

1423
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:58,110
With that being said, we do want to understand a few other things, too, so that we're not

1424
01:17:58,110 --> 01:17:59,290
completely groping in the dark.

1425
01:17:59,730 --> 01:18:00,410
But you have to.

1426
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:02,150
Actually, here's the irony of it.

1427
01:18:02,190 --> 01:18:05,210
It's kind of like there's a film called The Karate Kid where the young man was put through

1428
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:06,990
these exercises and he didn't know why.

1429
01:18:06,990 --> 01:18:12,490
If you pursue mastership of food, clothing and shelter or understanding the mind, the

1430
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:15,110
soul and the body, what else is there to learn?

1431
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:18,710
Because on the path of learning that, you will actually grasp anything that's tangible

1432
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:19,970
and intangible on the way.

1433
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:24,210
OK, that makes sense.

1434
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:27,540
So AIDS.

1435
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:30,640
Can that be?

1436
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,240
Automated immune deficiency, whatever.

1437
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:33,760
Yeah, here's the thing.

1438
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,180
Actually, you could still do the keyboard warrior stuff on that.

1439
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:43,560
And you'll see there's a lot of back and forth and it shows you the aspect of society where

1440
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,600
society is regarding truthful information.

1441
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:50,280
That's a good topic to bring up, not because to bring it up, to discuss what it is, because

1442
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:51,580
many have debunked it.

1443
01:18:52,260 --> 01:18:53,020
I don't want to get into that.

1444
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:56,560
There's you know, because then then it becomes, well, he believes this and he believes that

1445
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,580
I want to get into that.

1446
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:59,060
This is a planet full of morons.

1447
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:01,640
They they deserve stupidity like that.

1448
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:03,640
You know, I mean, that's one way to say it.

1449
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,100
The other way is they deserve the truth.

1450
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,480
But the thing is, they want to fight about it and neither one is going to settle in.

1451
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:11,080
You know, here's the other thing about it.

1452
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:15,160
I used to tell people back in the 90s, there was a big thing about selling life insurance

1453
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:16,120
in the insurance industry.

1454
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:20,100
And this one guy wanted to do it and he had these little postcards before they offered

1455
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,660
someone a policy was an AIDS test.

1456
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:25,740
And what you're supposed to do is prick the finger, put it on a dot, put it in an envelope,

1457
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,180
send it to the insurance company to give you a policy.

1458
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:28,520
Right.

1459
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:29,980
And I used to play a joke.

1460
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:33,760
I say, everyone you're going to test on this is going to have AIDS.

1461
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,760
And he's, oh, no, not everyone that they did test had AIDS.

1462
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:41,300
And the way we played with them and did that is I said, listen, before you do that blotter

1463
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:43,200
for the Stanley guy, right, that was his name.

1464
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:47,060
What you're going to do is I want you to go eat some rare meat, like have like a rare

1465
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:50,060
steak dinner, you know, like the real like black and blue rare.

1466
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:50,460
Right.

1467
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,540
And within two hours after eating that, go ahead and do the blood thing and you're going

1468
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:56,960
to show up positive on an AIDS test every time.

1469
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:00,500
Just like, for example, another thing is cancer.

1470
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:04,820
Your basic cancer screening is like those dollar store pregnancy tests.

1471
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:09,960
You know, the pregnancy test thing, if you show up positive, if you're a guy or whatever

1472
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:14,260
that you're pregnant, that's a hormone that they test for when they do cancer screening.

1473
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,940
I mean, this is this whole medical thing is a is a show.

1474
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:18,300
It's a show.

1475
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:20,360
It's a it's a pranking, you know.

1476
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:24,760
I mean, look, if it wasn't, why would 80 percent, if not more of the medications that

1477
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:33,000
are prescribed rendered illegal or considered illegal, unlawful and dangerous after a decade

1478
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:33,520
or so?

1479
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:39,660
Do you know of any medications that were like fashionable prescription drugs after a decade

1480
01:20:39,660 --> 01:20:41,060
that are not deemed dangerous?

1481
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:42,480
Very few.

1482
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:44,820
Most about 80 percent of them are deemed dangerous.

1483
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:45,780
Come on.

1484
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:46,600
They don't know that.

1485
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:48,060
Who's they?

1486
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:49,240
They don't want to know anything.

1487
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:49,960
Who cares?

1488
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:51,160
This is planet Earth.

1489
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:52,200
Don't you see?

1490
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:53,880
Now some people care.

1491
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,600
That's not enough.

1492
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:59,620
In other words, they're still accommodating the masses, the space heaters, you know.

1493
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,520
And if you guys have defined what space heaters are before, so.

1494
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:05,640
Right.

1495
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:07,360
Well, this is life on Earth.

1496
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:07,700
Yeah.

1497
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:15,960
With regards to AIDS, I've heard this theory put out that it's connected in some way to sperm

1498
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:20,280
in the sense that sperm, which is housed in the testicles.

1499
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:23,620
You take that and put it.

1500
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,340
I'm just sort of using loose speak.

1501
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:31,080
If you take that sperm and put it in other parts of the body, it creates a problem, which is.

1502
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:31,740
Oh, yeah, sure.

1503
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:32,560
Yeah.

1504
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:37,660
Well, we'll think about mitochondria is the inside inner part of the nucleus of the cell

1505
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:39,860
of single cells break, broken up into pieces.

1506
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:41,340
Anything that's not in its environment.

1507
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:45,460
I was ready to make a lascivious comment about that, but I'm going to withhold.

1508
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:51,240
I always have to make a lascivious comment every week and some kind of debunking some

1509
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:56,400
cliche, you know, because this is like a non-carnal mature type, you know, sonic experience.

1510
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:57,040
You know all this.

1511
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:01,420
Here's another thing about this fake prudence and fake morality that the quote unquote

1512
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:03,160
Christianity has.

1513
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:04,580
Oh, I said hell.

1514
01:22:04,780 --> 01:22:05,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

1515
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:07,020
Oh, I'm sorry.

1516
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:08,280
You ever see that how they do that?

1517
01:22:08,480 --> 01:22:08,680
You know.

1518
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:09,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

1519
01:22:10,020 --> 01:22:10,640
I said, damn.

1520
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:12,520
Oh, it's not this fake morality.

1521
01:22:12,520 --> 01:22:15,460
I mean, how can on one side you say sin is a big deal.

1522
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:17,140
On the other side, you say the law is done away with.

1523
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:17,760
How do you judge?

1524
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:19,820
I mean, this is all this fake stuff.

1525
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,240
Put your children in front of Molex Santa Claus.

1526
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:23,860
I mean, this is ridiculous.

1527
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:25,100
I mean, all of it.

1528
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:29,020
And I mean, you know, the public prayer and the women dressed in burkas and other religions

1529
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:31,800
and the worshiping the fat man and this other thing.

1530
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:37,380
And it's all the falseness and all these spiritual minded people telling you about consciousness

1531
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:41,480
and transcending what a pile of rubbish and reincarnation.

1532
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:45,500
And clairvoyance and psychics and intuitives and meditative.

1533
01:22:45,720 --> 01:22:46,820
What's going on, Sam?

1534
01:22:47,340 --> 01:22:49,900
These people, they've lost their minds.

1535
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,840
No one is making any sense anymore.

1536
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:56,120
Statistically, they are, but they're not speaking.

1537
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:04,300
Please, if you are semi rational, semi intelligible and have some information, do a radio show.

1538
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:06,100
AFR has got some open slots.

1539
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,440
Come on, speak to AFR.

1540
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:10,140
Tell him the Greek says I want to do a show.

1541
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:16,100
Talking about stuff that people need to know the truth or do a website and send me a link.

1542
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,760
Please, somebody, please.

1543
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:22,000
You know, but we digress.

1544
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:22,820
Yes.

1545
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:23,320
Yeah.

1546
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:23,720
No.

1547
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:24,920
So the thing is about the AIDS.

1548
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:25,400
I want to leave.

1549
01:23:25,480 --> 01:23:29,480
As you see, I'm avoiding it because there's so much already about it.

1550
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:30,940
I've already directly answered.

1551
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:32,660
Here's the point.

1552
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:35,960
It's kind of like discussing what size shoe Santa Claus wears.

1553
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:40,220
Yes, that sounds like a big discussion, doesn't it?

1554
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,160
But Santa Claus doesn't exist.

1555
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,180
In other words, you're all right and you're all wrong.

1556
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:46,400
Right.

1557
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:48,020
It's like discussing viruses.

1558
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,120
You're all right and you're all wrong.

1559
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:51,960
These things don't exist as they people think they do.

1560
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:56,620
If you actually go back and look at what they call AIDS and what they call viruses and all

1561
01:23:56,620 --> 01:24:00,020
that, as it's been memorialized, you'll find all that information is true.

1562
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:04,540
But the way that people discuss it is false.

1563
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:09,460
And all the religions are like this, bar none, bar none.

1564
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:10,420
They're all like that.

1565
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:14,440
What the people think and what they do and what they think they know about it is not

1566
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:17,880
memorialized anywhere other than the allegiances.

1567
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:21,960
Like, for example, if you read the allegiance to the creator of the Catholic Church or whatever,

1568
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:22,600
you know what it says?

1569
01:24:22,940 --> 01:24:25,140
I profess to believe or I whatever.

1570
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:26,300
It's a swearing document.

1571
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:30,180
I believe in one holy apostolic what?

1572
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,580
Church first.

1573
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:32,660
The circus.

1574
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:34,420
Cirque, right?

1575
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:35,000
The Cirque.

1576
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:37,680
That's where they pledge first.

1577
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:42,100
If you ever read any of the creeds and the pledges to these institutions, all of them

1578
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:42,520
have it.

1579
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:44,320
It's called a statement of faith.

1580
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,300
And they have it.

1581
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,560
And actually, when you join the church, they send it to you.

1582
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,920
And years ago, you're supposed to sign it in various degrees.

1583
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:53,600
But now they don't have you sign it.

1584
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:55,100
Now they just do the administrative default.

1585
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:58,340
If you got it and you don't send it back, they could go back to their administrative

1586
01:24:58,780 --> 01:25:00,440
body and say, yes, they swore to it.

1587
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:02,460
You see, they're just playing the game.

1588
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:03,720
Because why not?

1589
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,040
I mean, like no one's paying attention.

1590
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:06,880
It's taking advantage.

1591
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,880
So basically, you're swearing allegiance to the Cirque, the church or the circus or

1592
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:11,660
Cirque.

1593
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:16,200
You know, so it's like, have you lost your minds?

1594
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:18,560
No, no, you haven't.

1595
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:22,280
Because this has been going on for a very, very long time.

1596
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,940
What do you know about a skepulous, the god of health?

1597
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:26,880
What do you know about Serapis?

1598
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:32,220
What do you know about Mithra from ancient Egypt and the collaboration between the

1599
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:33,100
Greeks and the Egyptians?

1600
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:36,280
You see, and this goes on and on.

1601
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:40,260
This is also, by the way, not just a rant on the religious side of it, like we brought

1602
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:40,780
up the topic.

1603
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:42,620
This is also the rant on what?

1604
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:44,340
The medical side.

1605
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:45,860
Right.

1606
01:25:46,340 --> 01:25:47,920
We're talking about like in Egypt.

1607
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:49,020
Oh, Egypt was so great.

1608
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:49,320
Really?

1609
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:49,740
Really?

1610
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:50,400
OK.

1611
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:54,920
So when a woman had menstrual cramps, they prescribed bat's blood and cat urine.

1612
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:57,160
Mm, yum, yum, yum.

1613
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,380
That's really good.

1614
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:00,480
Egyptians.

1615
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:01,560
Oh, they're so great.

1616
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:04,780
If the Egyptians were so great, how come they're still laying in ruins?

1617
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:06,300
Can you tell me?

1618
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:06,800
No.

1619
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,040
Better wake up, people.

1620
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:12,480
You know, so and you will soon.

1621
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:16,580
I mean, we've got a roughly, you know, this is roughly I don't call it the new year,

1622
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:19,840
but it's the first week of the first month and we're going forward.

1623
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:20,680
Right.

1624
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:24,360
It's going to be interesting to see what happens in the next year when people start

1625
01:26:24,360 --> 01:26:27,840
to get their senses for the first time in over 2000 years.

1626
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:29,560
Can you imagine what a time that will be?

1627
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:31,620
I can only imagine.

1628
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:32,660
It'll be dangerous for some.

1629
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:37,360
Well, it's going to be you see, the thing is, you don't want to scare the frog out

1630
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:37,800
of the pot.

1631
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:41,840
Now, remember, this is the thing that people don't comprehend and don't want to understand

1632
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:48,160
is that right now, humanity for the past 18 or so years has been set up by the gods.

1633
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:49,040
You're being set up.

1634
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:55,060
And part of the setup is that you're going to be lead or led into the finishing line,

1635
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:58,780
which is like the starting line, which is a grand civilization that you read about in

1636
01:26:58,780 --> 01:26:59,340
ancient times.

1637
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:05,160
Like I mentioned, Egypt and Babylon and Assyria and all that will be revived in a way that

1638
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:06,740
you will completely accept it.

1639
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:12,840
And then the kill shots start coming because when the gods go in to do war with a society

1640
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:16,840
or to take out a society, it's not much of a war because of their ordinance.

1641
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:20,000
They prop you up to your highest position.

1642
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:21,240
Then they come and take you out.

1643
01:27:21,300 --> 01:27:25,520
It's the opposite of what man does in their war where they soften the and lower the tart,

1644
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:26,860
you know, lower the opposition.

1645
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:35,900
So and pretty much the majority, 99.999999999% of the people on this planet are falling for

1646
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:37,260
it, are going to fall for it.

1647
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:43,200
And it's amazing that this can still be said publicly as we are doing right now, because

1648
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:45,800
there are a very small handful of people that are beginning to see it.

1649
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:49,960
And there's nothing that you need to read into it, need to start to read out of it.

1650
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:55,040
And one of the main things that you've heard me discuss is the coming Assyria, the new

1651
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,540
Assyria in northern Iraq.

1652
01:27:56,540 --> 01:28:01,660
Look at the plains of Nineveh, like Mosul right now is a little bit being discussed

1653
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:05,780
and all that's the concept of ISIS that has been around the all the stuff that's going

1654
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:06,600
on in Syria.

1655
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:11,100
Wait until you see what's going to be happening in Jordan in about a year or two.

1656
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:16,780
Wait until you see what's going to be happening with the Palestinians in a couple of years.

1657
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,580
The level of carnage that is going to be put on what's known as the modern Philistines

1658
01:28:22,580 --> 01:28:26,060
will be unthinkable if you said what it is now by Israel.

1659
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:31,500
But not this prime minister and not the next, but definitely the next after one after that

1660
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:32,760
and beginning with the next one.

1661
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:36,460
And then you see, we've discussed this and this can be discussed maybe next week.

1662
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:38,300
Let's start giving more specifics.

1663
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,160
Now, here's the interesting aspect of it.

1664
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:45,040
What's really fascinating is that anyone can see what or it can be.

1665
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:49,800
Let's say this discussion can be brought forth to anyone that has interest to inquire

1666
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:50,540
on the subject.

1667
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:55,000
And once the interest in the inquiry is brought forward, let's say what's called about

1668
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:00,760
things to come as conveyed to man by the gods, you can grasp it and then you can start

1669
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:01,460
discussing it.

1670
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:06,300
But you'll notice that the majority of the subject matter and its impact and import is

1671
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:07,680
not for your everyday man.

1672
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:11,900
It's really for multinational corporations and monarchies and people that have these

1673
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,360
big international interests.

1674
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:17,080
And I'll tell you, it's quite amazing to me to be able to come on a minor internet

1675
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:23,460
platform two hours a week and basically pontificate or just throw this stuff out there like that

1676
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:28,820
that is beyond what most of these think tanks that are getting millions of whatever by these

1677
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:32,680
big international companies are getting false, just crap information that they're gleaning

1678
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:33,300
off the internet.

1679
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:36,560
It's just the irony here is just amazing.

1680
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:38,380
You know, Sam?

1681
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,260
So yeah, I hear you.

1682
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:41,680
Oh, okay.

1683
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:43,260
Well, thanks for my questions.

1684
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:44,020
Thank you.

1685
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:44,280
Yes.

1686
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:44,960
Yes.

1687
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,300
So BC, it all ties together.

1688
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:47,100
Thank you again.

1689
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:48,040
Yes.

1690
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:48,700
Thank you too.

1691
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:50,720
Well, we'll see you again soon.

1692
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:51,860
Definitely.

1693
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:52,520
Bye then.

1694
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:54,240
Okay.

1695
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:58,140
Thank you, Sam, for calling and actually having someone to bounce some ideas off of.

1696
01:29:58,260 --> 01:29:59,920
So what's going on in chat?

1697
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:03,880
And we have not gone through the emails, but we have indirectly to some extent.

1698
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:06,120
So time travel.

1699
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:06,440
Okay.

1700
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:07,300
Even coded code.

1701
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:07,520
Okay.

1702
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,120
We've got stuff.

1703
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:14,200
So here, there was someone who sent me, sent an email to the Greek following.

1704
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:21,580
This was several questions regarding things that have said in the past, perhaps since

1705
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:26,880
I've gone solo here more specifically on the period of confusion.

1706
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:27,540
I'm just going to preface.

1707
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:33,360
This is not in the question, but discussing how the past seven years or so or six plus

1708
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:39,020
years has been a time of confusion and distraction, because this is a time when basically a lot

1709
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:44,460
of spiritual entities through the cosmos or the universe are being corralled down to earth

1710
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:46,360
where they're being quarantined down here to earth.

1711
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:51,380
So when the kill shots come, they will be physically or in the spirit in this location.

1712
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:59,280
And the question here directly to that comment made a while back is, are they coming to earth

1713
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:00,800
gods or other entities?

1714
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:01,360
Yes.

1715
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,640
Do they take human form and can they be distinguished?

1716
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:04,240
No.

1717
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:09,660
They can take human form, but they cannot be distinguished unless they allow themselves

1718
01:31:09,660 --> 01:31:14,700
to be, and they usually don't, unless they're one of these lower entities that someone has

1719
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:19,360
some grimoire or some form of incantation or evocation technique to do it.

1720
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,880
Because remember, they're very technical.

1721
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:27,100
It's just like, for example, if you're a woman and you go by the name Susan, and you're

1722
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:31,780
in a crowd of people and someone yells out, Susan, that gets your attention.

1723
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:32,540
You turn around.

1724
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:36,280
There might be four or five other Susans in the crowd, but because they've addressed you

1725
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:40,220
with the name, and so that's how these spiritual entities work.

1726
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:43,940
That's why when you've seen in some Hollywood memes and things like that, they have to read

1727
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:47,940
something or you hear about these, quote unquote, Satanists that have to get their

1728
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:50,640
access to, and they're not Satanists, by the way.

1729
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:58,180
They're actually just evoking and reviving ancient gods, dark lords, as they would say.

1730
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,340
There's a lot of specifics involved in that.

1731
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:04,540
That's why with Samuel, I want to thank him for coming on earlier and asking what prayer

1732
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:06,420
is because they're specific to that.

1733
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:11,520
It's interesting how people take a lot of interest in these minor pagan demonic kind

1734
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:18,160
of things, the specificity, but when we talk about going on a higher level, no one wants

1735
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:18,660
to hear it.

1736
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:21,780
It's because, again, it's all set up for part of the cosmic censorship.

1737
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:28,680
You have mentioned that there are three bloodlines.

1738
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:31,520
One appears to come from the sons of Elohim and the daughters of Adam.

1739
01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:31,800
Correct.

1740
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:38,140
Now, when you read in the King James, it says the sons of gods took the daughters of men.

1741
01:32:38,180 --> 01:32:39,080
It does not say that.

1742
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:44,720
It says the sons of the gods took the daughters of Adam, which delineates a bloodline, right?

1743
01:32:45,240 --> 01:32:50,480
Because once there are hybrids and other things like that, you cannot delineate.

1744
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:52,580
So the information has to delineate.

1745
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:55,000
So that's very good that you brought that up here.

1746
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:59,520
And what are the origin or the other two or more there are?

1747
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:03,040
Do all humans fall into one of these categories?

1748
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:05,480
Yes, that's right, appearing human.

1749
01:33:05,480 --> 01:33:09,000
There are three types that appear human.

1750
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:15,960
It is the descendants of Adam, the sons of gods, and the hybrids.

1751
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:23,180
And the easiest ones to distinguish, well, actually, there would probably be the Nephilim

1752
01:33:23,180 --> 01:33:24,500
or the hybrids.

1753
01:33:25,640 --> 01:33:31,780
Nephilim just means plural of soul, plurality of souls.

1754
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:37,600
The typical hybrids were large in stature.

1755
01:33:37,720 --> 01:33:38,700
Let's say they were called giants.

1756
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:40,280
By the way, the word giants is not in scripture.

1757
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:46,120
It was put in the subteragent only, but it's easy to render the term correctly because

1758
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,580
of the descriptions that are given.

1759
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:50,180
But they're also polydectyl.

1760
01:33:50,240 --> 01:33:56,320
They have six digits on hands and feet, which are typically removed these days in nursery,

1761
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:59,540
in birthing rooms, what they call them, things like that.

1762
01:34:00,040 --> 01:34:07,280
I would say that the third one, the sons of gods, which are not born from women, by

1763
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:11,240
the way, if you remember from ancient literature, people would be addressed as such, you, man,

1764
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:11,920
born of a woman.

1765
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:13,680
I mean, what kind of a statement is that?

1766
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,780
Isn't everyone born of a woman?

1767
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:15,540
Think about it.

1768
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:20,980
But they are basically the subcontractors that were part of the remaking of the earth.

1769
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:25,940
And when they have offspring, they are pretty much mimicking what has been developed over

1770
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:27,680
a thousand years for developing Adam.

1771
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:30,600
I know this sounds kind of crazy, but make good science fiction, by the way.

1772
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:35,520
But when they produce offspring, they're male and they come into existence as full

1773
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,040
adults.

1774
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:39,780
And you might have seen it in some of your sci-fi also, where they have these breeding

1775
01:34:39,780 --> 01:34:41,880
tanks and cloning and stuff like that.

1776
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:47,680
One of the problems with these sons of gods that come into this reality as full adults

1777
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:54,820
and male is that they do tend to exercise, presuming exercise and enjoy the thousand

1778
01:34:54,820 --> 01:35:02,560
year lifespan, which would be of Adam also, which tends to be problematic.

1779
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:08,120
Because if one of these cats or guys lived in a neighborhood for 100 years and didn't

1780
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:12,840
seem to have aged a month and everyone else is born and dying around them, they're going

1781
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:13,840
to start asking questions.

1782
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:15,700
So they tend to move around a lot.

1783
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:20,400
They tend to move from city to city, town to town.

1784
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:24,900
And because they're around so long, it's easy for them to get wealth and power.

1785
01:35:26,040 --> 01:35:30,640
So actually, a lot of these things have been indirectly described.

1786
01:35:30,780 --> 01:35:38,040
You might know of Oscar Wilde, you know of various other stories of nobility, the way

1787
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:39,500
people were addressing each other.

1788
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:44,220
If you read between the lines and learn to read out of it, once you understand the sons

1789
01:35:44,220 --> 01:35:45,680
of gods are different.

1790
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:51,620
And but here, because they use the formula or the prototype of Adam or the model to make

1791
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:57,480
Adam, they are fully compatible with women that are descended from Adam, just like Adam

1792
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:59,080
was fully compatible with Eve.

1793
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:01,160
So I'm just addressing that.

1794
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:06,180
I know this sounds like crazy talk here, because when you compare it to what else is being

1795
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:09,420
said, yeah, it's very contrasting.

1796
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:14,720
But I'm just stating it because I said I would probably try to answer this on air and

1797
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:15,900
everyone else can benefit.

1798
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,040
So there you go.

1799
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:23,480
And maybe we'll get into more depth and cite some examples on these three.

1800
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:29,000
Well, you know, presuming most people are descendants of Adam and also discuss the hybrids

1801
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,780
and the sons of gods, the Elohim, plural.

1802
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:39,080
So this is very hard to discuss, but I would say gods, because most people in the Judeo-Christian

1803
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:40,280
only think there's one.

1804
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:42,560
And there's no such thing as monotheism, by the way.

1805
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:43,600
That's ridiculous.

1806
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:45,020
There are many, many gods.

1807
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:49,660
As a matter of fact, the biblical text of the scripture cites about 36 to 40 of them

1808
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:50,300
by name.

1809
01:36:51,540 --> 01:36:53,520
But there is a hierarchy, you see.

1810
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:57,640
So and when you believe in a god, believe in that he's going to do what?

1811
01:36:58,400 --> 01:37:01,080
See, so in the faith and all this stuff, it's not just time yet, folks.

1812
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:05,280
But if you're into Uncommon Radio and you're here, you know that maybe the time is now for

1813
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,100
two hours a week.

1814
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:10,280
And I'm sure here by we're about an hour and 45 minutes in, the dummy load has been

1815
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:14,420
rubbed off of the minds from being dummy loaded all week.

1816
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:19,100
So we'll see what we can do here for the next 10 minutes or so.

1817
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:21,560
But let's see.

1818
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:26,860
The other question here is, how does one race serve as a clock on this era?

1819
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:30,160
Do certain events with this race signal the end of this age?

1820
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:32,380
Not really, not with the race, no.

1821
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:37,620
It's basically the human race and their descendants and different bloodlines within

1822
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:41,360
that human race descendants of Adam and the hybrids and the sons of God.

1823
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:43,960
So that's sort of like another thing.

1824
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:45,680
So let's go to the next here.

1825
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:52,440
As there is an anti-life agenda with the slowdown, the finale for a certain number of humans

1826
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:53,560
necessary to pass through Earth.

1827
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:58,120
Yeah, yeah, there's actually the finale is very interesting because it's all repeating.

1828
01:37:58,380 --> 01:37:59,260
Things have repeated.

1829
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:04,600
Like for example, when you read about the last days will be like the days of Noah.

1830
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:05,600
Well, look around you.

1831
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:06,240
How many people?

1832
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:07,360
About seven and a half billion.

1833
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:11,320
Who knows who's counted, but let's just go with the – by the way, the World Bank,

1834
01:38:11,780 --> 01:38:13,500
that's their baby.

1835
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:14,320
That's their puppy.

1836
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:18,880
That's their little function is to count how many products, human products or credit

1837
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:19,900
lines they have to offer.

1838
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:22,560
They are about seven and a half billion right now.

1839
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:28,160
There were about that many around the time of the flood about 4,500 years ago.

1840
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:35,000
So yeah, don't think that you're modern and so expanded and so great right now.

1841
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:36,700
All these things were once but different.

1842
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:38,560
Here we go.

1843
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:43,320
Lastly, is it possible that our perception of time is changing, i.e.

1844
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:44,020
speeding up?

1845
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:45,980
Well, yes.

1846
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:48,880
Time is the recordation of events.

1847
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:51,100
Are the events going to perceive like they're speeding up?

1848
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:51,340
Yes.

1849
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:52,560
I'll give you a personal example.

1850
01:38:52,940 --> 01:38:58,460
Like by the wind-up toy, it was two hours before I was to come on to radio and five

1851
01:38:58,460 --> 01:38:59,100
minutes passed by.

1852
01:38:59,180 --> 01:39:00,700
I look at the clock and it was 20 minutes.

1853
01:39:01,820 --> 01:39:05,120
So the hour and a half went by like five minutes.

1854
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:07,280
So I guess it's what you're doing in the mindset.

1855
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:08,720
But here's the thing.

1856
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:12,840
Perception of time, if you're on the Pope's work schedule, you have no perception of time.

1857
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:18,740
You have a perception of when to go to work and when to have a weekend in the dark, by

1858
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:19,080
the way.

1859
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:25,840
So I'm not convincing or suggesting even that anyone should understand lawful timekeeping.

1860
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:31,360
I'm just putting it out there that such a thing exists just like such a thing as rational

1861
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:33,260
and lawful thinking exists.

1862
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:39,240
And it's quite interesting to come here for two hours a week to propose such a thing here,

1863
01:39:39,360 --> 01:39:44,940
meaning American Freedom Radio, which I'm grateful that they've given me the platform

1864
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:46,140
to do so.

1865
01:39:46,700 --> 01:39:52,260
But otherwise, if you just for both the other hosts and American Freedom Radio, what is

1866
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:56,800
being said and represented by the Greek does not represent American Freedom Radio or the

1867
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,320
other hosts, not even close.

1868
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:01,560
So I just want to always give a little bit of a disclaimer there.

1869
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:02,100
Wink, wink.

1870
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:11,680
I just want to also suggest that this is to consider donating to AFR, not only to donate

1871
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:16,440
to AFR, but you're really indirectly donating to the Greek to see what kind of a cause can

1872
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:16,960
be launched.

1873
01:40:17,380 --> 01:40:22,980
So just to remind everyone again, this is the third episode or third time around, third

1874
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:28,060
sonic experience that the Greek is trying to perform an experiment to see how much support

1875
01:40:28,060 --> 01:40:34,160
can be garnered from the public at large about sending some kind of contribution to

1876
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:39,360
AFR, which will sort of maybe be the measurement of what can or could be done in a private

1877
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:40,140
member's area.

1878
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:42,120
Because many of these things can be elaborated on.

1879
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:43,780
Just like I said, there's two hours a week here.

1880
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:48,460
Pretty much the first hour is to shake the dummy load off, because I know you guys have

1881
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:49,520
been dummy loaded all week.

1882
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:50,960
I know what you listen to.

1883
01:40:51,220 --> 01:40:51,560
Why?

1884
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:52,920
Or read.

1885
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:53,280
Why?

1886
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:57,440
Because it's most likely on the internet and I have access to it also.

1887
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:59,440
I have not really been looking at it.

1888
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:04,120
This week may be a little bit more than usual, but I'm in touch with enough people that I

1889
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:08,120
ask if there's anything interesting going on, just cite me a notice or let me know and

1890
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:08,700
nothing much.

1891
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:13,420
It's still the same dummy load everywhere, and I mean everywhere.

1892
01:41:14,820 --> 01:41:15,980
What about donating here?

1893
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:17,580
What about donating to the meek?

1894
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:18,120
Yeah, it's interesting.

1895
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:19,660
Go look up what that word really means.

1896
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:20,740
I'm not going to give that away.

1897
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:25,960
When I was doing a previous Sonic episode called On Common Sense, very similar to this

1898
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:31,900
with a co-host, Seth, I was trying to dispel a biblical cliche or some cliche every week

1899
01:41:31,900 --> 01:41:38,060
and just to show in an indirect way how erroneous what people are relying on is.

1900
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:45,340
But again, remember folks, you all sort of partake in things that you find readily available

1901
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:46,680
and convenient to access.

1902
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:52,540
How many people do you know, including yourself, that tends to go out of their way to get things?

1903
01:41:52,820 --> 01:41:54,040
I mean like really out of their way.

1904
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:58,980
If you live in a neighborhood where they have let's say a butcher, a baker, a candlestick

1905
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:02,680
maker and all this stuff, do you really want to go to like five neighborhoods over to get

1906
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:06,500
the best meat or the best bread or the best candles or whatever?

1907
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:07,700
You see, no.

1908
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:12,020
Most people just go what's conveniently, and this is the neighborhood market.

1909
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:14,320
The internet is now the neighborhood market.

1910
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:19,780
So what happens is there's a quote unquote mainstream ridiculous dummy load story that

1911
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:25,460
is best fit for a five-year-old or third grade mentality, which is probably an eight-year-old,

1912
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:29,800
and all of you, and I mean all of you, fall for it and discuss it.

1913
01:42:30,620 --> 01:42:31,480
That is pathetic.

1914
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:34,480
I am so sorry for humanity at this point.

1915
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:39,980
Anyway, I just have to say, and this has been going on.

1916
01:42:40,040 --> 01:42:42,520
I've been on this planet for more than a half a century.

1917
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:45,520
So I've got to say this is all I've noticed.

1918
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:51,680
The beauty of this is as you're being set up and as we go further into time, yes, the

1919
01:42:51,680 --> 01:42:57,640
recordation of time, as we go further and further into these events, regardless of how

1920
01:42:57,640 --> 01:43:03,020
esoteric the emotions get, regardless of what you think is going on or what you're being

1921
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:11,200
told or even dummy loaded about or concerned, it's all about the setup of the central part

1922
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:15,860
or center mass of the earth, which is known as Middle East, and if you're going to live

1923
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:22,680
your life with efficiency, you will be able to see what is in that area, what is in that

1924
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:25,340
part of the world with efficiency and clarity.

1925
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:27,980
I'll give you another example.

1926
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:33,300
One thing that I have been saying for over a decade is that the Western world, the Western

1927
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:39,640
culture, the Western convention is going to be playing second fiddle to this new, let's

1928
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:46,240
say revived way or convention, which is all things old, like if you want a new idea, read

1929
01:43:46,240 --> 01:43:53,160
an old book, but all these old religions, sciences, conventions are going to be revived

1930
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:57,720
and seen as something new or coming out of the ashes of something bad that is going on

1931
01:43:57,720 --> 01:44:01,400
there right now, but the Western world is going to be playing second fiddle.

1932
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:02,340
What a better way?

1933
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:07,100
Look at what's going on with all of the Western leadership, Western banking, Western

1934
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:07,540
industry.

1935
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:08,900
What Western industry?

1936
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:11,100
Where is it all being manufactured?

1937
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:20,020
You can sit and complain and bitch and moan about where you are, meaning if you're in

1938
01:44:20,020 --> 01:44:27,700
the Western world, and take place in its inefficiency only to be even more inefficient later when

1939
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:30,900
you see everything going to another part of the world and wishing it was here.

1940
01:44:30,900 --> 01:44:36,420
How about acknowledging what's going on and taking part of it with efficiency?

1941
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:41,740
If you want to know what is coming in the future, you better have a pretty good grip

1942
01:44:41,740 --> 01:44:43,360
on the past, right?

1943
01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:50,900
For example, if someone lights a fuse, I think Alfred Hitchcock in one of his docos or

1944
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:54,960
documentaries gave an example about suspense, and he said if you're going to do suspense,

1945
01:44:55,080 --> 01:44:56,680
you can't just have a bomb blow up.

1946
01:44:56,940 --> 01:44:59,460
You can't just have something explode and shock the audience.

1947
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:03,940
You have to show the audience that there is a bomb under the desk where the man is

1948
01:45:03,940 --> 01:45:08,020
sitting unawares, and it's like the audience is crawling in their seats trying to talk

1949
01:45:08,020 --> 01:45:09,800
to the actor on the screen.

1950
01:45:09,880 --> 01:45:11,720
Don't you know there's a bomb under your desk?

1951
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:12,260
Get away.

1952
01:45:12,380 --> 01:45:12,800
Get away.

1953
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:14,340
That's how you build suspense.

1954
01:45:14,980 --> 01:45:18,240
Well, I'm not trying to build suspense or anything, right?

1955
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:23,080
So this is not like something that's going to be going off like that, but it is going

1956
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:26,500
to be going off in slow motion where it's going to be acceptable, but it's going to

1957
01:45:26,500 --> 01:45:32,640
be extremely destructive to your ways, and there is nothing anyone can do.

1958
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:34,780
When I say you, I'm addressing the Western Convention.

1959
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:36,140
Yes.

1960
01:45:37,380 --> 01:45:42,020
Well, your mac and cheese and Stouffer's lasagna and your hot dogs and all that crappy

1961
01:45:42,020 --> 01:45:45,980
food that's eaten in the West, I mean, I'm not talking about the French and the Italians

1962
01:45:45,980 --> 01:45:49,980
and the Spanish, but all that crap that you folks eat might be replaced with falafels.

1963
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:50,400
Ha ha.

1964
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:59,180
Anyway, so anyway, this is just one way to just say things, just keeping it real, like

1965
01:45:59,180 --> 01:45:59,800
they say, right?

1966
01:45:59,860 --> 01:46:00,260
In the ghetto.

1967
01:46:00,940 --> 01:46:07,000
So let's just put this one thing that you folks should look for.

1968
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:10,400
This is a place called Iraq, right?

1969
01:46:10,700 --> 01:46:13,280
And the northern part is known as the Nineveh Plains.

1970
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:13,920
Watch that.

1971
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:15,340
Watch that this year.

1972
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:17,000
Do me a favor and watch that.

1973
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:18,560
Yeah, uh-huh.

1974
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:20,380
See what's going to be happening there.

1975
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:22,320
I've been saying this for a long, long time.

1976
01:46:23,160 --> 01:46:23,260
Yeah.

1977
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:30,000
You ever notice how there's a lot of turmoil and you're suffering all this, I keep using

1978
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,040
this tonight, esoteric emotion about what's going on there and what to think about it?

1979
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:34,760
Yeah.

1980
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:36,060
You ever hear of a place called Israel?

1981
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:37,780
You ever hear of a place called Iran?

1982
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:38,780
Yeah.

1983
01:46:39,180 --> 01:46:42,640
Do you know that everything in the Middle East right now is revolving around those two

1984
01:46:42,640 --> 01:46:43,240
superpowers?

1985
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:45,660
Well, let's not call them superpowers yet.

1986
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:46,640
Yeah.

1987
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:47,540
Think about that.

1988
01:46:48,340 --> 01:46:48,540
Mm-hmm.

1989
01:46:49,060 --> 01:46:50,360
But watch Assyria.

1990
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:51,760
Assyrians.

1991
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:52,320
What do you know?

1992
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:53,160
That's Syria.

1993
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:54,500
Assyrians.

1994
01:46:54,620 --> 01:46:57,220
A-S-S-Y-R-I-A-N-S.

1995
01:46:57,740 --> 01:46:57,920
Yeah.

1996
01:46:57,940 --> 01:46:58,980
What do you know about those people?

1997
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:00,300
Better start learning about them.

1998
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:01,140
Yeah.

1999
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:02,360
Talk about efficiency.

2000
01:47:03,260 --> 01:47:05,060
So let's see what the chat's doing here.

2001
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:06,320
Oh, yeah.

2002
01:47:06,320 --> 01:47:06,940
You love falafels.

2003
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:07,200
Good.

2004
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:07,740
Yeah, you should.

2005
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:12,580
I once made falafels, by the way, for some people that were not familiar with it and said,

2006
01:47:12,620 --> 01:47:13,340
what kind of meat is that?

2007
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:14,340
I said, it's the boneless kind.

2008
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:15,140
They said, oh, it's very good.

2009
01:47:15,640 --> 01:47:16,080
Anyway.

2010
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:19,480
Yeah.

2011
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:20,600
The end of a plane.

2012
01:47:20,980 --> 01:47:22,480
Start looking at all that stuff.

2013
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:24,200
And also, I do see there's a wordsmith.

2014
01:47:24,340 --> 01:47:24,440
Yeah.

2015
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:26,020
It's someone I mentioned earlier.

2016
01:47:26,660 --> 01:47:30,920
Blog, there's a wordsmith in there that likes to cut and paste etymological terms.

2017
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:31,520
Yeah, that's good.

2018
01:47:32,100 --> 01:47:34,960
There's nothing wrong with precision and accuracy.

2019
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,960
And I think it's the way to go.

2020
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:42,260
So for anyone, which you won't find, by the way, in any media stream that you're looking at

2021
01:47:42,260 --> 01:47:44,060
because you're being accommodated.

2022
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:47,900
No one opens up a gas station in the middle of the desert unless they're going to accommodate

2023
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:48,820
the passersby.

2024
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:52,240
And when that road closes, that gas station has to close, too.

2025
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:54,060
With that said, we have one more week.

2026
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:56,700
Let's see what kind of contributions you folks can bring.

2027
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,680
Please bring it on to AFR.

2028
01:47:58,920 --> 01:47:59,380
Thank you.

2029
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:01,100
It's the Greek signing off till next week.

2030
01:48:01,580 --> 01:48:01,740
Ciao.
