00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
Greetings and welcome everyone. If you recognize the voice, you know who this is.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,830
And if you don't, it's the Greek. And be prepared for some more Greek-speak

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,810
on Uncommon Radio. It's also gone by Uncommon Sense

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:16,810
and it's uncommonradio.com. www.uncommonradio.com

5
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,950
That is a courtesy website where you can easily communicate

6
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,990
at your convenience. And by the way, this is a sonic experience

7
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,630
not just for the Greek, but for all. So if you care to participate

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,630
using, let's say, a Skype convention, feel free to go

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,410
to the www.uncommonradio.com website

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,990
and you will see an email there in red. And that email is also the Skype contact.

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,370
Yes, the entire email. That would be uncommonsenseradio1

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,210
at gmail.com and that's a numeric one. And that is the Skype contact

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,410
if you'd like to join through that convention. Also,

14
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,590
there is a, I guess a main switchboard

15
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,550
call-in line that you can get at American Freedom Radio.

16
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:06,290
And that one, as I pull it up, I know it's 218-339-8525.

17
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:07,770
So it's

18
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,350
218-339-8525.

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,770
And you probably won't be dialing, will you? You probably have a silly phone

20
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,470
or some kind of capacitive charging touchscreen.

21
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,350
So I always talk about perhaps, anyway,

22
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:27,510
it's a lascivious joke, maybe we'll leave it for later, about how funny

23
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:31,450
it would be for someone who's never used a dialing phone to try to

24
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,210
use one now. Maybe we'll bring it up later on.

25
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:39,370
By the way, Muppet Time or Pagan Time or

26
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,390
Pope's Work Schedule Time, I would say it's what they call March

27
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,410
23rd, 2017. And I like to always use

28
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:51,470
the exercise. If anyone wants to just pull up what they call the calendar, the work

29
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,250
schedule, if you look at today being what they call a

30
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,450
Thursday or Thursday for March 23rd, 2017, last year

31
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,370
I guess it was a Monday or a Tuesday. The next year it'll be a Friday or a

32
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,410
Saturday. So what is it? It's neither. It's a work

33
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,370
schedule. Now, I'm not knocking it, okay? Let's be ghetto

34
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,670
and knock it. I ain't down with that. No, it's not about that.

35
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,130
It's are we paying attention? Speaking of paying attention,

36
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,110
when things are worth paying attention to, I guess you pay attention to them, but

37
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,190
if you don't know about them, how are you going to pay attention to it? Lawfully.

38
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,150
Let's just say, you know that word lawful? Yeah, you've probably heard it, but you may not know much about

39
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,950
it. Yeah. Well, you know, think about keeping

40
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,030
time. Keeping time is simply just the recordation of events. And how do you do it so

41
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,050
it's lawful? Well, who's law, right? Well, maybe we'll get into that

42
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,890
later where law comes from and all that. I would suggest

43
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,130
this is the first month and the fifteenth day of the first month.

44
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,350
Anyone, isn't any ancient holy writs of any sort?

45
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,890
Even though you don't have any translations access to you, you most definitely

46
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,930
just have some kind of version. Or even if you're a keyboard warrior, go ahead and

47
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,230
plug in, let's say under a certain writ or something

48
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,870
what the thirteenth and the fourteenth of the first

49
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,790
month is supposed to be. Think about it. Well, either

50
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,850
way, welcome everyone and just a little bit of a

51
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,710
cold start there on the normal way the Greek starts off

52
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,610
just by maybe talking about what isn't spoken of.

53
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,710
Now, something interesting came up I just wanted to share.

54
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,710
I also want to maybe read a couple of emails as well. I always preface

55
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,890
that we don't get to them probably until the end of the two hours or so.

56
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,710
But nonetheless, I would suggest that

57
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,830
the concept of no one is paying any attention still

58
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,790
holds, folks. Or let's just say

59
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,870
discussion. What is discussion?

60
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:56,810
What is going on?

61
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:01,710
This is what came up, by the way. Fine print.

62
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,030
You've all heard of it somewhere. You've seen it.

63
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,770
It's on what they call contracts, the back of invoices, statements, things like

64
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,690
that. If that's important or if that's some kind of

65
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,630
condition or disclosure regarding an agreement or covenant

66
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:21,530
or something, why is it in fine print? Anyone think they can answer that? Maybe

67
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,970
in chat? I want to throw in why things are in fine print.

68
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,010
Remember, this is just, most of the time

69
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,430
the Greek brings up things that just aren't brought up by anyone and they're just in front of you.

70
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,550
It may not be the be all end all, but

71
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,490
we're questioning for the answer here. We're not just asking the

72
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,430
question and just whatever. And it's not a matter of whether

73
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,330
you like it or not. So think about it for a moment. Never really brought up the

74
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,410
fine print issue. Why is it in fine print? All right, let's just spill the beans

75
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,690
and say it. Could it be because they're in shame or they're embarrassed

76
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,270
to make it legible and readable and bring it forward into

77
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,850
the, let's say, the writ, right?

78
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,710
Writ, meaning things that are written or into the agreement or as

79
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,070
conditions. Why is it when you approach

80
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,770
administrative types, right? You know what

81
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,730
that is in this modern world. And they ask you to sign or agree to this.

82
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,590
Just sign here. And it's really long and lots of really fine print.

83
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,790
You want to sit there and read the fine print. Of course, there's 50 or 100 or 5,000

84
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,350
people standing behind you and they're all going to go through the same

85
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,570
dictate. Just sign here. But you want to read the fine print

86
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:39,110
and everyone gets angry. Just sign it. Everybody signs it.

87
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,450
So why is something so shameful, so

88
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,470
embarrassing that you're supposed to agree to that when you ask to read

89
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,530
it? Now, it's not shameful and embarrassing because you're asking to read it, but because

90
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,570
it's written in fine print. They're not proud of it. Think about

91
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,530
it. So the fine print, is something going to be hidden in it?

92
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,510
Well, you can still read it. It's fine print. But why is it just

93
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,590
whispered? You see? Welcome to the legal society, folks.

94
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,570
So think about it. Think about it. I mean, not

95
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,630
too much because there's really nothing much you can do for. Why? Because they're accommodating.

96
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,850
Well, first of all, they have to accommodate themselves.

97
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,510
How much have you heard of help yourself first? And they're just

98
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:27,590
helping themselves because certain societies, whether

99
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:31,770
the legal society, the medical society, the religious society,

100
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:35,570
the political society, on and on and on, just about

101
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,510
all of them, follow the old credo of help yourself

102
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,630
first. But here's the thing. The way that they help themselves

103
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,610
is only to help themselves. Why? Because what they are

104
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,570
engaged in, which is pranking, by the way, and this is

105
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:55,610
not a commentary or rant. This is just maybe tagging along

106
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,290
on what fine print is and why there is no discussion about it.

107
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,530
Their way of doing things is

108
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,610
a way that's been developed because you are you, meaning most of the

109
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,590
world, except for a few nations, which are toggling back and

110
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,410
forth under what's called a credit-based economy. And no, we're not going to talk about money

111
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,650
because this cosmic censorship is too heavy. No one will understand anything

112
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,750
than the, right? So let's get to the

113
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,750
point of it, is that in a credit-based society, the

114
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,770
people, quote-unquote, what is being used as money, have all the money.

115
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,690
And all the societies that are, or the, let's say

116
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,490
the apparatus that's built around it, doesn't matter whether it's through agency, through

117
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,470
administrative, through its government or corporate, they have nothing. They are part of the

118
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,590
receivership. Yes, receivership is a concept in bankruptcy.

119
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,090
Go look at it, maybe. Well, actually, don't look at it.

120
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:55,030
But you could. It's kind of maybe reverse psychology there

121
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,770
or reverse spiritualism, maybe. Same thing.

122
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,130
So what's going on is that if you can sign, you've

123
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:07,110
got it all. And if you're a company or an organization trying

124
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,090
to flip some kind of administrative stuff, you've got nothing. But the thing is, you've

125
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,490
got to get it from the people without letting them know that they have everything.

126
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,810
So fine print, legal society, credit society,

127
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,890
or credit-based society. You see how one

128
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,230
thing can't be brought up without showing how everything ties together.

129
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,850
Yeah. Let's just go back and tie again. Let's just weave back and forth.

130
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:34,870
You know, on a loom, you kind of start on the left, you go to the right, and you go back to the

131
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,549
left, okay, back to the right, okay. Well, think about it, folks.

132
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,890
If it appears to lawfully be around the first month, in the middle of the first month,

133
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:46,550
the moon should be fairly dark out there right now. And it's quite an important

134
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:49,830
day or days of observation

135
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,730
for those that are in the know.

136
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,230
Notice I didn't say uninitiated because there's nothing to be initiated into.

137
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,790
There's no group or crowd, by the way. But it's the first month, folks.

138
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,550
Now, physically in the natural world, you would say

139
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,590
perhaps down under and across those latitudes, it might be the seventh

140
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,930
month. Yes. Think about it. It's not that simple.

141
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,070
Could it be that many things involve tactics

142
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,870
and strategy and knowledge and learning and technique

143
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,050
and maybe it's starting to sound a little like chess and not

144
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,950
just simple checkers? So maybe

145
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,970
it's not like a television sitcom or a television

146
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,990
episode where everything gets explained and fixed in the last two

147
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,510
minutes? It doesn't work like that. But anyway,

148
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,470
everything is sort of tied together. I had a conversation this week

149
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:49,510
regarding boundary layers. It just kind of came up trying to explain

150
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,410
certain things. One thing contacts another, whether it's a liquid, gas

151
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,550
or solid. So you could be a surface-dwelling earth inhabitant and still be

152
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:01,350
in full contact with the fish in the deepest part of the ocean through

153
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,510
boundary layers of gas, solid and liquid. And this is

154
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,970
not some esoteric

155
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,770
whatever sublime thing. Just think about it.

156
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,790
Gases are a medium of contact. You can have a lightning

157
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,650
go through it. It conducts electricity. If

158
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:24,790
you're passing through air, let's say, which is a gas, fast enough

159
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:28,810
– I almost had a little joke there – but fast enough, it appears to be a

160
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,790
solid. That's why things get friction and burn up when they're

161
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,470
entering the atmosphere and things. So again, a surface-dwelling earth

162
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,410
inhabitant, you're in a meat bag with a frame, skeletal frame,

163
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,430
and you have this flexible membrane known as the skin, which is in contact with

164
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,430
the air. Or you're a lazy boy or the couch or the desk chair or wherever you

165
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,390
might be as well. Or

166
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,470
maybe your panties, which are probably in a twist by now if this is the first time you've

167
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,750
ever turned into Uncommon Radio. So your skin

168
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,570
is in contact with the air, and that air is in contact

169
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,590
with the surface of the water. It doesn't matter how far away it is, which

170
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,650
is in contact with the water, which is in contact with the fish, and it's all connected.

171
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,030
And this is the type of thinking

172
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,430
that goes into the longitudinal side, which is opposite

173
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,790
the transverse. What did he just say? What does that mean? Well, transverse is where time

174
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,490
and motion and waves propagate further

175
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,430
away the longer it takes. Longitudinal, there is no time. It's

176
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,650
instant. This is what Tesla was dealing with, by the way.

177
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:40,270
When you go and study the world

178
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:44,410
or society of the gods, yes, those unseen friends that crazy people

179
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,350
have, they operate in a longitudinal fashion.

180
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,950
So one way to start on that point of thinking

181
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,930
of instantaneous is how everything is already connected.

182
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,470
So again, the soft membrane, dry or juicy

183
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,850
or whatever outside of your body is connected to

184
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:08,450
the deepest parts of the ocean and the fish there through boundary layers

185
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,510
of various materials. And of course, it's easy to take the air for granted

186
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:16,610
unless you're moving at 25,000 miles per hour at about 50,000 feet

187
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,270
and then it acts as if it's made of concrete.

188
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,470
So it's a perspective thing.

189
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:28,450
So let's maybe engage a chat if anyone feels like they would

190
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,510
like to call, they may.

191
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,570
By the way, at any time, if I'm not giving the call in number, you can go to the

192
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,370
American Freedom Radio homepage and you will see it on the top

193
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,030
left in a red box. And if you don't see it there, it's on your other left

194
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,630
which is still the left.

195
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,530
Again, nothing to be ashamed of. So call in if you like.

196
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,670
I would suggest also when you're

197
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,310
let's say passing through this world, using that word passing again,

198
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,490
and you're looking at things around you, you ever notice how

199
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,250
it's always something out there, right?

200
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,950
Could it be that when all of your attention

201
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,650
is taken to somewhere out there, you really can't see what's going on right

202
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,870
here? Back in the 50s, they had the space men,

203
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,830
the space monster. And then you could always

204
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,650
see it's always out there, something to draw your attention.

205
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,290
Because maybe it starts at what they call home.

206
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:36,710
How about home being the body and how about reaching your arms out into the room?

207
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,830
What have you got, about a five or six foot radius? Why don't you master what is

208
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:44,850
around you there? When you're out in nature, you notice how the temperature

209
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,010
works differently than it does inside.

210
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,830
Heat doesn't go up in nature and heat

211
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,950
doesn't go up in living things. Think about it.

212
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,530
So mastering these things through perception,

213
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,050
you don't have to do anything, just perceive them.

214
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,610
How about at one point

215
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:12,810
turning off dummy loading? There's things called

216
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,870
influence. And by the way, speaking of influence,

217
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,730
I want to thank everyone who has influenced through input

218
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,590
to AFR regarding uncommon radio

219
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,910
because this is the fourth time the Greek has come around solo and perhaps

220
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,750
discussing as if this is the open members area, how

221
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,870
things might actually be or the liturgy of the back

222
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,990
room for those exclusive people that want to pay to hear

223
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:44,470
things, which you see everywhere, members areas and things like that.

224
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,590
By the way, I keep saying it, I find it distasteful to do that, but

225
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:52,610
I just wanted to thank everyone who has contributed and

226
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,630
shown voting by sending some

227
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,070
form of credits over to AFR. I've discussed how that actually works.

228
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:04,630
You really didn't send anything, but it's part of being on this planet. No, you can't change it,

229
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,410
but even though you haven't sent anything and it does show up as if you did send

230
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,650
some more, that would be great. It's very much appreciated from having

231
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:16,450
discussions with the management at AFR. This was probably the first time

232
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,350
any kind of an effort was made like this by the public in recent memory.

233
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,290
I really want to just thank everyone and

234
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,550
show that it is very, very appreciated. If you can

235
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,530
keep contributing, at least this is the fourth time

236
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,450
the Greek has come around solo. We had a goal. I haven't mentioned

237
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,290
what that number is, but we're very close to it. Very, very close. I mean like

238
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,590
really close. So if we can get just a few more people just to send something

239
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,550
Oh, it sounds like a beg-a-thon. No, no, no.

240
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,870
All right. Send something.

241
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,030
You're voting for the Greek, right? Okay.

242
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,670
I just want to throw this out there. There's some project in the works.

243
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,090
Usually you've heard the Greek. The history of it is calling in years ago

244
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:08,670
various places including here and doing what they call

245
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,210
round tables and things like that. It's not because I just want to do that.

246
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:16,470
The reason was basically because listening to what was being put out

247
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,630
and saying

248
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:24,270
this doesn't sound correct. It sounds like what people

249
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:28,250
are used to hearing and maybe the highest and best use of

250
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,410
a medium that is not so directly controlled is to perhaps

251
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:35,590
be talking about the truth. The truth of the matter.

252
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,970
Because you've got to realize, people, everyone's got their own truth now, right?

253
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,210
So I would call in and

254
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,890
try to make some comments and of course didn't do much.

255
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:50,330
And then it kind of evolved into the idea of speaking out because

256
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:54,910
it just should be spoken. Because really it's kind of

257
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:58,550
embarrassing for the human race. Actually, let's just say it this way.

258
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,890
The Greek is embarrassed to be called human.

259
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:06,589
Not all you fruity breakfast types, you know, fruits, nuts and flakes are going to say

260
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:10,829
oh, he just said he's not human. No, I'm embarrassed for you and myself

261
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:14,750
included at this point because these things are not being said.

262
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,490
What are these things? Very, very simple things. And by the way,

263
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,410
if you've ever turned into Uncommon Sense on Common Radio or Greek speak and you don't understand it,

264
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,770
that's great, you're normal. But okay, all those things aside.

265
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,170
But the project that's going to be perhaps coming

266
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:34,290
is going to be interesting. It'll probably be

267
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:38,350
an AFR. I should say most likely. I don't think any kind of an effort is going to be

268
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,350
made outside of that at this point. And it will emanate from there. And it will be

269
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:46,130
something very new, very different. And it will be Greek speak.

270
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,670
But we'll fill you folks in on it more. It'll be

271
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,370
more, a little deeper into

272
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,250
things and perhaps a little more stuff.

273
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,970
We'll just see how it develops as it develops. Right now there's just

274
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,830
basically not even a framework being put together. But hopefully

275
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,430
it will be around after maybe, let's say, the seventh

276
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,950
sonic event or so. This is around the fourth sonic event. So that gives you a little

277
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,670
bit of time to think about it and if there's anything else.

278
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:20,430
So I would suggest, again,

279
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:25,230
if you folks like what you're hearing, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

280
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,650
Well, send something to AFR. Just do that electronic boogie-woogie thing

281
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,790
and let AFR know through some credits

282
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,390
of some sort that you appreciate the Greek coming on. Because

283
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,810
I do appreciate you folks as well. Let me just say it at this point.

284
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,750
I've gotten quite a few emails. And they've all been

285
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,770
very positive. And not just, oh, I like you. What do you say? Well, I don't

286
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,570
know. I just like you. Nothing like that. It's all been very rational and

287
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,910
very much based on what's being imparted and not the Greek

288
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:00,910
sort of what the Greek is saying. And again, if these

289
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:04,070
things were being said, you wouldn't know of the Greek.

290
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,210
So the

291
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:12,830
feedback has been very good. And that's why I appreciate you

292
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,910
folks out there who have been giving the proper feedback.

293
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,770
Proper meaning, it's like table tennis. You know, you

294
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:24,770
put out some info and it comes back slightly different, but it's still the same

295
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,470
ball. So it's been working out very, very well

296
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,750
to understand or comprehend that there's at least about 150 to

297
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,750
200 surface-dwelling earth inhabitants out there that

298
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,050
are thinking somewhat. Yes. So

299
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,690
I'm going to log into the email and just maybe

300
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,850
start off this first hour by reading some of them. I'll also

301
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:52,590
check the chat. Because based on the

302
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,550
following project that's going to be coming, things are going to get a little deeper,

303
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,870
a little more concise and more defined.

304
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,570
And let me just give you folks a hint. It may not be open to the public.

305
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,130
Think about it. None of it. So just bear that in mind.

306
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,650
But at the moment, we're going to do

307
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,790
our best with, let's say, time allotted and venue allotted and what can be

308
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:20,650
said. So let's see if anyone feels like calling

309
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:24,510
in, please do so. And let's just see here

310
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,730
in the chat, there's not much. Just regarding some kind

311
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,270
of covenant from some really old book maybe.

312
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:36,670
Yeah, let's see. Okay, just some basic chit-chat. I wonder why

313
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:40,530
they just call it chat and they don't call it chit-chat. So just

314
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,570
bear with me, folks. I'm going to log into the emails here for a moment. I came unprepared.

315
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,570
Let's see if I can find them in the slurry. The way things have been

316
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,070
sorted out here is sort of unintuitive.

317
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,770
Here's one that was gotten today.

318
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,570
It might sound a little perky or something, but this is the

319
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,750
idea and this is part of the discussion that happens when I'm not on air.

320
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,730
Thank you, Greek, for covering the questions last week.

321
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,630
I hope you continue to discuss many topics despite how it may appear that

322
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:16,570
there are many of us out here that are very tired of the

323
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,430
economy low and have listened to O&G and Uncommon Sense

324
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,630
and it is impossible to look at any other media. There's really no going back.

325
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,550
So we look forward to whatever you do in the future. Best wishes. Thank you very much.

326
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,050
You see, that would be like the loosest commentary

327
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,610
that I've ever gotten, but it's still specific enough

328
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,590
regarding why. So when people tell you

329
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,870
things, maybe ask why and you get to a certain point.

330
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,930
How can a subject be brought up?

331
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,690
Look, you cannot discuss anything without

332
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,090
it connecting to the credit system. Think about it.

333
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,850
You cannot discuss almost any subject or anything unless it's

334
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,930
connected to the human body. Think about it. Or any subject that's

335
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,790
connected to the mind. Not connected to the mind. Everything is.

336
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,870
Or just quality. I brought up

337
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,490
earlier the idea of temperature.

338
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:20,150
Paying attention to what's going on around you. Just in the room around you.

339
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,950
However you want to consider. An indoor space versus

340
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,590
a natural space. Or a living body versus a dead body.

341
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,430
You'll notice that there is a rarefied rise in cold and a descending heat.

342
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:35,490
You want warm feet and a cool head. And when it's hot in the valley, it's cold in the mountain.

343
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:39,890
As you go higher, it gets cooler. Don't listen to these academic types that try to

344
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,310
well, you go ahead and listen, but have a laugh.

345
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,670
How is this temperature being measured with the expansion

346
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:51,670
of mercury, whether it's Fahrenheit or Celsius, and there were even some other conventions

347
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,670
at some point. How does that render

348
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:59,750
quality? Can you consider mercury

349
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,850
to be something of, what is its qualitative nature? Can you consider it to be

350
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,650
of quality that you would pursue? Well, maybe in a

351
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,690
thermometer. But why are we relying on things, I say we

352
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,390
meaning as it would be discussed how things are done on Earth

353
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:19,750
on something that is the expansion of the toxic substance. And again, just to bring up

354
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,650
temperature. Let's say it's 70 degrees Fahrenheit. You might be

355
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:27,750
very comfortable at sea level in let's say a t-shirt or a button down

356
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,410
shirt. And if you go below sea level,

357
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:35,690
mercury still being at 70 degrees Fahrenheit, you might

358
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,750
feel a tad warm. And still, if you go to the

359
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,770
top of a mountain or very high altitude, or not so high but higher

360
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:47,590
altitude than sea level, even if the

361
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,670
mercury is still at 70 degrees, you might start to feel a little chill. You notice

362
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:55,610
that the mercury has been reading the same temperature in all three locations, but

363
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,590
you feel there is a difference. And how come devices

364
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:03,570
haven't been measured to measure quality? Now, we talk about

365
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:07,510
food also. It's the same thing. You can take a petite Rothschild

366
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,670
1972 wine and a 3,000

367
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:15,450
whatever in credits, euros, dollars, whatever bottle of wine and take it to a lab

368
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:19,530
and they'll give you a chemical constituents and then you can go

369
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:23,410
ahead and based on the assay or the diagnosis of that wine

370
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,590
put all those things together. The tannins, the sugars, the water, the minerals.

371
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,190
Is it going to taste like that? No, it's not.

372
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:34,830
So you have a very limited description

373
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,810
and very little explanation being given to you throughout

374
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,970
anywhere or anything. Here's the thing.

375
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,450
If you want to look at statistically or hit or miss or just the efficacy

376
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:50,810
or how well or how effective an institution can be, if

377
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:54,270
university and college was so good, how come there's so many bad professors

378
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:59,070
or bad attorneys or bad doctors or bad

379
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:03,090
and I say bad, good boy, bad boy, good boy

380
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,530
bad boy, the good guys, the bad guys

381
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,790
poor in quality. And by the way

382
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:14,890
I've heard this before also. There's no such thing as a good attorney. There's a competent

383
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:15,530
attorney.

384
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,250
Going from just marking

385
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,890
because someone has passed some social rank

386
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,710
some form of glorification

387
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:34,090
let's say. Doesn't that render laziness?

388
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,990
Think about it. So a lot of the things that you hear

389
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:41,270
here at Greek Speak, Uncommon Radio

390
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,830
these are not things that are some far off thing. There are no

391
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:49,730
aliens that can get you or black goo or flat earth

392
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:52,950
or any of the ridiculous stuff or political talk. By the way folks

393
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,710
why is it, I think last week

394
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,990
I brought up the invisible ring in people's noses and how you're being accommodated

395
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:05,230
if you turn on what they call alternative media or mainstream media, they're the same

396
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,950
they're running parallel tracks

397
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,810
now it's a political thing and if you are going to any of these media things

398
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,890
you're being dummy loaded. So one way to

399
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:20,670
maybe control what you eat through the mind because

400
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:24,790
maybe thought can be food in a way. You start hearing

401
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:28,630
political talk, that's

402
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,830
poor character. Why? Because when you're

403
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,850
doing political talk, now the receiver may not be

404
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:40,670
poor character but definitely the deliverer is, that's for sure. And poor character

405
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:44,670
can be developed many ways. Censorship being probably

406
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,730
the most important and then good food or good intake and all that

407
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:53,010
or lack of it let's say promotes all these things

408
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:56,730
but I would suggest that the reason why it's poor

409
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:00,930
and I brought this up in several private conversations and it was kind of laid into

410
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:04,690
and I quickly put a stop to it. It's very simple to rationalize why

411
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:08,870
the poor taste and the poverty of character

412
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:12,750
of those that are engrossed in the political scene is very

413
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,950
simple. If you start discussing anything political it starts going into

414
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,190
that fray where you're going to be bringing up the way

415
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:24,750
governing agencies and bodies function. You're going to be bringing up

416
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,590
economics. You're going to be bringing up social control.

417
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,890
All of these things, the way they're being discussed is

418
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:36,950
100% false. Well let's say 99.99999%

419
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:40,730
false. So would you say that it's all lies? Yeah, it's all lies but

420
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,890
they've all been accepted as being lies. I mean not lies

421
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:48,970
but whatever, talk. Now let's just take those down real quick.

422
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:52,690
When they're talking about controlling agencies or the

423
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:56,970
sovereign agencies or the sovereign government, they've all been bankrupted. They're in receivership.

424
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,690
You could look that up, what that means.

425
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:05,010
They're under what's called policy not law. This is not a comment against or for them. I'm just stating

426
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,950
why political discussion is false. Do they have power? Yes, they do.

427
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:12,850
They do have power because there's plenty of people willing to

428
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:16,870
put on a uniform and do other things. Patriotism, have you heard

429
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:20,810
about that? Not that those things are bad. It's just that that's why the

430
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:24,930
perception of it is so strong. But what's been memorialized

431
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,470
about them, they don't exist as they think they do.

432
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:32,850
The other thing when economics comes up in this political commentary

433
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,490
which always does, it's a credit based economy.

434
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:41,050
Just do what forensic auditing or forensic accounting would render

435
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:45,250
to show where all this money comes from or what a debt is

436
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:48,290
in a credit based economy. So all of these discussions

437
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:53,250
and the social engineering part, all these things that are being

438
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,890
put on the people are because they're accommodating the mindset.

439
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,790
So this political talk that you hear

440
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:05,210
that's going on right now is a very, very poor quality and you're going to be

441
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,890
eating this when you hear it. Now I'm not going to say when you hear

442
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:12,910
political talk, just shut it off. That would be the best thing to do, but I'm not going to

443
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,950
suggest that. You're big boys and girls at this point.

444
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,210
But the thing is, again like the email stated, where are you going to go and get anything?

445
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,210
Silence maybe. Here's the thing.

446
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,710
If what they call the inane net or internet or the

447
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,770
World Wide Web was being used for its highest and best use at this point, you

448
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,810
wouldn't have much political talk. You would have edification talk perhaps.

449
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,770
Again, this is part of the

450
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:44,810
censorship, but this is just for those out there listening. You can just look

451
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:48,930
at pretty much everything that's being discussed in the mainstream and alternative by the way.

452
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,650
There's these cosmic invisible rings

453
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:56,850
in people's noses, seven billion let's say or those that have access to it

454
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,950
and they're all being led around and they don't know it or they do know it

455
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,850
but they're not doing anything about it and they shouldn't because they can't do anything about it.

456
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:08,690
But there are those out there that can see and those out there that can hear

457
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:12,230
and maybe a little bit of Greek speak will rationalize it for you.

458
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,190
Not telling you how to think about it or what to think about it, but just

459
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:20,790
think about it. You can say, well, is it wrong

460
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:24,110
for me to do this or wrong for me to listen to politics? I've heard this. Is it wrong?

461
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:28,190
I'll say, well, it's not wrong, but it's definitely not right.

462
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:32,470
Just by looking at the quality of the discussion and without being

463
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,350
ad hominem and looking at the actual individuals, you probably won't meet the people that you see

464
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:40,410
on TV or hear on radio or whatever, but I'm suggesting that there's poor character

465
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,190
all throughout all of it.

466
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:48,470
You see, I brought up the concept of politics, but I would also

467
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:51,970
suggest if there was a missing airplane, it would have been that.

468
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:56,190
If it was this or this or that or that, it would have been that.

469
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,510
How much of it would have been discussed accurately, precisely

470
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:03,650
with also bringing up things that are memorialized about that

471
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:06,230
topic? Probably none of it.

472
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:11,630
This is how humanity has been eking along for a very, very, very

473
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:15,550
long time. I've stated the obvious for the past half hour

474
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,910
or so. Big deal. Big effing deal. Why?

475
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:23,530
Because the obvious is where it lies, and the obvious is the last thing for people to discover.

476
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,130
Here's the thing. There's a lot of zealous

477
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:31,330
– not jealous, but zealousy, meaning, oh, we've got to do something about it.

478
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:35,110
There's nothing you're going to do about it. You could actually dummy load yourself

479
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,170
if you have that energy. Put it out there.

480
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:43,030
Wilhelm Reich talked a lot about the life force being bottled up in the body and how it can create

481
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:46,570
other manifestations that are not necessarily good for you.

482
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:50,830
Let's just put it that way. You need to get that out

483
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,050
if it manifests that way.

484
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,210
I don't even

485
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:01,170
need to go down that. This is a year, by the way,

486
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,070
folks, which is going to be very much like the past seven years that have passed.

487
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:08,830
Very much so, but it's going to be ending, and you're going to have a transition into

488
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:13,110
another period starting next year in the spring or the fall if you're down under.

489
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,010
By the way, I don't know if I've thrown this in before.

490
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:21,350
We've done a lawful measurement of time,

491
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,790
and you folks that are down under are not a day ahead.

492
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:27,130
According to the sun, the moon, the stars, and the planet.

493
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:32,730
According to the work schedule or the wind-up toy or some other fallacious way,

494
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,590
you've been told they've set you somewhere further ahead.

495
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:40,090
But the measurement taken by the moon repeatedly now

496
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:45,410
shows that it actually reaches a point where it can be

497
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,750
measured, and it always shows that the

498
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:52,250
more eastern part precedes it.

499
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,750
Let's just say this, just to

500
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,750
sum it up. Those folks down under that are scheduled

501
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:04,270
to be a day ahead, you've heard that sometimes.

502
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:08,650
We're calling from the future or we're in tomorrow already or whatever.

503
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,610
You're not lawfully according to the schedule you are, but remember,

504
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:16,650
it's about the schedule because if you don't show up to work and do these things,

505
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:21,110
you might get fired. But you may not get fired if you've never been hired though.

506
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,170
So anyway. So again,

507
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,310
lawfully the folks down there are, just brought that up because

508
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:31,390
when it's spring for up here, it's fall for down there.

509
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:35,550
You folks, just something to think about, not to add more confusion,

510
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:40,590
you are trailing behind. So where does it start

511
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:44,670
would be the next logical question. Let's just put this out. I would suggest that it starts around

512
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:48,450
the center mass of the earth with the

513
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:52,690
lawful marking of time. Not because you think it is or he

514
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:56,910
thinks or who gee what it doesn't. It's because it's a reference point.

515
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:00,830
It starts around the Levant, which would be

516
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,910
the east coast of the Mediterranean and somewhere around northern Iraq

517
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:08,090
is where the datum line for the planet kind of changes.

518
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:12,770
That Mesopotamia region. Yeah. You hear about it

519
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:16,770
all the time and you have what I brought up, esoteric emotion about it. You don't know

520
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:20,770
what to do about those people. Yeah. Those people in that part

521
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:24,750
of the world. Yeah. And if anyone is familiar with Greek speak, you've heard

522
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,670
quite a bit. But even when I do discuss the coming world order,

523
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,050
which is not the current world order,

524
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:36,469
it's still never in depth and that will be done in the future. I mean

525
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:40,550
very detailed. But the details right now, even

526
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,650
the slightest amount of generality is way, way, way beyond

527
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:48,630
anything else out there. So why even bother? Why even bother getting

528
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:52,210
into details? And a quick specific example is

529
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:56,770
in terms of the world stage, what you're witnessing is the precursor to the formation

530
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:00,170
not the formation, but actually the precursor to the formation of

531
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:04,670
a Middle East Union type thing that will be headquarters for

532
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:08,170
every aspect of man's society. Yes, it's kind of hard to see,

533
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:10,830
but that's why you have to know.

534
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:15,870
Anyway, and I've always given various explanations

535
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:19,790
and basically let's just throw this in there. I don't go much deeper

536
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:24,130
than just saying one of the signs that you will see that this is forming is a

537
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:28,370
new country being formed in northern Iraq. It has not been a nation

538
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:32,010
for a very long time. And that new country will be called the new

539
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,750
Assyria or Assyria. Have you ever heard of the Assyrians?

540
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:40,970
Assyrians, not Syria, but Assyrians, A-S-S-Y-R-I-A-N-S.

541
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:44,030
There are many other things, but that's just enough for now.

542
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:47,750
And I hope that puts at least some things

543
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:51,750
in perspective of what's going on. So I have not been ignoring the chat. I see there's quite a bit

544
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,630
of activity or somewhat of activity. I'm just going to go there and see what's being discussed.

545
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,530
I saw Greek in all caps.

546
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,890
Okay, will you elaborate on what day it is? Well, it's all perceived

547
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,770
in significance of the following seven days.

548
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,990
I've brought this up before.

549
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:16,070
The majority of the personal messages, let's say private messages and even calls on air

550
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:19,970
have been regarding what's called the Bible or Biblical stuff or the Scriptures.

551
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,530
I don't like calling it the Bible or whatever. Let's just leave

552
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,450
a personal critique out of it.

553
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:31,890
I always preface several things before I discuss that. First of all, it's very difficult

554
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,890
to have a discussion regarding that because when people do have

555
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:39,870
discussions, they tend to be false because they're based on churchianity or

556
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:42,370
whatever or other comments

557
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,430
and things like that that are not based on...

558
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:51,970
Okay, let's just say it this way. All of the information that you're getting is coming out of a version.

559
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:55,490
The actual Scripture, what has been memorialized...

560
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:59,270
Now, it doesn't matter. This has nothing to do with your religion or belief. It could be anything.

561
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:02,530
It could be an engineering document from the days of Archimedes.

562
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:07,190
Anything. If it has not been translated, it has not been translated.

563
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:11,570
A version is not a translation. You can't get a dinner napkin and a crayon

564
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:15,250
and write a hundred note on it and go and spend it, even though the one

565
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:18,810
that's printed by the banks is just as fake. It's the perception.

566
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:23,490
We have a perception that something is real when it is not here.

567
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,350
Sorry, folks. Just like anything, you have to go back to what it is.

568
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:31,650
In other words, if we're discussing wheat, why is it that people just want to talk

569
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,890
about puffed wheat? And when whole wheat comes up, it's no good.

570
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:39,110
So, I just wanted to bring up

571
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,230
most of the discussion I have.

572
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:47,350
A great majority of it is questioning that, which I've also stated in the past that you will see

573
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:50,390
more discussion about it in the future, but none of it will still be accurate.

574
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:54,670
The other thing I want to bring up, whenever you bring up any holy writ of the world,

575
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:58,710
most people tend to comment, and I say this often, I'll say it again,

576
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,770
most people tend to comment, oh, the Bible, oh, the Koran, oh, the Rig Veda, oh, no.

577
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:05,330
You know what? I'm not religious. I don't want to know anything about it.

578
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,830
They're excused at that point, but let me just translate that for you,

579
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:14,890
what that could mean. It means that, yeah, I've been on this planet

580
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:18,010
long enough to see what these religions do and say,

581
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:22,990
and I'm kind of disgusted by it, and that seemingly is attached to that,

582
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,010
and I don't want anything to do with it.

583
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:30,710
So if you want to know why people don't want to hear a Biblical discussion or anything

584
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,950
regarding any language, or any other holy writ,

585
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:36,350
thank the religion that hijacked it.

586
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:42,210
Just think about that for a moment, because there's not one religion on the planet that does anything

587
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,910
that's in the text that they allegedly subscribe to. Yes, Islam as well.

588
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,790
And I had a discussion, why don't you talk about the Koran and Islam?

589
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:53,570
I said, well, because most of the audience, I'm presuming, is of the Western convention,

590
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:57,170
and the entire world, by the way, is what's called the Christian era,

591
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:00,830
so that they are also. Have you ever heard of Friday worship, by the way?

592
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:04,970
There is no Friday in the Koran, folks. I had someone trying to tell me there is.

593
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:09,890
I had someone once try to tell me that King James is the true

594
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,150
word of G.O.D. I mean, this is

595
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,790
really a commentary on humanity, not on that particular subject matter.

596
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:21,930
So you notice I've skirted the issue in chat. Tell us about what's important.

597
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:25,890
A few folks are hearing this down the stream. If you have some internet

598
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:29,730
access, and of course it might make you not feel well, because I just explained why,

599
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,870
what the time being,

600
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:37,950
let's say the middle of the first month, 13th, 14th, 15th, it's really

601
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:41,850
the 15th till noon, apparently, through measurement, observation,

602
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:46,110
it's an important time of, let's say an appointed

603
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:49,690
time. If you look up in any kind of a

604
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:53,350
biblical search, what is the 13th day of the first month?

605
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:56,150
And that already happened.

606
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:01,970
There might be something, perhaps more

607
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:05,530
discussion. I don't mind doing it. I've done many, many hours regarding

608
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:09,990
certain things that people could look up regarding many subjects, but

609
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,610
the biblical one as well, that everything that you've been told about it is false.

610
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:17,710
And also I want to throw out, I would

611
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:21,550
say that there is also a slew, and it plays a large

612
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:25,550
factor in the way people pursue things, and a slew of writings through the

613
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:29,150
years and ages regarding that, that are false as well.

614
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:33,690
I don't like to bring a pinpoint up exactly, but something called the Urantia

615
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:37,490
book was always brought up, and people that were older and well-studied, and shame on you

616
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:41,490
older folks, by the way. I always tell the young people, you're on your own,

617
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:45,430
look at these old fools. But anyway, that's

618
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:49,430
a very lazy assumption that someone's

619
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:53,490
going to make a commentary. How do you know, by the way, if you look

620
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:57,310
at something like the Urantia, how do you know it's false? By the way,

621
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:01,310
if you look at something like what's put in front of you in mainstream

622
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:05,070
religion that has captured the biblical text, whether it's New or Old Testament,

623
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:09,310
because there's a couple of religions that have done that, and a couple

624
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:12,970
too. By the way, when you're shown

625
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:17,650
through efficiency, when you see something called the Shroud of Turin,

626
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:21,470
how do you know that's false? Not that it's fake or real, it's just that it's

627
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:25,090
absurd. When you just look at it, if you know

628
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,890
what's called the Scripture, you will just look at it and in less than half a second

629
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,930
know that it's not the real thing.

630
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:37,150
When you look at what's memorialized as certain sites

631
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:41,290
and days regarding certain religions,

632
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:45,390
regarding things biblical, can you determine that they're a fraud and a fake

633
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:49,110
in just a second or two? You see? It's very

634
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,710
simple. Once you know something, you can see it right away.

635
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:57,230
I've explained how all of those things are

636
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,290
that way, by the way.

637
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,970
Anyone can look it up. But the thing is, once you start looking for

638
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:09,070
precision and accuracy in anything, it doesn't matter, even your own field,

639
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:12,350
the field that you might be working in, regardless of what it is,

640
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:17,290
you're not going to be that likable. Through history, I've noticed

641
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:20,930
that people that excel and gain mastership in any

642
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:25,050
field have a really hard time. But at some point,

643
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:28,930
they are rewarded. At some point, something is rewarding,

644
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:32,770
I should say. Let's just see.

645
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:34,490
We might have a caller

646
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,930
perhaps on the line.

647
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:44,750
Let's see. Caller, I wonder if you can hear me. If you can, say

648
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,690
hello. State your name and maybe your purpose.

649
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:51,470
Hello. My name is Valerie. Hi, Valerie.

650
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:54,330
Welcome to Uncommon Radio. What's on your mind?

651
00:42:54,450 --> 00:43:00,070
Well, I had a report and a question

652
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,590
on your program

653
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:07,910
with Seth on Uncommon Sense.

654
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,890
Toward the end of it, you all spoke about dreams.

655
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:14,630
Oh, yeah, yeah.

656
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:20,870
My report is, as a young child, I was tormented

657
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:22,630
by dreams and nightmares.

658
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:27,970
Let me just help you think about that for a minute.

659
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:31,570
You were tormented, period,

660
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:35,910
and then through dreams and nightmares. The dreams

661
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:39,950
and the nightmares are what put the terror in you. And the thing is,

662
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:43,510
who was giving you the dreams and the nightmares? They're not your own. We've discussed that.

663
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:47,830
Thank you for bringing that up because all these subjects you see are connected, right?

664
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:51,730
I would suggest that

665
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:56,090
the tormented part is accurate, if you felt

666
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:00,010
that, right? There was an intent

667
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:04,310
to torment you, and the way that it was done is by dreams and nightmares.

668
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,890
Right, right. I understand that.

669
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:11,970
It's not you. It's not happening in your mind. It's put into you.

670
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,390
It was basically the crux that I've discussed in the past in great length.

671
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:18,970
Yes, yes. I understand that.

672
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:24,190
I've been working on that for the past year.

673
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:25,670
Oh, okay.

674
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:30,510
Yes. Very, very hard at it.

675
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:35,530
I can report I have had very few dreams.

676
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:40,210
And when I do dream, I do not repeat

677
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,390
them to anyone. I don't tell anyone.

678
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:44,710
And I think that has been to help me.

679
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:51,290
Also, another thing to suggest openly, I think I have, you can just rebuke them

680
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:55,170
during the day because they can't read your mind. They don't know what you're thinking.

681
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:58,530
But one thing that could be done is

682
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:03,410
if where you sleep has a door, just yell at them, tell them to get out and close the

683
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:07,190
door, and then you can just softly open it. They take offense to that,

684
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:11,190
some of them. I didn't want to speak over you, but that's really

685
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:15,110
exciting to me when I hear that what's being said, it has

686
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:17,270
effect in a positive way. Thank you.

687
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:21,430
Sorry, I'm a little nervous calling in for the

688
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:23,790
first time. I've really never spoken

689
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:29,270
on a talk show before, but I think this is important.

690
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:31,730
Thank you.

691
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:37,530
Also, I wanted to ask you a couple of questions.

692
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:41,410
You had on the 5th of

693
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:45,570
what they call January of this year, you had spoken about

694
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:49,810
Iran coming to the aid

695
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,930
of, well, maybe not coming to the aid yet of Israel,

696
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:56,810
but they would be friendly.

697
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:00,510
Now, would you say that

698
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:05,230
I'm assuming you're drawing that from a scripture, an old scripture.

699
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:09,370
Would you say that may be Daniel?

700
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:12,430
Possibly. And Revelation.

701
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,890
No, neither. I'll suggest,

702
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:20,290
and since you brought up Daniel in either one, I'm not drawing it from there. I'm drawing it from

703
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:23,450
Nehemiah, Ezra, Psalms,

704
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:28,350
Reason Why, and I'll just state this this way, and you realize discussing

705
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:32,410
and you don't, and I don't, and others don't, but this is a public

706
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:36,410
forum, and I've just finished saying that people don't like to hear this kind of

707
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:39,650
discussion because of what the religion has done. You're correct.

708
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:43,490
Yeah, and you'll see that throughout public life and in private as well.

709
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:47,550
But I would just suggest that, let's just give you a hint. I said this is like an open

710
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:50,870
members area, right? So let's just give some things that work, like dreams.

711
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:55,510
Everything repeats three times, if you notice, in scripture, and I say

712
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:59,750
everything mostly. Like you notice in the beginning, the beginning, the older part

713
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:03,670
of scripture is about what happens to a man or his family, and then it's what happens to

714
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:07,630
an entire nation, and then as you get into the later writings, it's all about

715
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:11,210
the same things happening to the entire world in similar fashion.

716
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:15,550
Okay. Right? So you'll have like a patriarch go through something, and then

717
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:17,910
the country goes through it, and then the whole world will be going through it.

718
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:23,750
Now, what you look at are certain repeats. If you look at

719
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:26,930
what they call the temple, you know,

720
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:30,130
the exile into Babylon,

721
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:35,430
71 years they went back, and they were starting to rebuild the temple, which was

722
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:37,210
mostly destroyed or broken down.

723
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:43,430
Now they came out of Babylonian exile. Who aided the

724
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:47,130
Judeans and the Israelites? Remember, you watch, I didn't say Jewish, right?

725
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:51,490
The Judean and the Israelites, financially and with

726
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:54,330
other support. It was Darius and Cyrus.

727
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:59,490
These were the Persian kings. So they assisted, and they actually

728
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:02,430
helped them when they were being hindered as well.

729
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:06,370
So that means that when this particular

730
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:10,250
edifice is suggested to be reconstructed, the majority

731
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:14,370
of the financial support, and let's say public

732
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:18,290
moral support and ethical support to do this, will be from the modern

733
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:22,410
Medes and Persians. Another thing I've suggested is that most people

734
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:25,310
don't know about what they call Iran or Persia,

735
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:29,790
is they have two governments. They have the political and the religious.

736
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:33,790
And one thing with Seth on a roundtable years ago, I said,

737
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:38,070
do you remember Ahmadinejad, the president before the current one?

738
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:41,690
He wore a Brooks Brothers suit, very western, right?

739
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:45,930
And I suggested that the next political leader is also going to be religious because you will

740
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:50,050
see a unification. And after a few months there, then that happened.

741
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:53,710
If you look at the current secular leader, he is also looking

742
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:57,850
more fitted in religious garb. And then you have the supreme

743
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:01,750
leader, Ayatollah, coming out and making political comments. So they're finding

744
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:06,010
middle ground as they're developing into this position.

745
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:09,230
Now by the way, the things that I discuss regarding the Middle East coming,

746
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:14,070
you have to comprehend and understand and take it to heart to some point

747
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:17,990
that none of this will change, no matter what people try. This is being done

748
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:21,590
by the gods, okay? No one can stop this.

749
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,570
That's why, you know, like I may not say

750
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:28,470
if you go to a strawberry, if you go to an ice cream parlor,

751
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:32,250
you should get strawberry or chocolate. No, no. If I have information that that particular

752
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:36,530
ice cream store is going to close in a year because they lose their lease, that's what I tell people.

753
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:38,970
What flavor you get in the meantime doesn't matter.

754
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:44,170
And that's what I like to discuss. So now your question

755
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:48,230
where I got that from, let's just go back and address those two things.

756
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:51,970
Look at scripture. When did the period

757
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:56,250
when Persia and the Medes and the Persians

758
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:59,950
helped the Judeans and the Israelites was only during the

759
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:03,950
Nehemiah-Ezra return period. So read that carefully. That will repeat.

760
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:07,610
Not exactly, but it's very similar. Now you mentioned Book of Daniel

761
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:12,130
and you mentioned Revelation. Let's do those two. Revelation is really a hands-off

762
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:15,730
book for most people at this point. Now it doesn't mean you shouldn't read it because

763
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:18,670
it's the only book that has a blessing for anyone who reads it out loud.

764
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:22,750
But it's quite the opposite if you comprehend it and read it to those

765
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:26,750
that are not qualified. Because the first verse states who

766
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:30,510
it's for. It's for the servants, not the believers, not the faithful, not the Christians,

767
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:34,670
not the Mets fans, not the Dodge fans, not the Republicans, just the

768
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:38,530
servants. And what is a servant, right? If you're a servant

769
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:41,630
and you tell the master all your rules are done away with,

770
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:44,930
you're not much of a servant. You'll get a boot you know where.

771
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:49,210
So I'll just say this again publicly.

772
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:53,070
I said this is an open members area. Let's make it juicy. If you comprehend the Book of Revelation

773
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:56,910
and you start explaining it to those that are not in that category, people will

774
00:50:56,910 --> 00:51:00,970
start dying. And it's good science to say that.

775
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:04,790
Meaning good science is when you do something and something happens, if you repeat it,

776
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:09,210
the same thing happens. And you know that if you do this, this happens. That's what science is based on.

777
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:13,290
So I can tell you scientifically, if you comprehend the Book of Revelation

778
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:17,250
and you read it and explain it to those that are not in that servant class, people

779
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:21,310
will start to perish repeatedly. So don't do it.

780
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:25,030
I mean, unless you're in that position and also things will not be.

781
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:29,110
It's a very, very powerful. So in that

782
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:32,770
respect, the other one, the Book of Daniel, that is extremely misunderstood

783
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:37,430
because it has some unique qualities. And one of the unique qualities is that everything

784
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:41,130
in that is referencing to the gods. And it's one of the few books,

785
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:44,610
there's a couple of others that don't reference the name of the Most High.

786
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:49,250
Now, what's interesting also about the Book of Daniel, it is misunderstood

787
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:52,750
because it's taken out of context. And the context is, for example,

788
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:56,550
or what's taken out of context is, for example, there's a verse in there that says,

789
00:51:56,970 --> 00:52:01,190
and many will travel to and fro and knowledge will increase. That's a very popular verse

790
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:05,090
in that book. And people say, oh, look, we have airplanes and we're traveling

791
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:08,730
and knowledge is increasing because of the Internet. That's not what it means.

792
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:12,690
And I'm suggesting when I say that's not what it means, I won't say it's solved dogmatically,

793
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:16,790
but let me just put it this way. Traveling to and fro means you're going to

794
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:20,690
be going places that you normally don't go and knowledge

795
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:24,510
will increase would be knowledge of the gods will increase, not

796
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:28,410
what's on the Internet. Now, if anyone has any sense that says

797
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:32,670
that means because of the Internet, knowledge is increasing. I mean, if you've gone to

798
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:36,790
any homepage of any browser, I mean, does that look like knowledge to you or does it look

799
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:40,930
like penile extension, hair loss and dolls? You know, it's really dumb.

800
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:44,890
It's all dummy loading. So when you read what's called

801
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:48,810
the Book of Daniel, that's regarding the gods and keep it in that

802
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:52,770
context and you'll be fine. And also another hint I'd like to give you since

803
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:56,830
you bring this up and I'll share that we're having a private conversation that's being broadcast publicly, let's say,

804
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:00,430
is that when you have a name, well,

805
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:04,490
if you want to hold on, I'll explain it and we'll catch you on the

806
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:08,610
second part. I would love to. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, Val.

807
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:12,170
See you on the second half, folks. Okay. Thank you.

808
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,470
Greetings and second hour

809
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:20,250
for Uncommon Radio on the 15th day of the first month.

810
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:24,330
Yeah, and I think we still have our caller. Valerie,

811
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:28,410
if she's present, I was trying to explain about how to. Yeah, great. Here you are. Okay.

812
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:32,030
Before the break, I was going on a short

813
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:35,990
monologue there on another hint on

814
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:40,010
what to comprehend or how to comprehend is when you're reading any of

815
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:44,250
the scripture, the people's names mean something,

816
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:47,050
whether it's Daniel or Jeremiah or whatever.

817
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:52,090
When the book is titled by someone's name, when you see the name being

818
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:55,990
repeated with redundancy in the text, do an etymological

819
00:53:55,990 --> 00:54:00,130
search for what names mean and replace that phrase.

820
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:04,090
It's usually a phrase in the verse when the name is being

821
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:08,010
used. And now you will see more clarity in the verse itself.

822
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:11,810
So when you're reading, Daniel went to the lions,

823
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:15,610
let's say, or was sent to the lions. Well, find out what

824
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:19,570
Daniel means and replace the name with that short little

825
00:54:20,070 --> 00:54:24,110
meaning of the name and then read it and you'll see things come more

826
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:27,930
to life. It'll be more vivid.

827
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:32,570
So those are some long-winded answers, which are typical Greek

828
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:36,590
fashion, but anything else on your mind? No, that's about

829
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:40,350
it, really. I mean, I have a lot of questions. I think a lot of people

830
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:44,110
have questions about the gods. I think you referenced

831
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:47,670
they have questions about that, about the universe.

832
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:52,430
Empty space. Well, the gods are just another society,

833
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:56,450
just intangible. Just like years ago, if you left

834
00:54:56,450 --> 00:55:00,510
hot coals in a room, people woke up dead because of the carbon monoxide.

835
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:04,370
They called it ether. They didn't know what it was until they were able to measure it with carbon

836
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:08,790
monoxide detectors. We just have memorialized

837
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:12,410
information from the past regarding them, which people like

838
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:15,950
to ignore. And they're here. They're right here.

839
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:20,450
Oh, yeah. They operate on a longitudinal

840
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:24,350
Yes, and they operate on a different level. There's no

841
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:27,570
time and space or distance that means nothing.

842
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:32,410
They operate longitudinally. And just to prove that, Tesla was operating

843
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:36,250
in that form of power transmission. It was instant,

844
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:39,770
pretty much. So it's longitudinal.

845
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:44,190
Thoughts are longitudinal versus they're transverse, which is like

846
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:48,310
speed of light or speed of sound. Further something away as longer it takes, no matter how fast

847
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:52,310
you're going. They operate in more of an instantaneous way.

848
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:55,650
Another way to think about it is what's called counter space. And they have a society,

849
00:55:56,070 --> 00:56:00,250
just like man has a society and a plurality. There's trillions of them.

850
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:04,290
Not billions, but trillions upon trillions. And they have a

851
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:08,270
very long lifespan. And they just happen to be intangible at the moment.

852
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:11,530
But you do see their effects if you know how to recognize them.

853
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:15,490
And you mentioned the gods and the other thing was the universe.

854
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:20,150
The universe is a term that's been used back and forth. And when we say that, let's just say

855
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:23,950
out there. Everything out there. Not in the fishbowl, but what's in the living room

856
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:26,750
and the apartment and out there in the city kind of thing.

857
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:32,450
It's very simple. You hear a lot of new ager types say, well, what the universe

858
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:36,550
sees it fit or whatever. It's just empty space, let's just say.

859
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:40,190
But again, as I started speaking tonight, you'll notice

860
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:44,170
that everything's connected through boundary layers. Whether it's gas, liquid, or

861
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:47,910
solid, you're still connected to everything. And space is not a true vacuum. There's still

862
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:52,070
gases out there. And they're more rarefied and imponderable.

863
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:55,370
You can't bring them to earth. So that's another level of discussion.

864
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:59,970
But one thing, let's just throw another little thing in there for people to think about regarding

865
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:03,790
outer space is that it's not as big as you've been told

866
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:08,050
and it's not as big as it's been perceived. And that will be more obvious

867
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:11,850
and actually be displayed in the future. I'd say starting in about

868
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:15,130
15 or 16 years from now. It'll be

869
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:19,190
very similar right now when you see all the pretty pictures of what's going

870
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:23,150
on out there that they show you. And by the way, we hardly get any more pictures. Everything seems

871
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:27,310
to be computer animated, computer graphic artwork. I would prefer

872
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:31,110
a blurry black and white over what vivid color fake stuff

873
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:35,190
they're showing. But regardless of all that stuff that

874
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:38,990
takes interest and what we're told is out there, it will be

875
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:43,190
the metaphor of what will start happening in 15 or 16 years would be as if you're

876
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:47,230
sitting in the movie theater right now enjoying the movie. The lights come on

877
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:51,230
and you see a white screen. But then the screen is pulled up and then

878
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:55,250
you see this brick wall behind the screen. I mean that's a real big

879
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:59,090
shock from the film you were just watching a few minutes ago or a second ago

880
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:03,030
that got you totally engrossed. And this is the level

881
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:07,270
of let's say esoteric emotion that people will be

882
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:11,430
experiencing. And after that point

883
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:15,170
there's many things we probably will discuss.

884
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:19,490
There's a lot of things to chew on. But I really appreciate you calling in

885
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:22,610
and I mean you don't have to go. You can stay but I just want to...

886
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:26,710
I would like to ask one small more question. Yes, please.

887
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:29,910
In regards to the dreams with little children

888
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:35,050
now I have a little child in my life and

889
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:39,410
sometimes when they're sleeping you can see them struggling

890
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:43,510
or whimpering, crying. Yes, wake them up.

891
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:44,790
And I do.

892
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,110
Is there anything I can do about that?

893
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:55,310
The same. The same you would do

894
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:56,510
just tell it to get out.

895
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:02,470
This is where I live and get away. And the other thing is the children

896
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:07,170
you know when a child comes to you and says there's a six foot tall dust bunny with

897
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:09,430
claws in the closet. There is.

898
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:15,110
As best as it can be presented to a human

899
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:18,670
let's say. It's usually denied and you know how

900
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:22,470
things are. You know how the society deals with that.

901
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,990
But it's not, it isn't like

902
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:30,270
as if it really was but it is that it's being put there.

903
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:32,930
And you don't want to really

904
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:37,110
here's a way to think about it

905
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:41,150
don't necessarily address the dream or the object or whatever

906
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:45,390
it's who's putting it there if you address because if they go away

907
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:47,490
then all of that rest of that stuff goes away.

908
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:52,750
And I think with a lot of the modern what you call

909
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:57,210
Christianity, demon possession

910
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:01,730
has kind of perverted what you can really do and what you're supposed to do

911
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:04,350
in that situation. Is that what you're saying? Yes.

912
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:09,690
What they do, they really do much at all

913
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:11,950
they bring it up. They've made a mockery of it.

914
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:17,830
They've made a mockery of it. Well they've made a mockery starting from the beginning

915
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:21,470
that there's only three people, three entities

916
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:24,470
in the universe. There's God, Jesus and the devil.

917
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:29,450
That's all they basically talk about. It's like worse than checkers.

918
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:33,710
There's

919
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:36,150
trillions of plurality of them

920
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:40,990
and if anything is discussed in the mainstream it's because

921
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:44,570
when I say anything discussed in the mainstream

922
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:48,630
has such importance let's say for thousands of years, it's for two reasons.

923
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:52,950
One is because they're trying to propagandize you to think a certain way so you don't find out the truth.

924
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:57,770
The other one is because the subject is just over boiling and they have to say something.

925
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:00,770
Either way it's just going to be pittance.

926
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:04,390
Think about it this way, they're just accommodating the mindset

927
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:08,410
and also they're accommodating their position to help themselves.

928
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:13,590
It's not that simple again. It's like chess. When you make a move

929
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:16,750
can you anticipate the next four moves?

930
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:21,630
This is what's been going on. Also when you throw in that humanity has been

931
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:25,470
censored because you have to remember at one point when all of this was

932
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:29,610
overt and also combine that with people having a lifespan

933
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:33,410
approaching a thousand, people were like, let's just get off this rock.

934
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:37,330
Then how would this whole thing proceed?

935
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:41,010
You've been as a society

936
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:44,650
shut down and there's no blame here. This is just an explanation

937
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:49,370
of what's going on in contrast with the description

938
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:53,690
because the description would be the exorcism let's say or these other things

939
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:57,790
but what's being put out in public is very, very

940
01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:00,990
minor and almost asinine and has very little worth at all.

941
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:05,590
That's why the whole thing is can you be objective

942
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:09,430
and objectifying it and also

943
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:13,810
if you even do a cursory study on ancient writs, dreams are given

944
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:17,250
to you. They're put into you. If you look

945
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:21,690
in history when the dreams were explained throughout history, I was given

946
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:25,810
a dream. I had seen a dream. No one ever said these are my dreams

947
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:29,210
or I dreamt this. Now I dreamt this means I received it.

948
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:33,830
If you look at what's been memorialized for thousands of years regarding

949
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:36,530
dreams, it was always something that was inputted into you.

950
01:02:37,550 --> 01:02:41,710
Now it seems to be people take ownership and origin of it

951
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:44,850
also which is a big mistake.

952
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:49,790
It's part of the dummy loading. All the things that I've discussed

953
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:51,270
let's connect back to it again.

954
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:55,450
I'm glad you've had some success.

955
01:02:56,490 --> 01:03:00,370
You mentioned the censorship.

956
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:05,290
That would have been around the

957
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:07,930
5th century. Is that correct?

958
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:11,130
B.C. 2500 years ago.

959
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:17,590
That would have been the time of

960
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:20,590
approximately Jeremiah's time?

961
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:23,330
Yes. Quasi-quattro in Mexico.

962
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:29,490
The burning of the Library of Alexandria. The formation of almost all of the

963
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:33,430
religions in the world today. The formation of the way

964
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:37,530
things are taught at university. The Greek system shortly after

965
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:41,370
that. Many many things

966
01:03:41,370 --> 01:03:45,350
put in place. When people refer, let's say I brought up the Greek aspect

967
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:49,210
to it. Oh the Greek philosophers are so great. Oh the university system, the medical

968
01:03:49,210 --> 01:03:52,490
system is from the Greeks. Really? Really? Really? It's so good?

969
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:56,410
If it was so good and so great, how well has it served you as a society?

970
01:03:57,790 --> 01:04:00,370
Not well. You're still in the you know what.

971
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:03,130
Because of it indirectly. It's just a tool.

972
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:09,450
When I say all the religions, Christianity was also

973
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:13,430
started around that time. The concept of this esoteric

974
01:04:13,430 --> 01:04:17,390
thinking of how to control the masses. You have to realize

975
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:21,090
at one point when you were wealthy

976
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:25,130
even with the castles and things, they built moats.

977
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:28,290
You had to build high walls to protect yourself while you were sleeping.

978
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:32,990
You were always looking to devise a mechanism, a social mechanism

979
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:36,810
that would tell people that your wealth

980
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:40,850
is somewhere else. Not on this earth. Not in this lifetime.

981
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:43,390
To quell them. So now you could sleep easy, right?

982
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:48,770
So this type of philosophy or teaching

983
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:52,810
or devise of telling people that all of your wealth and

984
01:04:52,810 --> 01:04:56,930
fortune will come in the next life was a way

985
01:04:56,930 --> 01:04:59,790
they would support that. Because now they could

986
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:04,530
impose that on the masses to some degree and then have them quell down.

987
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:08,890
Right. All about control. All right well Greek, thank you for

988
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:12,730
taking my call. Oh thank you for calling. You're quite welcome.

989
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,990
Thank you Valerie. See you again. Ciao.

990
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:20,910
Okay and we are back to Uncommon Radio.

991
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:24,910
Thank you for calling in and I hope that input or the questioning

992
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:28,990
and the answers were effective to others as well

993
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:33,110
and of course this will be archived and if you like it, good. And if you don't like

994
01:05:33,110 --> 01:05:36,590
it, even better because now you've got something to hate on. So either way

995
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:40,570
it will capture your energy or use some energy either way. So let's

996
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:44,010
perhaps go back. This is external input of course.

997
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:48,550
We're talking about how dreams are external and of course most

998
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:52,630
of this has been forgotten because it's been memorialized or it's not

999
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:56,670
popular or fashionable to think that you can take responsibility for your

1000
01:05:56,670 --> 01:06:00,330
thoughts. Hmm, what did I just say? Yes, taking responsibility

1001
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:04,750
folks. So if I look at the chat, there's still some

1002
01:06:05,370 --> 01:06:08,910
question regarding, it seems there's a lot of question

1003
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:12,710
regarding this part of the month on the first month and what it's

1004
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:16,690
about. Hmm, but either way

1005
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:20,850
I would just suggest that if you look at anything

1006
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:24,490
you know, look

1007
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:28,650
if you have a question. Let's just phrase this. I'm thinking about how to phrase this.

1008
01:06:29,370 --> 01:06:32,830
If someone has a question or yourself, you have a

1009
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:36,970
question let's say regarding a subject. Do some

1010
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:40,810
hmm, would you say research

1011
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:44,570
so you could structure the question a little bit better and also when you do the research

1012
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:48,790
what do you really see? You know, when you come across a piece

1013
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:52,250
of information that you might want to question

1014
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:56,850
perceivably to someone who might be able to give

1015
01:06:56,850 --> 01:07:00,770
you an answer. Do a little bit of cursory research to structure it a little

1016
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:04,570
bit more, a little tighter because

1017
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:08,190
what I'd like to do regarding a certain religion

1018
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:12,490
and a certain perception, a world view of a particular Biblical

1019
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:16,870
character, actually the most important character who comes up twice a year

1020
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:20,790
allegedly celebrating. I would suggest that everything that you're

1021
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:24,730
being told regarding mainstream religion and alternative religion and alternative

1022
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:28,690
is completely false. Your first

1023
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:32,610
sign by the way if anything Biblical discussion comes up that you

1024
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:36,590
probably are not going to be getting accurate information is somewhere

1025
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:40,770
in the discussion there should be a preface that what the public

1026
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:44,790
considers to be the Biblical text is not the Biblical text essentially. It's not

1027
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:48,890
the scripture, it's a version. And the second thing that should come up

1028
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:52,590
is time. Because there is no January through December, Monday

1029
01:07:52,590 --> 01:07:56,770
through Friday. Not only there but anywhere since 1500

1030
01:07:56,770 --> 01:08:00,990
or something. So you know I think I brought this up

1031
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:04,950
there are many things that people may not be interested in but it's interesting when you bring up lawful time

1032
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:08,970
and someone says, I'm really not interested in keeping lawful time.

1033
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:12,430
That's really a wonderful specimen

1034
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:17,149
when you look at the, well a wonderful

1035
01:08:17,149 --> 01:08:20,750
specimen to exhibit what has been described

1036
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:24,870
as humanity at this point. Yes I'm not going to say the M word again

1037
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:26,930
because it starts with a capital R.

1038
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:32,850
This is your average earth inhabitant these days. So if you're listening here

1039
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:37,050
you're probably not average. So anyway, again back to the

1040
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:39,910
chat. It's still really very intensive

1041
01:08:40,609 --> 01:08:43,830
on this. So maybe I'll bring something up. Here we have someone

1042
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:49,050
regarding the Passover. Could the report on today

1043
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:53,010
being the end of Passover start of Unleavened Bread Feast be addressed?

1044
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:54,430
Well what else is there to address?

1045
01:08:55,990 --> 01:09:01,010
This stuff is very simple. It's really an appointed time.

1046
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:05,170
So either way we'll leave that alone

1047
01:09:05,170 --> 01:09:09,069
and back to Uncommon Radio. And again the second hour as I do on the

1048
01:09:09,069 --> 01:09:13,109
first hour I want to thank everyone who has contributed to AFR to show your

1049
01:09:13,109 --> 01:09:16,729
vote of support for the Greek on

1050
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:21,050
Uncommon Radio on AFR. And the reason why is

1051
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:24,010
because there was something much to do about

1052
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:28,990
what to do. And there's

1053
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:33,050
much that needs to be discussed and which can be discussed. And here's

1054
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:36,990
the thing folks. Most of the stuff that should be discussed and could be discussed

1055
01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:41,029
at this point is really not for public consumption. It's typically

1056
01:09:41,029 --> 01:09:44,710
let's just say well then who is it for? Was it for the private? Well no let's just say okay

1057
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:47,649
who is it for? It's for a non-carnal mind.

1058
01:09:47,649 --> 01:09:50,590
Now what does that mean?

1059
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:55,590
Not the basic aspect.

1060
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:59,330
Most people are living in denial. I'll give you an example.

1061
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:03,390
The non-carnal mind. The non-body lustful type of

1062
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:07,690
head. Which it's fine to be lustful I guess

1063
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:11,270
because your body will draw you there lawfully. But I would say

1064
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:15,630
well I should say I guess. But when it's just

1065
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:18,970
based on you even being deceived whoever you are

1066
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:23,470
about how the body even works and how the mind and the breath or the soul

1067
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:27,490
is connected to it. Yes because you're made up of three things. The mind

1068
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:29,670
your breath and your body.

1069
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:33,770
This kind of discussion

1070
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:39,550
only fits well or actually more information that could be said and should be said

1071
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:43,350
to those that have got a firm grip on let's say that basic reality.

1072
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:47,370
What I call HQ or headquarters. If you don't know who you are

1073
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:50,770
how are you going to know about things that are not you?

1074
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:55,370
Or outside of you? Remember the help yourself first idea?

1075
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:59,230
Yeah but help yourself first and maybe

1076
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:02,870
how do you do that? Where do you get the example for that?

1077
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:07,390
You see that's kind of difficult. One also suggests that your operating system

1078
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:11,170
is quite important. How you run. How you compute or rationalize things.

1079
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:15,030
And that comes from your God. And there are a lot of default Gods which don't

1080
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:18,770
address themselves as such or identify themselves as such. In other words

1081
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:22,970
the state is in that position. Patriarchs

1082
01:11:22,970 --> 01:11:27,190
are in that position. And I just want to throw something else out

1083
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:31,210
there. If you read some ancient writs there's a concept of a father

1084
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:35,290
by the way. And one of the things there is you have the

1085
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:38,310
physical father obviously.

1086
01:11:39,730 --> 01:11:43,070
Which is the physical aspect.

1087
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:46,590
And then you have the spiritual father which is where you get your

1088
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:50,430
law and education from. Sometimes they're the same. Rarely they are though.

1089
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:54,010
That's why for example in some religions the

1090
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:57,050
patriarch of the community is called father.

1091
01:11:58,030 --> 01:12:01,650
And that's why there is a verse somewhere that says that Satan is your father.

1092
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:06,170
And the people that it was addressed to. There was this whole

1093
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:10,390
spin off on this mainstream Christian community say oh well

1094
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:14,210
you see Satan had sex with this woman and they're descendants from that. No it has nothing to do

1095
01:12:14,210 --> 01:12:18,370
with that. What you do and how you operate. Where you've gotten that information

1096
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:21,330
is your spiritual father. Not your physical.

1097
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:26,110
So where you get your law from or meaning from a human agent

1098
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:29,210
as well are deemed as such.

1099
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:34,190
So you have a spiritual aspect to it. For example if you had a really good mentor

1100
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:38,250
that was a man. He could be called your

1101
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:39,970
father in respect to that.

1102
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:46,430
There's much stuff to be done. Much stuff to be done

1103
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:48,030
regarding communication.

1104
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:54,270
How can ideas which by the way I've also said

1105
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:58,050
and anyone can determine this with maybe 15 years of research

1106
01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:02,410
that everything is information based. When you look through a telescope or a microscope

1107
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:06,370
or yourself. It's not the chemicals or molecules or

1108
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:10,250
energy that's holding it together. It's information that's holding it together.

1109
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:14,170
And that is another thing that will be discovered. And it's bantied about. And by the way

1110
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:18,610
when you hear stuff about quantum and all this other stuff that might deal with that

1111
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:22,170
and consciousness. That's all breakfast cereal types.

1112
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:25,390
Breakfast cereal is made up of fruits, nuts and flakes.

1113
01:13:26,430 --> 01:13:30,570
I'm just tired of those things. Anyway the quantum stuff.

1114
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:34,470
So being able to communicate clearly

1115
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:38,810
and saying what you mean and meaning what you say and having a comprehension

1116
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:42,110
of where things came from maybe.

1117
01:13:42,650 --> 01:13:46,650
And maybe one way is modern society feels like they have to

1118
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:50,470
rediscover or discover where things came from and maybe just ignore

1119
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:54,810
anything that's been memorialized prior. Isn't that kind of foolish?

1120
01:13:55,650 --> 01:13:58,370
Why would you want to reinvent the wheel?

1121
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:02,310
You know there was a writer or a film also. I think it was

1122
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:06,130
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy where they went to a planet and in the film

1123
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:10,290
and I believe in the book as well. I have not read that book but

1124
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:14,510
regarding the society a commentary was that they invented the aerosol can

1125
01:14:14,510 --> 01:14:18,270
before the wheel. In this case society has

1126
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:22,370
invented evolution, all of these social

1127
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:25,870
maladies called mainstream religion,

1128
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:29,370
mainstream university and all these other little cliques in societies.

1129
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:33,010
Well I wouldn't say society has invented them. There's leaders over that also.

1130
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:37,770
And it's kind of like the aerosol can coming before the wheel because in the

1131
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:41,790
modern sense what you're doing and when I say they've invented them

1132
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:45,770
I mean reinvented them in the past hundred years is ignoring anything that has

1133
01:14:45,770 --> 01:14:49,790
come before that. Now whether you're looking at anything scientific regarding

1134
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:53,210
natural philosophy, the physical world, the gods,

1135
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:57,390
nature, medicine, society,

1136
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:01,290
history, you've got to go back more than a century

1137
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:04,150
ago. Let's just say

1138
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:09,270
you've perhaps heard that society has been in the credits part of

1139
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:12,830
this epoch, this 6,000 year epoch let's say

1140
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:16,590
since 1998, the fall roughly around that time until now.

1141
01:15:17,330 --> 01:15:20,070
When you think about it it's almost 20 years already, quite almost.

1142
01:15:21,290 --> 01:15:24,010
Well the century that came before that

1143
01:15:24,710 --> 01:15:28,110
let's just break them up, typically they're broken up in 50 year

1144
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:32,470
segments, was kind of the wrap up century

1145
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:36,010
at the end of that also. So look at what's being wrapped up when things are

1146
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:40,050
wrapped up they're closed down. Look at your history or the history from the

1147
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:44,110
late 19th century till the present which it seemed to have stabilized around the

1148
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:47,990
1950s or 60s or 70s. Look at how that was more of a

1149
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:51,930
shutting down than an opening up of a mindset to

1150
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:53,030
get people prepared.

1151
01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:59,370
This kind of talk by the way might be a little too

1152
01:16:01,150 --> 01:16:03,810
big, meaning that it's discussing the infrastructure.

1153
01:16:05,470 --> 01:16:08,070
The reason why is I bring

1154
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:12,150
up the concept that people ask what is the meaning of life, what is the meaning of this, what is the

1155
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:16,050
meaning of that, and it seems to be self-centered within

1156
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:19,330
the microcosm or duration that they live in.

1157
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:23,690
Humans or people tend to live 70, 80, 90, even 100 plus

1158
01:16:23,690 --> 01:16:28,030
years. That is too short to comprehend the infrastructure that has been

1159
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:31,870
placed. It's like having a discussion where people are

1160
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:36,190
commuting let's say 20 minutes a day on a public rail to go to work

1161
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:39,970
or whatever using the bus or at a given amount of time. It's very rare

1162
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:43,630
that you hear them discussing the infrastructure, the millions of man hours

1163
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:47,730
and all of the material and effort and design that has gone into design

1164
01:16:47,730 --> 01:16:51,570
let's say that big commuter rail line or ferry or whatever.

1165
01:16:51,770 --> 01:16:55,390
People don't discuss those things when they're riding the infrastructure.

1166
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:59,890
They typically just discuss little chit-chat

1167
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:03,390
or they might be continuing on discussing something that they started

1168
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:07,850
before they entered that monorail, no pun intended.

1169
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:11,670
Very little discussion in public about what's going on

1170
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:15,610
in public as they see it. Of course, there's the invisible ring

1171
01:17:15,610 --> 01:17:19,230
in the nose that you will find in mainstream media and of course

1172
01:17:19,230 --> 01:17:23,310
alternative media and wherever else you go that everyone seems to be following

1173
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:26,650
the same story. It's a story, folks.

1174
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:31,550
It's kind of like a show. I think we defined what shows are

1175
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:35,450
or show etymologically perhaps could mean to deceive.

1176
01:17:36,590 --> 01:17:37,170
Again,

1177
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:41,790
if anyone does feel, I always want to state

1178
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:45,230
that this is the fourth time the Greek is coming around solo

1179
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:49,450
and the what to do next and the support that could be garnered

1180
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:53,470
and all this other stuff will be determined by you folks.

1181
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,390
As AFR tends to get more support,

1182
01:17:57,530 --> 01:18:01,710
we might actually consider, who's we, just from the Greek's perspective

1183
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:05,910
what to do next because as I just spent the past few minutes discussing,

1184
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:10,130
there's much that could and should be said but perhaps not for public

1185
01:18:11,490 --> 01:18:14,450
open in public. So how that can be

1186
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:18,010
packaged and given out is again to be

1187
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:21,350
determined and it is going to be by you folks as well.

1188
01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:26,150
So I see there's still more discussion about time

1189
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:29,410
and lawful timekeeping in the chat.

1190
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:34,170
With that said, I'm going to see, there were a couple of other

1191
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:38,190
interesting emails perhaps that could be addressed

1192
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:41,550
because they tend to be sort of quote unquote universal.

1193
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:46,010
They apply to many of the thoughts that other people have

1194
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:49,990
and I see that by grading, not by higher or lower or whatever

1195
01:18:49,990 --> 01:18:53,490
but by separating or correlating the subject matter

1196
01:18:55,290 --> 01:18:57,310
and many people are asking

1197
01:18:57,310 --> 01:19:02,170
they don't know each other I think or perceivably are asking very much of

1198
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:04,510
the same questions.

1199
01:19:06,350 --> 01:19:09,750
Let's just see here. We have someone calling in

1200
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:14,430
on Skype. Let's see if we can bring them in.

1201
01:19:16,030 --> 01:19:17,970
We're going to have to do it

1202
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:22,430
another way because if I answer this it will put the call

1203
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:25,690
on hold. So I see

1204
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:29,430
perhaps it is Seth Michael calling. Seth if you hear me

1205
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:33,150
you have to go to Skype

1206
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:38,090
and do a contact request

1207
01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:41,550
and the contact request in the search box you would put

1208
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:45,530
in UncommonSenseRadio1 at gmail.com

1209
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:49,490
and then, oh I see you have it. You have

1210
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:52,950
done that perhaps. My fault. Just hold on folks. I'm trying

1211
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:55,970
to walk and chew gum if possible.

1212
01:19:57,210 --> 01:20:00,150
Let's see if it can be done here. If I could probably

1213
01:20:01,150 --> 01:20:01,890
do that

1214
01:20:04,210 --> 01:20:08,130
and bring Seth in. No, it's not letting me do it

1215
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:11,730
at this moment. Let's see how that will happen in the future.

1216
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:15,090
Bear with me. We have a little bit of dead time.

1217
01:20:17,210 --> 01:20:20,130
Okay. So the future endeavors of what can be discussed

1218
01:20:20,130 --> 01:20:23,830
and what shouldn't be discussed perhaps

1219
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:27,750
and what shouldn't be discussed is what isn't being discussed

1220
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:31,770
let's say. But what is being discussed maybe isn't worth

1221
01:20:31,770 --> 01:20:34,810
listening to mostly out there. That's why henceforth

1222
01:20:35,710 --> 01:20:39,750
UncommonRadio. So let's see. I've sent the contact there and it's not

1223
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:43,750
letting me open it for some reason. It would be interesting to have Seth

1224
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:47,290
come on if you folks can just bear with this little bit of

1225
01:20:47,290 --> 01:20:51,810
downtime. Let's see. There's about a half hour left. So we will try

1226
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:55,930
it this way. Let's go. We'll do it like this. And I've

1227
01:20:55,930 --> 01:20:59,750
got it. And let's bring him around

1228
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:03,070
and bring him in. Let's do it like that.

1229
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:07,670
There we go. Let's see if it works. Okay.

1230
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:11,730
That doesn't seem to be working. Sorry about that, Seth. It's trying

1231
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:14,890
to bring you. Oh, it's his group call. Okay.

1232
01:21:15,610 --> 01:21:19,550
Sorry, folks, for the little bit of dead air. No, it's not letting me bring

1233
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:23,050
him in. If AFR can drag him in,

1234
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:26,850
that would work as well. Okay.

1235
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:31,390
Got it. Okay. So anyone who has contributed

1236
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:35,350
by the way and has shown the effort has been really

1237
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:39,250
grand, folks. I have not expected that much support from the public

1238
01:21:39,250 --> 01:21:42,670
listening at large. But it's still a little shy of our goal.

1239
01:21:43,930 --> 01:21:47,370
And if we do reach that goal, I will make it

1240
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:51,190
public that we have. And these things are determinations to be made

1241
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:55,210
because you want to kind of measure what kind of interest people have and what's

1242
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:58,970
being said. But in terms of bringing up subject matter

1243
01:21:58,970 --> 01:22:03,170
and fashioning some kind of package of information to

1244
01:22:03,170 --> 01:22:07,190
discuss on these calls, it has not been done. It's just pretty much show up

1245
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:09,190
and just discuss what could be discussed.

1246
01:22:12,110 --> 01:22:15,290
In the future, perhaps, it will be much more structure

1247
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:19,370
and create a

1248
01:22:19,370 --> 01:22:23,270
sense of more structure and

1249
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:26,730
more information to be imparted without being pedantic. Seth, do we have you

1250
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:30,390
on Skype? I believe so. There you are. Greetings.

1251
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:35,310
Greetings. Salutations. Well, thank you. You're really low.

1252
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:39,010
You might want to up your volume a little bit. Is that better?

1253
01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:43,390
Yes, that is. Yep, you're here now. Great. So what's

1254
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:47,530
on your mind? It's been a while. And you're on radio

1255
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:51,270
as well. So go ahead. Share some thoughts and

1256
01:22:51,270 --> 01:22:55,290
whatever you like. It has been a while. I'm grateful

1257
01:22:55,890 --> 01:22:58,750
as you read that brief email earlier

1258
01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:03,470
for pretty much the same reason. You're speaking about things that

1259
01:23:03,470 --> 01:23:07,390
are not being spoken about with any semblance of accuracy anywhere

1260
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:11,510
else. And when I realized that you had this going on,

1261
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:15,030
which was yesterday, I went and

1262
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:19,010
downloaded the archives of this

1263
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:22,750
latest Sonic Endeavor and

1264
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:26,970
listened to it. And you're doing really well.

1265
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:30,610
So there's that. And still bringing information that's not

1266
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:35,170
available in one place.

1267
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:39,450
You have a tendency to go kind of scattershot

1268
01:23:39,450 --> 01:23:43,210
with the topics, like a shotgun blast of

1269
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:47,350
information from many distant and

1270
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:51,330
dissimilar sources and kind of bringing it all together in a way that's

1271
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:55,470
rare. So yeah, I'm glad to hear that you're doing

1272
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:58,850
it again. I have kind of a subpar

1273
01:23:59,390 --> 01:24:03,430
connection. So if I drop, I apologize. That'll be rectified here in a few

1274
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:07,030
days. But I put a question in chat earlier.

1275
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:10,710
I was finishing up my shift at the Job

1276
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:15,070
and I put the question in

1277
01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:18,810
not dissimilar to what I asked actually

1278
01:24:18,810 --> 01:24:22,770
last night about

1279
01:24:22,770 --> 01:24:27,090
today being the, and today not the date,

1280
01:24:27,290 --> 01:24:29,990
but today being Peshach or Passover.

1281
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:34,790
Because as you're well aware, it's something that I'm very interested in.

1282
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:38,730
And I was admittedly a little bit

1283
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:41,510
confused about what today is.

1284
01:24:43,190 --> 01:24:45,850
And the site that I normally reference,

1285
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:49,990
barring personal observation,

1286
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:54,510
listed the last full moon as being

1287
01:24:54,510 --> 01:24:58,550
the 12th of what they call March.

1288
01:25:00,670 --> 01:25:02,750
And so I was just curious as to how

1289
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:06,730
can one be relatively certain with their own observation?

1290
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:08,970
Oh, you know, here's the thing.

1291
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:13,490
Thank you for doing that because

1292
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:19,230
here's the public

1293
01:25:19,230 --> 01:25:22,770
display of error. You're correct. It is the

1294
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:25,490
end of the first week, isn't it?

1295
01:25:25,490 --> 01:25:27,170
That's what I was thinking.

1296
01:25:27,170 --> 01:25:28,670
Peshach is next week.

1297
01:25:30,490 --> 01:25:32,350
That's kind of what I was after.

1298
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:38,330
Last month, actually, I observed it,

1299
01:25:38,510 --> 01:25:42,570
the wife and I, because I was unaware of the 13th month

1300
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:46,510
until I spoke to a mutual friend of ours just the other day,

1301
01:25:46,610 --> 01:25:47,530
like two days back.

1302
01:25:51,570 --> 01:25:53,930
That worked out well because of the measurement.

1303
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:56,970
But the Peshach is, today would be the 8th day

1304
01:25:57,650 --> 01:26:01,290
and the 15th would be next week. So there you go.

1305
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:04,550
Greek gave out erroneous information.

1306
01:26:05,310 --> 01:26:09,390
Well, if it was the 12th, today would be the 10th or the 11th day.

1307
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:11,890
Unintentionally. Well, thank you. Thank you for the correction. That's right.

1308
01:26:12,410 --> 01:26:17,830
So it is the end of the first week and the Peshach would be the 13th

1309
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:19,850
and the 14th, which is the dark moon next week.

1310
01:26:20,530 --> 01:26:23,870
Okay. Now, I'll ask another question just because,

1311
01:26:24,130 --> 01:26:26,170
as you've said a number of times

1312
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:32,310
on this program specifically, this is kind of like a pseudo-members only

1313
01:26:32,990 --> 01:26:35,590
area and you might discuss things publicly that

1314
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:38,850
you haven't in the past, at least in a public fashion.

1315
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:42,750
That was the other part of the question that I asked earlier was

1316
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:47,890
the significance of, not today, but a few days from now,

1317
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:51,830
Peshach, how that is observed and

1318
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:55,950
how it was observed in that event

1319
01:26:55,950 --> 01:26:59,870
that was so poorly captured in that very famous painting known as the Last

1320
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:03,950
Supper, which is absurd. I mean, they're all sitting

1321
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:07,710
around a table for one. Well, that is absurd, yeah. But also

1322
01:27:07,710 --> 01:27:12,030
I have to preface again, we don't have a translation and the other thing

1323
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:15,950
is when we bring up biblical discussion, most people in public find it very

1324
01:27:15,950 --> 01:27:19,450
distasteful because of what the religion and the culture has done.

1325
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:23,250
Understandably. But if this were the member section,

1326
01:27:23,970 --> 01:27:27,910
then what care would the public? Oh, the open members. Okay. Well, it's very

1327
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:32,030
simple. The Last Supper is, the only commentary that could be done on that

1328
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:35,850
would be a commentary that you would possibly do on

1329
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:40,050
art, just art commentary. It has nothing, it has probably a lot

1330
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:43,870
to do with Peshach and nothing to do with biblical. I'm sorry. Yeah, I didn't mean

1331
01:27:43,870 --> 01:27:47,370
to, I'm not even asking about the painting. I was just kind of making a joke

1332
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:50,390
about the painting. I'm not concerned with the painting at all.

1333
01:27:51,610 --> 01:27:54,770
The Last Supper was an observance of Peshach.

1334
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:59,530
Yes, yes, right, exactly. But it's not given as such because

1335
01:27:59,530 --> 01:28:02,970
if you look at the confines and how the

1336
01:28:04,050 --> 01:28:07,730
King James and the society was structured to put forth that version, they didn't

1337
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:11,550
want them to go down that pattern of law and religion.

1338
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:13,810
So they had to make something else.

1339
01:28:14,730 --> 01:28:17,930
Yeah, because if you bring that up, oh, that sounds Jewish, doesn't it?

1340
01:28:18,810 --> 01:28:22,750
That's a lot of the commentary that you get still. Oh boy, how did I miss out a whole week?

1341
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:25,830
I missed a whole week out publicly. There you go, folks. I'm fallible.

1342
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:31,130
No, I'm quite fallible. There you are. Thank you for calling and stressing the importance

1343
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:34,330
because I actually observed that yesterday and we're going to do it again.

1344
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:39,110
Thank you, folks. Maybe I was taking up on the

1345
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:43,170
mothership for a little too long, but it shows you what kind of

1346
01:28:43,170 --> 01:28:46,610
a week I've had here behind the scenes. So let's just say

1347
01:28:46,610 --> 01:28:50,950
the Last Supper wouldn't be a Last Supper directly. It would be, yes, that observation

1348
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:54,150
of that day called the Passover or the Peshach, which was

1349
01:28:57,170 --> 01:28:59,010
if you look at the ordinance

1350
01:28:59,010 --> 01:29:03,050
being stated in the text, it has prophetic importance.

1351
01:29:03,190 --> 01:29:07,150
It's not just an occurrence or do this because I say so. It has a very

1352
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:10,950
significant prophetic symbolism as well

1353
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:15,490
of things to come as they are or as they were and as they will be.

1354
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:19,130
How about say it that way? The interesting thing there is

1355
01:29:19,130 --> 01:29:23,250
to show if you comprehend how capital punishment was

1356
01:29:23,930 --> 01:29:27,130
put forward in those days. It was death by stoning

1357
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:29,530
and the position that the

1358
01:29:31,230 --> 01:29:35,110
victim was in delineated or denoted the

1359
01:29:35,110 --> 01:29:38,150
severity of the crime and the highest crime would be nailed to a tree.

1360
01:29:38,890 --> 01:29:42,150
After all these things had been done, all the contents,

1361
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:46,250
the body, the corpse and the possessions of the person were burned.

1362
01:29:47,830 --> 01:29:51,210
So that's why when you look at certain aspects of how it was

1363
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:54,810
done in the Last Supper, there was a slight anomaly there where he

1364
01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:59,170
was trying to indirectly state that this bread is my body, not that

1365
01:29:59,170 --> 01:30:01,330
lamb because the lamb is thrown into the fire.

1366
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:04,570
Anything that's left after

1367
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:09,330
the consumption of the feast by those partaking is

1368
01:30:09,890 --> 01:30:13,570
thrown into the fire. It's not given as scraps to the animals or anything like that.

1369
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:15,450
The whole thing is thrown into the fire.

1370
01:30:16,910 --> 01:30:21,370
That's why, for example, when this individual was buried, the tomb had to

1371
01:30:21,370 --> 01:30:25,270
be guarded because the Judean authorities wanted to go and claim the body and finish that

1372
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:26,230
particular ordinance.

1373
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:30,410
It was quite important to understand

1374
01:30:30,410 --> 01:30:34,470
these things from a codified point of view, the technical

1375
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:38,070
aspect of how these things are done and then apply them to what is going on

1376
01:30:38,070 --> 01:30:42,330
regarding that scene. That's why earlier I mentioned it would be very easy

1377
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:45,970
once you do look at any body of work or something that is

1378
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:50,490
let's say memorialized

1379
01:30:50,490 --> 01:30:54,590
to look at it very closely and get as much out of it as you can. Don't read into it.

1380
01:30:54,590 --> 01:30:58,810
That's why earlier I mentioned again, if you look at a lot of these ancient

1381
01:30:58,810 --> 01:31:02,690
religious relics, how can you denote them immediately as being untrue

1382
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:06,590
or fraudulent or not pertaining to this thing? Just by looking at it

1383
01:31:06,590 --> 01:31:10,550
quickly. One of the simplest things that you would see in

1384
01:31:10,550 --> 01:31:14,550
modern, let's say, parlance when you see something, a guy nailed to a

1385
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:18,470
cross and all that stuff, you know that has nothing to do with the biblical text

1386
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:22,590
obviously. When you see relics, leftover pieces

1387
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:26,550
of that, how you see that often still bantied about in

1388
01:31:26,550 --> 01:31:30,490
society, certain religious circles, that can't be either because all of that

1389
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:34,650
was burned. It's very easy

1390
01:31:34,650 --> 01:31:37,350
to seek out the truth and find it.

1391
01:31:39,270 --> 01:31:41,650
Yeah, I would say that it is easy

1392
01:31:42,590 --> 01:31:46,390
in one respect because the source material

1393
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:50,190
and the current time that we find ourselves

1394
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:54,270
is easily accessible to anyone who has access to

1395
01:31:55,170 --> 01:31:55,610
Internet.

1396
01:31:55,890 --> 01:32:02,170
I didn't mean it that way. Sorry, I stepped on you for a minute. What I meant is once

1397
01:32:02,170 --> 01:32:06,070
you have a good handle on the reference materials, it's easy

1398
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:09,930
to spot the fakes and the frauds and no arguments afterwards.

1399
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:14,190
No, no, but actually getting the reference point is very, yeah, to discern

1400
01:32:14,190 --> 01:32:18,270
it, yes. But no, the hardest part is, actually you might spend your whole life

1401
01:32:18,270 --> 01:32:22,090
trying to get it and not, is to get the ground

1402
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:26,150
reference material, like learning how to read a tape measure, right, to go on a

1403
01:32:26,150 --> 01:32:30,330
construction site. There are people, laborers on construction sites for 30 years who still don't know

1404
01:32:30,330 --> 01:32:34,330
how to accurately read a tape measure. So, yeah, no, no, I didn't

1405
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:37,750
mean, I meant the easy part was discerning what's put out there, yes, thank you.

1406
01:32:38,110 --> 01:32:42,210
Because, no, actually, it sounds

1407
01:32:42,210 --> 01:32:46,070
very simple. If you get a hold on the reference material, that's simple

1408
01:32:46,070 --> 01:32:50,170
and that is not easy at all. No, that is very difficult

1409
01:32:50,170 --> 01:32:53,510
because you cannot approach anything anymore

1410
01:32:54,050 --> 01:32:57,250
on your own loosely without reading into it.

1411
01:32:58,210 --> 01:33:02,090
That's the start of any, to clear your mind and read

1412
01:33:02,090 --> 01:33:05,870
out of it, look at it objectively. Many people look at anything, whether it's

1413
01:33:05,870 --> 01:33:10,110
historical or biblical or whatever. When the subject comes up, let's say about this, they say

1414
01:33:10,110 --> 01:33:13,850
oh, I saw this in the movies. This is what my parents told me. This is what I saw

1415
01:33:13,850 --> 01:33:17,830
and they read over it. Instead of seeing what is

1416
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:21,370
actually being said, they say I'll just skip over this because I saw it in the movies.

1417
01:33:21,670 --> 01:33:26,050
It's all false. They deny what's right in front of them in writing

1418
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:26,990
memorialized.

1419
01:33:28,590 --> 01:33:32,690
Yeah, I've heard it said that it's a lot easier to

1420
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:37,110
trick someone than it is to convince someone that they have been tricked.

1421
01:33:39,450 --> 01:33:41,950
Yes, and also it's easier to fool 7 billion

1422
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:45,970
people than one because if you fool one, the

1423
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:50,090
other 6,999,000,000 and so will correct them but if you fool the 7 billion,

1424
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:53,650
the one that sees it, he's under great opposition.

1425
01:33:54,850 --> 01:33:57,170
Wow, I'm still reeling from the shock from having

1426
01:33:57,690 --> 01:34:02,000
the time off. I want to almost play a song about that.

1427
01:34:04,290 --> 01:34:06,390
Thank you for

1428
01:34:07,910 --> 01:34:10,130
chiming in on that. It was important to get it out on air

1429
01:34:10,130 --> 01:34:14,250
because if I'm on next week, guess what? I'm going to start

1430
01:34:14,250 --> 01:34:18,930
as if it comes around, it will be the 15th also. Think about it.

1431
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:22,090
So that will be an interesting correction

1432
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:25,910
to have and thanks for making that point.

1433
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:30,250
Yeah, indeed. There was speculation on that very

1434
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:33,050
point in chat so I figured that I would.

1435
01:34:33,690 --> 01:34:38,310
Yes, but that's good. I started seeing all that and I was wondering, you know, I'm being a little too sure

1436
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:42,350
about this and all that speculation, all that jumping around and all

1437
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:45,050
that is kind of good

1438
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:50,330
because if I would have said, yeah, I was just testing everyone, it's really not the

1439
01:34:50,330 --> 01:34:54,230
15th, I'm just trying to see who is really paying attention, that would have worked also

1440
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:58,150
but actually, I didn't know. I fled the scene

1441
01:34:58,870 --> 01:35:01,570
consciously and that's why I was wondering why it was stuck on there

1442
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:06,430
but the chat seems to be like a little clubhouse sometimes, I guess, for each

1443
01:35:06,430 --> 01:35:10,490
what they call host of a show, which I don't like using the word show, it means to deceive

1444
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:14,510
but this was not meant to deceive. This was one of these, I was actually

1445
01:35:14,510 --> 01:35:18,290
blinded to the fact of taking it for granted

1446
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:22,610
that 14 days had gone by since the last time I came on and it was

1447
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:25,550
only 7. So talk about lost time.

1448
01:35:26,850 --> 01:35:30,930
But I hope things have been well with you and I appreciate

1449
01:35:30,930 --> 01:35:33,810
let's say the appreciation and the approval

1450
01:35:34,750 --> 01:35:37,350
of Uncommon Radio and you coming on.

1451
01:35:38,510 --> 01:35:42,050
I've always gotten very positive criticism about, I really liked

1452
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:45,850
it when you came on and did stuff with Seth, so that was always

1453
01:35:45,850 --> 01:35:49,930
a very good positive thing to do but this time, I decided to go

1454
01:35:49,930 --> 01:35:53,050
around solo just to keep it going because I think it's

1455
01:35:53,690 --> 01:35:57,790
you might remember when we used to do round tables somewhere else, I used to say,

1456
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:59,890
I'm not here to talk to people, I'm here to throw rocks.

1457
01:36:03,310 --> 01:36:04,710
I'm not going to be

1458
01:36:04,710 --> 01:36:07,590
toilet papering anyone's house, just rocks, just stones.

1459
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:11,530
There is a time that's going to be coming,

1460
01:36:12,210 --> 01:36:16,310
it's not now, it's roughly a year from now where this period

1461
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:20,530
if the chronology seems to be correct, you will see changes and at that point

1462
01:36:20,530 --> 01:36:24,210
it's going to be very popular to start catching up

1463
01:36:24,210 --> 01:36:28,230
on thousands of years of things that people have essentially been blinded to

1464
01:36:29,110 --> 01:36:32,590
and based on the cosmic censorship, that will start to change

1465
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:36,130
because remember when the gods do something

1466
01:36:36,130 --> 01:36:40,270
you have to be in full knowledge of it or enough knowledge that you know

1467
01:36:40,270 --> 01:36:44,190
it's the gods that are doing it and that's going to be

1468
01:36:44,190 --> 01:36:47,770
an interesting time. I always used to say in private, I'll say it now that

1469
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:52,530
anyone, any of these biblical patriarchs that you read about would give their left testicle

1470
01:36:52,530 --> 01:36:56,450
to live today where we are in this time period. It's a joke.

1471
01:36:58,950 --> 01:37:00,310
Joking with them because

1472
01:37:00,310 --> 01:37:03,770
there's a lot of humor in there as well. The seriousness

1473
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:07,910
of the time period that we're living in

1474
01:37:09,090 --> 01:37:12,590
has to be perceived with the cosmic

1475
01:37:12,590 --> 01:37:14,750
irony that's been throughout society.

1476
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:19,930
Other times when people were far away from things becoming

1477
01:37:20,310 --> 01:37:23,750
overt, they were very conscious of them being overt and now

1478
01:37:24,510 --> 01:37:27,850
the time is actually coming where many things will become

1479
01:37:27,850 --> 01:37:30,990
overt, no longer hidden. People are not conscious of it.

1480
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:35,090
They tend to discuss it to some level but they have no specifics

1481
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:39,110
and with no specifics, now you're like a boat without a rudder.

1482
01:37:40,050 --> 01:37:43,470
You're just going with the flow. I think

1483
01:37:43,470 --> 01:37:47,170
much of the information that could be thrown out is probably best

1484
01:37:47,750 --> 01:37:51,290
given with specificity and to guide

1485
01:37:51,890 --> 01:37:55,130
the thought. Not how to think or what to think but

1486
01:37:55,130 --> 01:37:59,330
if the thought exists or the subject matter exists, a slight criticism and a little bit of

1487
01:37:59,330 --> 01:38:02,170
info might be a correction factor.

1488
01:38:03,570 --> 01:38:06,250
Redundancy does that, like oversampling does it.

1489
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:11,370
A lot of the things that is going to be said perhaps here

1490
01:38:11,370 --> 01:38:15,010
and by others is going to be redundant, just repeating. I've gotten a comment recently

1491
01:38:15,690 --> 01:38:19,490
I've listened to all the archives and all this and you're just repeating the same thing.

1492
01:38:19,490 --> 01:38:23,350
Out of all that stuff that's been repeated,

1493
01:38:23,530 --> 01:38:24,790
which one don't you get yet?

1494
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:31,510
Just as a case in point in validating

1495
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:35,110
that repetition is necessary, we've

1496
01:38:35,110 --> 01:38:38,710
spoken at great length

1497
01:38:39,490 --> 01:38:43,310
about the observation of the day.

1498
01:38:43,690 --> 01:38:47,490
What day is it? I still struggle

1499
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:51,150
with it. Like I said, I totally missed

1500
01:38:51,910 --> 01:38:55,290
the fact that there was a 13th month in the

1501
01:38:55,290 --> 01:38:58,770
previous year. For the past

1502
01:38:59,690 --> 01:39:03,490
however many days, I've been a month

1503
01:39:03,490 --> 01:39:05,870
ahead, inaccurately obviously.

1504
01:39:08,410 --> 01:39:11,230
I got a call. I spoke to

1505
01:39:11,810 --> 01:39:15,310
a friend just a couple days ago that I hadn't spoken to in a while.

1506
01:39:15,310 --> 01:39:17,990
He mentioned that observation.

1507
01:39:18,790 --> 01:39:23,110
I wanted to get in touch and get a little bit of clarity on that.

1508
01:39:23,230 --> 01:39:27,430
When I saw the response that the question had garnered in chat,

1509
01:39:27,870 --> 01:39:29,350
I figured that I would call in.

1510
01:39:30,150 --> 01:39:35,070
Thank you. That's good because it got me going as well because I had not been out looking.

1511
01:39:35,610 --> 01:39:38,630
I've just been counting and miscounting to some degree

1512
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:43,530
by a week off. Somehow I had lost a week, which is

1513
01:39:43,530 --> 01:39:45,350
okay. Worse things have happened.

1514
01:39:47,310 --> 01:39:51,890
I just want to go back to the 13th month. That's like a squaring off

1515
01:39:51,890 --> 01:39:54,930
time. I went through that live

1516
01:39:55,810 --> 01:39:59,270
as I was ending the previous Sonic episode

1517
01:39:59,270 --> 01:40:03,470
with Chuck O'Chelly. I just ended that one

1518
01:40:03,470 --> 01:40:07,370
I think at 12 episodes or something and then jumped immediately next week and started this.

1519
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:11,470
In real time, we were discussing the 13th moon, why

1520
01:40:11,470 --> 01:40:15,470
it's the 13th moon and how the first one came around again. The easiest observation for

1521
01:40:15,470 --> 01:40:19,270
that was if you're familiar with any landmarks or buildings or windows that are

1522
01:40:19,270 --> 01:40:23,590
lined up with Cardinal east and west, you will notice the sun coming

1523
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:27,730
in dead square, northern or

1524
01:40:27,730 --> 01:40:31,430
southern hemisphere. The sun would be completely squared off

1525
01:40:31,430 --> 01:40:35,430
to the east. If you have a wall or something

1526
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:39,390
that casts a shadow. You said Cardinal

1527
01:40:39,390 --> 01:40:43,470
so not magnetic, but astronomic north.

1528
01:40:43,790 --> 01:40:46,910
Astronomic north, yes. Not magnetic at all.

1529
01:40:47,630 --> 01:40:49,170
Magnetic could be off quite a bit.

1530
01:40:52,530 --> 01:40:55,450
Magnetic, I tend not to refer to that

1531
01:40:55,450 --> 01:40:59,550
much. The Cardinal is garnered from the ecliptic. It would be the centerline

1532
01:40:59,550 --> 01:41:03,510
from where the sun passes in the summer to where the sun

1533
01:41:03,510 --> 01:41:07,550
passes over the earth in the winter. The moon and the sun, you can do that at any

1534
01:41:07,550 --> 01:41:11,390
time of year. Juxtapose that and a centerline through those movements

1535
01:41:12,190 --> 01:41:15,150
or the gates. It came through the center gate.

1536
01:41:16,090 --> 01:41:18,670
What's interesting is once you do this, find a landmark.

1537
01:41:19,870 --> 01:41:23,670
I have a landmark, for example, when the first and seventh month come around.

1538
01:41:23,750 --> 01:41:27,570
They're slightly different on height. There is almost like a hole in a

1539
01:41:27,570 --> 01:41:31,110
door with what they call the viewing hole or a peephole type thing.

1540
01:41:31,850 --> 01:41:35,390
It's so square that it puts a brilliant white dot on the wall

1541
01:41:35,390 --> 01:41:39,430
only for a few days during that time of year, very much like a

1542
01:41:39,430 --> 01:41:43,450
sundial would. Not a typical sundial,

1543
01:41:43,550 --> 01:41:47,310
but the ones in India, let's say. If anyone wants to see

1544
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:51,550
some interesting solar monuments, go ahead and do a search

1545
01:41:51,550 --> 01:41:55,630
on a browser. Sundials in India.

1546
01:41:56,030 --> 01:41:59,470
You'll see some of them are several stories tall and they're very abstract

1547
01:41:59,470 --> 01:41:59,970
looking.

1548
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:03,930
We have another

1549
01:42:03,930 --> 01:42:06,490
week until the middle of the month.

1550
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:10,410
It's interesting how the chatter in the chat

1551
01:42:12,170 --> 01:42:15,870
was directed that way and I somehow

1552
01:42:15,870 --> 01:42:18,630
couldn't see it until you called in. Thank you very much.

1553
01:42:19,670 --> 01:42:22,970
My pleasure. It's good to hear that you're

1554
01:42:23,910 --> 01:42:27,950
doing this. I hope that you're able to get into more of

1555
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:32,010
what I say with hesitance is

1556
01:42:32,010 --> 01:42:35,830
being Scripture. Yes. Well, that time will come.

1557
01:42:35,970 --> 01:42:40,310
That time will come roughly beginning in a year from now. But if you recall

1558
01:42:42,170 --> 01:42:43,870
years ago when you and I first started

1559
01:42:43,870 --> 01:42:47,350
speaking, I said that there will be much more discussion regarding

1560
01:42:48,810 --> 01:42:51,830
seemingly Scriptural or Biblical topics, but none of it will be

1561
01:42:51,830 --> 01:42:56,070
accurate. But the direction people's attention will be going

1562
01:42:56,070 --> 01:42:59,910
that way until a time in the future when

1563
01:42:59,910 --> 01:43:03,350
some of the censorship is lifted and it's deemed to be accurate.

1564
01:43:04,570 --> 01:43:08,190
So you might notice that for years now

1565
01:43:08,190 --> 01:43:11,850
and that time to be accurate is yet a time in the future.

1566
01:43:12,450 --> 01:43:16,010
Other than perhaps what anyone who can give accurate information

1567
01:43:16,010 --> 01:43:20,010
is, and it's not exclusive to the Greek, it's exclusive to anyone who can

1568
01:43:20,010 --> 01:43:22,930
read out of it instead of reading into it.

1569
01:43:23,790 --> 01:43:25,410
There's a lot of information there.

1570
01:43:26,590 --> 01:43:30,430
Well, the interesting thing about any of these older

1571
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:32,850
writs is there's a lot of redundancy.

1572
01:43:34,730 --> 01:43:38,490
Much like a jigsaw puzzle, it's very redundant because

1573
01:43:38,490 --> 01:43:42,370
you're always looking at each piece along the edges to see what

1574
01:43:42,370 --> 01:43:46,170
piece it will fit next to. It's the same methodology with each

1575
01:43:46,170 --> 01:43:50,230
piece of a jigsaw puzzle. You're memorizing and learning

1576
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:53,730
what it should fit into by looking at the

1577
01:43:54,230 --> 01:43:58,170
geometry, let's say, on the edge of a puzzle piece. And then you always have to compare it to the

1578
01:43:58,170 --> 01:44:02,150
main picture to field it. What part of the

1579
01:44:02,850 --> 01:44:06,310
geographically, let's say, on the table where the piece goes. But the redundancy

1580
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:10,210
in putting a jigsaw puzzle together is immense because you're always

1581
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:13,110
studying the edge of the piece that is supposed to interlock into another.

1582
01:44:13,770 --> 01:44:18,390
And that's basically how these works work, I should say.

1583
01:44:19,290 --> 01:44:20,830
Yeah, you mentioned

1584
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:25,690
earlier that things are often

1585
01:44:26,730 --> 01:44:29,470
repeated three times in the text.

1586
01:44:30,510 --> 01:44:34,470
And one of the reasons, I guess

1587
01:44:34,470 --> 01:44:38,330
this is sort of anecdotal or anecdotal, I've never been clear on the

1588
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:41,710
pronunciation of that word, but one of the

1589
01:44:42,370 --> 01:44:46,330
things that has made me concern myself

1590
01:44:46,330 --> 01:44:49,830
with the observation of what they call Passover

1591
01:44:49,830 --> 01:44:53,690
is that it's mentioned in the text

1592
01:44:53,690 --> 01:44:56,690
at least there is

1593
01:44:56,690 --> 01:45:00,650
a call to observe it

1594
01:45:00,650 --> 01:45:06,510
at least seven times in different

1595
01:45:06,510 --> 01:45:09,910
texts comprising what's referred to as Scripture

1596
01:45:09,910 --> 01:45:12,830
at least seven times that I can

1597
01:45:13,930 --> 01:45:15,790
think of directly. So it seems

1598
01:45:16,610 --> 01:45:20,770
perhaps that it's something of import to those who view

1599
01:45:20,770 --> 01:45:24,490
such things as being worthwhile.

1600
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:28,870
Well, check this out. Okay, seven times

1601
01:45:28,870 --> 01:45:32,590
yes, it gives it some import. Now when you want to find the import of the import

1602
01:45:33,630 --> 01:45:36,910
you look at the fourth time that it's being mentioned. Where is

1603
01:45:36,910 --> 01:45:40,350
it mentioned for the fourth time? Because when you're counting seven

1604
01:45:40,350 --> 01:45:43,970
the fourth position is really the first position

1605
01:45:43,970 --> 01:45:47,730
and the one and the seven are first and last. You'll notice they'll be equal.

1606
01:45:48,730 --> 01:45:51,870
So what I'm suggesting there, again, whoever's listening

1607
01:45:51,870 --> 01:45:56,170
if you want to start, quote unquote, decoding, I'm using that term lightly
