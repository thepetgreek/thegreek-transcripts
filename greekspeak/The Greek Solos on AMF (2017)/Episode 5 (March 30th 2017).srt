1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,380
Greetings everyone, this is the Greek and welcome to Uncommon Radio, also known as Uncommon

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:11,480
Sense or Greek Speak or other things, but those other things, yes.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,660
So let's just give a little bit of a time marker.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,520
You know, the Pope's work schedule with the conventional marker, the one that the cosmic

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,640
censorship allows to be known typically, will be, you'll find it on archives when you look

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,640
at this being solo number five.

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,080
This is a fifth solo event by the Greek.

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:38,700
And in terms of keeping real time, not Muppet time or pagan time or whatever else

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,860
everyone's been convinced of for the past 2000 plus years, really about 500 years, I

10
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,980
would suggest through observation, maybe it could be validated by others as well.

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,820
I would suggest today is the 21st day of the first month till noon.

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,800
Yeah, you've heard that correct.

13
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,900
You know, the day starts at noon.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,820
Look it up.

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,380
Have some fun researching that.

16
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:06,020
So, you know, have fun because you're discussing the Pope's work schedule as such.

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,640
Well, you know how they, you know, your work, you know that no one wants to work.

18
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,220
Right. You want to time off.

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,000
You want to have fun.

20
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,520
You want to have a vacation.

21
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,160
So take a break, take a vacation from that work schedule just for a minute in your life,

22
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,200
maybe a day or two or a week.

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,760
The reason why I bring this up is even in other conversations that I have off air, people

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,360
say, man, I've heard you and, you know, that thing about, you know, the sun and the moon

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,420
and keeping time. I just can't explain that to people or I do and people don't want to

26
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,120
hear it. I'm like, yeah, but, you know, you have to consider, you know, it's not just

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,860
what's being said that anyone can notice.

28
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,420
And you can wonder why they don't notice these things.

29
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,760
It's you have to everything is strung together and you have to consider the cosmic

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,100
censorship. People are censored.

31
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,240
I was just having a conversation about certain things, let's say, about the body and

32
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,320
nutrition and all that.

33
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,860
And, you know, it was like, why don't you do a show on that?

34
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,820
And I already did. I kind of bring it up almost every other time.

35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,880
And what I've noticed is many of the things that are said here on Common Radio seem to

36
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,860
be still.

37
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,780
Hmm. Let's just say it this way.

38
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,880
It's not checkers.

39
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,160
It's a form of chess.

40
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,040
And it's not because there's an opponent to play with, but it's just like how things really

41
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,180
operate. You know, things operate differently in checkers than they do in chess.

42
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,160
Like, you know, a pawn can take a king, but it usually doesn't because priorities are

43
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,900
considered before movements are made.

44
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,220
But if you actually look at what's going on in the world, very few priorities.

45
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,700
Anyway, before. OK, so let's just let's just get back.

46
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,360
When you hear something or someone hears something through Greek speak or what's being

47
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,560
imparted here, because this is a special kind of thing.

48
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,500
And you will see that it's not that's not to counter a lack of information or something

49
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,240
that may be false or something.

50
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,420
There are many layers that you have to go through before you even consider what's being

51
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,240
said. Hey, it's really simple.

52
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,860
Typically in the chat, I go in there and I say, well, they're so dumb, they couldn't even

53
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:09,780
pour piss out of a boot, even if their instructions on the heel.

54
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,860
Well, does that have to do with being dumb?

55
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,680
Not really. But it's just it's just showing that, you know, all you have to do is look for

56
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,820
the instructions and the job is done.

57
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,480
So I kind of use that if anyone's been in the AFR chat room, I kind of use that as part of

58
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,600
the nomenclature of knowing that the Greek is coming around to do some kind of a sonic

59
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,440
experience. So many of the things that you hear, like the conversation I had recently

60
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,140
with someone saying, yeah, I've heard you say about the sun and the moon and just lawful

61
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,620
things and just people either they don't want to hear it, they can't hear it or they don't

62
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,000
grasp it. It's because it's not checkers.

63
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:51,700
This kind of information tends to just stand outside the door of the mind, and even

64
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,680
when it's let in by the mind there, it has to go through many, many entries and egresses

65
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,900
you have to in and out of other things to really get gotten.

66
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,960
It's like you have to crash down walls and doors and perceptions and things like that,

67
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:14,620
because the reality, again, as can be discussed, even I think AFR has a little promo

68
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,100
spot here where they I think it's Bill Hicks or someone discusses reality, always hear

69
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,120
the question of reality.

70
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,700
There's the film called The Matrix and all these other things that tend to show, well,

71
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,600
what is it even have people that are so removed from reality that even say there is

72
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,660
nothing real. This is all tied in with the cosmic censorship.

73
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,440
What does that mean? There's a group.

74
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,780
Yes, there's a group.

75
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,620
It's not the Illuminati, but it is a society known as the gods.

76
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,960
And of course, you know nothing about them, even though you say you do, because if you

77
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,240
did, you wouldn't do what you're doing.

78
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,080
So anyway, why did I just say that?

79
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,680
Because there's a time that's coming where what people think is going to change.

80
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,400
Yes, of course, there's always change.

81
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,520
Just like if you talk about doom and gloom at any time in man's history, it sounds

82
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,260
plausible. But what's different about what what's being said here at Uncommon Radio is

83
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,520
not just what's plausible, things that are done with great specificity.

84
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,660
We don't get into all the ridiculous stuff that everyone else is getting into.

85
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,960
Yes, everyone else.

86
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,100
You could look up what everyone or who everyone is.

87
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:24,300
So if there was any sense being made anywhere else, personally, I would just you would

88
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,200
know the Greek existed as a sonic entity.

89
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,020
And I would just be privately referring people to where else they can get the info.

90
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,440
Now, the info is, of course, scattered everywhere and things can be accessed.

91
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,460
But you have to consider the times.

92
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,260
It's just not time yet.

93
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,700
Why? Well, yeah.

94
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,900
You know, what day is it?

95
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,560
Hmm. What about starting with something as simple as that?

96
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,920
Here's the thing, you know, this is the fifth, let's say, a sonic event, solo five.

97
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,700
You know, we've kind of if anyone's gone to the archives, we've kind of gotten the

98
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,440
habit of calling them solo one, two, three, four.

99
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,340
And this is five.

100
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,180
Let's see if we can go through the next two hours and have it archived as well.

101
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,340
So fifth position, by the way, cosmically is right before man.

102
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,740
Five is the number of, let's say, the natural manifestations of the Earth.

103
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,760
Yes. The Earth.

104
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,540
Yes. You know, that thing you're standing on.

105
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,380
I was going to perhaps see if I get any feedback either.

106
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,580
I have the email open and I'll go back to the chat and about what to speak on.

107
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,880
Otherwise, I'm going to go through the usual rantings and asking some what people

108
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,520
call rantings and maybe some chat questions.

109
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:41,020
Otherwise, I believe the best use of time is to give homage, sort of honor the what's

110
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:46,000
going on in terms of being in the fifth position with this sonic episode, because the

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
next one's going to be regarding mankind and that's going to be really, really harsh.

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,400
I might give a little bit of information regarding what next time around might be about.

113
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,400
And that is a very simple thing that if you've ever listened to Greek speak before, I

114
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,940
always ask. This is not to confound, but it usually does.

115
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,300
What do cannibals, birthdays and dolls have in common?

116
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,740
And if you are looking to comprehend reality, what's called reality and why people

117
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,560
say and do what they do or don't say and don't do what they do, which is actually more

118
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,280
important sometimes, you must comprehend to some degree the invariable description of

119
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,840
man's society on Earth, which could be invariably described as a question.

120
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,140
What do cannibals, birthdays and dolls have in common?

121
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:45,520
Because that gives you the mindset of humanity, their level of apathy, their level of

122
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,020
repugnancy, if one can say that, and their vileness, not just some specific group of

123
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,480
people somewhere far away in castles or living under a bridge or underground or on

124
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:04,920
another planet. Humanity in general, meaning statistically 99.999% of the people on this

125
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:10,340
planet. It doesn't matter if you live in Russia, America, Greece, Italy, Iraq, Chad,

126
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,920
Somalia, China, Japan, Thailand, Malaysia, go on and on and on and on.

127
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:22,400
There is a vileness in humanity that will be worked through and worked out in the near

128
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
future, near future.

129
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,260
Well, let's just not say this week or next week or the next month, because that seems to

130
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,080
be the attention span of your typical surface dwelling Earth inhabitant.

131
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:32,240
And you've heard that before.

132
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,919
It's just, you know, well, if it happened last week, it doesn't matter anymore.

133
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,240
This is happening this week.

134
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,600
Yes. But I'll tell you what, get a grip on what cannibals, birthdays and dolls have in

135
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,480
common. And this will be perhaps an explanation that is always given when you might

136
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,120
have heard or have heard sonic events by the Greeks somewhere or anywhere along the

137
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,540
line. So before I continue along the line, speaking of lines, we do encourage or who

138
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:05,460
we are is to be determined some kind of participation, if so needed or desired.

139
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,640
And the way that could be done through the standard telephone lines, I'll give the call

140
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,840
number and I will pull them up.

141
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,020
I do not have them open yet.

142
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:20,040
It is 218 area code three three nine eight five two five two one eight three three nine

143
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,180
eight five two five.

144
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,260
You will find that on the American Freedom Radio homepage on the left.

145
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,580
And if you don't see it on the left, guess what?

146
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,780
It's on the other left. So you will look at that.

147
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,100
And now if you like doing a slightly higher resolution, higher fidelity would be the Skype

148
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:41,380
convention. And an easy way to find the contact request, if you are not in contacts at the

149
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,940
moment, is go to the uncommon radio dot com website.

150
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,900
So you it's best to do www dot uncommon radio dot com.

151
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,860
And as you scroll down, you will see there is a Gmail there and that email is uncommon

152
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,340
sense. Radio one at Gmail dot com.

153
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,740
And the one is numeric.

154
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:10,060
So and I will if you send a Skype contact and I will accept it and bring you into the

155
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:17,100
the sonic episode, you know, very often you hear the conversation, you know, through the

156
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:23,780
years, the reason why I interacted with so-called alternative media and other media was

157
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,760
because I just couldn't imagine that the people believed in what they were saying was

158
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,880
true. Yes.

159
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,860
So what does that mean?

160
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,640
Well, so I would call in and try to perhaps not redirect the conversation, but maybe put

161
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,800
in some info or something that might help them along, because about almost all if you

162
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,520
had the Greek calling in, by the way, it's because the information that was being presented

163
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,420
was erroneous. Yes, folks.

164
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,740
Anyway, so right.

165
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,120
And erroneous, not because I believe so or think so, because anyone can see it.

166
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,240
But no one wants to see it.

167
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,840
So I was trying to participate on that level to bring out information.

168
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:07,280
So, OK, so let's see if there is anything I was thinking.

169
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,400
How about speak about food is one thing here in the chat.

170
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,940
And could the Greeks speak about the changing times in 360 and 365?

171
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:21,200
You know, I just jumped into a just Greek speak a blog to Tango and I did a quick little

172
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,320
anonymous thing there. I don't really sign in all the time, even though I probably should

173
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,440
to identify. But there is no change from 360 to 365.

174
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,460
That is, where do you start with that?

175
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,600
There is no change.

176
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,760
Nothing has changed times.

177
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,600
No, the times have not changed.

178
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:48,280
Well, you know, you have to be more specific, I guess, or to pre-flood having full moons

179
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,100
all the time and how the later moon will go back.

180
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,680
He's been full sighted through the colors of the rainbows.

181
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,340
We go through them and relate to.

182
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,220
OK, that's possible things.

183
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,320
You know, it's interesting. I've even had maybe a slighted joke about speaking about

184
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,120
someone will call in maybe and call about scripture.

185
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,960
Yeah, it seems to be the major topic here.

186
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,600
But there is reality, folks.

187
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,840
The only thing is that you are filtered and fogged.

188
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:16,500
You know, before I go to this question and maybe explain why the times have not changed

189
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,260
from 360 to 365, Daniel 221 is mentioned.

190
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:27,540
What's interesting is, you know, if you're, let's say, traveling on a road and there's a

191
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:33,880
fog and you have zero percent visibility, you are absconded from perceiving the reality

192
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,740
around you. It's absconded from you.

193
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,320
Can't see it. It's taken away almost.

194
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,120
But you know, it's still there because there's a fog blocking your ability to see it.

195
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,340
Right. And this is how humanity has been for a very, very long time.

196
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:50,740
And anyone can get away from that by just a few little hints and a little bit of effort.

197
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,820
It's set up that way.

198
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,220
It's kind of a tightrope.

199
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,300
Imagine, you know, looking at someone walking, walking on a tightrope, how much balance and

200
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,400
concentration they need.

201
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,520
That's how the cosmic censorship works.

202
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,200
It's backwards. It's a form of counter-spatial relationship.

203
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,480
In other words, one very narrow part of reality is in the reality that everyone is

204
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,160
discussing. And that is censored.

205
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,000
And it's censored by the gods because of people's lack of inquiry and lack of

206
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,140
consideration of even just paying attention around them.

207
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:25,880
Give another explanation of reality and brought up several issues.

208
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,620
You know, it's the fifth episode.

209
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,660
You know, this is right before man comes on the scene, how there is no reality and the

210
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,300
comments on reality and how fogged people are from it.

211
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,860
The concept of discussing humanity, what do cannibals, birthdays and dolls have in

212
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,420
common? In other words, if you were sent down here from the mothership and you had

213
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,920
three days on the planet and had to return back and just give a brief description of

214
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,680
what the morons on this planet are doing, that would probably fit them the best.

215
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,340
Now, and the other thing is, of course, taking in feedback from chat and other and

216
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,660
Skype and calls.

217
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:07,720
But I would suggest that maybe we'll do one or two or three things at the same time

218
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,380
because possibly walking and chewing gum is a virtue.

219
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:16,200
But let's just because let's just say first in line is first in time.

220
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,340
I saw this earlier in the chat and then another chat.

221
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:23,380
But I think it's just Greek speak blog, Chitango or something.

222
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,380
Someone set up graciously a while back.

223
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:33,020
The time has never changed from 360 to 365, and I'm not going to explain Daniel to

224
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,660
21. I have given hints about that.

225
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,540
Whenever you take something out of context like that, which is an academic

226
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,080
relationship, you know, chapter and verse, by the way, that was done.

227
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,120
So people communicate certain things and it's become a stylized way to comprehend

228
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,380
what's called scripture or the Bible, which it's not.

229
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,480
And unfortunately, at least Daniel is pretty close to the name that one has not been

230
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,240
changed. But I'd say about 90 percent of the names in what they call the King James

231
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,820
do not exist anywhere.

232
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,480
They have been made up for that and also from taken from different languages.

233
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:17,320
So, no, I don't think it's appropriate to just explain that particular verse at the

234
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,820
moment. But the hints are always there as keys.

235
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,940
OK, you can have a porter come and unlock, give you keys and then take the keys back out

236
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:33,000
of your hand, unlock the door, open the door and have you walk in and give you a foot

237
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,700
massage. Greek won't do that.

238
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,700
I'll give you what appears to be a key.

239
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,280
You're going to have to walk to the door and find out which door it unlocks and unlock

240
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,880
it. And very often I'll tell you which door it unlocks.

241
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,680
And then you have to go into the room and go to work and maybe take a hot bath because

242
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,520
you ain't getting a foot massage.

243
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,340
So at least at this point, but let me just throw something out there, because very often

244
00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:01,320
I've said publicly these are just, let's say, private conversations that have to be

245
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,340
aired. I just want to hearken back.

246
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,080
I didn't like calling them conversations.

247
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:13,340
And I said I used to call in and because it's pretty much erroneous information, I

248
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:20,200
would suggest that it was talking at people.

249
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,760
So here we have someone.

250
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,480
It's the 17th, not the 21st.

251
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,480
OK, now I'm confused.

252
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:30,040
By the way, I have not been paying attention at taking measurements, so I'm relying on

253
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,200
you folks right now.

254
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,760
And let's just whoever did that, that's really good.

255
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:40,280
You know, let's just see how it could be the 17th.

256
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,960
Yeah, it is. Perhaps someone else want to come in.

257
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,120
I'm sorry. Did I say the 17th?

258
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,040
Yeah, so there you go.

259
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,760
It's the third week.

260
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,640
Yeah, thank you.

261
00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:00,550
Yeah, so I'm going to pretty much stick to the 21st unless someone has any other

262
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,230
reckoning. OK, sorry about that little break.

263
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,089
It could be maybe edited out in archives, maybe.

264
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,089
OK, why at the wrong time?

265
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:16,109
OK, so just to go back with times here, you notice the censorship can affect anyone and

266
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:19,790
everyone. But knowing that it's there is half the battle, isn't it?

267
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:24,230
You know, perhaps let's just consider it this way.

268
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,950
Knowledge of avoiding a trap is knowledge of its existence.

269
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:34,310
So but I will just say that if anyone out there is considering lawful timekeeping, the

270
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,570
full moon is the beginning of the month and the day starts at noon.

271
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,990
And there's other subtleties regarding that.

272
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,650
So that can be observed as well.

273
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:50,690
I would suggest that, let's say, back to the times that the changing of times from

274
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,850
360 to 365, that never happened.

275
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,490
That is according to what?

276
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:59,930
The Pope's work schedule that what I'm seeing here ensued is that there is a mention

277
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:05,230
perhaps somewhere of a 360 days being a year, which it doesn't in Scripture, by the

278
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,770
way, that's implied and ensued.

279
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:12,810
And to three sixty five, that's three sixty five or three sixty four and a quarter is

280
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:16,510
what the Pope's work schedule does that that never changed anything.

281
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,710
So.

282
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,790
There you go, it didn't change anything at all.

283
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:30,950
The Pope's work schedule, and that's that's kind of like a joke when when, you know,

284
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,750
like it's like what color is George Washington's white horse?

285
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,330
It's the Pope's work schedule.

286
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,570
Yeah. OK, so I hope you folks got it.

287
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,810
There is no demarcation of the year as such.

288
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,130
It goes from a certain point to a next point.

289
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,330
Let me get just let me just throw this out.

290
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:55,370
Last year, being a 13th moon, there was over three hundred and ninety four days last

291
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,310
year. No one no one noticed.

292
00:18:58,130 --> 00:18:59,510
Right. No one really noticed.

293
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,070
So talk about a bending reality.

294
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:06,870
How can one bend reality to the point where they can miss thirty four days?

295
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:08,630
Uh huh. Yeah.

296
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:14,930
So let's just see what else is going on.

297
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,270
What's wrong with the wrong time?

298
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,590
We're going to have to catch up with time again here.

299
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:25,370
We'll see. We'll see how people can wrestle with that maybe and work it back and forth

300
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,510
as a form of exercise.

301
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:33,370
Perhaps I would suggest that perhaps getting on with more of the conversation unless

302
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:36,730
the people just want to discuss time or anyone else wants to call in, because there's

303
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:43,330
many things also that have been discussed on emails and things that tend to have the

304
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,530
variety that the shows do.

305
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:48,470
But again, I'd like to suggest that the majority of what they call the show, I use

306
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,770
that term. I don't want to use the term show.

307
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:55,930
Sonic episodes have are that most of the questions are scriptural or biblical.

308
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:59,630
And someone once told me, yes, Greek, you are accurate about saying that people will

309
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,710
start focusing on that.

310
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,990
Well, you know, it's not just that.

311
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,390
But, yeah, they'll start focusing on these things, but they will not be accurate.

312
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,750
They will be just focusing in that subject, in that direction.

313
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,830
And the time is coming.

314
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:15,490
So so we'll see how that works out.

315
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:21,650
So regarding other things to discuss, no one has called in and we don't have much else

316
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:27,190
on the subject matter regarding time other than several other.

317
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,550
Let's see what days what day it could be.

318
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:38,510
So I would suggest that if you want to configure the lawful timekeeping, someone in

319
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,930
chat is putting in when the days begin.

320
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,150
So thanks for mentioning month begins with the full moon.

321
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,410
Yes, it does. And it always has.

322
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,490
We'll give history on that.

323
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:50,870
Now, if some people have also said, Greek, you got some great stuff.

324
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,410
Some people, by the way, are completely enthralled by the information.

325
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,050
Others are like, these are great topics, but you don't fill them through.

326
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:01,070
You don't finish or you might skip around in case you've noticed.

327
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,930
I kind of mentioned in many, many other episodes that it's not just time yet.

328
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,970
Not only that, certain things just shouldn't be said in the public forum.

329
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,610
There's just too much to be said.

330
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,330
There are a lot of information, by the way, that can't it's not just information.

331
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,830
It's how you can handle the information, the program or the operating system.

332
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:25,770
A lot of that has to do with very specific people that have very specific purposes.

333
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:31,590
Sometimes people bring up asking questions regarding a manuscript or something and

334
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,590
they want to get into it because they think it affects them.

335
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,870
And I'm like, well, what do you think that has?

336
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,990
Why do you think that has anything to do with you?

337
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,890
You know, does it apply to you?

338
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:45,290
You know, of course, there's the concept of you electing what you want to learn, of

339
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:49,670
course. But I would suggest that most of the things that can be spoken of are just

340
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,410
simply not appropriate, which I would suggest.

341
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:59,590
Also, I want to give a big say of gratitude and thanks to everyone out there that who

342
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,070
has contributed to AFR.

343
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,450
This was the open.

344
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:07,430
This is what considered the open members area was an experiment just to see how much

345
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:12,750
support can be garnered on whether more projects can be done other than the standard

346
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,930
that has been done lately.

347
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:21,770
So I would suggest that you pat yourself on the back if you did contribute.

348
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,090
It's wonderful. And if you haven't, it would be great if you did.

349
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,870
Much appreciated.

350
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:31,470
All of this, by the way, let me just give a little bit of what's going on behind the

351
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:36,490
scenes with that. We had a goal and we exceeded the goal and in credits.

352
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,810
And the goal was exceeded by about 20 percent.

353
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,330
And that was really wonderful.

354
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,770
It was very, very small goal, by the way, very modest.

355
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:48,670
But it was exceeded, which is good, you know, making a goal regardless of what the

356
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,410
number is and exceeding it is very good.

357
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,190
But it all goes to AFR.

358
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,850
So you must consider that.

359
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:57,610
So if you get into the habit of it, it's good because they offer the platform for at

360
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:02,830
least two hours a week of dummy load free transmission or impartment, at least

361
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,050
minimum, at least of that.

362
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,310
So I would suggest that that's not a bad thing.

363
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:09,530
But on the other hand, there is a project in the works.

364
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:13,030
Don't know what it's going to be called yet formally, but there is an informal

365
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:14,490
decision on what to call it.

366
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:20,310
And it will be a place that will either be accessed through AFR or somewhere else,

367
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,030
which you will find out if so.

368
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:28,830
And it will be a place where there will be an unabated impartment of discussions,

369
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:35,210
information, stories, examples, things, how to's, all these things.

370
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:39,450
But it won't be in public and it won't be one of these tacky members areas or

371
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,750
something like that, where it's just, you know, a lot of I get so much feedback

372
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,950
about all that. It's just it's just tacky.

373
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,570
This will be the real stuff.

374
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:52,250
Now, of course, you know, everyone, you know, like that, you know, when you take

375
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,990
out pizza, it says the best pizza in town.

376
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,770
Everybody's got the best pizza in town.

377
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:57,710
Of course, this is going to be different.

378
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,150
It's going to be very different.

379
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:04,770
It'll be a first and it'll be a thing where you will decide if it applies to you

380
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:10,090
or not. And if you are on this planet, most likely it applies to you because there

381
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:14,730
will be, let's say, things mentioned there that will turn the brain inside out just

382
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:16,190
like a sock. Yes.

383
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:21,150
Why? Because, well, why not in public?

384
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,710
Well, kind of giving a little bit of that maybe.

385
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:29,070
Here's the other thing. There is a short laundry list of Greek speak that anyone can

386
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,210
hear. You know, there is, of course, the Pope's work schedule, how the body works,

387
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:38,250
the movement of living versus dead energies, all these various other things, how the

388
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,870
political system works, the money system, how the regarding information about the

389
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,430
gods. These are just typical things.

390
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:49,850
And also, if you're paying attention, a lot of hints on what's called quote unquote

391
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,510
science or technical aspects of things, much of it.

392
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:58,430
So pretty much cover all the bases of what it takes to be a surface dwelling earth

393
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:01,810
inhabitant. These things have been given out in smatterings over the years.

394
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:06,850
And there is going to be a place coming that it will be not open to the public.

395
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:13,450
Sorry. And it will be pretty much unabated, at least as far as time permits,

396
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:19,350
impartment of what can be said versus a public forum.

397
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,690
So what can be done, though?

398
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:28,150
I had once a recent communication regarding that is everything that can be said in its

399
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:34,250
entirety or as much as possible in its entirety, whatever time is given is always

400
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,450
hinted at in public.

401
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,910
Always, always, always.

402
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:42,550
By the way, there is a previous sonic event that had 18 episodes and then 12 and such.

403
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:49,030
And if you they're kind of regarding various topics and depending on your aptitude

404
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:54,470
to want to know more about what's being said, I would suggest going back and listening

405
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,850
to those with a fine tooth comb.

406
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,890
How do you listen with a fine tooth comb?

407
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,910
Anyway, yeah, because there's a lot of hints in there.

408
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:06,070
A lot of it is not elaborated, but the hints are there enough like a hint regarding

409
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:12,530
timekeeping would be very, very, very simple would be like, you know, the calendar,

410
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:13,930
the thing you use, right?

411
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:19,450
OK, well, you know, you ever observe a holiday or anniversary or something and you

412
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,590
notice how it's a different day of the week every year?

413
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,090
You ever notice that? Well, you know what?

414
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:27,770
Because it's arbitrary and they even tell you it's a work schedule.

415
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:32,970
OK, you know, you ever notice how in nature heat goes down and cold goes up?

416
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,950
You notice how you should have a cool head and warm feet?

417
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,630
You know, well, you know, these are real basic stuff, folks.

418
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:45,250
And by the way, I do call physicists and heating, cooling and HVAC people, you know,

419
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,750
ventilating, cooling, air conditioning people and ask them how many calls they got

420
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:53,070
yesterday regarding people asking for equipment that makes a verified rising cold and

421
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,030
a descending heat.

422
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,310
And they said, huh?

423
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,910
I said, thank you very much.

424
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:57,890
Planet full of idiots.

425
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:03,430
I'm just hang up. So if you are fine with that, you're doing great.

426
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,870
Now, this is your typical public discussion right now.

427
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:07,870
Not really. Sorry.

428
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:11,870
You're always being told how great you are and whatever, you know, how good you are.

429
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,010
And there's always somebody over there.

430
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:19,250
Some. Yeah, well, he worked for the Federal Reserve or he's part of a secret club or

431
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,990
or, you know, it's just really bad stuff.

432
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,130
Oh, yeah.

433
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,970
Cannibals, birthdays and dolls get a grip on that, folks.

434
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,270
And most of you have probably heard that before.

435
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,170
So this is humanity.

436
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,650
This is where you're at.

437
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:40,330
OK, so we've got pretty much a half hour of of so far of the sonic event.

438
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:47,610
And the people are still still speaking on time in this and various other things, very

439
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:52,270
specific things, by the way, in the AFR chat regarding things scriptural or biblical.

440
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:58,630
And by the way, I've always brought this up before because of what religion has done,

441
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:02,530
because it's one of the things that are just what you use the no pun intended.

442
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:03,970
God, awful. All of them.

443
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,190
Religion just means something you do regularly.

444
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,730
So, you know, you tie your shoelaces.

445
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,210
Well, that's pretty religious if you do it every day.

446
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:16,090
But what religions have done, if you bring up any unless it's in vogue, by the way, in

447
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:20,430
style or fashionable or anything, you bring up a holy red and right away people think,

448
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:25,290
oh, that has to do with religion and say, oh, I don't want to hear about that because

449
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:30,130
I'm not religious. Well, what they really want to say is those people that do those

450
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:34,650
things, you know, you know, I've heard of like Santa Claus, you know, anyway, all that

451
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:40,750
other stuff. It's kind of like, you know, you know, I don't want anything to do with

452
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:45,830
that. Right. So, yeah, so this is that's why I don't want to discuss too much in

453
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:49,450
public. There are primers and there's lots of information, just like there's information

454
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,650
regarding the human body.

455
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:56,530
The human body does not, period, work the way you've been told, period.

456
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:04,090
You want to empty out a room of academics and doctors with 30 years of

457
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:06,990
experience or any place like that?

458
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,750
You know, just go in there and ask them, how does the body absorb anything?

459
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,550
Watch what happens. They can't they can't handle that.

460
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:20,190
What you consider, by the way, the medical industrial complex, they've they're

461
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:24,150
ledger of domain. Basically what they're doing is they saw a woman in half, put her

462
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:28,950
back together and you say you saw a woman being sawed in half and put back together

463
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,890
and they lie, you swear to it.

464
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,890
And you love it because, well, you know, I woke up today and the day before yesterday

465
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,370
and these institutions are still there.

466
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,570
So I guess you love it because they wouldn't be there unless they were accommodating

467
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,290
you. But the human body, sorry, doesn't work the way you've been told.

468
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,230
And those that know it are not sharing.

469
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,770
You ever wonder why?

470
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,690
Yeah. What you're called, what you call science, physics, chemistry, none of that is

471
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,650
true. None of it.

472
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:59,050
It is true enough technique so people can technicians can technically access it when

473
00:29:59,050 --> 00:29:59,870
they go to work.

474
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,430
But it's super unintuitive, isn't it?

475
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,210
You ever heard of an electron or a proton?

476
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:07,910
Sounds like some kind of Greek lascivious thing, doesn't it?

477
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:12,630
Yeah. So, yeah, you've been duped again.

478
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:18,430
Yes. The only thing that seems to pretty much work and is semi-functional is

479
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,310
mathematics. So we get into the baker's dozen kind of stuff.

480
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:27,230
But all your other stuff doesn't work, folks, and but it well, functionally,

481
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:30,590
functionally literate means you know how to read, but you don't know what anything

482
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:31,670
means. You're functional.

483
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,350
You're functional and you're being led a certain way.

484
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,650
And it's fine because you know what?

485
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,830
This was this has all been put in place before anyone was born.

486
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:46,970
So in essence, there's going to be a place in the future where things will be said

487
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:52,590
openly and but in private, you're if you want to partake, you're going to have to

488
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:58,710
join. Somehow, you're going to have to figure that out as it's there'll be

489
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:59,650
instructions, I guess.

490
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:06,670
Yeah. And any of those that for some reason can't join or whatever, for some

491
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:10,950
reason, and there's a dire need to have access to it, you could contact the Greek

492
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:18,050
at Uncommon Sense Radio one at Gmail dot com at Uncommon Radio dot com and maybe

493
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,210
something can be worked out.

494
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:25,150
But there is a time coming here roughly next by next spring.

495
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,650
There'll be a time we'll actually see it come around.

496
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:32,370
Hopefully, if it does, the chronology is in place.

497
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,010
If it doesn't, we'll watch a little closer.

498
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:40,910
So let's just say at this point, this is the fifth sonic time around and this is a

499
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:41,730
time before man.

500
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,710
And like I mentioned, what do cannibals, birthdays and dolls have in common?

501
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,770
Now, that's more of a commentary on mankind society.

502
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:55,950
What I want to just ensue here is that there's a time before.

503
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:02,070
Mankind, right, and that's time of the earth, that's time of the animals, if you

504
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:05,650
ever think about that, you're not supposed to, because you were told you came from

505
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,590
the animals or whatever, and you're not an animal, it's very simple.

506
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:12,130
You can rationalize that in many, many ways.

507
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:18,450
You you do share the function of many of the organs and certain things, eyes, hair,

508
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:23,290
things like that might appear commonalities and needing to drink water and breathe

509
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:28,690
there. But once there's a comprehension, by the way, of what you're made up of,

510
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,110
which is a soul, a spirit and a body.

511
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:36,590
By the way, you ever hear in adverts or stuff where they say the body, mind and

512
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,370
spirit, don't they?

513
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:40,770
Somebody got to call them up, tell them, you know, the mind and spirit are the

514
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:44,470
same thing. Here's an easy way to prove it, folks.

515
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:52,290
Whenever you see the word with a PSY prefix, that means spirit, like psychic,

516
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:59,010
psychiatry, psychotic, psychopath or psychology has to do with the mind that is

517
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:05,370
the spirit. And by the way, folks, whenever you see see a word with a PNU prefix like

518
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:09,970
pneumatic, pneumonia, it has to do with something going through the nostrils and

519
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:11,750
ending up in the cul-de-sac of the lungs.

520
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,630
That's that's the soul, man.

521
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:19,210
Yeah. And the thing is, you can discuss this till you're blue in the face.

522
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:22,950
And maybe that's why there was a race of blue people.

523
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:27,690
But anyway, and no one statistically wants to hear it.

524
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,230
Maybe one out of a thousand, one out of a hundred, maybe.

525
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:36,050
And all these people that suggest that they profess to be guiding others spiritually

526
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:39,690
can't define anything. And this is not just putting a knock on them.

527
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:43,070
You guys can figure that out yourself if you so choose to.

528
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,730
But let's go back to the animals, folks.

529
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,770
And that just let's just say.

530
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:57,710
Yes, I brought up the earth, the soul, the spirit and the body, you're animated, you

531
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:03,410
what makes you the personality that you have is the mind, the spirit, the Elohim, our

532
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,690
mind, the gods, our mind.

533
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:10,710
They have the ability to toggle back and forth into the material world where you don't.

534
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:15,010
And by the way, I just want to throw this in there, all these idiots that do this

535
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,889
meditation stuff and they trust transfer astral and all that.

536
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:19,929
They're being taken for a ride.

537
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:27,350
Yes, they are. And if you've heard any of the previous sonic, let's say, layouts, you

538
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:30,770
know specifically how people are being taken for a ride to believe that crap.

539
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,170
And it's pretty real to them, believe it or not.

540
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:37,710
But is it you know, what's reality again?

541
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:43,250
You see, under this censorship doesn't take much to figure it out, folks, or maybe just

542
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,110
a little impetus, a little keys here and there will unlock the door.

543
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:53,150
So back to the the earth and the spirit, the spirit that you're aware of, your mind is

544
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:58,250
animated in a physical body that whose elemental constituents represent the soil in

545
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,870
the earth. Yes, they do look it up.

546
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:06,150
And so do the animals, by the way, most of them, not all of them, some salamanders in

547
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,950
caves with no eyes of different constituents.

548
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:12,830
But but one thing that humanity is going to find out in the future is all this stuff

549
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,210
around you is like a movie set.

550
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:18,010
Well, not like a movie set, because movies are not what I'm trying to talk about.

551
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,390
It was all put here in place.

552
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:25,470
So you, mankind, surface-dwelling earth inhabitants would be more of a reductionist

553
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:29,350
form of communicating humanity for you.

554
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,290
Yes, for you as well.

555
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,630
You know, initially when you're introduced to it, it was for to steward it.

556
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,510
To be a master over it.

557
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,670
And what was the purpose of all this stuff?

558
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:43,410
Have you ever heard of one of these terrariums where you put all these things in

559
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:46,730
there, you know, living life forms and you seal it up and it's sort of like, does it

560
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,430
need much food or water?

561
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,810
It just kind of goes around and around in there.

562
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:55,070
You know what I mean? It's like sealed up and you don't have to feed it.

563
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:55,950
It just grows.

564
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,690
Yeah. Uh huh.

565
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,390
That's how nature was set up.

566
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:02,270
And you're here to steward it and master it, not to process it.

567
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:06,510
All this processing is done by the animals, the insects, the bacterium, the

568
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:10,850
weather, the salt, you know, everything that you see around you and you have the

569
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:16,610
ability to change it slightly through stewardship, but not to step in and do

570
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,610
what, anyway, you get the point.

571
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,890
So what are these animals?

572
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:21,690
Who are these animals?

573
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:27,050
You know, when you bring up these, uh, the concept of the, that, uh, that life

574
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:31,310
form, you know, if you want to reduce it even to the unseen, you know, where you

575
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:35,110
have the flora and the fauna, you know, the fungus, the flora and the fauna would

576
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,930
say the animals, the smallest little bacteria and things like that, little

577
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:38,750
critters that move.

578
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:40,970
And I'm not talking about viruses, by the way.

579
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,470
I just want to throw this in real quick.

580
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,870
How do you kill a virus when they tell you it's already dead?

581
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:49,390
Are you people paying attention or are they lying and you swearing to it?

582
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:52,130
Anyway, go back to the animals.

583
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,210
Here's an interesting concept.

584
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,130
I'm going to throw it out there.

585
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:58,650
And if anyone has any, is familiar with any of the ancient manuscripts, it says

586
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,290
when the spirit of man dies, it goes back to the heavenly realm.

587
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:08,730
But when the spirit of the animals dies or the animal dies, it goes back to the

588
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:09,010
earth.

589
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,510
Sorry, let me just go back.

590
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,450
When man dies, the spirit returns back to the hard drive.

591
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:14,870
Let's say that's up.

592
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:18,990
But when the animal dies, it's mind or its spirit returns back to the earth.

593
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,790
So how many times have you run into people discussing, oh, mother earth, this,

594
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:23,290
that, and the other.

595
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,310
Well, you're not your mother.

596
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,050
Maybe it is the mother to the animals.

597
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:30,510
You can pretty much surmise that from many different ways.

598
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,970
I wouldn't say it directly, but close enough.

599
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,950
When the spirit goes back there.

600
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:39,030
So that would be very interesting, you know, just getting that little bit of

601
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:39,510
information.

602
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,570
Let's say you're going to roll along with that bit of information.

603
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:45,390
That means that the spirit houses, the earth houses all of the spirits of the

604
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:45,730
animals.

605
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,350
Isn't that interesting?

606
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:55,010
And you also put the plow into it to make farming and agriculture so you can

607
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:55,770
support yourself.

608
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,790
If you were not, let's say, consuming animal.

609
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,550
So there's many aspects to that that can be considered.

610
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:07,410
They're basically, all of this stuff was made, you know, for mankind.

611
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:08,930
Now, here's an interesting part.

612
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:13,530
Throw this in here and bounce around a little because the celestials are

613
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,090
important also.

614
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,630
How many times have you heard that the moon is artificial?

615
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,530
This was going on a few years ago.

616
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,990
You know, the internet is full of this in vogue, fashionable crap.

617
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,590
The moon is artificial.

618
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:23,230
Okay.

619
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:24,910
Well, okay.

620
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:28,970
Well, you know, my retort on that was, you know, very simply, you know, they

621
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,930
say it's artificial because it doesn't orbit like anything else.

622
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:34,350
Well, the moon has a strange orbit because it doesn't have its own orbit.

623
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:37,250
It uses the same orbit that the earth has.

624
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,090
It's locked into it.

625
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,110
So if you know how vectors work, you can explain that.

626
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:42,050
But no one seems to.

627
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,590
Tesla had a good little short paper that he published regarding that.

628
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,770
But the moon is artificial.

629
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,210
I was like, hold on a second.

630
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,870
So is this like part of evolution?

631
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:53,730
They're like, no, no, no.

632
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,190
There's people that make stuff out there.

633
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,030
So I mean, like creators.

634
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:56,390
Okay.

635
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:01,670
So, so, uh, if everything, if there's a creator, then, uh, everything's

636
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:05,450
artificial because in order for something to be artificial, it has to

637
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,110
have an artifice or a creator.

638
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,550
Have you ever thought about that?

639
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:13,030
If everything is created, it's made by an artifice or the term

640
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,250
artificial has gotten a bad rap.

641
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:18,630
It just means something bad because when it entered people's vocabulary

642
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,530
back, maybe in sixties or seventies, it meant something nasty.

643
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:26,530
They were putting in food versus natural, but I assure you, everything

644
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,190
is natural and everything is artificial.

645
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:32,590
You know, if you look at the formulation of the most toxic chemical

646
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:36,750
synthesized, that is still garnered and synthesized from natural things

647
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:37,850
that are found in the environment.

648
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:38,810
Yeah.

649
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,310
Even transmutation is natural to a degree.

650
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,290
Well, to many degrees, if you understand how human bodies work and the

651
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:49,390
concept of artificial ties in with nature, because it's all part of creation.

652
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:53,290
So look at how much of what people think about and talk about.

653
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:56,010
It's just going to be wiped away by simple different definitions.

654
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:57,810
Think about it.

655
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:00,610
That's why, I mean, how can you have a public discussion on this?

656
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:04,310
By the way, a few years ago, I did some sonic events with Ocelli and the

657
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,230
Greek, and I think there's 18 episodes on there.

658
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:09,450
Most of the topics, most of the episodes were topical.

659
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:14,910
And, uh, I do suggest referring those as just like a good base public

660
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:19,370
discussion on first time things being discussed, I would say everything

661
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:23,870
on there is the first time it's being discussed publicly, but mostly everything.

662
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:24,310
Yes.

663
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:24,930
Uh-huh.

664
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:30,330
So, uh, I would just suggest here, um, that this being the fifth sonic

665
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,830
episode, number five comes before man.

666
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:36,610
When you think about it and what came before man is this entire

667
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:40,370
environment before man is on here.

668
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:40,710
Yeah.

669
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:41,170
Mm-hmm.

670
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:45,410
Uh, as you know, it surface toiling earth inhabitant with the current lifespan.

671
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:51,150
Uh, I would like to get into more about man like I have in the past, but again,

672
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,390
I'm just going to throw this in again.

673
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,850
What do cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common?

674
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,230
And you'll understand the current state of affairs.

675
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:03,010
So back to the number five, the time before mankind, let's just take a look at it.

676
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,170
What was here?

677
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:07,450
Let's say if you scrub man from the planet, you still have an incredible, I

678
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:11,370
mean, veritable plethora of plants and animal life seen and unseen.

679
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:12,410
Yes.

680
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:13,950
You know, unseen as well.

681
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,330
You know, can you imagine animal life?

682
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:16,570
That's not in the visible spectrum.

683
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:17,490
Yeah.

684
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:18,510
You can only imagine it.

685
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,350
You might think of a contour or something or something or whatever.

686
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:23,990
Yeah.

687
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:29,290
Stories cryptology, but, uh, not to focus on that, but there are things seen and

688
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:33,050
unseen in that, that pretty much, if you just pluck man away, uh, you'd get an

689
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,190
idea of everything would pretty much be the same.

690
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:40,730
So when you look at all of these creatures and how many there are in variety,

691
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:45,190
um, just for a moment, take it out of your head that you didn't evolve from that.

692
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,770
Now the word evolve, it's always being used incorrectly.

693
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:50,330
It just means to unravel or open.

694
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:55,290
So even then it's not being, uh, and there's, there's nothing original about

695
00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:56,910
evolution, all that crappy science.

696
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:57,770
It's just a joke.

697
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,350
It's a prank.

698
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,470
Uh, that started, you know, with the ancient Egyptians, uh, you know, everyone's

699
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:04,630
had something, it's low level stuff.

700
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:08,170
I call it, you know, like, you know, when you're going down the highway and they

701
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:11,010
got some crappy fast food and you're really hungry and you eat it anyway.

702
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:14,890
Uh, yeah, you're going down the highway of life and all you're given is crap.

703
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:15,610
You eat it anyway.

704
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,310
So that's your prerogative.

705
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:18,510
But here's the thing.

706
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,050
People serving crap wouldn't be serving crap if they didn't

707
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,210
have an audience to accommodate.

708
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:27,830
But anyway, all this stuff here before mankind, look at how different it is.

709
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,550
You ever, you ever really look at animals?

710
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,390
I mean, just really look at them.

711
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:32,650
Yeah.

712
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,730
We, what'd you notice?

713
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:35,030
Hmm.

714
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:38,750
Some fly, some are fast, some are in the water.

715
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:41,690
Some, again, you don't see, and some you do see, you know, it's

716
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,130
interesting about them, but just keep it real basic.

717
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:48,510
There's been some discussion about this back in the day, but you know how I

718
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:53,130
mentioned earlier, the connection, um, if you want to subscribe to a certain

719
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:57,150
ancient manuscript, the spirit of the animal returns to the earth.

720
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:00,890
You know, you ever, we ever noticed that most animals, their spine, you know,

721
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:04,430
which is, let's say a spinal column in German, it's called the spiral column

722
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:06,810
because the energy is, moves in a vortex.

723
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:11,810
You ever notice how their spinal column is horizontal or parallel

724
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,030
to the surface of the earth?

725
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:17,430
And for most people it's perpendicular to the surface of the earth.

726
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:18,590
Yeah.

727
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:19,550
Think about that.

728
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,610
Now birds tend to be a little different.

729
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:24,850
Um, they tend to stand around with a fairly vertical spine.

730
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:29,250
I mean, on a diagonal, about 36 degrees or so, which happens to

731
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:32,970
be the diagonal of a cube, by the way.

732
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:34,390
Let me just get in that for a moment.

733
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:38,370
Cause it sounds like I'm all over the place, but you know, um, it's like chess.

734
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:39,750
Each piece has different movements.

735
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:42,410
Every time you bring something up, it can move anywhere on the board.

736
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:46,470
You know, when you think of a square and you put a diagonal through a

737
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,950
square, it's at 45 degrees, isn't it?

738
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:53,390
All day and all night, you know, we do a diagonal on the square.

739
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:53,610
Yeah.

740
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,430
You Pythagoreans out there know that by heart, but most people haven't

741
00:43:56,430 --> 00:43:57,490
really thought about it much.

742
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,810
In carpentry, you know, when you have a square and you make a diagonal, it's

743
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:04,410
always at 45 and split that again and get 22 and a half.

744
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:07,190
And they use that a lot for crown moldings and other things in construction.

745
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:11,130
Machinists kind of get into that lingo and they get down to breaking up

746
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:13,010
that 90 degree and 45 and all that.

747
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:15,110
But you can do that all day long.

748
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:17,590
You'll find out things that are square, have a diagonal of 45 degrees.

749
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:21,170
But if you make a cube, which is, let's say, um, a three-dimensional

750
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:26,190
relationship of that square, and you put a diagonal through that cube, if

751
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,910
that cube were made of glass and you look at, look at it from every angle,

752
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:34,030
it will appear to be crossing each angle of each side that you're viewing at 45,

753
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:34,670
doesn't it?

754
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:35,650
And you could swear to it.

755
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:36,870
I bet you would.

756
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:41,630
Now, if that cube, if you could open the top and, um, look at the diagonal

757
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:45,850
that goes through the cube, okay, from opposite corners, this is three

758
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:49,530
dimensional now, uh, you will measure that.

759
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:51,550
You'll see it's a 36 degrees.

760
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:53,150
Yep.

761
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:54,430
Yeah.

762
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:55,410
Gotcha there, huh?

763
00:44:55,970 --> 00:45:01,590
So, uh, start looking at things, uh, in, in, you know, how they're projected.

764
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:03,050
And by the way, there's only one dimension.

765
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:06,550
The, the, the reason I mentioned, you know, the square, notice I didn't say

766
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:10,370
two dimension, but when I discussed the cube, I mentioned three dimensions

767
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:12,430
because that is a proper way to use it.

768
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:14,850
The, there's only one dimension folks.

769
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:15,770
Yeah.

770
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:16,730
You'll find that out later.

771
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:21,030
And the dimension is, is, uh, made up of things that you perceive and things

772
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,370
that you don't perceive, period.

773
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:24,670
All this multiple dimension stuff.

774
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:27,310
You want to know what a weak minded individual is, but anyway.

775
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:28,310
Okay.

776
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:31,870
So you're here, the word quantum people using that or multiple dimensions.

777
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:32,250
Yeah.

778
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:36,190
That's really weak and it's getting kind of tired and everybody knows it, but

779
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:40,990
because there's nothing else to do or say seemingly by a society that is

780
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:45,350
completely censored, yeah, might as well entertain it, but it's dumb.

781
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:46,730
And you'll find that out later.

782
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:51,170
I'm not saying if you gravitate towards that kind of rubbish, not saying don't

783
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:53,930
do it, go ahead, but you'll find out later.

784
00:45:54,630 --> 00:46:01,230
So, uh, look at back to the spines of the animals, uh, how they are parallel

785
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:05,130
to the surface of the earth, or let's say, uh, and man is vertical

786
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,550
to the surface of the earth.

787
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:10,750
So he's kind of like the animals are parallel to the surface.

788
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:12,290
Man's perpendicular to the surface.

789
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:16,570
So the, uh, man is, uh, let's say, uh, perpendicular.

790
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:18,190
The animals are horizontal.

791
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:19,430
It's not interesting.

792
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:22,050
There are fields by the way, that move on the earth.

793
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:22,550
Yeah.

794
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:23,670
You want to experience one.

795
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:24,890
It's called a compass.

796
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:28,970
That is a magnetic field that doesn't have much to do with cardinal north

797
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:31,570
and south and east and west the planet.

798
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:37,490
And the sun will dictate cardinal direction, cardinal meaning, regardless

799
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:41,210
of what your compass or the compass and magnetic field does, and the

800
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:45,030
magnetic fields are being dubbed in the direction of north and south and east

801
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:51,070
and west, there are fields that move along the earth and these are considered,

802
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:54,710
um, by many fields, no pun intended.

803
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:58,030
And you'll see that the animals tend to be that way.

804
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:01,730
They're also on all fours and they make contact with all the ends of their

805
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:03,610
limbs on the earth, usually.

806
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:06,130
And mostly now the birds again are slightly different.

807
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:10,050
The birds came prior and the fish came prior to the land animals.

808
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:15,390
And most fish, by the way, tend to have that horizontal posture as well.

809
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:20,550
And so what they're doing is, uh, if you can imagine how the lines of force

810
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:22,930
move along the planet, right?

811
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:25,890
I would say parallel to the surface.

812
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:31,270
Uh, you'll see that the, um, the spine of the animals tends to

813
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:33,830
move parallel to those fields.

814
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:37,750
But the spine of mankind is perpendicular to that.

815
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:42,230
And most of his structure, central core structure, right?

816
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:43,270
Think about that.

817
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,170
You know, the lungs are perpendicular to that field.

818
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:46,550
Why?

819
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:50,670
Well, if anyone wants to get a little bit more into what they call physics,

820
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:54,570
there's some studies in various aspects of physics on perpendicular

821
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:56,230
lines of force and their effects.

822
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:56,990
Hmm.

823
00:47:57,090 --> 00:47:57,490
Interesting.

824
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:01,270
Wouldn't that be interesting for someone who's young actually wouldn't don't do

825
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:05,070
it if you're in college, don't do it, get out, do something, get a hotdog cart

826
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:09,530
instead, but anyway, if someone wants to do some kind of a study or a thesis on

827
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:13,870
that, that would be very interesting, of course, but if you look at the

828
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:17,450
differences and these things are functional, um, you know, very often, you

829
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:22,950
know, when people see, uh, let's say you discuss, um, the sun, well, yeah, it's

830
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:27,390
beautiful, you know, at sunset or at dawn, you know, there's all this poetic

831
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:29,650
stuff, but they see no lawful use for it.

832
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:33,490
You know, they have pets, for example, as animals, or they eat them.

833
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:34,510
Some people eat them.

834
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:38,850
Actually, most people, so carnivores to a degree, but they're not really carnivores

835
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:40,150
or carrion eaters.

836
00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:41,310
They don't eat it live.

837
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:42,670
They eat the carrion.

838
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:50,390
Uh, so at way after it's been killed, uh, but you look at the animals, uh, and you

839
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:52,190
say, well, you know, there are just animals.

840
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:52,910
I'm used to it.

841
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:55,010
Well, that's maybe part of the problem.

842
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:57,690
You get used to things and well, I wouldn't say there's a problem with the

843
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:01,230
animals, but most of the things that people seem to have a headache about and

844
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:05,410
they shouldn't is because it just takes a little bit of examination and a little

845
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,430
bit of discussion on how things are different.

846
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:11,930
And I would suggest that looking at these things with a fresh view, with a fresh

847
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:17,250
eye, and you don't need to crack a book open to look and for it to tell you how

848
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,630
to think in general.

849
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:22,230
I mean, there's some manuscripts out there that got some very high forms of law.

850
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,490
And you want to approach that and you think you could understand it, have at it.

851
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:28,470
But the thing is, what do you really see?

852
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:29,910
What do you really see?

853
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,590
What's going on around you?

854
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:32,570
Yeah.

855
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,130
So I just wanted to bring that up just to honor the animals a little bit.

856
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:39,690
They don't get that much, you know, other than the pets, you know, by the way, if

857
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:41,710
you, was it Gandhi who said something?

858
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:45,010
I'm not a fan of Gandhi or if you actually find out what he was into.

859
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:49,410
But either way, I would just say, if you want to learn more about a society, look at

860
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:54,510
how they treat their livestock or animals and you want to learn even more.

861
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,210
What do cannibals, birthdays and dolls have in common?

862
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:02,690
So we'll get into that perhaps next week and maybe a little bit before next week,

863
00:50:02,810 --> 00:50:03,150
perhaps.

864
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:07,370
So I would suggest that look at these creatures.

865
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:11,830
Yeah, they're very base and also have shorter lifespans in general cases.

866
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:14,790
And they were here before man was as such.

867
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:18,830
You know, you can say they came here and I don't want to get into when they were,

868
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:19,970
when all this happened.

869
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:23,690
You'll figure that out on your own or you will find out for sure later.

870
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:28,010
You know, there's nothing here to convince, it's just to impart.

871
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:33,490
Now, if you understand how things are different, you might also see, understand

872
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:35,030
more of what makes them the same.

873
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:43,530
So I brought up how the animal kingdom appears and perhaps maybe in a different

874
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,390
way than you've heard it, maybe to consider.

875
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:46,870
I'm not going to give away much more.

876
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:50,710
We'll save that for later regarding animals, the way they behave, who they,

877
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:52,750
what they really are, their purpose.

878
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,190
I'll get into a little bit here publicly.

879
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:57,370
I would suggest that they are here to process.

880
00:50:58,310 --> 00:50:58,470
Yeah.

881
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:02,610
You ever heard of, you know, a process means change things, you know, like I

882
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:04,570
brought up the concept of carnivore.

883
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:09,670
And carrion, you know, there's carrion eaters out there, like vultures, for

884
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:16,570
example, they rely on the scent of a decaying corpse to be attracted.

885
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:18,790
Not always, typically.

886
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:22,610
I mean, they can also be attracted to an injured animal and follow it around, but

887
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:26,670
they also have a keen sense for these, the smell of carrion or decay.

888
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:32,850
And by the way, a lot of the gas linemen, the people that maintain underground gas

889
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:39,570
lines and above ground gas lines and places where vultures could be found, they

890
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:44,730
look for vultures, let's say, circling over there.

891
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:47,350
They're in some places are taught to identify them.

892
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:53,030
And typically, if there is a gas line or a gas leak, they will also circle around

893
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:56,290
that gas leak because it tends to have the odor of such a thing.

894
00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:00,230
If you ever smell like a gas stove or propane, kind of a little slightly funky.

895
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:01,250
Right.

896
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:05,090
So these birds have actually become quite useful to people in industry.

897
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:09,690
So typically, if you're working in that field, you drive up to it and you see if

898
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:14,250
there's no dead animal and you chose that there might be a gas line there.

899
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:16,450
It could be leaking because these birds are attracted to that.

900
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:20,250
So there's a useful consideration on understanding how animals work.

901
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:24,610
And I give you a simple one just to show you how mankind can work with animals.

902
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:28,630
And anyone has dogs or cats or birds or, you know, they're working animals.

903
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:32,310
And you can go to places in the world where they actually help assemble

904
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:35,610
skyscrapers in places, I think, like Sri Lanka and Malaysia.

905
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:39,210
They have elephants doing heavy work still today.

906
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:44,210
So I would suggest that, you know, looking at these things and the reason I'm

907
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:48,930
bringing it up is I would say it's around the fifth time I'm coming around.

908
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:50,950
It's a time before man and what was around.

909
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:53,970
And seemingly there's not much talk about the animals.

910
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:57,450
There's a lot of animal rights thing people.

911
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:02,050
Now, I want to bring this up again, because, again, this is this is planet

912
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:06,730
Earth. But when the concept of rights comes up, by the way, whenever you hear

913
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:11,430
that, right, other than like maybe right of way, maybe even that might be a good

914
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:12,590
way to explain it.

915
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:15,910
But let's just do another way.

916
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:19,190
It means that something wrong has happened and now you have to go under rights.

917
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:22,070
So you hear about all these morons, these patriots are going around.

918
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:23,770
They want their rights or this and that.

919
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:27,110
You know, what did you do wrong to demand rights?

920
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:33,390
Rights are something that someone goes under after they've committed what's

921
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:35,210
called a crime or accused of such.

922
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:40,850
So instead of being thrown into a dungeon, a windowless dungeon with no food, you

923
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,790
have rights like three hots and a cot.

924
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:46,550
You know, they'll make sure that you get fed and clothes and something.

925
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:51,470
That's a right. So when you hear about rights, that means you're presuming that

926
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:56,770
something is going on wrong, that you have lost the ability to be reckoned through

927
00:53:56,770 --> 00:54:00,330
law. Now you go under rights and you are actually fighting for this.

928
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:05,370
So we'll continue more on the second half.

929
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:08,050
And this is Uncommon Radio with the Greek.

930
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:14,310
Greetings, everyone, and welcome back to Uncommon Radio with the Greek, also

931
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:16,650
Uncommon Sense and Greek speak to some degree.

932
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:19,330
And please call in if you do feel inclined.

933
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:21,570
You will find the phone number in a red box on the left.

934
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:25,170
If you can't see it on the left, it's on your other left, or you can try the

935
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:29,590
Skype convention and the Skype convention contact could be found if you go to

936
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:33,330
www.uncommonradio.com.

937
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:37,950
It helps to type in the whole thing and scroll down and you will see in red a

938
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:42,990
Gmail and that Gmail is Uncommon Sense Radio 1 at gmail.com.

939
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:47,850
It's a numeric one. And that is also the Skype contact and an email to contact the

940
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:53,470
Greek. So I would suggest that if anyone wants to join and part of this sonic

941
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:55,970
endeavor, please do so.

942
00:54:56,230 --> 00:55:02,230
And before the second hour started at the end of the first hour was discussing

943
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:06,630
animal rights. And I just brought up the concept of rights and how it's misused.

944
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:10,270
And if one thing, if you've heard Greek speak, it's just really trying to counter

945
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:15,050
the misuse. There's most things are misused, but just like even a large

946
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:18,190
mathematical equation that you see in the movies, because you probably didn't look

947
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:23,670
at them anywhere else. There's a small equal sign and a small number to the right.

948
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:26,050
So it doesn't take much to counter all the bullshit out there.

949
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:28,650
Yes, I did say that word. That is a biblical term, by the way.

950
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:31,510
It's called dung. There's another way to say it.

951
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:37,930
But I would just say that when you hear about rights, that has been misused.

952
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:43,250
And let me just to recap here, when rights come into play, I'm going to say it

953
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:44,530
slowly, I'm going to repeat it.

954
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:52,570
Rights come into play when someone, let's just say someone, has been accused of or

955
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:58,290
has committed a crime. And the rights are there to sort of have more of a

956
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:03,810
mitigatable condition for the assailant or the accused so they don't die before

957
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:09,190
they get a trial. Because typically in certain societies or in times, if you're

958
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:12,150
accused of a crime, you're thrown into a dark, deep hole.

959
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:19,190
And when it came time to execute judgment or for you to make it right or go to a

960
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:22,290
trial, you were dead because the conditions were so bad.

961
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:24,130
That's what rights are for.

962
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:30,030
So if you are a ordinary surface dwelling earth inhabitant, rights have nothing to

963
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:35,230
do with you unless you have been accused or considered to be a quote unquote

964
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:36,730
wrongdoer or unlawful.

965
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:44,130
So how do you how do you counter the perception of this when it seems to be the

966
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:47,630
opposite? You have all these idiots everywhere asking for rights.

967
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:49,190
And why am I talking about this?

968
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:53,110
Because we're discussing the point of animal rights that I brought up.

969
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,770
I'm not going to get into rights anymore.

970
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:59,170
But when you hear people asking for them, they are either admitting that they have

971
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:05,210
done something wrong and now they cannot be free amongst a lawful condition that

972
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:10,550
they now have to come up with some form or be subject to some form of retribution

973
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,670
or they have to do some kind of recompense or something.

974
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:19,150
And they are under rights and people asking for rights just willy nilly like that.

975
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:21,930
That is the mark of a moron with a capital R.

976
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:23,270
And you know what? They're everywhere.

977
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:25,470
So let's just leave that alone for now.

978
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:28,850
I mean, as much can be said, I have discussed this in the past in great detail as

979
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:32,310
well. And I will discuss it more in great detail as well.

980
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:34,190
So let's just say about animal rights.

981
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:37,130
What have animals done wrong that they deserve rights?

982
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:39,190
Think about that for a moment.

983
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:44,650
So all you animal rights activists, stop being so active because really, you know what

984
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:47,670
real, you know where you really find activism these days?

985
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:50,330
Take a pause. Anyone want to answer that?

986
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:51,770
It's a rhetorical pause.

987
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:53,230
Find it in yeast.

988
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:57,550
Go get a package of yeast for you and bake some bread.

989
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:59,850
Very active. The rest of it is worthless.

990
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:04,350
Anyway, what does that have to do with what you're going to do on the cruise ship?

991
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:09,870
If you don't like what's going on, it's because of, yes, you guessed it.

992
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:12,370
I think we need more mirrors.

993
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:16,390
Anyway, I would suggest, oh, who's we?

994
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:20,990
Oh, boy. See, it's real easy to fall into this language trap when you get comfortable.

995
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:23,850
What did animals do to deserve rights?

996
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:25,970
Nobody want to think about that?

997
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:27,930
I didn't say anyone want to answer.

998
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:29,830
That's rhetorical. Even want to think about it.

999
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:35,130
How twisted communication is and even the concept of it.

1000
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:38,770
Right. What did an animal do to you that it needs rights?

1001
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:44,150
So that's an entire thing that could just be put aside, because right now, I'll tell you,

1002
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:47,730
surface dwelling earth inhabitants are so far removed from what is right.

1003
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:55,250
There's no way to bring them back, but they have still a little bit of a journey to go.

1004
00:58:55,790 --> 00:59:02,450
Now, you know, sometimes people will say, well, you know, is this wrong?

1005
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:07,570
You know, this meaning any subject matter that I typically encounter in conversation.

1006
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:10,070
I'll say, well, it's not wrong, but it sure ain't right.

1007
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:14,510
And that gets them kind of wondering, you know, because why?

1008
00:59:15,270 --> 00:59:21,470
When you talk about any subject, by the way, it's what everyone has been told to think about it.

1009
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:23,610
That is right. Right.

1010
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:24,530
Does that make it right?

1011
00:59:24,530 --> 00:59:28,350
If everyone believes in a lie, does it make it the truth?

1012
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:32,630
Well, if you ask your common surface dwelling earth inhabitant, yeah, it does.

1013
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:34,490
But in reality, it doesn't.

1014
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:37,970
And that is going to begin to be changing soon.

1015
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:41,030
So if you're looking for activism, you'll find it in yeast.

1016
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:47,630
If you're looking for animal rights, what did the animal do wrong that it needs rights?

1017
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:50,450
And I'm not going to talk about people that are asked for rights.

1018
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:53,130
They are just, you know what, with a capital R.

1019
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:54,850
Yeah, there's plenty of them.

1020
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:55,830
There's no shortage of that.

1021
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:57,470
So there's no reason to go on that.

1022
00:59:57,590 --> 01:00:00,830
There's many hours of how people are more.

1023
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:02,050
And so that's a technical term.

1024
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:11,750
And if you haven't been out in public lately, and if you like, the best thing to tell young children is if you're not completely disgusted with people around you, you're not paying attention.

1025
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,090
Yeah, think about it.

1026
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:17,310
So if you're paying attention, you're completely disgusted.

1027
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:18,130
Yes, absolutely.

1028
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:21,010
So anyway, back to the animals.

1029
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:26,850
I hope we've not beaten that up too much about the animal rights.

1030
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:30,710
But here's something else to think about on the stewardship.

1031
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:39,610
I've had a recent discussion, hopefully a fellow will call in, be threatened to call in, maybe he will, regarding what's called automobiles.

1032
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:40,610
And why am I bringing that up?

1033
01:00:40,650 --> 01:00:42,210
Well, they're not automobiles, by the way.

1034
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:43,850
They're engine driven wagons.

1035
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:46,890
And they're not motor vehicles because motors are electric.

1036
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:52,950
Yeah, we just talked about how twisted rights are and look, something like that is twisted.

1037
01:00:54,110 --> 01:01:00,930
Now think about modes of transportation where you had beasts of burden, or even horses or mules or donkeys and other things like that.

1038
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:03,490
And by the way, mules are not technically lawful.

1039
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:06,110
Anyway, we'll get into that some other time.

1040
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:14,250
I would suggest that if you were using an animal as a mode of transportation, let's just use them as an animal could be your best friend.

1041
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:21,530
You know, if you just decided to stay home for a week, guess what?

1042
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:26,490
You still have to go out and feed and brush and water the creature, don't you?

1043
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:32,470
But if you've got one of these machines, you know, it can just sit there.

1044
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:37,830
Well, you know, for a certain allotted period of time, other things tend to go wrong with it if it sits too long.

1045
01:01:38,830 --> 01:01:41,830
So think about the modalities here that are being used.

1046
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:52,030
You know, right now, there is a going away from using animals for beasts of burden or labor to machines.

1047
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:53,750
What are these machines?

1048
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:54,490
Well, you know what?

1049
01:01:54,550 --> 01:02:00,610
They are very, very, very simple form of very similar things that all living things do.

1050
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:11,370
Because even though machines have an archetype, you know, basic, all machines share similar things, just like most living things share similar things.

1051
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:24,690
There is a place where in the living things amongst the living, by the way, things change where you have anaerobic creatures that require breathing of air and the other ones that thrive with less air, which are anaerobic.

1052
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:27,410
There is some discernment to be gotten there.

1053
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:30,790
And I want to throw this in since we were discussing the animal kingdom.

1054
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:35,770
How many times have you heard, is there life on Mars?

1055
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:46,390
Or, you know, I sometimes frequent a space weather research place and because there's weather out there as well.

1056
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:47,270
Yeah, sounds kind of funny.

1057
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:50,190
But is there life on this planet?

1058
01:02:50,750 --> 01:03:05,650
And what's interesting is the way academia and those that follow it and or who academia is accommodating, tend to stress that the definition of life is finding some kind of like microorganism in a rock somewhere.

1059
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:11,870
And if you find a microorganism, let's say on Uranus or Uranus, you will discuss that.

1060
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:19,590
You would find that you could deem that there's life that can evolve there, right?

1061
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:20,210
No, no.

1062
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:24,730
Well, you know, here's the thing, folks, and this is this has been mildly hinted at.

1063
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:34,290
The concept of life is not about whether there is a microorganism or a dinosaur or a human, that the actual life force, right?

1064
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:40,010
Well, if you ask any academic or scientist, you know, how how does one walk across the room?

1065
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:43,030
You know, well, you know, he'll tell you the muscles do this.

1066
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,670
Oh, yeah. But what enables all that?

1067
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:58,170
They can't. And if you start discussing what the life force is, like in Greek, it was the Zoe or the Chi in Asia or Ki in Japan, let's say, Prana in the Sanskrit.

1068
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:02,750
Right. Various terms for it.

1069
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:18,330
I would say that it makes them very uncomfortable because their job in the entitled classes right now is to avoid that, because remember, they only deal right now.

1070
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:22,330
Humanity and the entire classes are only dealing with a very simple game of checkers.

1071
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:26,970
They can't deal with multiple movements of multiple parts and multiple prioritization.

1072
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:30,470
It has to be a very simple dummy load.

1073
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:32,190
Yes. Dummy load.

1074
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:38,110
I haven't brought that up much because if you're listening to past Greek speak stuff, you've heard a lot.

1075
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,090
Look up what a dummy load is.

1076
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:45,270
It's an engineering term and it sounds kind of cutesy and it kind of is to apply it when you say, well, that's a dummy load.

1077
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:47,490
Yeah. Even if you don't really know what it means.

1078
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:52,570
But if you discuss the life force, it makes people very uncomfortable.

1079
01:04:52,570 --> 01:05:07,390
Wilhelm Reich discussed the emotional armoring that when you do bring up these core issues, it makes people, them, the entitled classes, the ones that you look up to, by the way, because you are busy doing whatever you find that you need to do on this planet.

1080
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:18,030
And if you have an interest outside of what you do and another subject, you have to trust that what you're being told is true and correct or enough or whatever.

1081
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:35,990
But by the way, folks, when you do partake on the infotainment, I call it, you know, the Internet or the inane net, no matter how serious people are, you know, on the Internet, you know, those that produce and show you shows, when you kind of catch them in the background and how what they're doing is just a dummy load, they always say, yes, it's just entertainment anyway.

1082
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:40,590
So if you're taking it seriously, you take your entertainment very seriously.

1083
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:48,650
But I would suggest that, again, the life force is something that is everywhere, everywhere.

1084
01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:53,770
Do you know, I've discussed, perhaps maybe in the future, again, you can suffocate a rock.

1085
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:56,730
Yes, just like you can suffocate a living thing.

1086
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,650
You can suffocate a rock.

1087
01:05:59,070 --> 01:06:01,650
Yes. And how it can be done is quite simple.

1088
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:03,270
And it's by observation.

1089
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:06,770
And no, rocks are not born and they don't die like you do.

1090
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:08,850
But they are subject to the life force.

1091
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:16,090
Now, just to continue a little bit, this basic life force, which is accessible by everyone that is alive.

1092
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:20,810
And even when you die, that life force continues around you just in a different quality.

1093
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:31,790
Because when you look at something alive, an animal, let's say, or a plant, when it dies or ceases to exist, as it's known pleasantly, other critters move in.

1094
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:36,010
Right. Anaerobic, aerobic bacteria, maggots, things like that.

1095
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:39,290
So it keeps continuing in different forms, in different stages.

1096
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:46,410
But I want to bring up something that I don't discuss publicly, for good reason, is something called the weather.

1097
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:50,730
Now, the weather is also subject to this force.

1098
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:57,390
It is not, I will say this emphatically, the weather is not thermodynamic as you are being dummy loaded.

1099
01:06:58,170 --> 01:07:01,030
It is not thermodynamic at all.

1100
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:10,930
Now, most people on this planet will say it is, because, you know, warmer weather makes hurricanes and this, that and the other.

1101
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:13,170
And tornadoes are a function of this thermodynamic.

1102
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:17,030
And rain is formed by humidity forming around dust.

1103
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:20,410
No, it's not. No, none of that is true at all.

1104
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:21,970
It is a dummy load.

1105
01:07:22,090 --> 01:07:26,570
It is there to give you a cursory explanation.

1106
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:29,330
I mean, sorry, did I say explanation?

1107
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:30,910
Incorrect. Description.

1108
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:32,550
They never explain anything.

1109
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:34,250
They can't. Makes them very uncomfortable.

1110
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:36,730
Who's they? Everyone out there.

1111
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:40,050
That's why, for example, I'll just jump around a little.

1112
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:42,270
Legal society, they don't care about the truth.

1113
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:45,690
They're waiting for you to say something that they could use against you.

1114
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:48,850
We'll tell you that. When you bring that up, they get very uncomfortable.

1115
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:52,870
Doesn't matter if it's the highest judge or the lowest attorney or the lowest paralegal.

1116
01:07:52,970 --> 01:07:57,910
They know it. Anyway, this has nothing to do with the truth.

1117
01:07:57,910 --> 01:08:07,350
This planet here on Earth, it's the society built on it is not about the truth right now.

1118
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:08,590
It is a show.

1119
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,150
Look up what the word show means.

1120
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:13,830
So I would suggest that the Earth is true.

1121
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:14,950
The Earth does exist.

1122
01:08:15,069 --> 01:08:18,210
And several of the things we've discussed, if you subscribe to certain ancient manuscripts,

1123
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:19,930
these things will come up.

1124
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:23,470
And I just give a little bit more explanation on what you can see with your own eye.

1125
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:26,890
Because one of the things that are discussed is what do you see with your own eye?

1126
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:30,510
Right. So just to recap on the first hour,

1127
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:33,069
predominantly just mentioned how the animal kingdom, including,

1128
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:38,130
let's say the plants came even before that, how their spines are typically parallel

1129
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:41,870
to the surface of the Earth and parallel to the field lines on the Earth,

1130
01:08:41,950 --> 01:08:46,970
where mankind's spine is perpendicular to the fields that move across the Earth

1131
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:52,450
and the Earth itself, and also the mind of the animal when it leaves,

1132
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:57,790
the animal goes back to the Earth and the mind of mankind or the spirit goes

1133
01:08:57,910 --> 01:09:00,750
somewhere else. So, yeah, these things are interesting.

1134
01:09:01,069 --> 01:09:05,210
And to be brought up to discuss, perhaps numerologically,

1135
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:09,330
not because I'm into numerology or geometry or anything like that.

1136
01:09:09,490 --> 01:09:11,569
It's because proper things in proper time.

1137
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:13,310
And this seems to be the fifth time around.

1138
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:18,810
By the way, it still is the spring season on the northern hemisphere.

1139
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:20,189
Maybe that's the hemisphere that matters.

1140
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:20,830
I don't know.

1141
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:24,569
I should say I don't know, because if you were somewhere else,

1142
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:26,529
you would take it quite seriously and that would matter.

1143
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:30,609
But if you look at where the center of the Earth is,

1144
01:09:30,689 --> 01:09:35,370
it is on the northern more tendency aspect of the Earth.

1145
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:37,609
And it is in spring time right now.

1146
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:40,470
The friends that are down under and such,

1147
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:44,109
they're going through a fall, almost winter time.

1148
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:49,609
So I will just perhaps make references to the where most of the events are

1149
01:09:49,609 --> 01:09:51,590
happening are considered going into spring.

1150
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:54,670
So you have to understand, again,

1151
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:56,890
many times this has been discussed.

1152
01:09:58,810 --> 01:10:00,770
Let's just say the way you gather information,

1153
01:10:01,290 --> 01:10:03,990
it's really easy to pay attention to where it's noisy.

1154
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:06,150
It's almost if you want to do something,

1155
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:09,990
a lot of noise and hubbub is made, you're distracted to pay attention there.

1156
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:13,490
And I assure you, that is not where the real deal is,

1157
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:14,750
where it's really going on.

1158
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:18,070
It's always the true power is where it's silence,

1159
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:20,890
where it's silent or where the silence is.

1160
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:22,870
Now, what's interesting about springtime

1161
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:27,790
is that there is a lot of silence once things are prepared and not much visible

1162
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:29,630
growth, but everything is in place.

1163
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:33,570
What is being put in place right now geopolitically and such and everything,

1164
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:36,830
even in your life and a microcosm of the life you're living.

1165
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:42,370
And this will grow in the summer and then be harvested and broken down in the fall.

1166
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:44,570
And this is how the cycles work, by the way.

1167
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:46,690
Man, it's not really a dig.

1168
01:10:46,730 --> 01:10:47,630
It's really easy to dig.

1169
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:49,270
It's not fair to shoot fish in the barrel.

1170
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:51,130
What happened to all these idiots talking

1171
01:10:51,130 --> 01:10:54,430
about a big financial collapse in the middle of March?

1172
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:55,690
Did it happen?

1173
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:58,630
See, it's in bad taste to say that because

1174
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:03,830
they kind of know they're stupid about all these matters, but they'll never admit it.

1175
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:05,930
But everyone wants to listen to it anyway.

1176
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:08,290
So doesn't that make everyone also very...

1177
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:09,190
I'm not going to say it.

1178
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:10,630
Yeah.

1179
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:13,670
So it's springtime, so pay attention.

1180
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,910
And regarding the

1181
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:20,770
the aspect of the animal kingdom, which came before mankind,

1182
01:11:20,990 --> 01:11:26,350
I think I'm going to yield at that moment, and I think I gave something to chew on.

1183
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:30,190
And let's see.

1184
01:11:31,970 --> 01:11:33,290
Let's see what's in chat.

1185
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:39,430
Let's see, there's a bunch of just basic, basic chit-chatter in chat,

1186
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:42,670
and no one has called in yet and no one on Skype.

1187
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:47,550
And we could just pursue, perhaps, what we would like to discuss next week.

1188
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:48,530
Who's we?

1189
01:11:49,410 --> 01:11:54,650
And the reason why is there's a preface that can always be made to things.

1190
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:58,230
And here's an email from someone.

1191
01:11:58,350 --> 01:11:59,450
What is in real time?

1192
01:12:00,070 --> 01:12:02,490
What can be known about the life force?

1193
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:05,170
What can be known about plant life and microbiology?

1194
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:05,650
Okay.

1195
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:08,810
Thanks for plugging that in.

1196
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:10,110
That was just five minutes ago.

1197
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:13,610
Because these are formative things.

1198
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:17,790
Now, the thing is, the last thing you want to do in society,

1199
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:21,930
if you really want to lose people, start talking about what causes things.

1200
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:24,570
Formative.

1201
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:28,210
And these subjects make people very, very uncomfortable.

1202
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:29,970
And it's not something distant.

1203
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:31,150
You all experience it.

1204
01:12:31,150 --> 01:12:35,710
It's just that you're so used to it and you take it for granted that you'd rather

1205
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:37,650
not pay attention to it.

1206
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:40,630
Because if you do find and take a liking to considering these things,

1207
01:12:40,730 --> 01:12:42,850
you might get so excited you might want to talk about it.

1208
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:46,630
And the people that are called so-called family and friends and those that you

1209
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:50,830
thought were cordial and friendly to you will not be so much.

1210
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:53,930
So if you want to go ahead and ruin your life, go pursue the truth.

1211
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:55,650
But anyway, I don't believe I just said that.

1212
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:58,110
But yeah, let's just say that is particularly true.

1213
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:03,310
I've once said this before, and I'll say it again just for whatever reason,

1214
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:06,810
that everyone you've ever met, everyone you know,

1215
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:10,110
and everyone you're going to meet is a moron, statistically.

1216
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,230
Meaning the majority of the people are.

1217
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:15,350
Meaning they're still stuck.

1218
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:18,610
And this is how things work on this planet.

1219
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:23,390
And not necessarily the planet's way, but the way mankind has set up society.

1220
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:24,890
And I'm going to say this again.

1221
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:27,750
What do cannibals, birthdays and dolls have in common?

1222
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:32,370
And so back to the life force, what can be said about that?

1223
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:33,270
Well, it's the life force.

1224
01:13:33,770 --> 01:13:35,430
It's pretty much everything, isn't it?

1225
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:36,310
Right.

1226
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:38,570
And the plant life and microbiology.

1227
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:41,410
Well, the micro is very important.

1228
01:13:42,370 --> 01:13:44,910
I mentioned the weather, for example.

1229
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:47,810
Let me give you a quick story regarding that.

1230
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:53,670
And maybe you'll consider, let's say, the microbiology and weather.

1231
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:57,610
The deserts of the planet should not be redeemed.

1232
01:13:58,410 --> 01:13:58,810
Why?

1233
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:00,870
We serve a function.

1234
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:04,850
Well, there's some commentary about them, both negative and very little positive.

1235
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:08,590
Why shouldn't they be redeemed?

1236
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:09,450
Well, very simple.

1237
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:10,650
Now, this has been done.

1238
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:15,270
A certain desert in the southern part of the continent of Africa was redeemed a

1239
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:19,270
while back, and when this was done, it seemed too good to be true.

1240
01:14:20,030 --> 01:14:24,130
This is not using the geoengineering methods that most people cry and scream

1241
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:29,610
about or dummy loaded about when you understand how to access the life force

1242
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:32,710
time and space, time and distance are irrelevant.

1243
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:34,050
Okay.

1244
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:42,810
So I would suggest that when this desert was mitigated and redeemed, where it had

1245
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:47,350
lakes on it now for a short time, when the people that were responsible for

1246
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:48,850
doing this said, this is too good to be true.

1247
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:53,290
We really need to watch things very carefully because what's the payback for

1248
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:57,890
this? And seemingly what happened is through the news, after about six months

1249
01:14:57,890 --> 01:15:02,450
to a year or two, there was a critical demise of the fishing industry near South

1250
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:02,850
America.

1251
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:07,490
There were no fish to be caught and the fish had gone away.

1252
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:12,010
By the way, you do hear a little bit about this now with the Fukushima

1253
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:13,110
disaster and all that.

1254
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:17,930
By the way, people crying about the Fukushima thing, their capital, what the

1255
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:19,030
capital are also.

1256
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:23,170
We can get into what atomics are in the future on another project.

1257
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:30,190
But when this desert was redeemed and the fishing industry went away, it was

1258
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:34,450
consideration that the food chain was disturbed.

1259
01:15:34,610 --> 01:15:34,910
How?

1260
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:41,190
These big deserts throw up these huge dust storms and some of them are so

1261
01:15:41,190 --> 01:15:47,070
dynamic that very fine microscopic particles of silica go even up into the

1262
01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:49,590
stratosphere and descend into the oceans.

1263
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:54,910
What do plankton eat or certain varieties of plankton or small microorganisms in

1264
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:55,330
the ocean?

1265
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:57,070
Yes, you guessed it.

1266
01:15:58,110 --> 01:16:02,670
And if they starve out because there's no dust storm, well, guess what?

1267
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:06,710
What eats the plankton gets starved out and the entire food chain or the concept

1268
01:16:06,710 --> 01:16:12,470
of the big fish eating the smaller fish on and on and on goes away and you end up

1269
01:16:12,470 --> 01:16:14,730
losing a particular aspect of nature.

1270
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:19,730
So consider these things as how everything is tied together.

1271
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:25,410
This was also done, for example, there's some forest research where certain

1272
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:30,810
plants or trees were eliminated and then some animal species corresponded with it

1273
01:16:30,810 --> 01:16:36,790
also, but I think the one regarding the weather manipulation and mitigating the

1274
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:43,110
desert led to the loss of the fishing industry perhaps is another connection

1275
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:44,670
with microbiology.

1276
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:47,770
Now plants, plants are very interesting because when you look at plant life,

1277
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:53,290
how it emerges, plants rarely reach around and grab themselves or touch

1278
01:16:53,290 --> 01:16:56,510
themselves, they tend to have certain geometric patterns.

1279
01:16:56,610 --> 01:17:00,610
There's a book out there on the planetary effect on plants if anyone wants to

1280
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:01,150
get into that.

1281
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:05,230
I have not read it, I've done a cursory review of it, it should be interesting,

1282
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:06,670
an interesting perspective.

1283
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:12,450
I don't have the author, just do a search somewhere, planetary effects on

1284
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:15,850
plants, it's an obscure book, but it's something to look at.

1285
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:23,270
But they have a certain manifestation also and that's something that I would

1286
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:28,550
like to get into, agriculture and all that, perhaps in future projects, because

1287
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:30,950
all of that also ties in with what's called water.

1288
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:34,110
So what can be said about the life force?

1289
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:41,390
Much, but all you have to say, there is a life force and that is enough to get

1290
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:43,870
the passerby mentality with most people.

1291
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:47,450
Yeah, of course there is, but they do not want to discuss it.

1292
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:51,110
Now unfortunately people are still seeking out to pursue what they want to

1293
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:55,390
pursue and are looking for specialists and professionals and all that to tell

1294
01:17:55,390 --> 01:17:58,290
them what, and I assure you, you're not getting quality information.

1295
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:02,190
Not everything they're telling you is a lie, but it's so piss poor that it

1296
01:18:02,190 --> 01:18:02,850
might as well be.

1297
01:18:03,550 --> 01:18:05,590
This is the state that you're living in, folks.

1298
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:10,210
So, uh-huh, that's why your best activism is found in yeast.

1299
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:15,150
So, but here, let's just maybe consider this.

1300
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:20,450
The definition of a professional is someone who's always learning more and

1301
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:22,170
more about less and less, isn't it?

1302
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:24,510
You ever notice how specialized they are?

1303
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:27,110
You ever talk to someone who has a Ph.D.?

1304
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:28,150
What did you get a Ph.D. in?

1305
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:30,710
Oh, I studied the bum of the Moroccan housefly.

1306
01:18:31,610 --> 01:18:32,850
Yeah, that's where I got a degree.

1307
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:36,530
You ever notice that when they get these doctorates, it's such a narrow,

1308
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:41,450
specific, and useless topic that it almost doesn't make any sense, but yet

1309
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:45,290
they get all the entitled praise of their social rank of Ph.D.?

1310
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:47,230
Are you folks paying attention out there?

1311
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:51,250
You know why these people get these doctorate and graduate degrees?

1312
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:53,210
To accommodate you.

1313
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:54,390
Yes, you.

1314
01:18:54,850 --> 01:19:00,010
Because if these people went away and that entitlement program and the social

1315
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:07,130
ranking system of master or Ph.D. went away, you morons would be looking at each

1316
01:19:07,130 --> 01:19:12,050
other saying, we have so few people with master's degrees and Ph.D.s.

1317
01:19:12,110 --> 01:19:13,850
We need to do something about it.

1318
01:19:14,470 --> 01:19:16,590
They're accommodating you with stupidity.

1319
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:22,010
Now, if you don't believe that these graduate people and doctorate people are

1320
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:25,770
accommodating with stupidity, then that means you haven't spent five minutes

1321
01:19:26,490 --> 01:19:28,670
discussing anything with them.

1322
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:29,710
Anything.

1323
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:34,830
And if you have and you haven't realized that it is in that category, guess what?

1324
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:36,810
You're not paying any attention.

1325
01:19:38,030 --> 01:19:42,830
And this is a broad blanket statement that holds true almost all of the time.

1326
01:19:43,630 --> 01:19:44,910
What is going on?

1327
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:49,330
You know, you want to really just confound them, ask them what day it is.

1328
01:19:49,850 --> 01:19:51,990
Anyway, that should be a private joke.

1329
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:56,210
But anyway, going back to the life force, it's there.

1330
01:19:56,290 --> 01:19:57,190
Yeah, there it is.

1331
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:58,150
It's everywhere.

1332
01:19:58,150 --> 01:19:59,030
It can be accessed.

1333
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:04,610
By the way, with some minor cursory research, anyone can access the work of

1334
01:20:04,610 --> 01:20:08,470
Wilhelm Reich and Trevor James Constable and others that worked with what they

1335
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:08,990
call ether.

1336
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:12,430
There's a little bit of fight about what the ether is or whatever.

1337
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:16,750
You got a lot of weak minded individuals trying to look at the label without

1338
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:17,670
defining anything.

1339
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:23,530
And that's the problem with discussing anything objectively in any field or any

1340
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:23,850
group.

1341
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:30,390
So avoid the group and the purely dedicated, methodic, kind of like fanatic

1342
01:20:31,790 --> 01:20:32,770
following of anyone.

1343
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:37,310
You know, there's some people out there that have done really good work in the

1344
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:37,850
past.

1345
01:20:38,550 --> 01:20:41,110
Their mistake was they wanted to make the world a better place.

1346
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:43,370
That's why they were tossed to the side.

1347
01:20:43,910 --> 01:20:44,910
And they said it perfectly.

1348
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:46,090
I mean, they said it publicly.

1349
01:20:46,190 --> 01:20:49,430
They should have just not said that and done it would have been more successful.

1350
01:20:49,690 --> 01:20:51,150
Because by the way, I've said this before.

1351
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:55,710
If anyone's heard Greek speak, if you have something really good, you know,

1352
01:20:55,750 --> 01:21:01,330
that could help anyone, even the animals, of course, and the plants, just do it

1353
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:02,870
and tell others how to do it.

1354
01:21:03,070 --> 01:21:07,410
But the minute you go public and start saying with your mouth or in print that

1355
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:09,630
you're doing this to make the world a better place, you're finished.

1356
01:21:10,190 --> 01:21:16,090
And the reason why you're finished is because the malevolent forces in the

1357
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:18,050
world don't want to see that.

1358
01:21:18,050 --> 01:21:20,790
Yes, and also the benevolence don't either.

1359
01:21:20,990 --> 01:21:21,270
Why?

1360
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:24,490
Because the time for reckoning is coming around.

1361
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:30,550
Not next week, not next month, not next year, not even in five years, not even in

1362
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:31,090
ten years.

1363
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:34,010
But it's coming around and you will not recognize it.

1364
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:35,070
I assure you that.

1365
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:39,670
Because you're going down a path where things will be seemingly getting better.

1366
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:44,370
And you will not be able to recognize what's going on unless you know.

1367
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:48,390
So, actually we have someone trying to join on Skype.

1368
01:21:48,530 --> 01:21:53,970
What I will do is see if I can add him to the group call and perhaps maybe continue

1369
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:54,990
the conversation.

1370
01:21:56,570 --> 01:21:58,490
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

1371
01:21:58,590 --> 01:22:02,850
I think we have been joined by someone that goes by Wes.

1372
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:05,010
I guess, but sorry if I say that.

1373
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:05,610
Greetings.

1374
01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:07,570
Hey, Greek.

1375
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:09,850
Hey, it's for horses, better for cows.

1376
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:10,410
How are you, man?

1377
01:22:11,090 --> 01:22:11,890
I'm good.

1378
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:15,270
I had a total change of subject.

1379
01:22:15,490 --> 01:22:20,270
I don't mean to take it too far away from what you were talking about.

1380
01:22:20,530 --> 01:22:25,530
But automobiles, basically, I know there are a lot of tricks that can be done that

1381
01:22:25,530 --> 01:22:28,890
don't even require new hardware or stuff to do in your car.

1382
01:22:29,370 --> 01:22:34,590
And I'm not specifically asking how to do it, but really, if these things are kind

1383
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:40,190
of pretty simple, is it just that car makers don't know about them or is it

1384
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:43,710
something more or less that we are not supposed to know about?

1385
01:22:46,430 --> 01:22:48,630
Well, here's the thing.

1386
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:52,310
Do you want the answer that people are used to hearing or do you want the answer

1387
01:22:52,310 --> 01:22:53,830
from actually dealing with those idiots?

1388
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:56,710
Can you do both?

1389
01:22:57,290 --> 01:22:57,550
Yeah.

1390
01:22:58,730 --> 01:23:03,450
Basically, if you talk to anyone that's outside on the market end of it, they're

1391
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:05,910
like, oh, this is the best that we're getting.

1392
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:09,390
That's why if you really want to prank the pranksters, you go to a car dealer.

1393
01:23:09,390 --> 01:23:11,730
And you ask them, is this the new car?

1394
01:23:11,830 --> 01:23:12,510
They're like, oh, yeah.

1395
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:14,630
Is it different than last year's?

1396
01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:15,150
Oh, yeah.

1397
01:23:15,870 --> 01:23:16,810
And I'm like, why?

1398
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:19,850
That means you guys just haven't figured out how to make them yet.

1399
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:23,110
You see, because it's based on vanity.

1400
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:26,770
Cars are based on contour, what they look like.

1401
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:28,410
It's the same junk inside.

1402
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:32,510
The best they can do with efficiency is about 20% right now.

1403
01:23:32,590 --> 01:23:33,550
25 tops.

1404
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:34,970
So diesels get better.

1405
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:40,290
So what's going on is when you have good intentions to work in the field.

1406
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:44,630
Now, let's switch over to well, actually, should we switch over?

1407
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:47,850
Do you want to talk about the modifications that have been flooded and

1408
01:23:47,850 --> 01:23:50,830
what people have been talking about making a car better on the typical

1409
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:55,570
Internet dummy load like HHO and little tornado thing that you can add?

1410
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:56,230
That sounds good.

1411
01:23:56,850 --> 01:23:57,190
Yeah, yeah.

1412
01:23:57,250 --> 01:23:59,050
OK, just to continue a bit more about how

1413
01:23:59,050 --> 01:24:03,890
the ridiculousness of cars, what's going on is that whenever there's

1414
01:24:03,890 --> 01:24:07,830
a desire, there's always an opportunity and when there's an opportunity,

1415
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:11,330
there's something called an opportunist and an opportunist.

1416
01:24:11,810 --> 01:24:12,750
Usually they're unlawful.

1417
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:13,670
How do I know they're unlawful?

1418
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:15,990
Because they're typical humans are unlawful.

1419
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:18,290
They'll take advantage and put out really

1420
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:20,130
shoddy products and things that don't work.

1421
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:21,050
And you have these phases.

1422
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:21,890
What's in vogue?

1423
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:24,450
So there's been many modifications and

1424
01:24:25,690 --> 01:24:27,750
actually criticism on these modifications.

1425
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:29,190
They're both good and bad.

1426
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:31,090
And actually, they never really pan out.

1427
01:24:31,090 --> 01:24:32,610
They tend to go away and they're thrown

1428
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:36,590
by the wayside and everyone relies on what the manufacturers are doing,

1429
01:24:36,690 --> 01:24:37,590
which is crap also.

1430
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:40,510
So that's a little bit more commentary on that.

1431
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:42,670
Now, we'll finally get to what we've

1432
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:45,330
discussed, perhaps in some in private to some degree.

1433
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:46,610
But let's just say this.

1434
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:50,370
And this ties into the discussion of the animals, because I did mention, by the way,

1435
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:54,210
that, you know, if you had a horse for

1436
01:24:54,210 --> 01:24:57,030
transportation, even though you didn't go anywhere for a week, you still have to feed

1437
01:24:57,030 --> 01:24:59,070
him, brush him, groom him and all that, water him.

1438
01:24:59,070 --> 01:25:01,750
Well, you can have what they call a car and it just sits there.

1439
01:25:01,870 --> 01:25:03,730
It's a lot cheaper, ultimately, isn't it?

1440
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:08,850
So it is a much better modality if you look at it strictly from that point of view.

1441
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:13,730
But now, if you want to look, let's go to the other side of what the car manufacturers do.

1442
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:17,710
The car manufacturers is really no such thing.

1443
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:21,230
It's an organization of people from designers to manufacturers to industrial

1444
01:25:21,230 --> 01:25:22,310
engineers. You get the idea.

1445
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:27,950
It's an army, battalions of people getting together, each doing different things.

1446
01:25:27,950 --> 01:25:32,210
Now, what ultimately the contour or what the car looks like or how it performs

1447
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:36,150
comes from the designer and engineer, typically originates there.

1448
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:39,910
And if you discuss anything with these guys, especially how they got into it,

1449
01:25:39,930 --> 01:25:41,130
they all have the good intentions.

1450
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:46,190
And once they get into the field, of course, they're accepted based on whatever

1451
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:48,390
merit they can, whatever they can produce, right?

1452
01:25:48,410 --> 01:25:51,730
They're placed in the field, you know, with the corporations to produce these

1453
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:54,230
things and design them actually before they're produced.

1454
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:59,710
And what they do is they start putting blinders and they start steering you into it.

1455
01:25:59,890 --> 01:26:04,190
You, first of all, if you've gone into the field, you've gotten a dummy load

1456
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:07,710
education from the university, and then you're going to be subject to certain

1457
01:26:07,710 --> 01:26:10,010
laboratories where you see how things physically work.

1458
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:12,690
And then now you have to make them different, not better.

1459
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:14,590
Just because something new doesn't mean it's better.

1460
01:26:14,690 --> 01:26:15,510
It just means it's different.

1461
01:26:16,110 --> 01:26:19,710
Now, what happens if the issue of efficiency comes up in the field?

1462
01:26:20,310 --> 01:26:23,730
They always throw into your face, if you're working in the field,

1463
01:26:23,730 --> 01:26:28,150
the EPA recommendations, you know, the environmental protection.

1464
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:30,110
Okay, so this is what we're looking for.

1465
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:35,250
And also how it will process the fuel that it's designed.

1466
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:40,950
Remember, remember, you're designing this engine for a particular type of fuel

1467
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:43,370
and how it addresses that fuel.

1468
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:46,310
And that's it, even though there's many other things.

1469
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:49,710
And here's a ridiculous statement that can be made, and you could play around

1470
01:26:49,710 --> 01:26:51,910
with engineers all day long, but they're not worth it.

1471
01:26:53,730 --> 01:26:56,970
Do you know that no one has ever burned gasoline in a car, ever?

1472
01:26:57,390 --> 01:26:58,490
You're like, that sounds ridiculous.

1473
01:26:59,270 --> 01:27:04,390
I mean, in other words, you don't put the gasoline in the car to burn it.

1474
01:27:05,010 --> 01:27:08,650
It sounds ridiculous, because Greek, if I run out of gas, it doesn't go anywhere, right?

1475
01:27:09,070 --> 01:27:12,570
Well, the reason you're putting the gasoline in is to burn the air,

1476
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:16,410
because you can substitute the gasoline with alcohol and hydrogen and all these

1477
01:27:16,410 --> 01:27:17,170
other things, right?

1478
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:20,870
So the purpose of doing that is burning the air, and they're telling you,

1479
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:22,410
you have to preserve all these mixtures.

1480
01:27:22,410 --> 01:27:26,230
And so they're putting blind spots on these people that are working there.

1481
01:27:26,350 --> 01:27:32,190
And eventually, if you have a sprained leg or a broken leg and you walk with a crutch,

1482
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:36,450
that's fine, but once it heals and you continue walking with a crutch for five

1483
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:40,370
or ten years, it starts to atrophy, and you'll never probably be able to walk

1484
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:43,970
on it after a certain point when the bone mass starts to disappear, you see?

1485
01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:47,410
So these engineers have no bone mass left anymore.

1486
01:27:47,490 --> 01:27:50,950
They've got nothing, and they just sit there, and they do what they're told.

1487
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:52,770
Why?

1488
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:58,710
Because they're accommodating, again, the mindset that gas makes cars go,

1489
01:27:59,350 --> 01:28:00,170
meaning gasoline.

1490
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:03,850
In many countries, if you go to South America, it'll be alcohol, for example,

1491
01:28:03,950 --> 01:28:05,630
in Brazil and places like that, right?

1492
01:28:06,190 --> 01:28:13,770
So I would suggest that you will notice this modality of dumbing up and limiting

1493
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:18,690
the people that work in the field in any field, Wes, not just in the automotive.

1494
01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:23,410
Now, there are many stories that I will share in the future about how many

1495
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:27,850
anomalous things are being discovered or have been discovered through the past

1496
01:28:27,850 --> 01:28:31,770
working with what they call reciprocating motors or combustion engines that had

1497
01:28:31,770 --> 01:28:35,470
never really made it to the field, and you've heard about the 200-mile-per-gallon

1498
01:28:35,470 --> 01:28:36,670
carburetors and all that.

1499
01:28:37,550 --> 01:28:42,610
That was very simple to do back then when the formula of the fuel was a certain way.

1500
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:45,350
What they did was they changed the formula so it became thicker,

1501
01:28:45,430 --> 01:28:46,290
and they couldn't use it.

1502
01:28:46,290 --> 01:28:50,890
But essentially, from, let's say you called in because you have an interest

1503
01:28:50,890 --> 01:28:53,970
of certain things, and we've spoken in private, and I'll share this with everyone,

1504
01:28:54,770 --> 01:28:59,530
is that what you are now discovering is we had a discussion about increasing

1505
01:28:59,530 --> 01:29:05,710
the available vacuum to the combustion part of the engine for increasing

1506
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:07,350
efficiency or really changing it.

1507
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:12,430
Just changing the amount of vacuum that is available to the engine radically

1508
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:13,650
changes the engine, correct?

1509
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:14,890
Have you discovered that firsthand?

1510
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:20,030
Yes, and I'd like to actually, well, share with you, you can continue,

1511
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:24,790
but I figured something out that was causing the issue, and it surprised me.

1512
01:29:25,070 --> 01:29:29,610
You had some negative issues along the way, but yeah, this might be something, yes.

1513
01:29:30,030 --> 01:29:33,910
Yeah, it was the, I have a gauge, right, that I plugged into the OBD,

1514
01:29:34,350 --> 01:29:39,430
and I've kept it plugged in, and this last time, like after so many times,

1515
01:29:39,470 --> 01:29:42,530
I would start in the car, and it would like, a check light would come on,

1516
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:45,970
okay, one more time, after doing some changes or whatever.

1517
01:29:46,370 --> 01:29:50,310
Started up, it was going great, and it just so happened when I started it up again,

1518
01:29:50,670 --> 01:29:51,950
the gauge was just off.

1519
01:29:52,230 --> 01:29:55,030
I'm like, oh, that's funny, so I unplugged it and plugged it back into the car.

1520
01:29:55,230 --> 01:29:59,550
As soon as I did that, check engine light came on, and then the car started doing

1521
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:03,270
weird things, and then just like, and then I realized this whole time,

1522
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:04,410
it's been this gauge.

1523
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:07,610
I didn't know it had any effect on the car at all.

1524
01:30:07,630 --> 01:30:08,690
I just thought it took readings.

1525
01:30:11,170 --> 01:30:12,810
Okay, and it was the gauge.

1526
01:30:13,630 --> 01:30:15,890
So in other words, there was a two-way street going on.

1527
01:30:16,730 --> 01:30:20,790
Right, maybe somehow the gauge was synced to a time when it wasn't working,

1528
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:23,850
and I don't know, I haven't looked much more into that,

1529
01:30:23,930 --> 01:30:25,890
but it was definitely the gauge.

1530
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:32,390
You say definitely because you've worked, okay, so in other words,

1531
01:30:32,450 --> 01:30:35,950
you say definitely because it's, in other words, if you plug it in,

1532
01:30:35,950 --> 01:30:38,610
it comes back, and if you unplug it, it goes away, so it's definite.

1533
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:39,090
Okay, good.

1534
01:30:39,490 --> 01:30:41,130
Yeah, pretty much.

1535
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:42,210
Okay, interesting.

1536
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:46,870
So now you're on your path again, and you perhaps might report back,

1537
01:30:47,010 --> 01:30:51,610
and I would like to report more on how to modify,

1538
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:56,610
and perhaps since you've called in, maybe you will make more public experiences,

1539
01:30:57,650 --> 01:31:01,250
appearances regarding these experiences, and we could continue down the path

1540
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:05,170
of perhaps vocalizing publicly how to make these things work better

1541
01:31:05,170 --> 01:31:08,810
for those that tend to be adventurous and know how to operate a screwdriver and a wrench.

1542
01:31:09,610 --> 01:31:09,850
Absolutely.

1543
01:31:11,010 --> 01:31:14,850
Yeah, but so far the concept of what we're discussing

1544
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:19,450
and the primary source being vacuum or the motive force, let's say,

1545
01:31:20,070 --> 01:31:23,710
you're finding that to be true, and it's contrary and counterintuitive

1546
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:26,690
to what has been taught or what you've experienced to be on what's called

1547
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:28,250
the World Wide Web and other mechanics.

1548
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:30,690
Yes, along that same note,

1549
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:36,470
if you were to be pulled over or something, and they saw this,

1550
01:31:36,990 --> 01:31:41,350
would it be an illegal modification or would it just be weird to them?

1551
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:42,470
Not at all.

1552
01:31:42,590 --> 01:31:43,630
It's not even considered.

1553
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:44,350
It's so minor.

1554
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:48,270
Well, illegal just means that that's the legal society.

1555
01:31:48,710 --> 01:31:50,350
There is no right and wrong with them.

1556
01:31:50,410 --> 01:31:54,610
They're just waiting for you to see what you do so they can monetize it and blame you.

1557
01:31:55,930 --> 01:31:57,790
I think I've discussed what they represent.

1558
01:31:57,970 --> 01:32:00,390
They represent spiritual forces on the Earth.

1559
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:02,830
And they won't be around in the future, fortunately.

1560
01:32:03,730 --> 01:32:05,710
It's not that mankind's going to change that.

1561
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:06,810
The gods are going to do it.

1562
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:11,870
Because you can't change it because 90% of the population of the Earth

1563
01:32:11,870 --> 01:32:14,230
pursues what they do, if not more.

1564
01:32:14,830 --> 01:32:17,390
And that's why 90% of them won't be here, one of the reasons.

1565
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:20,070
So that is an interesting concept.

1566
01:32:20,390 --> 01:32:21,890
No, I wouldn't be concerned about that.

1567
01:32:21,970 --> 01:32:25,390
And if there is anything that has any legal constraint like that,

1568
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:26,190
I always let people...

1569
01:32:26,190 --> 01:32:29,590
Actually, I wouldn't communicate it because that creates a liability, doesn't it?

1570
01:32:30,650 --> 01:32:31,870
Of course, yes.

1571
01:32:32,350 --> 01:32:33,250
So, yeah.

1572
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:39,790
Actually, the most illegal thing you could do is have a car run without any fuel at all.

1573
01:32:39,890 --> 01:32:40,890
Oops, did I just say that?

1574
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:41,770
Okay.

1575
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:42,470
Yeah.

1576
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:47,670
I just worry if I take it into the shop to get an oil change and they see it,

1577
01:32:47,730 --> 01:32:50,110
they're going to think, oh, I better fix this, you know,

1578
01:32:50,150 --> 01:32:52,670
without telling me, thinking they're doing me a favor or something.

1579
01:32:53,470 --> 01:32:54,070
That's fine.

1580
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:55,670
It's so simple.

1581
01:32:55,670 --> 01:33:00,910
Well, it's really just one little tiny minuscule hose disconnected and capped off.

1582
01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:01,570
That's all it is.

1583
01:33:01,630 --> 01:33:03,510
It's just basically removing...

1584
01:33:03,510 --> 01:33:07,910
The original aspect of that was that was originally designed to work that way

1585
01:33:07,910 --> 01:33:11,390
when engines were developed on the benchtop, right?

1586
01:33:11,790 --> 01:33:16,710
And when they decided to keep that feature when they manufactured and put it in the field.

1587
01:33:17,310 --> 01:33:22,770
And when you are starting to send the vacuum into the other side of the engine,

1588
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:26,550
you get blow-by and you're getting strong vacuum where you don't...

1589
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:27,570
The engine doesn't want it.

1590
01:33:27,650 --> 01:33:30,430
The engine just wants to relieve extra pressure.

1591
01:33:31,130 --> 01:33:33,010
It doesn't want to be sucked on like that.

1592
01:33:33,130 --> 01:33:37,990
So, what we'll discuss perhaps in the future endeavor, sonically,

1593
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:40,910
in great detail on that, and in the meantime,

1594
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:45,510
you and I will privately be communicating on how to further this along

1595
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:50,970
and have you as a testimonial testbed where you can vocalize.

1596
01:33:50,970 --> 01:33:53,490
It sounds like you can communicate what's going on

1597
01:33:53,490 --> 01:33:56,770
and we'll go through several things as you find them to be applicable.

1598
01:33:58,310 --> 01:33:59,630
Yeah, if that's okay.

1599
01:33:59,750 --> 01:34:04,030
And I would like for you to report back as you have been on the progress on it.

1600
01:34:04,110 --> 01:34:09,770
Because many people may not consider automobiles to be the first thing

1601
01:34:09,770 --> 01:34:12,370
that they want to, let's say, play around with to make better.

1602
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:13,470
But you know what?

1603
01:34:13,490 --> 01:34:15,870
I said many people don't, but there are many people that do.

1604
01:34:16,450 --> 01:34:19,570
There are many people that are concerned about how automobiles work

1605
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:20,450
and how to make them better.

1606
01:34:21,010 --> 01:34:24,410
Because intuitively, you figured out that you're being scammed, aren't you?

1607
01:34:25,730 --> 01:34:27,950
I mean, if you look at how cars were made

1608
01:34:27,950 --> 01:34:30,610
or what they call automobiles or motorized wagons,

1609
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:32,910
you know how like right now, for example,

1610
01:34:33,170 --> 01:34:36,670
there is a boom with Tesla Motors, not to plug them,

1611
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:40,070
but the electric movement and all that with the cars.

1612
01:34:40,230 --> 01:34:43,730
If you do some research, back in the 1920s and 30s,

1613
01:34:43,810 --> 01:34:46,350
one third of the cars on the road were already electric.

1614
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:53,350
And if you actually look at the, let's say, the overall range of them now,

1615
01:34:53,430 --> 01:34:58,450
I think there are 250 on average, maybe 150 to 200 conservatively.

1616
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:00,450
I mean, realistically, with a load.

1617
01:35:00,990 --> 01:35:04,470
And some of them can go up to 300, 400 miles on a charge,

1618
01:35:04,510 --> 01:35:05,730
I should say, for an electric car.

1619
01:35:06,590 --> 01:35:06,690
Okay.

1620
01:35:06,930 --> 01:35:08,950
Back in the 1930s, you could look this up.

1621
01:35:09,010 --> 01:35:11,270
There was a competition on developing a car

1622
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:13,290
to have a 1,000-mile range on one charge,

1623
01:35:13,330 --> 01:35:14,450
and they accomplished that.

1624
01:35:15,190 --> 01:35:19,190
We're talking almost 90 years ago now, 80-something years ago.

1625
01:35:19,950 --> 01:35:23,490
So, didn't I just say earlier that newer is not better, it's just different?

1626
01:35:24,770 --> 01:35:26,970
So, these are things to consider.

1627
01:35:28,910 --> 01:35:32,150
And electricity doesn't even work the way that we're being told.

1628
01:35:32,230 --> 01:35:34,330
That is a whole other concept.

1629
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:36,750
So, yeah, I do appreciate you.

1630
01:35:36,830 --> 01:35:37,550
Anything else?

1631
01:35:37,710 --> 01:35:39,650
I mean, whoever, yeah.

1632
01:35:39,790 --> 01:35:40,010
Sure.

1633
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:43,930
Like, Schauberger, a lot of the stuff that,

1634
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:47,370
I know you say that a lot of the stuff we find out now

1635
01:35:47,370 --> 01:35:48,950
might not be true or whatever,

1636
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:52,730
but I know he did have a lot of stuff with vacuum,

1637
01:35:52,930 --> 01:35:54,930
and he watched fish and stuff like that.

1638
01:35:55,530 --> 01:36:01,830
And does that somehow coincide with kind of how a car engine works?

1639
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:03,230
I mean, we're talking about vacuum here,

1640
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:05,630
and just like a closed or open system, whatever.

1641
01:36:07,070 --> 01:36:10,670
Does it correlate, kind of translate to what he was getting into

1642
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:13,870
and discovering about energy?

1643
01:36:14,670 --> 01:36:16,050
Yes, but here's the thing.

1644
01:36:16,150 --> 01:36:17,850
Have you heard any of the other sonic events

1645
01:36:17,850 --> 01:36:19,590
where it discussed how the human body works

1646
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:21,270
and how you're under a slight vacuum already?

1647
01:36:21,790 --> 01:36:22,810
A biological vacuum?

1648
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:23,550
Yes.

1649
01:36:23,730 --> 01:36:24,910
And nothing goes in and out?

1650
01:36:25,550 --> 01:36:27,410
And anything that appears to be coming out

1651
01:36:27,410 --> 01:36:29,730
is actually produced on the membrane surface of that,

1652
01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:30,690
just like plant roots.

1653
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:33,350
If you pull out a plant, it's a healthy plant,

1654
01:36:33,350 --> 01:36:37,210
and you wash the roots and spray the roots with a mister,

1655
01:36:37,370 --> 01:36:39,310
a water mister, does it soak in like a sponge

1656
01:36:39,310 --> 01:36:42,910
or does the water bead up on the roots like a freshly waxed car?

1657
01:36:43,410 --> 01:36:43,790
The latter.

1658
01:36:44,230 --> 01:36:44,810
It's hydrophobic.

1659
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:47,070
So everything is sealed up.

1660
01:36:47,350 --> 01:36:51,530
So the concept of the Victor Schauberger is misunderstood,

1661
01:36:51,950 --> 01:36:52,790
because if you notice,

1662
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:56,330
you can go on hundreds if not thousands of sites

1663
01:36:56,330 --> 01:36:58,650
or mentions online and they're all parroting each other.

1664
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:00,610
I think these people need crackers.

1665
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:02,090
You get it?

1666
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:02,890
Parrots, you know?

1667
01:37:02,890 --> 01:37:05,370
So they missed the point.

1668
01:37:05,530 --> 01:37:06,730
And even here's the interesting thing,

1669
01:37:06,790 --> 01:37:08,550
if you've studied Schauberger a little bit,

1670
01:37:08,890 --> 01:37:11,790
he also said everyone around him is missing the point.

1671
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:13,250
Have you ever recalled reading that?

1672
01:37:14,950 --> 01:37:15,470
Yes.

1673
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:16,370
Okay.

1674
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:17,690
He was very frustrated,

1675
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:19,930
and Wilhelm Reich and other people,

1676
01:37:20,030 --> 01:37:20,830
and Tesla and others,

1677
01:37:21,150 --> 01:37:22,510
everyone is missing the point.

1678
01:37:22,650 --> 01:37:25,810
Everyone meaning everyone that he's come in contact with at large.

1679
01:37:26,330 --> 01:37:26,850
Yes.

1680
01:37:27,430 --> 01:37:29,750
And there are a few people known as protégés

1681
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:30,890
and others that have come around,

1682
01:37:30,890 --> 01:37:35,650
but the mass success of this is not going to happen

1683
01:37:35,650 --> 01:37:37,090
in this society, by the way.

1684
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:40,030
But it doesn't mean that there are few that can master it

1685
01:37:40,030 --> 01:37:41,950
or learn about it,

1686
01:37:42,030 --> 01:37:47,010
because first it's the inspiration to go in that direction,

1687
01:37:47,110 --> 01:37:49,870
because you can go to many people discussing implosion,

1688
01:37:50,090 --> 01:37:51,950
vacuum, Victor Schauberger, Tesla,

1689
01:37:52,150 --> 01:37:53,630
and they don't want to hear it, right?

1690
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:54,890
So there's no inspiration there.

1691
01:37:55,330 --> 01:37:57,610
Those that are inspired, then they will get the ideas,

1692
01:37:57,690 --> 01:37:58,690
and then they need the knowledge

1693
01:37:58,690 --> 01:38:00,170
so they don't have to reinvent the wheel.

1694
01:38:00,170 --> 01:38:02,710
Then they need to be directed so it's done properly

1695
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:04,750
so they don't have all failure, right?

1696
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:07,750
Because all failure is very intimidating, discouraging.

1697
01:38:08,270 --> 01:38:10,830
And then you build it up, and you go and you go and you go.

1698
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:13,030
And these people are very hard to find.

1699
01:38:13,110 --> 01:38:13,790
They're not around.

1700
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:16,490
As a matter of fact, I used to say,

1701
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:18,850
I'd like to interview, perhaps,

1702
01:38:18,950 --> 01:38:23,410
there's a possibility since I'm doing these public sonic things,

1703
01:38:23,550 --> 01:38:24,350
to interview someone,

1704
01:38:24,410 --> 01:38:26,710
but everyone that I think worth interviewing is dead.

1705
01:38:27,330 --> 01:38:28,170
What does that tell you?

1706
01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:30,370
What do you do now?

1707
01:38:30,710 --> 01:38:33,650
They've all died, and some of them even more recently.

1708
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:36,110
So there is a time that's coming

1709
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:38,570
where these things will be known, and they will reemerge.

1710
01:38:39,130 --> 01:38:40,670
But again, like I've mentioned,

1711
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:43,210
I'm going to be involved in a sonic endeavor

1712
01:38:43,210 --> 01:38:44,870
that's going to be either launched here

1713
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:46,090
or somewhere else or somehow

1714
01:38:47,150 --> 01:38:49,430
where all this information can be put together.

1715
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:50,690
And let me just, before we continue,

1716
01:38:50,810 --> 01:38:51,690
you brought up Schauberger.

1717
01:38:53,030 --> 01:38:55,830
You ever notice, let me just throw this little bit out,

1718
01:38:55,830 --> 01:38:59,430
a little gem or a pearl for whoever's really listening.

1719
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:02,410
And perhaps you as well, Wes.

1720
01:39:03,630 --> 01:39:05,490
If you look at Schauberger's devices,

1721
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:08,110
one thing you'll find that they all had in common is what?

1722
01:39:08,230 --> 01:39:09,110
And I'll answer it for you.

1723
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:09,930
They all ran at what?

1724
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:11,710
Very high speeds, didn't they?

1725
01:39:12,770 --> 01:39:13,210
Yes.

1726
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:14,850
Very high.

1727
01:39:14,930 --> 01:39:17,990
I mean, in the tens of thousands was normal.

1728
01:39:18,530 --> 01:39:21,590
You know, 10,000, 20,000, some 30,000 RPM.

1729
01:39:22,650 --> 01:39:23,090
Right?

1730
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:25,430
When you consider how things, how fast things spin,

1731
01:39:25,850 --> 01:39:28,510
you know, your average electric motor is 1,500 to 3,000,

1732
01:39:28,610 --> 01:39:30,590
and that seems like really wicked fast, doesn't it?

1733
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:30,790
Right?

1734
01:39:30,850 --> 01:39:33,330
That's really slow compared to what Schauberger was looking for.

1735
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:36,490
Why is it important that these high speeds were attained

1736
01:39:36,490 --> 01:39:38,590
or maintained in order to see these effects?

1737
01:39:39,810 --> 01:39:41,090
Okay, I'll answer for you.

1738
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:41,990
And this is the tidbit.

1739
01:39:42,630 --> 01:39:45,530
It's because it's a concept called resonance.

1740
01:39:46,290 --> 01:39:46,530
Right?

1741
01:39:46,570 --> 01:39:48,890
When two things resonate with each other,

1742
01:39:48,930 --> 01:39:50,830
then they communicate energetically, don't they?

1743
01:39:51,450 --> 01:39:51,630
Okay?

1744
01:39:51,830 --> 01:39:51,930
Yeah.

1745
01:39:51,930 --> 01:39:54,870
All right, now, if you look at, for example,

1746
01:39:56,230 --> 01:39:56,950
how fast...

1747
01:39:56,950 --> 01:39:58,350
See, you're standing stationary,

1748
01:39:58,690 --> 01:40:00,990
but, you know, the Earth is moving very, very, very fast.

1749
01:40:01,410 --> 01:40:06,330
I think it's 66,666 miles per hour around the sun

1750
01:40:06,330 --> 01:40:07,190
or something like that.

1751
01:40:07,370 --> 01:40:08,650
It's funny how I brought that up, right?

1752
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:10,650
Okay, so...

1753
01:40:10,650 --> 01:40:12,790
It might be a little off, but that's roughly it.

1754
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:14,450
Or roughly, you know, the Earth is spinning

1755
01:40:14,450 --> 01:40:16,410
at roughly 1,000 miles per hour, isn't it?

1756
01:40:16,890 --> 01:40:17,090
Yeah.

1757
01:40:17,170 --> 01:40:19,330
Now, isn't that about 1,000 feet per second?

1758
01:40:20,650 --> 01:40:21,010
Yep.

1759
01:40:21,670 --> 01:40:22,110
Roughly?

1760
01:40:22,910 --> 01:40:23,350
Roughly.

1761
01:40:23,950 --> 01:40:24,570
Yeah, okay.

1762
01:40:24,910 --> 01:40:27,750
Now, when you have one of those turbines

1763
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:29,010
that Schauberger was building,

1764
01:40:29,210 --> 01:40:31,870
and it was going, let's say, at 20,000 RPM,

1765
01:40:32,330 --> 01:40:34,770
if you cut it loose and let it roll down the sidewalk,

1766
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:35,890
don't you think it would be covering

1767
01:40:35,890 --> 01:40:37,290
about 1,000 feet per second?

1768
01:40:38,110 --> 01:40:38,450
Yes.

1769
01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:41,290
It's funny you say cut it loose, you use that term.

1770
01:40:41,990 --> 01:40:42,490
Uh-huh.

1771
01:40:42,530 --> 01:40:45,970
Because isn't it something about how it's not really

1772
01:40:46,490 --> 01:40:47,990
moving in the way that we think it is?

1773
01:40:48,090 --> 01:40:50,230
It's actually kind of being taken there?

1774
01:40:50,890 --> 01:40:51,690
What's happening...

1775
01:40:51,690 --> 01:40:52,490
Let's just throw this...

1776
01:40:52,490 --> 01:40:53,290
You're ready to turn...

1777
01:40:53,290 --> 01:40:55,650
Let's just turn some minds inside out like a sock.

1778
01:40:56,090 --> 01:40:56,250
Okay.

1779
01:40:56,490 --> 01:40:57,570
You appear to be stationary,

1780
01:40:57,970 --> 01:41:00,670
but to someone who's normally moving 1,000 miles an hour,

1781
01:41:00,750 --> 01:41:02,690
you appear to be moving very fast, don't you?

1782
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:03,650
Yes.

1783
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:05,270
Because you just whisk...

1784
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:07,050
Even though you ever go in a really fast car,

1785
01:41:07,130 --> 01:41:07,630
look across...

1786
01:41:07,630 --> 01:41:09,510
Everything's moving really fast, isn't it?

1787
01:41:09,570 --> 01:41:12,250
So, I once spoke to someone who was a pilot,

1788
01:41:12,410 --> 01:41:14,350
and he was going supersonic near the ground,

1789
01:41:14,390 --> 01:41:15,130
and he says...

1790
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:18,290
He said that light poles were...

1791
01:41:18,290 --> 01:41:19,450
Looked like picket fences.

1792
01:41:20,370 --> 01:41:21,990
That's how fast he was passing them.

1793
01:41:22,330 --> 01:41:22,730
So...

1794
01:41:23,230 --> 01:41:25,990
Yeah, I think that's such a funny song, by the way, too.

1795
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:27,110
Yeah, okay.

1796
01:41:27,410 --> 01:41:27,870
All right, there you go.

1797
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:31,710
So, what happens here is when Schauberger attained

1798
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:34,490
his ultra-high speed, or relative ultra-high speed,

1799
01:41:34,790 --> 01:41:36,870
it appeared to be stationary to the Earth,

1800
01:41:37,530 --> 01:41:38,890
even though it was very fast to you,

1801
01:41:39,410 --> 01:41:40,650
meaning that if you put your finger there,

1802
01:41:40,670 --> 01:41:41,810
you wouldn't have a finger, right?

1803
01:41:42,110 --> 01:41:43,650
But when it reached that speed,

1804
01:41:43,730 --> 01:41:47,050
it appeared to be at parity with the Earth's speed,

1805
01:41:47,050 --> 01:41:49,890
and now what it did was it coupled into the energy

1806
01:41:49,890 --> 01:41:51,210
that the Earth is coupled into.

1807
01:41:52,410 --> 01:41:54,730
Just like, you know, everything...

1808
01:41:54,730 --> 01:41:57,150
The Earth is moving 1,000 miles per hour, let's say,

1809
01:41:57,370 --> 01:42:00,810
and that's moving 60 times faster than that around the Sun,

1810
01:42:00,870 --> 01:42:03,730
and the Sun is moving about 3,000 times faster than that

1811
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:04,650
through here.

1812
01:42:05,230 --> 01:42:06,990
Do you know that if you stopped something,

1813
01:42:07,550 --> 01:42:09,010
if you had the ability to ground,

1814
01:42:09,110 --> 01:42:10,750
let's say, an ordinary object in the room

1815
01:42:10,750 --> 01:42:11,530
that you're in right now,

1816
01:42:12,450 --> 01:42:14,810
ground it and stop it from all those other motions

1817
01:42:14,810 --> 01:42:16,750
that it would be so energetic

1818
01:42:16,750 --> 01:42:19,290
that it would probably create a nuclear explosion?

1819
01:42:19,890 --> 01:42:20,130
You see?

1820
01:42:21,110 --> 01:42:22,530
So, I don't know if you're still here.

1821
01:42:22,890 --> 01:42:23,910
No, no, I am, I am.

1822
01:42:24,270 --> 01:42:24,450
Yeah.

1823
01:42:24,830 --> 01:42:26,730
You see, if you, let's say, stop the pencil

1824
01:42:26,730 --> 01:42:31,290
from the movement of the Earth relative to the movement of the Sun

1825
01:42:31,290 --> 01:42:33,210
and relative to the movement of the Sun

1826
01:42:33,210 --> 01:42:34,510
through what's called space,

1827
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:36,750
that pencil would be going, you know,

1828
01:42:36,930 --> 01:42:39,650
tens and even 100,000 miles per hour.

1829
01:42:40,050 --> 01:42:40,270
Right.

1830
01:42:40,290 --> 01:42:42,790
If you could just harness that pencil for half a second,

1831
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:44,850
that would be enough to, you know,

1832
01:42:44,850 --> 01:42:46,530
pretty much run a city for a week.

1833
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:48,490
So, it almost makes you question

1834
01:42:48,490 --> 01:42:50,770
if we're being told that everything's happening

1835
01:42:50,770 --> 01:42:51,570
in the way we're told.

1836
01:42:52,470 --> 01:42:52,770
Yes.

1837
01:42:53,230 --> 01:42:54,830
You're censored, basically.

1838
01:42:55,010 --> 01:42:56,690
Humanity is being censored from this.

1839
01:42:56,770 --> 01:42:58,330
And when you do find out about it, it'll be,

1840
01:42:58,410 --> 01:42:59,070
oh, no big deal,

1841
01:42:59,450 --> 01:43:02,410
because when humanity does find out how to manipulate

1842
01:43:02,410 --> 01:43:03,690
and actually, when they say manipulate,

1843
01:43:03,790 --> 01:43:05,590
meaning handle using the hand,

1844
01:43:06,790 --> 01:43:09,050
these things, you will be in a different state

1845
01:43:09,050 --> 01:43:10,610
where these things now will be secondary

1846
01:43:10,610 --> 01:43:12,630
where now they seem primary, right?

1847
01:43:12,690 --> 01:43:13,670
Because the primary, because, you know,

1848
01:43:13,670 --> 01:43:15,610
you've got to pay for energy, you know,

1849
01:43:15,650 --> 01:43:17,430
all these things, you know, wearing you down,

1850
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:18,790
they seem oppressive sometimes.

1851
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:22,070
But when humans or people go to the next level,

1852
01:43:22,630 --> 01:43:23,870
this concept of free energy

1853
01:43:23,870 --> 01:43:26,010
or tapping into the universal energy is,

1854
01:43:26,170 --> 01:43:27,010
you will have that,

1855
01:43:27,070 --> 01:43:29,370
but it won't be as big of a deal as if you had it now.

1856
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:31,090
It'll be in its own time.

1857
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:32,770
It's kind of like if you're four years old,

1858
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:33,650
you want a fire truck,

1859
01:43:33,690 --> 01:43:36,130
and you get a real fire truck, a real one.

1860
01:43:36,450 --> 01:43:38,690
You know, somehow it's modified so you can operate it.

1861
01:43:38,710 --> 01:43:39,610
Is that a good thing?

1862
01:43:41,190 --> 01:43:41,550
No.

1863
01:43:41,730 --> 01:43:42,290
Well, to who?

1864
01:43:42,290 --> 01:43:43,150
It's good for you,

1865
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:44,910
but is it good to everyone around you?

1866
01:43:45,770 --> 01:43:46,290
Probably not.

1867
01:43:46,350 --> 01:43:46,990
Not really.

1868
01:43:47,750 --> 01:43:49,070
So let's be objective,

1869
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:50,350
and I always discuss this,

1870
01:43:50,470 --> 01:43:51,870
but there are many things,

1871
01:43:52,650 --> 01:43:54,650
you know, I also bring up the metaphor,

1872
01:43:54,890 --> 01:43:56,070
you know, someone went to an ashram,

1873
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:56,810
wants to meditate,

1874
01:43:56,950 --> 01:43:58,590
and this guru supposedly was very good

1875
01:43:58,590 --> 01:43:59,830
to helping people see the light.

1876
01:44:00,250 --> 01:44:01,470
And he told you if you sat here

1877
01:44:01,470 --> 01:44:03,610
and you meditated on these particular concepts,

1878
01:44:03,790 --> 01:44:05,990
if you saw the light, you got to that level.

1879
01:44:06,430 --> 01:44:08,250
So one day, you know, a student did that,

1880
01:44:09,090 --> 01:44:10,610
and he joined this ashram,

1881
01:44:10,670 --> 01:44:11,990
and he did that for three or four months,

1882
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:12,950
and he meditates diligently,

1883
01:44:13,710 --> 01:44:15,550
and he's in this meditative state,

1884
01:44:15,610 --> 01:44:16,610
and he sees this bright light,

1885
01:44:16,710 --> 01:44:18,210
and he jumps up and he tells the guru,

1886
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:20,750
he says, yes, I see the light, I see the light,

1887
01:44:20,850 --> 01:44:21,850
I finally see what you're saying.

1888
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:23,290
And you know what the guru told him?

1889
01:44:24,430 --> 01:44:26,710
He said, oh, don't worry, you'll get over it.

1890
01:44:29,650 --> 01:44:30,010
Right?

1891
01:44:31,030 --> 01:44:32,710
So this is what's going on.

1892
01:44:33,130 --> 01:44:34,870
It's like, here's the thing,

1893
01:44:34,930 --> 01:44:37,030
those that know how to do this tapping,

1894
01:44:37,210 --> 01:44:38,050
they just don't do it.

1895
01:44:38,490 --> 01:44:39,210
They don't do it,

1896
01:44:39,250 --> 01:44:41,070
because in order to get to that level

1897
01:44:41,070 --> 01:44:43,130
of know how to do it, you have to be objective enough

1898
01:44:43,130 --> 01:44:44,550
to know what's going on around you.

1899
01:44:45,750 --> 01:44:47,390
And when you know what's going on around you,

1900
01:44:47,410 --> 01:44:48,310
you don't do these things,

1901
01:44:48,430 --> 01:44:51,130
because it's better off to kind of sit back

1902
01:44:51,130 --> 01:44:52,510
and chill like everybody else,

1903
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:54,610
because it's going to draw too much attention,

1904
01:44:54,650 --> 01:44:56,190
unless you think it's time to check out.

1905
01:44:57,470 --> 01:44:59,090
Yeah, so is that, is that,

1906
01:44:59,110 --> 01:45:01,210
I don't know, it's the wrong word,

1907
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:02,170
it would probably be ego,

1908
01:45:02,490 --> 01:45:04,110
but is it something like ego?

1909
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:05,730
No, it's not ego.

1910
01:45:05,830 --> 01:45:06,850
Ego is, that's Freud,

1911
01:45:06,870 --> 01:45:08,530
all that stuff that people use is Freudian.

1912
01:45:09,330 --> 01:45:11,150
When a lot of people use ego,

1913
01:45:11,310 --> 01:45:14,430
I would say it as being like a self-centered, arrogant,

1914
01:45:15,030 --> 01:45:18,790
you know, too much into what your needs are.

1915
01:45:19,310 --> 01:45:20,150
Well, I guess I'm just,

1916
01:45:20,270 --> 01:45:23,450
I just mean the kind of like the ability

1917
01:45:23,450 --> 01:45:27,490
to not be taken away by emotions,

1918
01:45:28,190 --> 01:45:29,210
or, you know what I mean,

1919
01:45:29,390 --> 01:45:33,490
a grandeur, or just something crazy like that,

1920
01:45:33,550 --> 01:45:35,430
like seeing the light, you know what I mean?

1921
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:37,730
Is it, what's, what is that

1922
01:45:37,730 --> 01:45:39,470
that keeps that in control, you know?

1923
01:45:39,590 --> 01:45:40,750
Oh, the cosmic censorship.

1924
01:45:41,730 --> 01:45:42,070
I see.

1925
01:45:42,570 --> 01:45:44,490
There's many, there's many levels of censorship.

1926
01:45:44,730 --> 01:45:45,470
Do you know that one,

1927
01:45:45,770 --> 01:45:47,250
a decision you made yesterday

1928
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:49,570
affects your life today, for example, doesn't it?

1929
01:45:50,230 --> 01:45:50,670
Yes.

1930
01:45:50,850 --> 01:45:52,770
But, but the general consensus is,

1931
01:45:52,810 --> 01:45:55,590
I give the metaphor of surface-dwelling earth inhabitants,

1932
01:45:55,710 --> 01:45:56,350
your average human,

1933
01:45:56,790 --> 01:45:58,590
is that you're all on this cruise ship

1934
01:45:58,590 --> 01:46:00,950
leaving, let's say England, going to New York.

1935
01:46:01,890 --> 01:46:04,450
That's, that's the, that's the plan for humanity.

1936
01:46:04,610 --> 01:46:06,890
Now, that cannot be changed.

1937
01:46:06,890 --> 01:46:08,710
Now, but while you're on this cruise ship,

1938
01:46:08,770 --> 01:46:10,030
all seven billion of you tourists,

1939
01:46:10,170 --> 01:46:12,530
you have an ability to go anywhere you want on the ship.

1940
01:46:12,670 --> 01:46:13,350
You know, you have your cabin,

1941
01:46:13,450 --> 01:46:14,330
you have to go to the deck,

1942
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:15,950
ski, you know, you go to the theater,

1943
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:17,630
go to, okay, but you're,

1944
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:19,830
but everyone is going to New York.

1945
01:46:20,710 --> 01:46:23,130
And the state of affairs of humanity

1946
01:46:23,130 --> 01:46:24,250
and all this right now,

1947
01:46:24,510 --> 01:46:25,870
everyone is going to this point

1948
01:46:25,870 --> 01:46:27,630
because the decisions that were made

1949
01:46:27,630 --> 01:46:28,930
a long, long time ago.

1950
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:30,770
Part of the cosmic censorship

1951
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:34,050
is the adherence to modernism

1952
01:46:34,050 --> 01:46:35,550
and how wonderful that is.

1953
01:46:35,550 --> 01:46:38,190
And if you do some research on ancient civilizations

1954
01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:40,130
that are now considered to be a fallen,

1955
01:46:40,910 --> 01:46:42,110
if you look at their literature,

1956
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:43,550
what's preserved of it,

1957
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:46,490
they've always, before they fell from prominence,

1958
01:46:46,530 --> 01:46:48,810
they always described themselves as being what?

1959
01:46:49,550 --> 01:46:50,070
Modern.

1960
01:46:51,050 --> 01:46:54,270
Doesn't this society describe itself as being modern?

1961
01:46:54,730 --> 01:46:56,750
And no one is paying any attention.

1962
01:46:56,890 --> 01:46:58,270
If you look at the world's fairs

1963
01:46:58,270 --> 01:47:01,890
that were held in the 30s, 40s, and 50s of the last century,

1964
01:47:02,330 --> 01:47:04,510
didn't they promise you flying cars by the 1990s

1965
01:47:04,510 --> 01:47:07,410
and a hotel on the moon by the year 2000 or so?

1966
01:47:07,730 --> 01:47:08,290
Where is that?

1967
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:10,770
You're not going to get any of that.

1968
01:47:11,770 --> 01:47:12,410
I assure you.

1969
01:47:13,810 --> 01:47:15,630
So I would suggest that,

1970
01:47:16,630 --> 01:47:18,490
how many times have you heard in Greek speak,

1971
01:47:18,570 --> 01:47:20,330
food, clothing, shelter, food, clothing, shelter,

1972
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:21,910
up the quality of those.

1973
01:47:22,330 --> 01:47:23,610
And it sounds really base.

1974
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:25,650
Oh, that sounds really basic.

1975
01:47:26,010 --> 01:47:27,210
I can do more than that.

1976
01:47:27,230 --> 01:47:27,610
But you know what?

1977
01:47:27,610 --> 01:47:29,990
If you pursue increasing the quality

1978
01:47:29,990 --> 01:47:31,350
of food, clothing, and shelter,

1979
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:33,530
while you're seeking to increase those qualities,

1980
01:47:33,530 --> 01:47:35,930
you're going to learn a lot about many, many, many,

1981
01:47:35,930 --> 01:47:38,310
many other things on the way.

1982
01:47:39,450 --> 01:47:41,310
It's kind of like the Karate Kid movie.

1983
01:47:41,430 --> 01:47:42,490
You know, wax on, wax off.

1984
01:47:42,530 --> 01:47:43,610
Why am I doing all this?

1985
01:47:43,990 --> 01:47:44,430
You'll see.

1986
01:47:45,230 --> 01:47:46,370
It all goes together.

1987
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:50,010
So, for example, that's why I've said many times,

1988
01:47:50,070 --> 01:47:52,450
this is a harsh criticism, but I assure you it's true.

1989
01:47:53,110 --> 01:47:55,970
Look at people that discuss politics wholeheartedly.

1990
01:47:57,150 --> 01:47:58,370
And if you get to know them personally,

1991
01:47:58,450 --> 01:47:59,890
they are of poor character.

1992
01:48:01,070 --> 01:48:03,030
You don't want them marrying the sister.

1993
01:48:03,570 --> 01:48:05,530
You wouldn't bring in all this other stuff.

1994
01:48:06,410 --> 01:48:08,010
So pay attention, folks.

1995
01:48:08,950 --> 01:48:10,510
And thank you for calling in, Wes.

1996
01:48:11,390 --> 01:48:15,210
And this is Solo 5 or Solo 6 is coming.

1997
01:48:15,330 --> 01:48:17,710
We'll be talking about what do cannibals, birthdays, and dolls.

1998
01:48:18,370 --> 01:48:19,690
Thank you, everyone, for contributing.

1999
01:48:20,070 --> 01:48:20,650
See you again.

2000
01:48:20,850 --> 01:48:21,630
Greek signing out.

2001
01:48:21,850 --> 01:48:22,010
Ciao.
