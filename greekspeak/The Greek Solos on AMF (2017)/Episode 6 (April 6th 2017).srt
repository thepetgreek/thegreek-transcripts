00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Greetings everyone, it's the Greek, it's Uncommon Radio time again, and it could be

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,680
uncommon sense or Greek speak, however you would like to call it.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,460
And this is American Freedom Radio, and this is also a place where you are welcome to call in

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,219
and participate somehow.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,760
If, just right out of the gate, I'd like to say the number for calling in

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,960
to Uncommon Radio would be 218-339-8525.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,200
That's 218-339-8525.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:33,160
And for the Skype, if you prefer better clarity, you can go to uncommonradio.com,

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:40,340
www.uncommonradio.com, and there you will see an e-mail which is uncommonsenseradio1

10
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,920
at gmail.com, and that's a numeric one.

11
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,380
And that is also the Skype contact.

12
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,880
And what I will do in the meantime is bring up the phone lines and perhaps get that started.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,840
And again, it's the Greek.

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,160
This is the sixth time around.

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,820
We've been archiving these as solo, solo one all the way through five.

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,180
Now, this perhaps would be number six.

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:07,180
I would suggest that it'll be a carryover or follow-through of what was discussed last week,

18
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,320
which was number five.

19
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,340
And the reason I'm bringing up the numbers is because, indeed, numbers do matter in this case.

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,060
There is a convention that sort of lies behind it.

21
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,340
It's a form of numerology perhaps, maybe, maybe not.

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,880
It's a form of Dematria, maybe, maybe not.

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,200
But let's just say that numbers are important.

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,500
It's rational communication.

25
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,120
So I'm going to try to bring up the phone lines and see if I could walk and chew gum today.

26
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,300
And speaking of today, by the way, for a time marker, on the Pope's work schedule, it's what they call April 6, 2017.

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:50,380
But I would say lawfully it's the last week of the first month, and I would suggest it's about the 28th day of the first month.

28
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:57,420
So also I wanted to bring that up real quick because there's been a lot of chatter on chat regarding timekeeping.

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,940
And, yeah, I did get thrown it back.

30
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,020
I was not doing the observation about two weeks ago.

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,500
I think I'm back on track.

32
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:09,400
I haven't done due diligence to the point where I can really have a good verification or validation of it.

33
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:14,300
But I would suggest that forming records like that for oneself is just for oneself.

34
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,780
To do them formally, there is a social rank that is almost required to do it.

35
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,020
It's to make it official.

36
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,620
So is there a right and wrong?

37
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:23,960
Yes.

38
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:32,000
I wouldn't say anyone is particularly wrong, but I wouldn't say anyone is particularly right spot on because there's an element of authority.

39
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,880
But you have to understand this is a different type of society.

40
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,720
Just because you're born into it doesn't mean that it's correct or right.

41
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,900
So we'll get into that.

42
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,640
I think I have the phone board up now as well.

43
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,540
So with that said, we'll probably continue.

44
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,500
Number six, I had gotten an e-mail also regarding something that pertains to that.

45
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,980
I don't think the person who just e-mailed is aware of it.

46
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,340
But I see these things in a certain order, and I like to communicate them.

47
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:11,340
What you will find by listening to Greek speak or on common radio is there's not a lot of who-gee-was-its and we don't know and a lot of descriptions.

48
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,140
This is what you're going to get in the world today.

49
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,260
And when I say in the world, I mean university, all of your people that are imparting in academia.

50
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:26,360
Now, by the way, academia means theoretical and practical, not leading to a conclusion.

51
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:36,640
Alternative media, mainstream media, what you will do is approach all of these mediums of informational exchange or impartment.

52
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:43,860
Now, by the way, they're typically entertainment, but let's just say people don't consider it as such.

53
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,080
Why?

54
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,460
Well, because at a very young age, I remember watching – this is when just black and white televisions were on.

55
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:57,940
A woman, a very old woman, a Greek grandma type came over from Europe, and she was actually crying watching cowboys and Indians get shot.

56
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:08,660
And it had to be explained to her that these are actors because where she had come from when people were shot so realistically, it appeared to be real.

57
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:21,960
So what I would like to suggest is a lot of the information that people are getting I think is real, even if it is contrary to the convention, which is allegedly what the alternative media is.

58
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,000
So I just wanted to bring up a few points like that.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:35,280
You won't get too much of the stuff you hear everywhere else, so be prepared.

60
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,420
And if you're here and you don't understand anything that's being said and you can't follow along, that's great.

61
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,920
You are completely normal, and you'll be fine.

62
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,240
You just do what you're told, and you'll be fine.

63
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,040
Actually, oh, wow, here's an old colleague or young colleague.

64
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,370
Okay, here. Hello, Chuck.

65
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,310
Okay, let's just say the Greeks speak about the war that is now in progress in Syria or has been.

66
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,630
Okay, that's interesting. That's good.

67
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,590
I did think about that a little bit.

68
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,010
I mean the war is not good, but there's many levels to that.

69
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:20,390
Very often when things can be explained, it's not in the television sitcom way.

70
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:29,630
I have not, by the way, been up to snuff on what's going on in terms of the progress with Syria,

71
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:39,390
because I discussed what that area would be a point of contention along with Turkey as well as Iraq over a decade ago with specifics why.

72
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:48,550
The one thing about knowing what's coming is you don't necessarily know how it's going to come, but you know it's going to arrive.

73
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:54,170
So I'm not really aware of the progress part, but Syria is an interesting aspect.

74
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:00,450
If you understand the history of Syria, and it's not what you've been told, by the way, well, of course.

75
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,850
There's a lot of people pontificating things.

76
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:08,970
How many times have you heard, like, oh, the pyramids were built 35,000 years ago or whatever.

77
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:15,750
It's not a matter of arguing that if it's 35,000 or 5,000 or 3,000 or whatever.

78
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:26,750
It's just that these pieces of information are given out without any form of backup, or they seem to be noncontinuous.

79
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,450
They just kind of jump out of whatever.

80
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:39,030
But discussing Syria, if anyone wants to plug in anything specific about the war in Syria, because it's not really a war.

81
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:46,110
Here's the many levels that you can't really come out and answer something immediately.

82
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:53,010
When you listen to Greek speaker things along this, anyone else explaining or trying to give an explanation, not just a description.

83
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:55,930
There's no pat answer to do it.

84
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,070
There's many levels, and typically three.

85
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,850
It's like almost three doors that you have to go through.

86
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,470
One is the door of perception.

87
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:10,350
The other one is the gathering of the information, and the last one is basically hashing it all together.

88
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:15,530
And remember, information is not just what it's about because it's tied into the perception.

89
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:24,210
Like, for example, I give the example of forensic crews that look very closely where others have said they looked and they have not.

90
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,070
That's why the word, for example, research means you've already searched it out.

91
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,470
Most quote-unquote researchers are just searchers.

92
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,290
It's all searching.

93
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:37,130
So when you have everything, then you go back and look at it again.

94
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:47,030
So in this case, looking at what's called Syria, again, there's a certain mindset that needs to be sort of considered.

95
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,550
Or let's say I invite people to consider a certain mindset.

96
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,430
How about that?

97
00:07:52,430 --> 00:08:01,130
And the mindset would be that if it's impending that there is going to be a loose confederacy of nations in the Middle East,

98
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:09,210
the formation which is going to be starting around next year and pretty much be beginning as a union,

99
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:16,190
as a loose confederacy of nations around what's called 2025, 2026, around there, perhaps even 2024,

100
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,990
one must consider what it takes to have a loose confederacy or union of nations.

101
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,870
Typically, I don't like to use the EU, European Union, as an example,

102
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,590
because that is just an achievement of the old National Socialist Party.

103
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:36,809
You folks know them as the Nazis, and that's the National Socialist Party.

104
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,309
One of their main goals was to unite Europe under Germany.

105
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,070
They had succeeded with that.

106
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,450
As a matter of fact, most of the EU mumblings and rumblings were in the late 90s,

107
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:50,490
but I think around the mid-2000s or so last decade, they had their 50th anniversary.

108
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:51,750
So how can that be?

109
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,910
So if anyone wants to look into that history, that is not what I'm discussing.

110
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,310
What is interesting about this Middle East confederacy that is coming around,

111
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,130
it is not going to have a centralized aspect to it.

112
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,350
Now, one can see, let's just jump around a little bit.

113
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,450
At this point, this is the precursor to the formation.

114
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,610
This is not the formation.

115
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,290
This is the precursor.

116
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,510
Now, let's just consider something on a very rudimentary level.

117
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,350
If you're going to have a group of nations, in this case it's ten,

118
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,650
which only nine are on the map.

119
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,390
But in this case, or any case, if you're going to have a loose confederacy of nations

120
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,110
or a group of nations forming together to work together,

121
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:33,370
and in the type of alliance that one can say is a form of a union

122
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,970
or a centralization of world power,

123
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,270
you cannot have nationalistic or unstable governments

124
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:47,390
or those that would run the central power base of each country

125
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,570
or are known to run as being over-nationalistic.

126
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:56,770
In other words, another way to say it is if you have a group of nations

127
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,950
that are having border squirmishes, political squirmishes that are bordering each other

128
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,790
or even just skipping a few borders,

129
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:09,490
there is no way you're going to form a relaxed enough atmosphere for them to work together,

130
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,710
for it to be the actual world center for almost every aspect of humanity.

131
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,470
Think about that for a minute.

132
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,790
Again, I don't like using the European Union because that would be misleading

133
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,650
to say it's going to be like that.

134
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:30,470
But if you comprehend on several levels, the level of nationalism that had,

135
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,250
let's say pretty much the norm of the day in Europe prior to what's known as World War II,

136
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:41,030
that would have been very difficult to establish what has been established now with the EU.

137
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,790
And when you look at it consecutively,

138
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:50,390
it's past the cessation of hostilities that led to the reforming,

139
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,990
not immediately, or the forming, I should say, of the EU.

140
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,510
What you're witnessing in what's called the Middle East right now

141
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:00,450
is actually various aspects of what I'm discussing,

142
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:07,950
as well as a global aspect that it is the starting line of a particular event,

143
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,290
meaning the civilization of mankind.

144
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,590
And because all things are sort of spiral or circular,

145
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:16,490
you might actually be witnessing the finish line.

146
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:21,790
So this is a discussion that can be elaborated on over and over and over.

147
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,950
One thing one can actually observe at this time,

148
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,250
other than all the things going on, not only in Syria,

149
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,390
because there's also other countries that are, let's say Yemen,

150
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:36,190
and Lebanon has been in shambles since the civil war.

151
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,690
Iraq has been sort of like a really big mess.

152
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:47,530
And so on and so on around even the, if you go northeast,

153
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:53,470
the former Soviet Union countries that are now sovereign again, supposedly.

154
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:59,650
You could pierce around the veil and see how things get a little unstable

155
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,230
as you use what's called the Middle East as the epicenter.

156
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:08,130
But the most unstable would be the Middle East.

157
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,470
And I'm using the term Middle East because that's a simple way to communicate it.

158
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,570
So you can see the instability.

159
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:19,670
But where you will find stability is the two current, let's just say,

160
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,930
not even in name only, but simple descriptive, let's say analogously,

161
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,250
you can say that Israel and Iran are the superpowers of the Middle East right now.

162
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,950
Yes, there's a lot of attention to Saudi Arabia and Dubai and other UAE

163
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,290
and other places like that.

164
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,570
But I don't really want to get into too much of their history

165
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:42,870
because that would be UAE and Saudi Arabia and all that

166
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:48,230
because you cannot be very objective about those places or those nations.

167
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,770
The reason is because no matter how objective you are,

168
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,050
it sounds like you are not saying good things about them.

169
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,910
So I would rather just leave them alone and remain neutral on the approach,

170
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,110
not only neutral on that.

171
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:04,090
But I would consider that what, let's just put it this way,

172
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:08,610
what the Greek had put out and parted over a decade ago

173
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:14,750
is that the main aspect of this, let's just say loose confederacy of nations,

174
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:20,070
is going to be the number of nations that come on the scene,

175
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,230
and that number is 10.

176
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,230
And there's a list of them in scripture.

177
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,370
But if you look at that list, and it's not listed like a laundry list, by the way,

178
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,630
it's actually part of a verse regarding Assyria.

179
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:37,070
And what's interesting about that is Assyria does not exist.

180
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,970
And now I said Assyria, A-S-S-Y-R-I-A-N.

181
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:47,150
The Assyrian people or the Akkadian have not had a nation in over 2,300 years.

182
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:53,170
And they predominantly, several million in population, live in Europe,

183
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,610
what's known as the U.S. and Australia.

184
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,870
They're scattered all over the world.

185
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,550
They have not had a nation in over 2,300 years formally.

186
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:08,230
They typically were at what's called the Nineveh Plains or northern part of Iraq.

187
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:13,510
Now what was written regarding this situation was that when Assyria forms,

188
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:20,510
it will be most likely a product of a loose civil war,

189
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:26,150
more of a political civil war in Iraq that will allow that territory to be formed

190
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:30,570
or reformed, which it has not in thousands of years.

191
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,470
Now you could look at the Assyrians, by the way,

192
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,310
and there was a genocide regarding them and an acknowledgment of such.

193
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,130
There's some notoriety regarding their history, but not much.

194
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:46,170
But what had been written regarding the situation over a decade ago is that

195
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:52,770
when a loose sort of political and economic civil war allows Assyria to form,

196
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,990
it won't just form in northern Iraq.

197
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,890
If you comprehend the borders, let's say spiritual borders,

198
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,890
because let me just jump around a little bit here.

199
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,210
Every nation has a principality behind it.

200
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,630
Yes, it's kind of a patron deity.

201
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,370
They might be slightly different.

202
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,570
The patron deities might be the ones that the people prop up,

203
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,870
but there is a principality or spirit behind it.

204
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:20,190
So when you look at maps, it's not just men squirting ink on paper.

205
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,070
There's a little bit more about that.

206
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:27,890
Now when Assyria comes around and it's acknowledged as a political body,

207
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:33,570
according to its older borders, you will probably discover that parts of it,

208
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:39,890
of the formal border of Assyria, goes into what's called modern Turkey,

209
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:44,870
more of like the southeastern part, and it also goes into Syria.

210
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,210
Not much, but enough.

211
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,130
So part of the communication that was drafted over a decade ago

212
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,990
was to watch Turkey and to watch Syria,

213
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,730
because they're going to be giving up a small amount of land.

214
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,430
Now what's interesting about that, many people here,

215
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,130
when land is given to another, let's say, sovereignty or political state,

216
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:09,170
it can be purchased, like it is, let's say, the Americans bought Alaska

217
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,330
and other things, you know, other pieces of property, let's say,

218
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:17,450
that they consider part of their rule.

219
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:24,130
But you would say that in this case, there's some very, very deep ethnic differences,

220
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,670
and I wouldn't see it as being financial solely,

221
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:33,950
and I would see that there's a destabilization that's going to be coming in Turkey

222
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:39,410
and Syria, and this was written, let's say, around 2005, 2006.

223
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,770
So not a lot of specifics about what's going on specifically,

224
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:49,570
but when you see what's going on, it makes complete sense if you know what's coming.

225
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:56,430
The other thing about what's going on in Syria is that it is going to break up

226
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:02,270
in different jurisdictions, so is Jordan and other things, and I can go on and on.

227
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:09,790
Now I believe I would say that there is a tremendous amount of specific information

228
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:16,589
with references where they can be sourced, and a little bit more history on the matter,

229
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,750
which will be coming in the future.

230
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,069
Now I just want to, this is just to maybe digress just for a moment.

231
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:27,650
I want to thank everyone who has contributed to supporting the show

232
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,210
and acknowledging that it is worth contributing to Uncommon Radio.

233
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:37,950
I suggested that the first four weeks of doing this, the first four solo events,

234
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:44,010
and sonic events were going to be sort of an open member's area where anyone was willing to call in

235
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:47,910
or bring up a subject, it would be discussed pretty much as it could be

236
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,350
within a two-hour open platform like this.

237
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:59,890
Now I would suggest that in the future there is going to be a project that perhaps will be with AFR,

238
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:06,810
perhaps not, we'll see, but it will be coming in the future where it will be not a member's area only,

239
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:12,730
perhaps there's got to be something better, but a non-public venue where information regarding

240
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,170
what the Greek discusses in greater length and greater specifics.

241
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,630
There is quite a bit of commentary that I've gotten where you bring up all these subjects,

242
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:22,810
but you don't give enough specifics.

243
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,550
And then the same people will comment, well, I have to go back and listen to it again,

244
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,230
because every time I do there's so much in there.

245
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,590
So there's a dichotomy there.

246
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:39,830
So I'm not sure how this is going to be exactly structured, but it will not be open to the public at large.

247
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:46,070
This is not being done strictly as something to monetize anything,

248
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:51,430
and if anything is monetized to an extent it will be put back into it to keep the project going.

249
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:59,630
I recently found out certain university libraries are charging some pretty high fees for scanning old documents,

250
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:05,770
and it's quite interesting to be working for free sometimes, but anyway, what they call gratis.

251
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:12,150
So whatever kind of exchange can be garnered, and I'm sure it will be very well worth it for anyone who participates,

252
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,610
and this is a project that will come together in the future,

253
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:22,190
and it will be based on some very, very specific aspects of things that have been discussed and your questions.

254
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,250
So again, I didn't see anything else come up in the chat,

255
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:36,130
but all I have to say about any war in progress, especially in the Middle East, is that its sole purpose, as was discussed,

256
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:42,810
and the interesting thing is perhaps maybe it's discussing something that's too far into the future,

257
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,950
because it seems like things change on a weekly basis or a daily basis too often.

258
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,850
The attention span is like that of a cat with humanity at large.

259
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:58,870
So I tend to see that knowing the terminus point, or the termination of something,

260
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:05,990
helps you understand what process it goes through before it reaches that end, instead of watching it just as it goes.

261
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:13,710
So what's interesting also, one thing I just want to maybe, that's all I can say about the war in Syria at the moment,

262
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:20,130
but the other interesting thing is that there's a couple of other countries that are next in line for a major destabilization,

263
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:25,450
and if you read between the lines, or reading out of what I'm saying, and it's not Israel and it's not Iran.

264
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:31,290
So you take your pick, that leaves you about another, let's say six or so.

265
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:36,330
But I have given these countries out in the past, and we can get into more specifics.

266
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:43,010
Now there will be destabilization in Iraq and Israel, but not now, and it will be much later, and it will be for different reasons.

267
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:49,030
But I would suggest that if anyone wants a new idea, read a really old book.

268
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:55,930
That's the beginning of looking at things with fresh eyes, as they say.

269
00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:05,570
So with that said, I see someone is probably bringing back on track, what is the role of man on Earth?

270
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:10,150
And I would just suggest that that's a very simple way to look at it.

271
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:15,170
It depends on where you get your information from, and how you classify information as being valid or not.

272
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,410
There are several ways to look at that.

273
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,090
So let's just see.

274
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,730
We're getting a couple of other messages here.

275
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,470
I'll see if anything is pertinent, and then we'll just go on,

276
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:34,110
because I would suggest that when you're discussing mankind, what is the role of man as a steward?

277
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:39,430
But ultimately, man is actually a product.

278
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,530
I've discussed this many times before.

279
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:49,050
When you start getting into these matters, it has nothing to do with belief, by the way.

280
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:55,170
Whenever you hear anyone say the word belief, it means you have knowledge of something that will be coming or happening.

281
00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:02,930
And if it's a good belief, that means that the knowledge is firm, and the possibility of something happening is eminent.

282
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:08,710
If the belief is not good, it means the knowledge is not very good, and it may not happen.

283
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,990
So when people say, what do you believe in, it has to be action-based.

284
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,390
I'm not saying it to be dogmatic, or this is what the Greek says it is or whatever,

285
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:22,470
but looking at what beliefs are are totally different the way people use them.

286
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,870
Okay, I'm getting some questions here.

287
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,050
These have been answered before, and how do the gods perceive man in their bigger picture?

288
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:36,310
I've explained much of that before, but I would just suggest that from a spiritual perspective with mankind,

289
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:45,830
it's a form of spirit that manifests on this earth that is pretty much animated through the physical body.

290
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:53,830
In other words, it's a high form of spirit that is limited to be animated through the physical body.

291
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,630
So when the physical body is removed, there is no more animation.

292
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:59,610
That is the other interesting aspect of mankind.

293
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:04,670
You will look at various cultures, and they talk about the first man or early man.

294
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:08,170
Now, this again is different from belief.

295
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:14,590
If you contrast what's being said here to academia regarding evolution and all this other stuff,

296
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:20,830
that is a whole other field, because all you can do with evolution is explain it,

297
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,230
and it's not in a very good way, because it's just a prank.

298
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:30,790
That's what academics do, and that's what the entitled classes like to do.

299
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,870
They like to play pranks.

300
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,050
So the description of mankind is quite simple.

301
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:43,690
You're a spirit that's animated through the body, and everything around you was made or remade to house you,

302
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,030
just like you would build a house for someone to live in.

303
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:50,530
There is basically a 7,000-year curing period.

304
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,550
It's quite simple.

305
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:55,650
Now, it sounds like, oh, well, that's not enough information.

306
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:59,090
Well, it's actually the mindset required to look at the rest of the information.

307
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:04,150
When I say required, I mean there's many things you could look at in this world if you feel like being pranked.

308
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,790
It's not like, well, the Greek believes this.

309
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:09,190
There are things that I believe, meaning like what I just discussed,

310
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:15,110
based on knowledge of things that are going to happen, and the knowledge is pretty good.

311
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,750
When someone says, for example, just for a minute, this is a mindset, folks.

312
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,190
Oh, do you believe in God?

313
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,210
Don't even answer that.

314
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:22,710
That's a ridiculous question.

315
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,990
It's completely ridiculous.

316
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:26,670
Believe in God.

317
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:27,390
What does that mean?

318
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,630
I don't know what that means.

319
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:31,070
Believe that a god is going to do something?

320
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,270
What are you speaking of?

321
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:38,810
So the level of the reductionist, the level of information and the dumbing up

322
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:44,370
and the reductionist communications that are being partaken in by the society at large right now

323
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:48,250
is almost something to be avoided, almost in wholesale.

324
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:54,350
It's almost, I would say, almost impossible to have a rational conversation at this point.

325
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:58,670
I've had people from different walks of life come and say, yes, I do see that,

326
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,010
and it's kind of an interesting thing to discuss on its own.

327
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,430
But mankind being here, and this being the number six, by the way,

328
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:11,290
when we give a little bit of timekeeping, if we're going to do a little bit of timekeeping,

329
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:22,130
you're roughly, I would say, about 19 years into the credits, which the time roughly ended.

330
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,750
When I say roughly, there's a little bit more fine-tuning,

331
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:29,810
but it doesn't matter at this point because it's gotten too far into the future from this point.

332
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:35,810
Around the fall of 1998, and let's just give a few tidbits here,

333
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,870
because what's interesting is redundancy is important because it seems like when I say things,

334
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:44,150
there's many questions regarding the same thing that has been said many times.

335
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,230
So there's a time and place, and it's not time yet.

336
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:51,230
When it's not time yet, you can pretty much give out a secret, and it won't be comprehended.

337
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:56,330
But I would just suggest that the year 1998 was around the year 6,000,

338
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,210
so you add roughly 19 to that in the fall.

339
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:03,410
That's how many years since Adam, because Adam is the reference point.

340
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,870
Now what's interesting, and here's the little secret.

341
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:11,690
The most critical and most significant figure in the Scripture is the Christ.

342
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,750
Now I'm not talking about Jesus or anything Christian.

343
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:17,630
That does not, in Scripture, there's nothing in Christianity that is scriptural.

344
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:22,490
Zero. And that sounds irrational, but if you've done your homework, you will see.

345
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,490
And the Bible is not the Scripture by far.

346
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:29,610
You know, King James, that is an interesting thing that I will be giving the history on in the future,

347
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,270
most likely in private.

348
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:38,130
But I would just suggest this, folks, that the Christ, the most important figure, was born the year 4,000,

349
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:45,430
because there is a number sequence here that I have described, I think, with the Ocelli and the Greek

350
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:51,290
several times, probably at the end of the second hour, about discerning the number 7.

351
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:57,930
So you need to think about that for a moment, and I will bring that up with even more information in the future.

352
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:03,750
So this is regarding an email I recently just got a few minutes ago.

353
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:11,870
If the Christ was born on the number 4, and that is his number, when would another character be born?

354
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,870
What millennial would he be born?

355
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:20,010
If you guessed the 6th millennium, the year 6,000 around 1998, you would be pretty accurate,

356
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,890
about as accurate as one would want to be.

357
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:29,050
So that, let's say, is a directly, indirectly answering the question regarding someone emailing earlier.

358
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:35,770
So I would just say that the position of man and its 6 is also very interesting.

359
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,710
When you look at many people, this is just a social commentary,

360
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:46,030
when they think the number 666 elicits some form of Satan or something demonic or whatever,

361
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:50,370
where 666, by the way, that comes out of what is called the Book of Revelation,

362
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:55,370
and if you don't fit the description as one of the people in the first verse,

363
00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:00,850
you could read that book every day, five times a day, and I assure you, you will not understand a thing in it.

364
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:07,010
I mean, after the, or up or down, or hot or cold, you will not comprehend anything.

365
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,930
And the other promise on this, or assurance, I should say,

366
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:15,910
is if you consider yourself Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, or any of the mainstream religions,

367
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,730
you will not understand anything in the Book of Revelation.

368
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:21,070
That's an assurance. That's pretty simple.

369
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,170
So there is a lot of problem still with communication and just bad information.

370
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:34,700
So there is regarding something regarding the law on the seventh day and all that.

371
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,680
Yeah, okay, that, you know, it's interesting.

372
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:41,180
There's been a lot of questions in chat and other places regarding specific verses,

373
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,980
almost from a legalistic point of view.

374
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:48,260
And I've had some pretty good Skype conversations regarding scripture,

375
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,900
some of them hours and hours long.

376
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:57,160
And just to be apologetic or defend the point that looking at just one verse is not the way to do it.

377
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,680
Yes, you need to know what you need to know, and you will find it in singular verses or groups of verses.

378
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,400
But what's interesting is when you see a subject come up,

379
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:08,940
for example, like a specific question is being asked in the chat right now.

380
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,340
I'm not going to read it on air.

381
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:17,260
But what I will say is that whenever there is a question regarding something in what's called scripture,

382
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:21,500
even if you're reading it out of the Pittsburgh King James or whatever other language,

383
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,040
you're not going to language of preservation.

384
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,460
If there is a question about it, it's because that is usually interjectory thought or interjectory verse,

385
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:33,560
where it's interjected within a body of information or a storyline.

386
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,760
And more information regarding that is found in other places, okay?

387
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,460
And you also have to remember when you're reading something like the scripture,

388
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,940
that is about the gods.

389
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,240
It's not about you.

390
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,080
There's plenty to read.

391
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,320
If you want to read stuff about mankind, there's plenty of people that are willing to write it.

392
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,820
But whenever you read the scripture, it is about them.

393
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:05,580
So even when they are discussing in scripture information about men, it is regarding the gods, you see.

394
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,620
So you have to consider certain things.

395
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,140
Who are they?

396
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,120
Like I've given metaphors before.

397
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,380
We don't know what a bear is, but we know enough about its characteristics that we can discuss.

398
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,340
We know what bears are, but we really don't.

399
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,520
We don't really know who the gods are, but we know enough about their characteristics that's been memorialized.

400
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,480
Because on the other hand, you may not know if one is riding the bus with you.

401
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,520
At this point, they are covert in appearance.

402
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,600
They are not overt in appearance.

403
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,820
And I'm not discussing any of the stuff that you have in your mainstream you,

404
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,420
meaning people at large, surface-dwelling earth inhabitants, not you, the listener, for example,

405
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,700
have in your mainstream religions.

406
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,340
That is completely different.

407
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,140
There is something very unusually distasteful about that.

408
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:59,180
But anyway, so one thing about getting specific answers about specific verses and specific concepts,

409
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,260
yeah, that could be answered.

410
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,240
There's a question there, sure.

411
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:07,160
But it's not what you think because it's not strictly related to that one item.

412
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,820
Let me just give another little thing.

413
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,960
Well, we'll save that for another time.

414
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,160
This is regarding how to comprehend and read scripture.

415
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:23,680
Because you have to realize the gods have IQs of over 2 million, not to insult them.

416
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:28,400
And when you read any of the holy writs, they're really speaking baby talk.

417
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:35,200
And if anyone says that it cannot be understood, that's like indirectly just wanting to kick the gods in the nuts

418
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,420
or saying that the gods act in futility.

419
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,020
That was your little lascivious comment for the day.

420
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,420
Okay, so the gods do not act in futility.

421
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,060
There's many things in place here that mankind is not aware of.

422
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,620
That I have tried to explain, not just describe.

423
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,800
One of them is cosmic censorship.

424
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,980
The other thing is you're in the credits part of society.

425
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:56,780
Yep.

426
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,100
But discussing mankind and any question that might come that way,

427
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:07,060
if I harken back to the previous number five solo episode, I would suggest, or sonic experience,

428
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:11,960
I would suggest that what was brought up, what do cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common?

429
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:18,120
And if you've heard Greek speak before, by the way, what does Greek speak and heavy artillery have in common?

430
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,120
Well, once you hear it, it's too late.

431
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:29,080
But either way, if you were to objectify the present civilization, surface-dwelling earth inhabitants,

432
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,840
and just pretty much anyone you will meet in a general sense, statistically,

433
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:45,660
can be described as what would be in the next few-minute installment of the explanation of what do cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common.

434
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:52,160
Now, if you want to, there are things that kind of perplex people, fancy words and tongue twisters maybe,

435
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,660
but just go ahead and ask someone, what do cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common?

436
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,300
Now, by the way, just a little bit of history on this.

437
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,920
I've been saying this for quite a while.

438
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:06,300
And people that do enjoy it always want the Greek to say it.

439
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,220
And I say, well, why don't you say it?

440
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,940
And it doesn't seem like people are able to string it together for some reason.

441
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,640
Some say you're more eloquent Greek or whatever.

442
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,800
No, I am not as described.

443
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,880
I just find it very unusual.

444
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:27,360
So anyone is free to use this, by the way, if you want to perplex or confound the average surface-dwelling earth inhabitant,

445
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,140
and also exhibit their vileness.

446
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,440
And one thing, again, I just want to recap here.

447
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:38,640
When you do tune into Uncommon Radio or get into Greek speak, you'll notice it is chock full of explanation.

448
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,440
You won't get too many I don't know whys or it's like this or like that.

449
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,140
What you're going to get is the gateway into objectivity.

450
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,500
You will not get objectivity.

451
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:59,020
You will get the gateway into a certain mindset that will make you extraordinarily perceptive of the obvious.

452
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,100
That's right.

453
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,600
You will become extraordinarily perceptive of the obvious.

454
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,060
And no, it is not good for making friends.

455
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,560
No, it's not.

456
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,860
I mean, yeah, well, neither is like you've got a stain on the shirt there.

457
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,199
You know, are you eating spaghetti?

458
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,400
Anyway, you will not make friends.

459
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:19,080
So let's please, please, folks.

460
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:25,000
If anyone comprehends the question and the answer and the explanation, feel free to use it.

461
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,600
Feel free to spread it around.

462
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,820
I'm not looking to create any form of social currency or anything.

463
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:37,780
As a matter of fact, I don't pursue anything that much of the aspirations of others that are in this electronic media.

464
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,360
I do not do YouTubes and all that other silly stuff.

465
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,659
So I'm not saying that if you do YouTubes, you're silly.

466
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,960
But most people do it just to whatever you get the picture.

467
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,659
There's no reason for it.

468
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,500
Well, the reason for speaking is solely that.

469
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,719
Now, it has to be done one way or another.

470
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:02,780
And just to recap again, there are many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many, many things that need to be discussed.

471
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,380
Yes, you heard, need to be discussed, but they will not be done in public at this time.

472
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,640
So please be aware there are projects or projects coming in the near future where that can be done.

473
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:20,620
It will be well worth anyone's time if you are not looking to make any friends, of course.

474
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,680
But anyway, cannibals, birthdays, and dolls, feel free to use it.

475
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:31,400
As a matter of fact, if you're going to objectify pretty much everyone on this planet and leave this planet

476
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,960
and communicate what everyone on this planet is about just in a few minutes, this is the way to do it, folks.

477
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,600
Now, I haven't met everyone.

478
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:43,520
I don't need to because I'm not really speaking about everyone on the planet.

479
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,740
I'm speaking about the great majority, statistically the great majority.

480
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:51,520
If you put 7.5 billion people, which is the World Bank statistic, by the way,

481
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,900
and it's interesting how that metric is maintained and garnered by the World Bank, folks.

482
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,660
If you were to eliminate, let's say, 50 million or 30 million, you wouldn't see much of a difference.

483
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:11,360
It's actually the number of people that are objective, perceptive, and sort of aware are much less than that.

484
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,260
It's actually a small percentage of the 50 million.

485
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:21,000
So speaking a certain way regarding the majority of the people on this planet,

486
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:28,700
let's just say give it a rational communication of 7.5 billion, it sounds like you're speaking poorly of them.

487
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:34,840
Yes, it's not difficult, yeah, to do that.

488
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,800
Anyway, what do cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common?

489
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,060
So this was asked last week.

490
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,400
Again, let's just go back to Chapter 4.

491
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:54,360
We start then and said, okay, someone is – okay, we can get to these discussions regarding the Earth and other things as well, and they will be.

492
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,180
But what do cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common?

493
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:03,760
We have 20 minutes left in the first hour, and I'm going to go slowly with it because I don't think there's much that can be –

494
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,620
much can be added to it, but much will not at this time.

495
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:16,840
Now, the interesting thing about – again, just to say it again, the reason why this is asked is because it is a simple representation

496
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,340
or simple representative explanation of what is going on on this Earth.

497
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,120
It doesn't matter what country you're in or when you have lived.

498
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,800
So what do cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common?

499
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:34,700
What's interesting – here we go – is that even if you look into the crap education system, whether it's private or public,

500
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:42,560
they will all admit that life somehow, man's civilization, started in and around the Mesopotamian region of the world.

501
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,460
Okay, Mesopotamia, Tigris, Euphrates, and all that other stuff.

502
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:52,080
And what's interesting about that is you will also find that most of the writs of the world have that as well.

503
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:59,540
And there's points that can be argued, but typically that is the accepted and truthful aspect of it.

504
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:05,660
Now, regarding a region, let's say something like Europe, you know, like most of the countries,

505
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,240
let's say Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian, those are known as Latin languages.

506
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,280
They're different unto themselves, but they are known as the Latin language.

507
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,740
The language of these early civilizations in Mesopotamia was the Chaldean Hebrew, Akkadian, that style.

508
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:26,840
You might call it Hebrew-Arabic, but whatever, but there's a distinction between the Chaldean Hebrew-Arabic now.

509
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,420
But they were generally grouped together as a Chaldean type of language.

510
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:43,440
So what's interesting is that in their religious practice, by this time, they had admittedly and functionally had various priesthoods,

511
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,300
and the priesthoods were known as the Qahans.

512
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:52,600
And typically they would set up institutions, very much like the circuses or churches you see today,

513
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:57,420
and other temples and houses of worship that are called such.

514
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:04,020
And the people were attracted to go there because if you did certain things and made certain offerings,

515
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,740
you were garnered prosperity and other things.

516
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:15,960
So basically what had happened was the overt aspect of human sacrifice had been in place,

517
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,980
and the human sacrifice was for the Baals.

518
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:24,940
Baal is an elemental, I would say, a little bit more than an elemental.

519
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:35,540
They're personified in anthropomorphic forms, and I would suggest that the priests of the Baals were called the Qahan Baals,

520
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:44,220
and the way they suggested the people would gain prosperity is by bringing a child and having it slaughtered on an altar publicly.

521
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:50,420
And when this was done, some of the flesh and some of the blood was passed around,

522
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:57,540
and that's why the consummation of or consuming of human flesh is called Qahan Baalism.

523
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,460
This is not a play on words like telling lies on your vision or anything like that, or history is history.

524
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:08,900
Qahan Baal or cannibal is where you get the association of eating flesh.

525
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,180
So this is the story that we are going on.

526
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:16,820
What do cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common?

527
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:23,260
Now typically if you comprehend human nature and society and the familial structure,

528
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,920
with a missing child, if there were other children, they would ask,

529
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,400
where is our missing brother? Where is our missing sister?

530
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,720
Typically it would have been a male, but let's just say.

531
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:41,180
So the altar boys of these priests of the Lord, because by the way, Baal means Lord, right?

532
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:47,780
If translated today, a Lord of some sort, and these were priests, so today you have priests of the Lord as well.

533
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:56,800
But nonetheless, they had altar boys that produced an item, maybe an effigy of such, or something called a doll.

534
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:03,480
An appearance of a child, and they were told to give this to the children that were asking about the missing child,

535
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,640
to keep them occupied until they forgot about it.

536
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,740
So now you know the history of dolls.

537
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,380
Now the interesting thing about that is, go ahead and ask anyone about dolls they don't know,

538
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:16,680
and they don't want to know, and if they hear about these points, they just don't care.

539
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,720
Because see, they're having a good time playing with dolls, and it's part of the culture.

540
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,420
As a matter of fact, there's an industry behind it.

541
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,220
Yes, that's right. There are doll factories.

542
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,200
Never heard of such a thing, huh?

543
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,780
Okay, yeah.

544
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:33,400
Now you know what cannibals and dolls are tied in together somehow.

545
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:39,540
Now what's interesting about this, many of this did not bring prosperity, for obvious reasons,

546
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,700
and a lot of them were run out of that area, and they went and settled northern parts of Europe.

547
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,120
Have you ever heard of the Druids, by the way?

548
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,960
Yeah, mm-hmm.

549
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,160
Yeah, okay.

550
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:55,220
Okay, so yeah, this is humanity, folks.

551
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,120
So they get run out because it doesn't bring a lot of prosperity, obviously,

552
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,600
but there was remnants of this, and this is all they knew how to do.

553
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,740
So they said, well, let's instead of sacrificing a child,

554
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,520
why don't we just take the next child in line, or that would be offered,

555
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,580
and have a celebration where we bake a loaf of sweet bread, and that represents the body,

556
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,780
put some lights in it, have the child blow out, which represents blowing out the life,

557
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,260
and everyone participating would eat a piece of the body,

558
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,440
and when you're participating, the child is told to make a wish of prosperity

559
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,060
and to show that it works, anyone that comes brings a present.

560
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:38,280
And I studied this, and I was like, I wonder, this is an odd kind of celebration or ceremony.

561
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,520
It took about six months to figure out that's the origin of the birthday cake by description.

562
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,220
So, yeah.

563
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,400
You know, what's interesting is there's something called a goat which will eat anything.

564
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:56,140
You know, a goat-type personality will find things pleasant that are pleasant

565
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:00,120
and, you know, find things that are not pleasant as being, you know, should be avoided.

566
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:03,380
If you're speaking to someone and they find this story to be a gasp

567
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:07,540
and they invite you to a birthday party later, they're a goat because they just eat anything.

568
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:12,080
So anyway, here, folks, I didn't want to throw the goat part in because that's very common,

569
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,840
but now you know what cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common.

570
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,280
Or the story, as it goes, is cannibals, dolls, and birthdays,

571
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,700
but it seems like cannibals, birthdays, and dolls almost has a little rhyme to it.

572
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,760
Limerick, maybe. Doubt it.

573
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:33,240
So this is the representation of the attitude, the intent, and the functionality of humanity.

574
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,240
Now, I just want to throw something in here.

575
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,080
This is the way you explain who is on this planet.

576
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:42,180
It doesn't mean that you're a part of it.

577
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,220
It's just the general consensus, and it doesn't matter what culture you're in.

578
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,160
This goes on everywhere.

579
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,320
Now, I just want to throw something in.

580
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,320
I don't really like discussing that television show or radio program they call the news,

581
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:57,720
but there's been something about a certain gate regarding a certain Italian food.

582
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,720
You know, I put it all together.

583
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:03,020
It's a flat thing, baked pizza, whatever, about humans and children and all that.

584
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,740
Yes, this has been going on everywhere, and as a matter of fact,

585
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:14,140
as a matter of fact, if you want to know how bad this is from an intentional point of view,

586
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:20,960
from the spiritual side, go into a local market and ask them if they sell birthday cakes.

587
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,360
Yes, that's all.

588
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:28,740
And if they say yes, you are up Schitt's Creek without a paddle in that society.

589
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:36,320
Okay, so whether it takes just a few years or a few generations, you're not going to fare well.

590
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,820
So for one aspect, yes.

591
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:45,260
Are there children being taken underground that involves every aspect of all of the entitled classes?

592
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:50,980
And I don't need to name who they are, who the entitled classes are, your professionals, I should say.

593
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,060
They're all involved in it.

594
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:59,320
And the ones that are not involved in it are somewhat used as buffers or whatever.

595
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:05,200
But you're involved in it at large with all of your other ceremonial stuff.

596
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,900
There is not one religious holiday I see in Christianity that is not based on human sacrifice, by the way.

597
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:12,840
And this is the Christian era.

598
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:16,220
This is not just speaking out against a specific religion.

599
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:20,700
When you say the Christian era or Christians, you're talking about everyone on the planet.

600
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,720
Yes, why?

601
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,000
You ever heard of something called the Pope's work schedule or the calendar, the Gregorian calendar?

602
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:34,100
That is a timekeeping nomenclature, and it's not even timekeeping in your face.

603
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,600
You can't keep time with it.

604
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,460
It's a work schedule.

605
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:41,600
If you ask anyone, by the way, what day is it, and they say anything between January and December and Monday through Friday,

606
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:45,600
they're admitting with their own mouth that they are the Pope's subject.

607
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,780
And the worst is these idiots that go out and start bad-mouthing the Vatican.

608
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,960
Just pull them over and say, what day is it?

609
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,540
And he'll tell you something between January, December, Monday through Friday unconditionally.

610
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,120
It's okay to use that conditionally.

611
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:00,160
What's called January?

612
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,020
What's called March?

613
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:01,900
What's called Tuesday?

614
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,860
Yeah, I'll meet you what's called next Friday.

615
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,100
Or I'll meet you what's called next Friday or next Wednesday.

616
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,680
Not Wednesday or Friday.

617
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,640
How can it be?

618
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,740
So anyway, is anyone paying attention?

619
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,120
No.

620
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,060
It's about mindset, folks.

621
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:20,680
So let's just say, what do cannibals' birthdays and dolls have in common?

622
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:21,960
Here's your mindset.

623
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:26,940
Keep that in mind and use that as a reference point.

624
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,300
It's all about reference points.

625
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:33,000
If you know, let's say, the tape measure in inches or feet and someone says,

626
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,760
well, you know, that board's a foot long.

627
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,620
And you're like, well, you know, I know what a foot looks like in 12 inches.

628
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,140
That looks kind of short, man.

629
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,160
Really?

630
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:40,480
Okay.

631
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,160
And you're like, this is fine to me.

632
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,500
Well, you know, there's no argument about this because I've got a tape measure right here.

633
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,380
Oh, yeah, it's 11 inches.

634
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:48,820
Oh, yeah, I see.

635
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:50,100
Okay.

636
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:50,920
No arguing.

637
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,140
Once you have reference points, there's no arguing.

638
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,900
It's part of academia, by the way, to argue.

639
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,960
Now it's creeped into regular communication.

640
00:46:59,180 --> 00:46:59,580
And you hear it.

641
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:00,940
I just want to run away.

642
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:05,880
I mean, I don't listen to Internet and all this other stuff and even anything in print anymore

643
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:08,620
because it's just the quality is too low.

644
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:09,660
Right?

645
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:16,700
I mean, most of the stuff that you see in what's called the news and other places like that are current events.

646
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,680
And who is not interested in current events?

647
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,880
Everyone is to some degree.

648
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,600
But the problem is the quality is so low.

649
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,180
Okay, folks get the point.

650
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,400
If you're listening to Uncommon Radio, you know exactly what I'm saying.

651
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:39,040
So at this point, looking at what humans can be explained or derived as objectively.

652
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,340
Now some people might say that they have.

653
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,260
No one ever has.

654
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,160
That's not how people are or denies it.

655
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,740
Just like, for example, I've been saying this for quite a long time,

656
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,680
and anyone I've ever told that anyone you've ever met, anyone you know,

657
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,740
and anyone who you're going to meet is a complete moron.

658
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,920
No one has rebutted that ever.

659
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,680
Think about that for a minute.

660
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:04,400
And I'm not saying that to be degrading or I'm saying that to be put down or this or that

661
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:11,280
or whatever prankster kind of psychological reasoning or whatever attitude reasoning you imagine.

662
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,620
It's just that I find that it's very interesting that it has not been rebutted.

663
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:22,700
It's very interesting how certain claims, yes, claims can be made regarding the typical condition of humanity,

664
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:28,880
whether how short or how long, as long as they're objective, they will be conveyed and they will stand.

665
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,200
So that's the interesting aspect of it.

666
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:41,900
So I think we've achieved part of the aspect of saying what mankind is about at this point in terms of status or the state.

667
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,640
But there's much more to mankind.

668
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,980
And here I'll just say something before we continue.

669
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:53,960
I would just suggest that mankind is so unique at this point and always has been.

670
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:59,680
And when I say mankind, it is, yes, I'm talking about the anthropomorphic form where a spirit is animated through the body,

671
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:11,280
that mankind, let's just use the term we, are being made to join the highest-ranking aspect of the highest-ranking beings in the universe.

672
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:16,120
And just because you don't see a lot of them or any of them doesn't mean they don't exist.

673
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:25,540
If you, for example, study or know anyone who studied the explicit varieties in deep-sea biology,

674
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:30,400
and I mean explicit, all the ones that are known, you will see that it will bury you.

675
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:34,020
There's so much going on down there, even though it looks barren at first glance.

676
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:38,820
Anyone studies the nature of the gods and their category, categorically of the gods,

677
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,920
you will see there's a tremendous amount of information regarding that.

678
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:44,320
And there is a hierarchy there as well.

679
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:50,900
So when we study mankind, it seems to fall apart,

680
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:58,100
because the level of division and the level of quote-unquote arguing and the level of ignorance is beyond reproach.

681
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:04,520
So let's just say, this being the sixth solo event, and almost tidying up the first hour,

682
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:11,000
I did want to get the what do cannibals' birthdays and dolls have in common out there,

683
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,120
because it is very important to comprehend.

684
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,560
Use that as your ruler.

685
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:18,780
Like earlier, there was a question regarding the progress of the war in Syria.

686
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:22,980
You can get drawn up into these little vortices, right?

687
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:27,020
And by the way, if you look at what I call the news matrix or whatever,

688
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,940
I'm not using the word matrix as what it really means, but as people use it,

689
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,560
you will see that it changes every week.

690
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:43,420
And what people are vehemently passionate about this week, they don't care at all in a week or two later.

691
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,560
So try not to get sucked up into that vortex.

692
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,840
But if you do understand regarding the question about the progressing war in Syria,

693
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:57,580
if you do understand from a reference point that there is an upcoming loose confederacy of ten nations

694
00:50:57,580 --> 00:51:01,540
forming in the Middle East, and how can that come together,

695
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,320
and the conflicts through just practical history of man's civilization,

696
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,460
you will see that this is starting to make sense.

697
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:13,560
So I would suggest that if new ideas are required to look at things,

698
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:18,560
you're going to have to go back and see what was written about similar things from times of old.

699
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,900
Well, let's just give a little bit of attention here.

700
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,760
We'll just have a few more minutes and see what can be garnered out of e-mails and chat,

701
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:27,800
just to keep this going.

702
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,000
Okay, all right.

703
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:35,680
People don't seem to comprehend you have to hold back because of other forces, man and otherwise.

704
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,800
Okay, that was a suggestion. Thank you.

705
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:43,200
And in chat, yeah, close to the second month, middle of the 28th day of the first month, Sabbath.

706
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,720
Seventh starts midday. Yeah, pretty close.

707
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,640
Someone says it's wrong.

708
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,680
The 11th is the new moon.

709
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,620
Well, on paper, here's one thing.

710
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,660
I want to bring this up, folks.

711
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:57,720
There are some pretty good references on what's called the World Wide Web regarding moon phases,

712
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:05,340
and I would suggest that you go and research how they determine a phase.

713
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:08,800
It's pretty technical, and they do say they do it astronomically,

714
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,400
which is through observation point.

715
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,500
Now, one thing that they don't give is when the datum line or when the phase actually changes,

716
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:24,660
because if these things go in a cyclical pattern, when does the moon become full and when is it not?

717
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,600
Never really quite discussed that.

718
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:31,840
Typically, let me just give a little bit of a hint for anyone who's doing both observational

719
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,840
and let's say formulative study of the moon,

720
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,680
which is where you go online and it tells you the moon phase is down to like decimal points.

721
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:44,040
Typically, I found them through the past 12 or something years of looking at that,

722
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,420
is that they're typically succeeding the point.

723
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:52,520
So, in other words, the full moon in the western world proceeds when they say it will be full.

724
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,940
But when they're like 98%, 99%, it could be full still.

725
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:03,660
Now, traditionally, the moon was rendered full when you saw it rise in the east,

726
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,800
but it was nearly the end of the 12th hour.

727
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,760
So, okay, I'm getting a little bit of a mess here.

728
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,300
29th day is – yeah, it's the 28th.

729
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,120
Yes, that's correct.

730
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,880
So I would suggest that the actual observable measurable full moon,

731
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,240
it precedes what you see on the Internet in terms of days,

732
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,940
because they're also garnering days on the Zulu time.

733
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:29,780
Okay.

734
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,800
One thing I haven't discussed specifically, and I will in the future,

735
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:38,620
this is not a teaser or holding a carrot out to get people to come over to someplace else,

736
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:44,520
but I'm just saying that whether it's being self-conscious or not,

737
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,660
I don't like to discuss a lot of these things in public,

738
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,380
even though there is a specific show called Uncommon Radio,

739
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,580
and the Greek can pretty much, according to the AFR policy, say whatever he wants to say.

740
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,760
I find that still many of the things are viewed distastefully by humanity at large

741
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,900
because of just what's been going on for so long.

742
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:08,020
So going on for so long, that's hour one, and we will see you folks at the top of the second hour.

743
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,880
Greetings, everyone, and welcome to Uncommon Radio.

744
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:18,320
Yes, and I've been looking at chat, folks, and you guys are hot about trying to figure out time.

745
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:18,820
That's good.

746
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:19,960
Is it wrong?

747
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,620
No, but it's not right.

748
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,020
And here's the interesting part about anything, folks.

749
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,880
It is fun to be authoritative.

750
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,040
It is also necessary to be authoritative and quote-unquote official sometimes.

751
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,640
But for these things, you are outnumbered, folks.

752
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,660
You are surrounded if you are interested in anything lawful.

753
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:42,020
By the way, lawful, yes, that term has nothing to do with attorneys or courts

754
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,640
or the laws that you're familiar with.

755
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,140
Lawful has to do with fit and proper.

756
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,600
Yes, I haven't used that much.

757
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:52,240
I've used set-apart much, but if you're interested in anything lawful,

758
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,780
you will not make friends, and this is the wrong planet to be on at the moment.

759
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:59,780
And yes, one day you'll have a conversation with the earth, and she will tell you the same.

760
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:05,940
So what's interesting, anything lawful is quite interesting to analyze and to know

761
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:12,840
because it makes good reference and it makes good posture for comprehending events around you.

762
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:17,760
Like there's many things we can get into, many things that we will get into,

763
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:21,280
we meaning whoever is listening to Greek speak and the Greek, of course,

764
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,360
but I just want to, because this is archived, just inform anyone who is listening to this,

765
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:31,700
there is a chat on AFR, and they are discussing, they meaning whoever is participating in the chat,

766
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,480
the right and wrong about lawful timekeeping.

767
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:42,780
Now let's just give a, because mankind is sort of the subject loosely on this sixth solo episode,

768
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:47,420
and I believe that what I wanted to define this episode with is the description of mankind,

769
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:54,100
which is what do cannibals' birthdays and dolls have in common, which was pretty much completed in the last hour.

770
00:55:54,280 --> 00:56:00,260
So right now I just want to bring up in terms of timekeeping, folks, this is just really simple in terms of lawful.

771
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,200
See, lawfully the day starts at noon.

772
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,820
Well, it's not what I believe.

773
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,760
Well, actually I do believe that because I measure it every day.

774
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:12,920
It's a good belief to have, and it's not because I'm an oddball and everyone else is this and that.

775
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:15,540
And by the way, I just want to throw something in, and we'll get back to it.

776
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:24,700
I've discussed certain concepts, economic, judicial, quote-unquote religious, scientific, with people in media,

777
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:32,840
both I'd say more alternative media, and no matter how progressive they are, very often I do get,

778
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:37,620
well, Greg, I don't want to discuss that because nobody knows about that.

779
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,880
Think about that for a minute, folks.

780
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,720
Okay, let's go back to lawful timekeeping, the day starting at noon.

781
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:48,720
Now, there's many conventions that will show you that.

782
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:54,420
For example, the timekeeping authorities that are listed perhaps in what's known as the Americas

783
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,720
would be the Naval Observatory in Colorado Springs and Greenwich is the other one in England, I believe.

784
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:03,040
They have websites, and if you study what's called Julian calendar date,

785
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:10,240
which is the format for the current calendar, which was now called the Gregorian calendar for different reasons.

786
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:16,220
If anyone would like to research the papal bull of Pope Gregory around 1580-something,

787
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:20,420
you will see the purposes behind this work schedule being installed.

788
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:25,120
But I would suggest that its format or its code is based on the Julian.

789
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:31,480
You will see on these timekeeping authorities, if you research what they proclaim about the Julian calendar date,

790
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:37,420
they will tell you for astronomical and scientific purposes the day starts at solar noon.

791
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:43,380
And other times I've read it where it said, you know, for astronomical and scientific purposes,

792
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,120
the day starts at solar noon, but for the people, it's civil midnight.

793
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:51,420
That's kind of how dictionaries, when they first started arising in popularity,

794
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:54,340
they didn't know exactly how to define words, so they said, well, oats.

795
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:59,300
It's what they feed horses in England, but it's the staple of the people in Scotland.

796
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:04,680
Kind of a put down there, but anyway, let's just say if anyone is old enough to remember

797
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:09,320
non-electronic banking conventions, if you made a deposit in what's called the bank,

798
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:15,560
because they're not banks, folks, they considered it afternoon after not necessarily solar noon,

799
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,020
but the wind-up toy known as the clock, which is another discussion.

800
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:22,760
They considered, by the way, the deposit to be accredited for the next day.

801
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:25,520
Some people like now to say, well, it's 2 o'clock or whatever,

802
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,480
but now things have changed again because of electronic convention.

803
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:34,800
There's a level of absence of anything as a reference point on that.

804
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:43,580
So when you consider noon on these old western movie courts and western frontier courts,

805
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:49,200
they would have sentencing and execution on the next day,

806
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:54,160
and there are many popular films where they'd be hanging at high noon.

807
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:59,460
So also, noon is a really good time to measure.

808
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:06,200
You see, as the day is winding down, the shadows are going towards the west,

809
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:10,440
and when the new day begins, the shadow goes towards the east.

810
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:14,320
So there's many aspects of that which will be discussed in the future.

811
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:18,980
Now, one thing I haven't gone into, this is timekeeping, lawful timekeeping,

812
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:24,540
is in terms of the day, there are 12 hours in the day of daylight.

813
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,600
Now, how you do that, and I'm just going to say this once.

814
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:30,660
If you want to replay this, it's in archives, and listen to it again,

815
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:36,340
and I will get into this more in the future, maybe not publicly, maybe so.

816
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:44,800
There are 12 hours of daylight, but the sky is divided into 10 portions to do that.

817
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:49,560
So let's say 180 degrees, you have 18 degrees each,

818
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:54,480
and remember, 6 is the number of men, 18 is 6 plus 6 plus 6 in each hour.

819
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:55,780
Each hour has three divisions.

820
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,100
So yeah, you heard that right.

821
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,480
So let's just say this.

822
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:07,900
If the sky is divided into 10 divisions, how do you get 12 hours?

823
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:11,320
Should I hang that rhetorically, or should I just keep going?

824
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:12,320
Let's just keep going.

825
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:16,040
When you are noticing that the sky is black, it's nighttime,

826
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:20,460
and at dawn you'll notice that the sky starts to illuminate,

827
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:24,360
but you do not see the sun disk above the horizon.

828
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:30,580
When that condition prevails, until the sun disk is visible,

829
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,260
that is considered the first hour.

830
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:39,760
When the sun disk is visible above the horizon, into that first tenth in the east,

831
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:45,880
in those three portions of that tenth, you will see that is the first hour.

832
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:48,460
Now let's succeed through the day.

833
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:53,880
When the sun is at the western horizon, that is the 11th hour, and you guessed it.

834
01:00:54,440 --> 01:01:01,240
When the sun goes below the horizon at sunset, twilight I guess, you still have sunlight.

835
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:05,960
It's albeit dim, and you will see that is the 12th hour.

836
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,000
So you see the disk of the sun 10 times during the day,

837
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:13,660
and the first and the last hour are the same where it's below the horizon.

838
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:17,240
Oh, interesting, the first is the last, and the last is like the first.

839
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:23,740
So that is for you men and women, mankind, time lawful, timekeeping.

840
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:29,880
So think about that, or actually don't think about that, but just have access to the information.

841
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:37,120
By the way, when people are on a path of developing a mindset that is objective and lawful,

842
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,880
it will not make you happy, it will not bring you pleasure,

843
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,680
but have you ever heard that it's better to have love and loss than to have ever loved at all?

844
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:49,200
Isn't it better to have known what's fit and proper than to have never known at all?

845
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:50,580
Think about it.

846
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:52,300
Actually, that you should think about.

847
01:01:52,300 --> 01:02:00,360
Now, let's go to the formidable topic, perhaps, maybe momentarily, is the moon,

848
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:04,520
because as I have, I don't like to necessarily go over it,

849
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:08,220
because when you do public speaking, if you make a mistake, just keep going.

850
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:12,360
No one will notice, but I just want to bring up a few weeks ago, I was not doing any observation.

851
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:17,220
It was a very important time, but I had prepared personally, let's just say,

852
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:20,020
on the Greek's personal life prior to that anyway,

853
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:25,620
but I would suggest that the moon is a very interesting way to look at it.

854
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,140
Now, the moon reckons the month.

855
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:30,840
That's why, for example, if you research how people in commerce,

856
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,000
they would always settle all their debts before the full moon came around.

857
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:39,360
That's why today they kind of keep it in a way you get a monthly bill.

858
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:44,880
You get it, it's a monthly, well, anyway, and that's why I've discussed how the credit system works.

859
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:51,100
Anyway, you can't just discuss one thing without leading to another.

860
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:56,900
Now, what's interesting about the moon is that it follows the path through the sky in the winter,

861
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:01,500
that the sun follows in the summer, and vice versa, they switch places.

862
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,800
So, the moon and the sun together mark the year.

863
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:11,060
By the way, if you ever hear of a lunar calendar, walk away.

864
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:12,700
There's nothing there.

865
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:15,260
That's just a carryover.

866
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:21,240
That is like fossilized thinking and just to accommodate a mindset that knows something is wrong,

867
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,440
but can't quite put their finger on it.

868
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:29,520
There's no such thing as a lunar calendar, and there's no such thing as a solar calendar, folks.

869
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,400
The moon rules the month and the sun rules the day,

870
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:38,200
and their paths through the sky give other determinations as the year, singular,

871
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:41,080
and the years in epochs are ruled by the stars.

872
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,660
Now, I haven't gotten into determining the year.

873
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:47,640
I have given various descriptions, but I haven't given specifics,

874
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,080
just like I will not give more specifics on the moon.

875
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:54,120
But what I would suggest is that when the moon is sighted in the east,

876
01:03:54,180 --> 01:04:00,620
it typically comes up fairly yellow, and then as it rises above what would be called the second position,

877
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:06,900
about 20 degrees or so, you would see that 20 to 30 degrees, it starts to turn bright white.

878
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:10,540
Now, what makes a full moon a full moon is not how big it is,

879
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:15,880
but it's how round it is and how bright it is for its roundness, for its area.

880
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,560
Because the moon will always seem larger after a full moon, but it's not quite round,

881
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,260
and it also comes up later.

882
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:28,260
It usually comes up after the 12th hour, after there is no light in the west.

883
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:32,200
Typically, the sighting of the new moon, which is the full moon,

884
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:38,940
you will see it's past the second half of the 12th hour,

885
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:43,400
when the sun is already below the horizon and there's just a little bit of light left.

886
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,540
So this is an interesting thing to denote.

887
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:50,620
Now, there are secrets about this.

888
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:55,220
I have given them in the past, and I knew they were heard because I had gotten feedback about it.

889
01:04:55,220 --> 01:05:03,660
But one way to determine something is by two witnesses and double verification or validation.

890
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:05,800
Now, I'm going to say this.

891
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:11,480
This might sound absurd, but anyone who has heard this before and has used it has confirmed it.

892
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:14,400
So it sounds absurd because, unfortunately, it's true.

893
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:19,440
What you will find out is that there are two full moons, folks.

894
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,740
Yep, same moon, but it's full twice.

895
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:25,900
First time, it's very, very short, and it's not in the east.

896
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:29,800
So I'm just going to leave that hanging for now.

897
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:35,480
But what's interesting is that the full moon, the first day of the month, is the first day of the month.

898
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,740
It is set apart to itself.

899
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:45,580
So the second day of the month is the first day of the first week.

900
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:52,740
So you've heard in various traditions, cultures, quote-unquote religion, and hold your wits,

901
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:54,820
the seventh day is to be set apart.

902
01:05:54,960 --> 01:06:00,600
It's known in certain languages as the seventh day of rest in their corresponding culture.

903
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:04,760
Now, what you will find is that that corresponds with the moon phases.

904
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:11,400
So that would be you have the first day of the month, and then the second day of the month is the first day of the first week.

905
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:17,360
So you count from the second day of the month, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, right?

906
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:21,960
So that's the eighth day of the month, because remember, you started counting on the second day of the month.

907
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:28,020
So the seventh day of rest is always on the 8th, 15th, 22nd, 29th of the month.

908
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:33,900
Now, that's why, for example, in the biblical text or scripture, there is the story of Jericho,

909
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:37,780
where they marched around and they blew the trumpets and the walls came down.

910
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,140
They marched around for seven days and all that.

911
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:46,540
And if you discuss any academic, anyone that has gone to school of divinity, anyone that has studied the biblical text,

912
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:53,780
and you bring up the point that what were they doing, waging war or battle on the Sabbath,

913
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:58,460
their answer is, well, God could make them do whatever they want to do.

914
01:06:59,040 --> 01:07:00,000
This is your academic.

915
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:05,440
And the reason I'm using that voice is because that's what they sound like when I hear these professionals speaking supposedly.

916
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:11,540
But that's not the case, because the irony here is they started on the first day of the month,

917
01:07:11,780 --> 01:07:15,020
and the seventh day was really the sixth day of the week.

918
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:21,860
And the story of Jericho is a primer for children to understand how to keep time,

919
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,640
because the double entendre here is that Jericho means the moon.

920
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,580
The city of Jericho literally means the moon.

921
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,400
And they also worship the moon god.

922
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,500
So what's interesting about that is that you will find these primers

923
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,740
and very small descriptions of how to learn things through story.

924
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:49,300
So I just wanted to throw that in there just to satisfy maybe if there is any interest in many of those things.

925
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:53,560
We will discuss in the future also the origin and the purpose of these books

926
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:58,160
from a perspective that is probably not public, not known,

927
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:02,560
and I think it will be very edifying to anyone who wants to hear them.

928
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:05,420
But again, these specific things will not be done in public,

929
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,140
because even though people say it, Greeks say it,

930
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:15,660
I believe that still using a public forum to discuss very specific things like this is viewed in bad taste for some reason at this point.

931
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:18,340
In the future, they will be known, and they will be discussed.

932
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:21,220
But why not give some people that are really interested a head start?

933
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:25,180
Now, the interesting thing here, going back to the timekeeping,

934
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:29,080
is that if you do any kind of a reference on what's called the moon,

935
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:33,319
you'll go to like a, whatever, they'll tell you the moon phase is 28.96…

936
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:35,740
…days long.

937
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:39,300
That's not how it goes, because they're even calling the new moon the dark moon,

938
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:44,479
which started during a time period around when the cosmic censorship started.

939
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:48,560
You can't, and the other thing here, there's a certain religion or religions

940
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:53,380
that count the day ending at sundown and the new moon being the dark moon.

941
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:55,020
And that is absurd and ridiculous.

942
01:08:55,660 --> 01:09:01,080
Not because I say so, because it is objectified as being absurd and ridiculous.

943
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:06,580
You cannot take a measurement at sundown or with the dark moon.

944
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:11,580
So, you folks that do that kind of stuff, wake up!

945
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:17,720
Anyway, I don't think really even strong coffee or anything else is going to wake you up at this point,

946
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:19,800
because you are subject to cosmic censorship.

947
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:24,260
Now, this is not because it's being dogmatic or whatever,

948
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:29,840
but when you say something is lawful, it needs to garner a form of measurement.

949
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,140
Because if you can't measure it, you can't manage it.

950
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:35,779
How can you measure sundown or a dark moon?

951
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:37,620
Hmm? I'm listening.

952
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:39,600
Okay, I thought so.

953
01:09:41,859 --> 01:09:43,479
Anything lawful has to be measurable.

954
01:09:43,859 --> 01:09:46,120
That's why, for example, when you look at the money system,

955
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:49,300
they tell you the Federal Reserve notes, everything you guys are using in the credit,

956
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:51,000
the way you're using it, is unlawful.

957
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:54,060
Just because everyone does it, doesn't mean that it's lawful.

958
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:55,300
Okay?

959
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:56,740
There's nothing there to measure.

960
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,420
I've discussed how the credit system works.

961
01:09:58,440 --> 01:09:59,180
There's nothing there.

962
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:02,000
People say, well, I have to wait for money to be wired.

963
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,340
There's nothing going to be wired.

964
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:04,840
They can't wire anything.

965
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:05,520
It's created.

966
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,020
They're just messing with you.

967
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:15,300
So, when you start looking at the lunar cycle being 28.6457... days,

968
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:16,700
you're being messed with.

969
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:22,340
When the day ends at sundown, you're being messed with.

970
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,880
When the dark moon is the new moon, you're being messed with.

971
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:26,980
Yeah, it's fun to mess with people.

972
01:10:27,100 --> 01:10:30,920
That's why apparently, I mean, it's been done for so long.

973
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,500
Now, personally, I don't think it's fun to mess with people at all.

974
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:36,160
When I say mess with people, take that word however you want.

975
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:43,160
So, in essence, there's something called mixing where, you know,

976
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:45,400
there are certain things that you might say are absolute.

977
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:51,620
I'm not speaking in absolute terms, but I am suggesting that when something is

978
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:57,520
considered to be lawful, it also instills and incorporates a form of measurement

979
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,000
that allows one to objectify its lawfulness.

980
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:08,020
In geometry, that's, for example, known as the construction of geometric figures.

981
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,440
In order for a figure to be lawful, it has to have certain attributes in terms of

982
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,120
angles and sides and things like that.

983
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:20,600
So, when I say lawful, it should hearken the concept of measurement and management.

984
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:21,680
Okay?

985
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:25,360
Now, let's just go for just a quick recap.

986
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:30,660
High noon is very easy to measure, and also the full moon is very easy to measure.

987
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:35,520
And when the two shadows correspond of the moon and the sun, that is your equinox,

988
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:38,440
because equi means to measure or equinox meaning night.

989
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,680
So, yeah, if you're confused, that's quite well,

990
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,380
because welcome to planet Earth.

991
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:49,720
So, I just wanted to get into those points, because these are for man, by the way.

992
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:57,480
If you leave the subjectivity of the Earth, your objectivity of the sun and the moon

993
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,300
change radically.

994
01:11:58,520 --> 01:11:59,880
By the way, I'm going to just throw this in there.

995
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,820
If you were to leave the Earth, you would be able to still perceive the moon,

996
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,440
but you will not perceive the sun.

997
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,100
Let's just throw that in there for future discussion.

998
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:13,000
So, in terms of mankind, his purpose and all that,

999
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,580
let's just go back before we continue, if we do,

1000
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:18,360
and see what has been thrown around in the chat,

1001
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:24,820
because there's one way to continue something known as Uncommon Radio

1002
01:12:24,820 --> 01:12:26,620
by seeing what people would like to hear.

1003
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:31,200
Oh, it says, okay, U.S. just had an airstrike in Syria.

1004
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:37,440
Well, yeah, well, was it John Matthew Bright's U.S. just had an airstrike in Syria.

1005
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:39,460
Damn, they really want to get the pipeline going.

1006
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:41,840
That's not about a pipeline, but it seems like it.

1007
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:44,460
Yeah, well, the U.S.

1008
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,340
Well, everything that's in there is from the U.S., France, and England.

1009
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:50,020
It goes through various things.

1010
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,740
Have you ever heard of, you know,

1011
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:59,400
anything that shouldn't be done is done by those who tell you you shouldn't do it?

1012
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:06,360
Have you ever heard the term, by the way, do as I say, not as I do?

1013
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:09,160
Yeah, that's what's going on.

1014
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,100
But, you know, they're going to have their airstrikes.

1015
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:17,320
There's going to be – let me just say, just discussing mankind.

1016
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:26,480
I've said this before with previous sonic experiences and episodes.

1017
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,640
This thing you guys call war with dropping bombs and bullets and other things like that,

1018
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:37,700
the state of capability of mankind to wage war is typically done that way.

1019
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:45,840
But what people fear with that type of embattlement is that it will wipe out a whole people.

1020
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,240
It usually doesn't.

1021
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,760
It's a form of terrorism, typically.

1022
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:55,380
Nuclear devices, tactical nukes, as you see, have been used through history.

1023
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:56,380
Actually, you probably haven't.

1024
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:01,840
You're probably just aware of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and all that other stuff that's been put in front of you.

1025
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:05,940
But, for example, nuclear ordnance is an act of terror.

1026
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:09,220
It has no strategic purpose, even though they call them strategic.

1027
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:14,540
And I still see – there's some news sites I do go to occasionally,

1028
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:17,180
and they do say, oh, nuclear attack, nuclear – so what?

1029
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:21,580
Basically, a nuclear device is like hitting a hornet's nest with a baseball bat.

1030
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:25,540
It will be rapid and destructive, but guess what?

1031
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:26,600
It's left over.

1032
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:28,160
Lots of angry hornets.

1033
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:37,400
So the use of high-speed chemistry and shorting out dielectrics, which is known as atomic energy –

1034
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:42,460
I shouldn't have said that, but I did anyway – is essentially a form of terrorism.

1035
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:46,820
The way people are wiped out or genocided is through biologicals.

1036
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:47,560
Sorry, folks.

1037
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,180
And through something called radionics.

1038
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:57,400
You don't need guns and tanks and bombs to do – if you wanted to eliminate a group of people.

1039
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:58,580
It's not done that way.

1040
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:01,600
What you are witnessing is an industry.

1041
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:07,980
It's basically the legal society and the banking society that are doing this.

1042
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:14,260
This meaning not the conflict and waging misery on a society,

1043
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:19,160
but the way it's done, as you see, with tanks and guns and planes and bullets.

1044
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:23,240
I had a conversation recently.

1045
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:27,660
There was a major mainstream media outlet about 10 or 12 years ago.

1046
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,640
There was, I think, a squirmish between Lebanon and Israel.

1047
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:32,540
And it was a JAG officer who came on and said,

1048
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:34,080
Basically, war works like this.

1049
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,240
The attorneys call the other country and ask for money.

1050
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:37,300
If they don't, we bomb them.

1051
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,820
That's what's going on.

1052
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,420
But you can't discuss this because people don't.

1053
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:44,460
Anyway, we will.

1054
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:47,680
Whoever is willing to listen,

1055
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:52,320
we're willing to bring forward any information regarding these matters

1056
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,080
so you can go back and measure what's happening.

1057
01:15:55,620 --> 01:16:03,160
But the horrors that are going to be put into what's known as nations in the Middle East are only just beginning.

1058
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,860
But there's going to be a respite.

1059
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:10,500
I think I've mentioned there's going to be a tremendous amount of brutality and bloodshed,

1060
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:13,260
very rapid, that's going to be occurring in the future.

1061
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:19,400
Not this year, not next year, but in the near future around that few years from now in other places.

1062
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:22,060
Yes, it is very unfortunate.

1063
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:31,060
But this is a society mankind has learned and has adapted legitimizing savagery.

1064
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:33,140
Yes.

1065
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,500
So it is unfortunate.

1066
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:40,080
But nonetheless, let's see what else is in chat before we continue.

1067
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,780
But I hope we're throwing certain topics around here.

1068
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:45,240
There's a lot to be discussed.

1069
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:51,780
And if anyone is more interested, the archive is a good way to go back and listen to it again, perhaps, if needed.

1070
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:56,920
And there's also communication that could be had at www.uncommonradio.com.

1071
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:04,300
You could email the Greek and perhaps I'll entertain or consider anything that's being written.

1072
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:11,000
So, okay, I see there's still time discussion on the chat, which is important.

1073
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:20,080
It's a hell of a lot more tangible and rational than a lot of other things I've seen being discussed about the earth and society at this point.

1074
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,000
How can these things be measured if you have nothing to measure with?

1075
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,900
There's a lot of guessing going on.

1076
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:35,980
And hopefully that anything that could be said to get away from the guesswork is really where it's at, at least for a rational perspective.

1077
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:40,920
So in terms of mankind, what else can be discussed about mankind?

1078
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:42,400
Well, here's the thing.

1079
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:51,220
You're going to be, as a society, I've mentioned if you've heard Greek speak before, you're in the credits part of civilization.

1080
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:59,300
And what that means technically is that civilization is still going, but it ended, just like a film ends when the credits are rolling.

1081
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:00,880
But technically the film is rolling.

1082
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:05,100
But if you came in when the credits are rolling, the film is really over.

1083
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,760
The major storyline is over.

1084
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:11,560
And the credits have very specific characteristics, which lend themselves to be known as the credits,

1085
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:15,340
which show things that you had not seen during the film and they're less interesting.

1086
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:23,980
So when you consider this, bear in mind that this type of talk that you hear regarding the Middle East Union

1087
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:28,740
and there's roughly around 15 or so years left for most people on this planet,

1088
01:18:30,620 --> 01:18:37,700
when these times start to manifest, the mindset is going to be completely the opposite.

1089
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:44,200
Roughly by the mid-2020s, most people on this planet, I should say all people on this planet,

1090
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:51,860
except for a very, very, very, very small group, will be aware and will be completely enthralled and enticed

1091
01:18:51,860 --> 01:19:00,560
and intent on not only believing, but living in a perfect society, which will be pledged and manifested.

1092
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:03,360
Yes, there will be no war.

1093
01:19:03,620 --> 01:19:10,100
You will not have any of the conditions that you consider to be maladies around that time period.

1094
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:17,600
You will have a new world order that is in place that is not the old world order, new world order that you hear bantered about.

1095
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:24,000
That new world order that's been talked about for the past century or so is going to support this one.

1096
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,620
This is going to be completely different.

1097
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:33,080
It is still going to be based on a lot of the goddess religion things that you're familiar with now.

1098
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:37,420
Have you ever heard of the legal society, the medical society, education society, entertainment industry?

1099
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:39,820
That's all goddess religion stuff, right?

1100
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:41,540
She's a malevolent goddess.

1101
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:46,580
But like anything malevolent, they always present themselves as being benevolent.

1102
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:55,620
But again, back by the middle 2020s, you will have a bona fide, almost perfect society on the planet.

1103
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:56,420
Why?

1104
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:59,360
It will not be propagandized, by the way.

1105
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:09,620
You will see that it will be sort of, I should say, well, materialistically, it will be tangibly considered a perfect society.

1106
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:20,460
Now, the reason why you're getting this is because when the gods do – see, when man does war with man, he softens the opponent and then does the kill shot.

1107
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:28,360
When the gods do war, they raise their opponent to their highest position and best and most optimum position and then go with the kill shot.

1108
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:30,320
This is what people will not understand.

1109
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:41,420
So again, this type of conversation and information that you do hear imparted through Greek speak will almost not be possible around that time period because no one wants to hear it because what are you talking about?

1110
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:42,440
Look at this.

1111
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:44,520
This is a perfect society.

1112
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:49,040
And the more perfect it seems to become, the closer you are to the kill shots.

1113
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:53,000
Now, this is – try to keep this light.

1114
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,840
There's a tremendous amount of specifics.

1115
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:59,160
There's a tremendous amount of more information that can be given and discussed.

1116
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:05,640
And I think that in about a year, that time will be where more of it can or will be discussed.

1117
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:14,980
And then after a few years after that, it will probably start to go away and shut down because the manifestation of this new reality is going to begin,

1118
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:27,080
especially around the 2021-2022, what you call 2021-2022-2023 time period which is prior to the formation of this Middle East Union.

1119
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:40,240
None of this kind of talk will be acceptable because you will be made promises that pretty much the conditions are going to last a thousand years and you're all going to believe it.

1120
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:41,240
Yes.

1121
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:45,280
So when I say you all, you know who you are pretty much all of you.

1122
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:56,060
So the interesting part here is when you want to discuss mankind, is it perhaps a way to discuss mankind in generality from the beginning to the end?

1123
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:58,600
What of a better place to start than the beginning?

1124
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:02,000
But when you look at the finish line, it's very much like the starting line.

1125
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:03,300
As a matter of fact, it's the same.

1126
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:11,920
So discussing mankind is important, especially if it's the six solo event because the number corresponds to man.

1127
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:21,780
And I also want to just bring up again, if anyone brings up, evokes the number six or 666, that has nothing to do with the main adversary that's ruling the planet, by the way.

1128
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:37,760
The only thing it has to do with that main adversary is that the one that is identified with that 666 is going to be probably the only and the first human to be possessed by the adversary.

1129
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:38,420
Yes.

1130
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:49,760
So anyway, there's some pretty interesting stuff to get into that as well, which will not be possible, by the way, when these things are manifesting, if you get my drift.

1131
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:56,220
So one thing to say is that it's a very interesting time.

1132
01:22:56,300 --> 01:23:05,080
I think I've said even on air that any of the patriarchs and the old holy writs would have given their left testicle to be alive today.

1133
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:08,180
And most people don't even realize what's going on.

1134
01:23:08,580 --> 01:23:10,780
Because, look, there is a certain setup.

1135
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:12,340
You're being set up.

1136
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:19,540
And in order to be set up, if you know that you're being set up, it's not a setup because you'll resist it.

1137
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:23,940
Another way to think about it is that avoidance of a trap is knowledge of its existence.

1138
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:33,220
But certain things are just so appealing that the possibility of it being an entrapment is just maybe secondary because it just looks so good.

1139
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,360
And this is something to consider about human nature.

1140
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:46,600
But the purpose of man, one thing I just want to throw out there again is that I had a conversation with a caller a few weeks ago.

1141
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:54,760
And the suggestion was to discover who you are, where you are, and when you are, and then food, clothing, and shelter.

1142
01:23:55,620 --> 01:24:01,580
Now, that sounds really base, and was the comment on that proposal.

1143
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:10,900
But when you go on a path to improve and discover who you are, when you are, and where you are, and food, clothing, and shelter of highest quality,

1144
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:18,100
there is nothing that cannot be known by mankind that you will not run into on the way of improving and discovering those things.

1145
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,160
So bear that in mind.

1146
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:20,940
Why?

1147
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,620
Have you heard all things in moderation?

1148
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:24,420
Yes.

1149
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:25,420
But you know what, folks?

1150
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:26,640
Nothing exceeds excess.

1151
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:38,840
So I just wanted to say that if you discover that you, humanity, mankind, in this technical, functional form, and spiritual, which is also technical, are made up of three things.

1152
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:49,840
You're made up of a mind, a breath, meaning a living metabolism, and a body, which body will exist and constantly change depending if it's alive or dead.

1153
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:59,760
So again, the mind, which in English typically is the PSY prefix, or in Greek would be the convention that is used.

1154
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:14,960
Whenever you see the psyche or the PSY, as in psychology, psychotic, psychopath, psychiatrist, PSY prefix denotes the mind, which is the spirit, which is what makes you you, your mind, or the mind.

1155
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:22,780
Whenever you see the PNU, pneumatic, or pneuma in Greek, or pneumonia, PNU, that is the soul.

1156
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:23,620
That is the breath.

1157
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:26,760
That is something that is in the nostrils, and it's part of the metabolism.

1158
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:33,020
And then when you see the carne or the body, the carnal, that is the body.

1159
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:33,940
That is the flesh.

1160
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:39,240
That is the almost identical elemental composition as the soil.

1161
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:42,580
Okay, so that's the three things that you're made up of.

1162
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:45,020
And by the way, I've said this many times, I'll say it again.

1163
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:50,540
All these quote-unquote gurus and people think they're so spiritual, ask them to define soul and spirit, watch what happens.

1164
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,360
Can't do it.

1165
01:25:55,200 --> 01:26:01,080
Can't do it, because you're not supposed to project this type of knowledge the way that it's being done.

1166
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:03,600
And their reward is ignorance.

1167
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:12,780
You ever run into someone called a guru, or a spiritualist, or an astrologer, or a psychic, or a wizard, or a witch?

1168
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:13,520
Right?

1169
01:26:13,660 --> 01:26:14,620
You ever run into these types?

1170
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:15,620
They're all over the place.

1171
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,380
Intuitive, right?

1172
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:22,660
The way they're projecting it unlawfully, their reward is bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh.

1173
01:26:22,820 --> 01:26:23,020
Right?

1174
01:26:23,260 --> 01:26:30,180
So you might hear them using a particular language, but when you put the Babelfish translator on, all you're going to hear is bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh, bleh.

1175
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:31,760
Right?

1176
01:26:32,340 --> 01:26:34,460
So, you know, do you want some candy?

1177
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:43,220
And one way to prove that to these idiots, by the way, is ask them to define soul, ask them to define spirit.

1178
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:50,260
And they will give you a million reasons why it's not those two things, but they can't give you a reason for why anyone can know.

1179
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:53,020
No one can know is one of the things I recently heard.

1180
01:26:53,640 --> 01:27:00,560
Anyway, I just want to throw a little dig in there, because look, if you're going to sit around and put a dig on seven and a half billion people,

1181
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,280
that's going to take a really long time.

1182
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:09,820
So you just take these large swaths at a time, just slap them in the tuchus, like they say in Yiddish or whatever, and kick them out the door.

1183
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:14,100
And that's perhaps – because no one is doing that.

1184
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:15,860
I don't know if anyone can do it at this time.

1185
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:22,240
And the other thing I wanted to just bring up – this is not a rant, but you old folks out there, you guys like over 50 or 60,

1186
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:25,100
you've got to start talking to young people.

1187
01:27:25,100 --> 01:27:27,620
But the problem is, listen, I feel you.

1188
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:30,100
You really don't know Jack.

1189
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:31,760
So what are you going to say?

1190
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:32,400
Nothing.

1191
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:34,160
But here's the thing.

1192
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:34,800
I know Jack.

1193
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:36,860
Anyway, who's Jack?

1194
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:43,420
So one of the things, if you watch, folks, that's why the old people have been rewarded with being thrown into nursing homes,

1195
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:47,100
completely drugged up, and they slap a pair of diapers on them.

1196
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:49,640
Yep, that's what the old folks have been.

1197
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,560
All have been reduced to a band of fools.

1198
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:52,480
And I say all.

1199
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:53,840
I mean pretty much all.

1200
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:57,660
I haven't met any that are not foolish or heard of any that are not.

1201
01:27:57,900 --> 01:27:59,740
And by the way, it's not what you believe.

1202
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:05,660
If you like what someone is saying and you really like them, that's not what I'm talking about.

1203
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,380
Are you listening to what's being said and measuring it up?

1204
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:09,620
Do you have any reference points?

1205
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:16,760
Next time you have a family gathering, hang around the old people and ask them some questions.

1206
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,480
Don't even bring up Greek-speak stuff.

1207
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:20,240
We're not using like what's lawful as a measure.

1208
01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:21,040
Just really listen.

1209
01:28:21,780 --> 01:28:22,360
What's happened?

1210
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,580
You young folks are in deep, deep doo-doo.

1211
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:29,520
Yeah, because, see, the old folks used to be bastions of wisdom and experience,

1212
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,220
but now they've been reduced to a band of fools.

1213
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:39,960
Not only that you're not only at home, let's say, or personal, go into public places,

1214
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:42,940
listen to the older people, even on the Internet, alternative media.

1215
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:47,040
Listen to these old folks, not too many of them, but you got to wonder.

1216
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:50,380
Yeah, you're in big trouble, you young folks.

1217
01:28:50,660 --> 01:28:51,540
Can't turn to them.

1218
01:28:51,540 --> 01:28:56,680
Now, you can go to anyone you like, and you might think they've got wisdom and knowledge or whatever,

1219
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:58,040
but I'm telling you they don't.

1220
01:28:58,260 --> 01:28:58,540
Sorry.

1221
01:28:59,240 --> 01:28:59,960
You know, why?

1222
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:00,820
Measure it.

1223
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:05,880
Anyway, I just thought I'd throw that in there because there's a whole bunch of stuff going on

1224
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:10,220
that you folks are still not aware of, and it's in your face, and it's obvious.

1225
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:15,980
Because, remember, if you're going to go out and make any discoveries, it's nothing far away.

1226
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:17,480
It's the obvious.

1227
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:21,160
Yes, yes, and when you discover the obvious, it's not going to make you happy.

1228
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:26,840
Because, well, it should make you happy because it didn't take a lot of traveling to find it, did it?

1229
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:29,480
It was right there in front of you.

1230
01:29:30,100 --> 01:29:38,620
So, anyway, regarding mankind, again, just to go back, there's not much time to discuss these things,

1231
01:29:38,820 --> 01:29:42,120
a few years at least, but at least it is being discussed, right?

1232
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:48,660
And the other thing about mankind is once you discover who you are, the spirit is the mind,

1233
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:54,200
the soul is the breath and the metabolism, the life force that pulses through you,

1234
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:59,940
and also nitrogen is the primary constituent in mass or in volume of air.

1235
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:04,260
You ever notice you're breathing nitrogen mostly?

1236
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:06,240
Think about it.

1237
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:07,480
What do you know about nitrogen?

1238
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:09,640
Oh, it's the oxygen that you need.

1239
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:10,580
Yeah, yeah, you need oxygen.

1240
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:11,340
You need all of them.

1241
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,920
Yeah, but you're breathing your nitrogen breathers.

1242
01:30:16,240 --> 01:30:19,020
So, that's by observation, right?

1243
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:21,000
And you've got to know about the body.

1244
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:23,380
You're not a filter bag, are you?

1245
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:25,720
No, you've got things absorbing, huh?

1246
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:29,940
If you've got anything absorbed into the body, you'll be dead in a couple of days.

1247
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:31,540
It's called sepsis, folks.

1248
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:33,820
You're completely sealed up in a vacuum.

1249
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:35,900
Yeah, go figure that out.

1250
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:37,280
Don't ask any old people about it.

1251
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:40,960
They won't tell you or a wizard or an intuitive or whatever.

1252
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:44,500
Yeah, they'll tell you a million reasons why you're absorbing,

1253
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:46,680
but they can't explain it, of course, because you're not.

1254
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:52,060
So, you're going to have to, yeah, grab a boot.

1255
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:57,700
Anyway, pull your pants up, tighten your belt, and start walking around like a man

1256
01:30:57,700 --> 01:31:01,140
or like a woman if you're a woman or whatever.

1257
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:05,300
You know, put your chin up and realize that, yeah, you've been lied to.

1258
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:07,400
Why do you think they tell lies to children all the time?

1259
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:08,480
To prepare you for the world.

1260
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:14,300
Now, what's going to happen is you're going to need to figure out what's going on in front of you first.

1261
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:17,900
And that's really the thing about mankind is, you know,

1262
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:22,260
if you want to think how big the Earth is, you know, it's really, really large, right?

1263
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:23,300
Well, yeah, it could be.

1264
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:25,160
You know, it's relative, I guess.

1265
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:26,680
You know, it depends on how big you are.

1266
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:29,780
And there's a lot of things to see, a lot of places to go.

1267
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:33,480
But what I've noticed is that when people typically, through the lifetime, went on vacation,

1268
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:36,860
they're all wondering about if they locked the door or not or when they're going to get back.

1269
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,500
So why even bother going on a vacation if you're stressing that?

1270
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:48,000
You get a big-ass flat-screen TV and throw in videos of Madagascar if you're interested.

1271
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:48,960
Don't waste your time.

1272
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:49,600
Be effective.

1273
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:52,220
Be efficient, right?

1274
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,420
I'm not saying that all vacations are a waste of time, but just think about it.

1275
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,180
So mankind is don't be enthralled, you know.

1276
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:02,360
Mankind has been led down all these things.

1277
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:07,380
You're being told through society and your whole life what is good, what is bad, what you should do, what you shouldn't do.

1278
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:07,660
Really?

1279
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:10,340
Yeah, all of that holds true to a certain degree.

1280
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:12,940
But, you know, what do you know about yourself?

1281
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:16,300
And if you answered you think you want to know more, that's correct.

1282
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:21,360
And you don't need some esoteric feeling to lead you in that direction.

1283
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:27,680
What is necessary is to perhaps pull the veil slightly away from the cosmic censorship.

1284
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:35,480
If you're heavily censored, by the way, you will not understand any of this or comprehend or see its importance.

1285
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:37,280
Not that it's important because I'm saying it.

1286
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:42,100
But if you don't think that knowing who you are, where you are, and when you are,

1287
01:32:42,660 --> 01:32:47,280
and food, clothing, and shelter of the utmost quality that you want to afford or can afford is important,

1288
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:49,580
you're really not of good character.

1289
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:53,520
And it's not meaning that I'm demeaning those who are not interested or not of good character.

1290
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:55,500
But let's just go back and measure.

1291
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:02,560
You ever hear about people talking about politics or the economy like there's really money?

1292
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:07,640
Or the body like you take these drops and you'll feel better?

1293
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:09,600
Yeah, you know what I'm saying?

1294
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:13,660
Go get to know these people personally and you'll see that their diet sucks.

1295
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:16,040
They don't know what food is and good food is or anything.

1296
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:18,460
And they put crappy fluids into their body.

1297
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:22,820
I think one time the Greeks said that people who put crappy food and crappy drink into their body

1298
01:33:22,820 --> 01:33:25,280
are promoting poor character.

1299
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:29,080
So next time you hear people talking about these categories,

1300
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:32,000
get to know them a little bit more and you'll find out they eat junk.

1301
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:33,760
And you eat junk, you think junk.

1302
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:35,020
Can't help it.

1303
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,820
Anyway, this is something to think about, not a criticism.

1304
01:33:39,260 --> 01:33:42,460
If you could criticize what's going on in the community at the same time,

1305
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:45,320
make it positive for who's listening, why not?

1306
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:50,520
What you're going to find out is as you improve your intake, what passes through the body,

1307
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:54,040
you're going to notice that your attitude, your energy level,

1308
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:59,480
and your cognitive ability will be better as well, especially if you eat seasonally.

1309
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:03,680
And if you know how to dress, by the way, you're going to feel a lot better.

1310
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:06,180
By the way, never buy shoes you can't run in.

1311
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:08,020
Think about it.

1312
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:09,840
And shelter.

1313
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:11,440
Make sure your shelter is clean.

1314
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,100
It doesn't mean spraying chemicals around.

1315
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:18,240
And if you've got those nasty cleaning chemicals in what's called a living space,

1316
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:23,640
develop a chemical box or a chemical closet outside of where you live and sleep.

1317
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:26,420
And if you're in one of these apartments or something

1318
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:29,840
and you can't keep those strong chemicals in the apartment, let's say,

1319
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:34,220
just ask if you could put them somewhere else, like down the hall or in the basement somewhere.

1320
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:38,840
Or if you really can't keep them outside of the living space, don't use them.

1321
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:43,660
A really good cleaner, by the way, is like hydrogen peroxide and water in a spray bottle

1322
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:45,860
or a little bit of alcohol in a spray bottle.

1323
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:47,180
Yeah, alcohol's not going to kill you.

1324
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:52,140
By the way, you folks in AA and all that, you're mentally sick and you're unrehabilitatable.

1325
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:55,040
Alcoholics Anonymous, I just want to say this.

1326
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:57,260
I ran into a couple of people once who mentioned alcohol, like,

1327
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:58,660
I'm going to touch alcohol.

1328
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:00,440
I said, you've been in AA, and they're like, yeah.

1329
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:08,060
One of the most demoralizing, demonic, downright satanic organizations man has ever put forward

1330
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:09,900
is Alcoholics Anonymous.

1331
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:10,380
Why?

1332
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:13,660
Because most people think they're being helped.

1333
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:14,680
No, yeah, that's true.

1334
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:16,520
Because the worse it is, the more people want it.

1335
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:20,160
But because it is demoralizing the human spirit.

1336
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:26,840
It is getting the individual or the idiot or the moron to go in there and admit that they are a behavior.

1337
01:35:27,180 --> 01:35:27,700
Think about it.

1338
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:30,040
I have never seen a more demoralizing.

1339
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:35,760
Now, I'm not talking about someone locked in a basement in a cage that's being urinated and defecated on every day,

1340
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,620
saying they would admit certain things.

1341
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:41,760
I'm talking about overt public, because there are worse things in Alcoholics Anonymous.

1342
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:46,720
Like being locked in a cage and never seeing daylight and being defecated and urinating on

1343
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:48,300
and admitting that you like it.

1344
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:52,520
I'm talking about public stuff that anyone can access.

1345
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,280
It's far worse.

1346
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:57,000
And what spurred this on, by the way, is just a commentary.

1347
01:35:58,240 --> 01:35:58,940
Think about it.

1348
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:00,980
So anyway, back to the alcohol.

1349
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:04,860
A little bit of isopropyl, or if you get Everclear, which is moonshine,

1350
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:07,040
a little bit of that in some water in a spray bottle.

1351
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,060
Excellent cleaning.

1352
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:11,380
Hydrogen peroxide, which is acidic and oxidizing.

1353
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:12,620
Excellent cleaning property.

1354
01:36:13,460 --> 01:36:16,300
So now you keep the living space, your shelter, clean.

1355
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:18,380
The shelter you're using, clean.

1356
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:23,120
Now, unfortunately, many of the modern materials outgas all this crap.

1357
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:24,940
Always leave a window slightly open.

1358
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:26,140
Promote good circulation.

1359
01:36:27,560 --> 01:36:28,920
So pretty much covered everything.

1360
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,040
Where you are.

1361
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,920
Well, we covered who you are.

1362
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:34,000
Well, maybe.

1363
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:35,020
When you are.

1364
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:36,200
Maybe you've covered that.

1365
01:36:37,780 --> 01:36:39,200
And food, clothing, and shelter.

1366
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:41,640
Food's been covered in archives.

1367
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:44,380
I'd like to discuss it, but at least how to think about it.

1368
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:47,800
Yeah, can you take someone who's got a lousy character

1369
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:50,740
and make them good character with good food and good water?

1370
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:54,180
No, not really, but it does help, and it is a major factor.

1371
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:56,460
It is a variable.

1372
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,460
When the variable is changed, the equation changes.

1373
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:02,420
Or it's a variable in the equation, I should say.

1374
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:05,040
Get the right one, and everything adds up.

1375
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:07,260
And then shelter.

1376
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:10,840
Don't poison yourself and the shelter you're using

1377
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,800
with cleaning chemicals and things.

1378
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:16,220
Just use basic water and basic soap.

1379
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,700
By the way, have you ever heard about soaps cause cancer?

1380
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:20,600
You know, these artificial soaps and dish soaps?

1381
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:21,420
You know what?

1382
01:37:21,460 --> 01:37:23,520
It's the fragrances that do that.

1383
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:24,260
Yeah.

1384
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:30,060
So unless it's one of these like adjuvetic or organically made fragrant soaps,

1385
01:37:30,060 --> 01:37:32,600
if it's got one of those toxic floral smells,

1386
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:35,820
that's the stuff that makes you sick, not the surfactant or the soap.

1387
01:37:35,980 --> 01:37:37,000
So think about that.

1388
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:38,060
Yeah.

1389
01:37:38,420 --> 01:37:41,400
So that's pretty much the general coverage for mankind.

1390
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:46,980
The rest of it is just a matter of being present.

1391
01:37:47,540 --> 01:37:50,360
I always tell people, you know, doing a particular project or something,

1392
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:51,940
I need a lot of bodies, is it a show?

1393
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,040
I don't know anything about that.

1394
01:37:53,380 --> 01:37:55,280
See, if you show up, that's 90% of the work.

1395
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:58,460
Well, if you showed up on this planet and you're at Manifest,

1396
01:37:58,460 --> 01:37:59,960
you're about 90% done.

1397
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:04,880
The other 10% is up to you if you're going to set yourself apart or be part of it.

1398
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:08,420
So we actually have someone coming in on Skype.

1399
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:10,400
We just have about a quarter of an hour left.

1400
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:12,600
Let's see if it's possible to add them to the group.

1401
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:13,540
Let's give it a shot.

1402
01:38:14,440 --> 01:38:16,180
And we'll see if it comes up.

1403
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:21,830
Seth Michael, let's see if he does come in.

1404
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:27,800
We'll try him again.

1405
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:31,500
Maybe the board can bring him in.

1406
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,180
For some reason, he is not coming in.

1407
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:37,800
I know Seth's got lots to say, or it appears that he does.

1408
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:41,960
Maybe AFR can bring him in, can drag him in, because he was trying to call in.

1409
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,360
We have less than a quarter of an hour left here.

1410
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:49,940
So this being the giving some notoriety to being the sixth time around,

1411
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,020
I just like to bring up things in accordance to how they are.

1412
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:55,200
And also, folks, don't forget, it's springtime up here.

1413
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:59,420
You've heard the Greeks say that in the spring it's really quiet.

1414
01:38:59,540 --> 01:39:01,020
It's when things are planted to grow.

1415
01:39:01,860 --> 01:39:06,600
Even throughout history, since when is where the noise is being made,

1416
01:39:06,660 --> 01:39:08,980
where it's really happening, where it's really at?

1417
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:09,720
Think about it.

1418
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:10,740
Very rarely.

1419
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:15,100
Giving you folks an example, you've heard of something called the Great Depression

1420
01:39:15,100 --> 01:39:17,020
and all that other stuff, a lot of noise being made.

1421
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:20,760
You know what they pulled under people is that they're under a credit-based economy

1422
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:24,520
and everything is paid for, but you can't tell people that because human nature is so shitty.

1423
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:26,120
Yes, I use that biblical term.

1424
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:27,420
Dung.

1425
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:30,220
So think about it.

1426
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:34,980
Right now, there's a lot of stuff that people are making noise about,

1427
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:37,220
and you've got to look at where it's quiet.

1428
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:40,160
And how are you going to find it if it's quiet?

1429
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,580
It's not going to take your attention.

1430
01:39:45,420 --> 01:39:47,940
You kind of have to keep it in the back of the mind.

1431
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,960
Like, for example, if you're running a retail store

1432
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:52,480
and a bunch of guys have a fight in aisle six,

1433
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:56,820
you should direct someone to go and check out what's going on

1434
01:39:56,820 --> 01:40:01,400
and at the same time, you should go and run and go look and see if the front door,

1435
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:04,200
entrance and egress door, and the cash register is okay

1436
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:06,680
because typically when something like that happens,

1437
01:40:07,180 --> 01:40:11,680
it's a distraction for the money or to pull the register and run with it.

1438
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:15,120
This is maybe an old-school thing to say, but you get the picture.

1439
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:23,480
So controversy or controversy is always profitable,

1440
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,940
and there's no way to make a profit, by the way.

1441
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:31,240
It's a credit-based economy when you think about it.

1442
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:35,860
So Seth, if you're listening, I see you're trying to come on for some reason.

1443
01:40:36,620 --> 01:40:38,920
I cannot bring Seth Michael in.

1444
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,980
I'm sure he can say a thing or two.

1445
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:45,060
And if we had AFR present, maybe they could bring him in.

1446
01:40:45,180 --> 01:40:46,520
I don't know if AFR is listening.

1447
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:47,940
Oh, okay, that's fine.

1448
01:40:47,980 --> 01:40:48,920
He's probably having a connection.

1449
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:52,060
Okay, so a connection issue.

1450
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:53,860
So there you go, folks.

1451
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:58,260
How much can you stress something that's considered an idea?

1452
01:40:58,780 --> 01:41:00,760
See, if it's just an idea, is it worth stressing it?

1453
01:41:00,820 --> 01:41:01,900
Well, no, not really.

1454
01:41:02,180 --> 01:41:03,300
Is it worth just saying it?

1455
01:41:03,340 --> 01:41:03,720
Absolutely.

1456
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:10,400
And I think taking what's being said however you want to take it could be important

1457
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,980
or just trivial if you can even understand it, by the way.

1458
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,460
So learn to discern and be objective.

1459
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:22,300
Another thing about mankind, which I would just maybe want to suggest,

1460
01:41:23,060 --> 01:41:27,380
and just to, I don't know, there's much to say,

1461
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:29,240
but the other thing to consider about mankind

1462
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:33,100
and how basic the existence here on this planet really is,

1463
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:37,540
is you are the only, well, I should say,

1464
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:44,340
there is a cognitive ability regarding the society of the gods that mankind has.

1465
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:49,660
In other words, the supernatural beings, the other side, that is very unique.

1466
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:57,640
And at that point, what that does for you is that you're never really alone.

1467
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:02,100
And the other thing what that does for mankind is that you're going to be

1468
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:05,460
interacted with whether you like it or not.

1469
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,700
Have you ever heard of things called dreams?

1470
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:08,980
Those are not your own.

1471
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:09,660
You're being plugged.

1472
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:12,800
Yeah, regardless if you want to believe that or know that,

1473
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:15,300
you will find that out later, might as well just say it now.

1474
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:16,460
Okay?

1475
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:20,560
And the other thing about that is there's various forms of assistance,

1476
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:22,580
both good and bad, from the other side.

1477
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:29,200
And there's also various forms of acknowledgments from what mankind can do

1478
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:30,780
regarding the other side.

1479
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:37,380
And because of his limited lifespan and because of the world of the unseen,

1480
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:43,080
man is solely reliant on the memorialized information to really have proper

1481
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:43,720
knowledge.

1482
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:47,000
Just, like, for example, going back to the concept of dreams,

1483
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:51,600
if you don't have proper knowledge of the spiritual realm,

1484
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:55,020
you will not be able to manage the dream state or shut it off if it's

1485
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:57,360
negative or encourage it if it's positive.

1486
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:01,460
Or I would suggest that anyone that does have proper knowledge would not be

1487
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:05,420
encouraging any plugging in to the mind or the spirit while you're asleep

1488
01:43:05,420 --> 01:43:07,800
because that is a time of recuperating the body.

1489
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:13,100
Now, most of the intuitives, pagans, atheists, or whatever,

1490
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,720
they like the dreams because they don't have proper knowledge

1491
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:19,300
and they don't know what's going on, and sometimes best to not know.

1492
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:22,920
Because the last thing you want is an entire population that is aware of

1493
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:25,820
what's going on, and that might just affect the plan.

1494
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:33,820
But one thing that I would suggest is that mankind is almost a perfect vehicle

1495
01:43:33,820 --> 01:43:37,920
to interact between the physical world and the nonphysical world just by the

1496
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:41,760
elements of creation that were put in place for him to exist.

1497
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:43,300
You're not an animal.

1498
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:45,120
That's the thing I would suggest.

1499
01:43:45,540 --> 01:43:48,660
I mean, there's so much to say, but mankind might share some of the

1500
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:52,920
mechanisms and organs and things like that, but mankind is not an animal

1501
01:43:54,340 --> 01:43:54,820
spiritually.

1502
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:59,300
And he is the medium or the in-between, the go-between,

1503
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:01,420
the gods and the material world.

1504
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:05,900
But unfortunately, the cosmic censorship, which had to be put in place

1505
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:09,680
2,500 years ago, otherwise, I don't know.

1506
01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:13,220
Folks, if they were in full knowledge of what's going on, you probably would

1507
01:44:13,220 --> 01:44:16,680
have wanted to leap off this planet a few thousand years ago,

1508
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:19,040
or a couple thousand years ago and not be around.

1509
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:22,920
And then they'd have to gather you all about like the frog and put him back

1510
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:24,160
in the water, back in the pot.

1511
01:44:24,980 --> 01:44:27,960
So there's a curing period that has to be comprehended.

1512
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:32,000
Things have been discussed through Greek-speak, and fortunately,

1513
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:34,920
that period is almost over.

1514
01:44:35,140 --> 01:44:38,440
And unfortunately, it's almost over because it's going to be very,

1515
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:39,180
very dynamic.

1516
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:44,880
But the inclination that I would give anyone, well, the inclination that can

1517
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:49,360
be gotten from Greek-speak is that you're going to have to start referring

1518
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:54,320
and start looking at things that have come before you because the ancients

1519
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:55,200
were not ridiculous.

1520
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:56,220
They were not ignorant.

1521
01:44:56,220 --> 01:45:00,740
You are always being given the vision that they were backwards and ignorant

1522
01:45:00,740 --> 01:45:04,720
because of sandals and horses and various things like that.

1523
01:45:04,780 --> 01:45:06,120
That was not the case.

1524
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:11,020
There were qualitative decisions and limitations that were put on the

1525
01:45:11,020 --> 01:45:14,940
ancients in contrast to make you seem like you're modern because you have

1526
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:17,200
airplanes and cellophones and things like that.

1527
01:45:17,380 --> 01:45:18,240
That is not the case.

1528
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:21,760
There were interactions and other things that were done that were far beyond

1529
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:24,220
what is being done in the modern world.

1530
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:27,640
So there is no reason to discount that.

1531
01:45:27,980 --> 01:45:30,620
And believe it or not, just like anything, it's like a muscle.

1532
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:35,220
Once you start comprehending everything that's been memorialized prior to this

1533
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:38,140
society by other societies and civilizations,

1534
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:42,100
what you're going to discover is how many holes have been deliberately left

1535
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:44,640
there, how much is being censored from you,

1536
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:47,920
and how similar everything kind of is.

1537
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:52,140
So one thing, again, if you're looking for new ideas,

1538
01:45:52,140 --> 01:45:54,460
go back to some old information.

1539
01:45:55,440 --> 01:46:00,280
And being man or woman, when I say men or man, it also includes woman,

1540
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:06,360
you are extremely unique and extremely powerful to come, though,

1541
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:07,460
not at the moment.

1542
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:10,340
And I want to just bring something up to that.

1543
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:15,780
You're being talked about and talked at that you are wonderful individuals.

1544
01:46:16,300 --> 01:46:19,380
And you have all this power and you can do anything you want or whatever.

1545
01:46:19,380 --> 01:46:22,520
You hear this all the time in all forms and shapes and forms of poetry,

1546
01:46:22,700 --> 01:46:25,900
media, and instruction in general.

1547
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:30,100
But when you start dealing when specific people individually deal with other

1548
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:33,500
individual people, that message tends to fall apart.

1549
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:37,260
And what you get is you have to be like everybody else.

1550
01:46:38,660 --> 01:46:44,260
So there is a level to consider what society will be and what mankind will be.

1551
01:46:44,260 --> 01:46:47,880
It will not have the vile, when I say vile,

1552
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:50,940
and repugnant hypocrisy that is in place right now.

1553
01:46:51,620 --> 01:46:58,460
And what I'm discussing here is not like this might be considered an alternative

1554
01:46:58,460 --> 01:46:59,640
media platform.

1555
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:03,620
When you turn into these alternative media types,

1556
01:47:03,820 --> 01:47:07,280
they're always bashing, quote, unquote, the conventional government,

1557
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,680
corporations, and whatever, whatever.

1558
01:47:11,180 --> 01:47:12,460
This is not it.

1559
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:17,380
The vileness and the hypocrisy, it begins at home.

1560
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,540
It starts with the parents and the children.

1561
01:47:20,420 --> 01:47:22,240
It starts within the group think.

1562
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:24,720
Gustave Le Bon talks about the crowd.

1563
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:28,760
If you start listening to all these people everywhere,

1564
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:32,140
you will start finding out there are crowds forming.

1565
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:35,420
And you'll notice that the faster and the larger the group,

1566
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:38,960
the less cognitive or dumber they are.

1567
01:47:39,380 --> 01:47:42,060
So this is a fact, folks, on this planet.

1568
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:44,120
These are facts about mankind.

1569
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:47,480
It might sound dogmatic because you don't like it.

1570
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:51,240
But I will suggest that pursue things that are pleasant.

1571
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:58,180
But unfortunately, if you're going to have measurable and lawful things that are of

1572
01:47:58,180 --> 01:48:01,200
quality, you will not find them in crowds,

1573
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:02,760
and you will not find them in groups.

1574
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:11,120
Typically the best things in life are sequestered and are held more separate.

1575
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:14,140
So pursue the best things in life.

1576
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:16,040
This is solo number six.

1577
01:48:16,820 --> 01:48:18,220
Thank you for coming, everyone.

1578
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:19,300
We'll see you again soon.
