00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
Greetings everyone and welcome to another sonic experience with the Greek, also known as Uncommon

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:12,540
Radio, perhaps also known as Uncommon Sense Radio or Greek Speak, or if you kind of hear it, it's

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:19,560
too late. So, by the way, it's what they call April, according to the Pope's work schedule,

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:27,320
roughly the 13th in the year 2017, according to their Lord. And let's just say, lawfully,

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,240
I'm reckoning, it's the middle of, just past the middle of the first week of the second month,

6
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:36,920
or roughly the fifth day of the second month till noon. So, let's see if there's any

7
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:43,620
clashing of the brain cells on that. And I do see a little bit there, yeah, regarding in the chat,

8
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:50,820
by the way, this is a very interactive experience, sonic experience. So, when this is,

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:58,300
the liturgy of this event is conducted, let's say that callers are welcome, the chat is engaged,

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,800
emails are engaged, because it's really, you guys are the guests. In other words,

11
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,320
if you are listening to this, even though if it's further down the road, you are still a guest to

12
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,320
it. And like a little joke, like what does Greek speak and heavy artillery have in common? Once you

13
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,200
hear it, it's too late. Notice I didn't say if you, but let's just say again, to go back for

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,820
date time, because it's not just a matter of nomenclature, just dating the quote unquote show,

15
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,360
as they call them. It's a matter of also, I wouldn't say poking fun, but yeah, don't you

16
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,000
want to kick them in the shins a little bit sometimes, or who's they? But what's lawful

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,980
is what can be measured. Now, most people think it's what they call April 13th. And by the way,

18
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,040
most people will glaze over when you bring up this topic, and they'll just have a real shallow,

19
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,960
dumb look on their face saying, I don't know what you're saying, man. But for those of you that do,

20
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,540
on the Pope's work schedule, it's April 13th, 2017. I know I'm being redundant,

21
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,880
but it appears to be just past the middle of the week of the first week, let's say,

22
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,540
of the second month. So it's roughly the reckoning, roughly the fifth day of the second month.

23
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:11,960
That's interesting. By the way, I want to thank, I do get some messages, Skype and email and such,

24
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:18,180
and someone had been doing some pretty good reckoning. And let's just say, from a radical,

25
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,880
truthful perspective, I heard the Greeks say that when you measure time regarding lawful time,

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,040
things that are measurable using the sun, the moon and the stars and other positions as such,

27
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,220
you will find that events repeat themselves accurately. And I had some confirmation on that.

28
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:38,320
Now, it was slightly anomalous because there was a 13th month, but nonetheless, the lineup was so

29
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,660
precise. So I want to thank people that report back on what is lawful. Of course,

30
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,960
just to reiterate real quick, I would just say that lawful just means it's measurable. And if

31
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,840
you can't measure it, you can't manage it. You ever wonder why there's so many managerial problems?

32
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,640
Well, anyway, speaking of managerial problems, if you'd like to join the, I wouldn't say

33
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,460
conversation, but if you'd like to join the sonic experience and partake and contribute

34
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:10,820
using what's considered the normal telephone lines, it would be 218-339-8525. And that would

35
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:19,500
be again, 218-339-8525. And if you prefer using the Skype convention, you can go to the uncommon

36
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:28,340
radio.com www.uncommonradio.com. And the email for the Greek and on that site is also the Skype

37
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:35,100
contact. So you would actually type in uncommon sense radio one at gmail.com. And that's a numeric

38
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,840
one. And that in the Skype search box, if you'd like to join in Skype now also looking at the

39
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,440
chat, which happens to be on American freedom radio. And by the way, if you are hearing this

40
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,560
now and didn't get all that other information, you can go to the American freedom radio homepage

41
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:56,900
and you will see on the left, there is a call in number in red with a box around it is on the left.

42
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:03,660
If you don't see it on the left, it's on your other left. And that would be 218-339-8525. So

43
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:09,760
with that said, it seems like right out of the gate, you know, it seems the topic can be regarding

44
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,040
time and what's lawful. It's a good way to segue into other things. And speaking of segueing into

45
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,260
other things, it appears to be around the seventh solo episode of the Greek. And we've been numbering

46
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,440
these on the archives solo one, two, three, all the way down. Now, what's interesting about that

47
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,980
is that earlier I stopped from saying join the conversation because this is not a conversation.

48
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,560
When the Greek speaks, he doesn't have conversations. He talks at people. Now,

49
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,120
does that sound rude? Yes, it sounds rude, but is it rude? It's not. If you've been on this planet

50
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,400
long enough, and you can classify the surface dwelling earth inhabitants as I won't say it

51
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,580
because I've said it enough. Some people think they find it offensive, even though they do like

52
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:57,320
to listen to what's being said. It is a reality that is just not, let's just say, discussed in

53
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,400
normal dialogue. So if you like to want to be talked at, or you want to talk at the Greek and

54
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:10,220
the audience, please call in and partake. But nonetheless, being solo, I just want to again,

55
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:18,000
bring up there, there's a project that's pending. And it's going to be somewhat different. And why

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,580
is it going to be different? Well, the interesting thing is because it's not only going to be

57
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,600
informative, because information is not only the key that people think it is. The information is

58
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,320
what you get inside after you get the keys and unlock the door. And you need a mindset for that.

59
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,720
You ever take out some keys in the dark, and you can't find which one fits in the right. Okay,

60
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,600
you get the picture. It's going to be regarding a mindset. The whole thing is how to develop an

61
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,640
objective mindset. And no, these are not memory techniques or objective techniques.

62
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:53,120
It's just a very simple, organic way of discussing how things are, and why they are perhaps. So maybe

63
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,220
you can irritate people by explaining things instead of just describing them. So this is the

64
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,880
seventh time around in the last time, kind of mentioned six being a number of men and got into

65
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,060
a little bit of what the structure in terms of explanation of why things are going on the way

66
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,740
they are, is and that is basically what do cannibals birthdays and dolls have in common,

67
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:24,120
and that would be archived. And that is a typical Greek cliche type stuff. But if you've ever heard,

68
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:29,260
I just want to tag along on last week's thought there, you ever heard having your cake and eat it

69
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:36,240
to that's pretty much stems off of that. What do cannibals birthdays and dolls have in common?

70
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,740
When you hear people having their cake and eat it to literally it means I can have my child and

71
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,920
eat it also. Because you're really hell bent on that stuff as humans. But here's the thing.

72
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,340
One thing that I had done on another recording, somewhere on the internet, I had described why

73
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:59,360
there is a obsession with human sacrifice. And I wouldn't say in a lascivious manner, but tends to

74
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,820
be once you know what it is, the gynic and phallic symbolism throughout society, whether it's an

75
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:13,040
just symbolism throughout. And then of course, how the concept of sexuality has been bandied about

76
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:19,600
in many ways, you know, expressed, whether it's natural or unnatural, meaning unnatural,

77
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:26,320
meaning part of the goddess religion. Because if you want to understand, there are spiritual

78
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,360
beings influencing the earth. And just like here, I see someone in the chat. Yes, seven is about the

79
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:40,620
will get into that as well. Thank you, young Matthew. I would just suggest that just a few

80
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,020
more things. When people when you hear things being discussed, or even in print, or even university or

81
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,100
anything like that, you'll notice that the information sounds like it's being packaged

82
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,380
like it has a lot of value, but it really doesn't. That's one of the reasons why Greek speak is being

83
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:00,400
done. So, you know, when the gods come up, it usually goes to we don't know it's what you

84
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,600
believe or their ets. And it seems like everything has been flushed away and no one wants to look at

85
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,120
it. And seriously, mankind has a serious case of the fox and the grapes. That's a Aesop's fables.

86
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,920
If you're not familiar with Aesop fables, maybe you might have heard of the hare and the tortoise.

87
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,500
And well, he did one called the fox and the grapes. And that is a really good description

88
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:26,020
on the attitude and the mindset. So I just wanted to add one more thing to the pretty much like an

89
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,919
addendum to what was discussed about what do cannibals birthdays and dolls have in common.

90
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,440
And just to tag along how this obsessive nature of development of gynic and phallic symbols and

91
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:43,440
human sacrifice has been, you know, through society all throughout society so much that you get used

92
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,220
to it just like riding a bike. You don't think about it. You don't think about walking. You don't

93
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,380
think about riding a bike or tying shoelaces when you reach a certain point of alleged maturity.

94
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:59,420
Now, what's interesting about that is you can search many forms of holy writ or other writ,

95
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,040
and you see that mankind being an agricultural based creature, even though right now you think

96
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,600
you're modern and information based, you're not. You could lock a computer geek in a room

97
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,320
without anything agricultural. He won't even have pants on, by the way, or she, and you'll

98
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,260
probably starve within a few weeks. Yes, a few weeks, because you can stay alive, whatever.

99
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,200
So you're all agriculturally based. Now, the thing about the production of life on earth,

100
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:33,600
let's say the production of life on earth, maybe we'll re-coach that a little bit. The continuation

101
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:45,220
of life on earth through procreation with most things tends to be with a seed and a fertilization

102
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,580
of that seed and so on and so forth. You might call it the polar opposite of male and female,

103
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,560
and they both have a seed, for example, that comes together and you form that procreation.

104
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,460
That's why, for example, when mankind was considered through holy writs and others

105
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:07,600
to be the most important creature on the planet, meaning the steward of everything here natural,

106
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,080
he is important. But what is the most important part about man? Well, obviously,

107
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,340
you could say the heart. You could say, well, the lungs, the internal organs,

108
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:26,160
the brain. That could be contested. And also, why are we discussing or why was importance discussed

109
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:32,240
in significance? Ultimately, it was just the agricultural perspective of how does man continue

110
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,220
and what that continuation or procreation is based on is obviously the most important organ.

111
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:45,120
And that would be the gynec and phallic aspects that you see in architecture and

112
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,440
quote-unquote pagan culture, which you will see throughout Christendom and other religions as

113
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,040
well, because they are as such as well, very much so. By the way, if you're running anyone

114
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,480
that insists that they are pagan, I mean, that's a really good candidate for the next pope.

115
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:08,380
But anyway, I would just say that when you consider these things in a metaphor, you would

116
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:14,020
say the most important thing for the farmer other than the production and yield and bringing to

117
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,780
market is that he has seeds for his next year crop. Otherwise, he's temporarily or only an annual

118
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:25,340
farmer. So in order for him to continue, he needs to have some seed. So what the consideration was

119
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:30,660
with mankind, where does the seed come from? It is the sexual organs of genitalia. And that's why,

120
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:36,000
again, you see it throughout architecture and symbolism. But nonetheless, when offerings were

121
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,040
made, it was the best of what you produced. Okay? Now, what is the best of what mankind can produce

122
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:51,220
in this realm? Yes, a child. That is the product of the seed and the procreation mechanisms and

123
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:58,120
organs. Henceforth, the human sacrifice. This is the type of inspiration that humanity has had

124
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:06,400
for thousands of years. Essentially, it was decided, inspired, and put into effect.

125
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,920
But the most important organs were the genitalia, because they considered the ability to procreate

126
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:19,560
and keep man going. And the offspring was the product of that, which led to the sacrifice to

127
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,540
these demons and things like that. So when I say demon, meaning spiritual beings that were

128
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:29,720
influencing mankind of low tier type, which is a typical thing that most people, when they consider

129
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,600
gods or angels or religions across the board, they are actually just considering these lower

130
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,400
entities. They know nothing about the higher entities. They might in passing and in literature

131
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:45,140
and allude to it, but it seems to be still very much taboo to discuss these with accuracy.

132
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,160
So I wanted to throw in the aspect of why you see this obsession with human sacrifice,

133
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,120
especially of children, and of the Gainix symbols and all that throughout. And by the way,

134
00:12:56,180 --> 00:13:02,960
this is a first. I've looked high and low, but I didn't look low enough. Anyway, I looked high and

135
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,120
low on what they call the World Wide Web, and I have not found anything similar to this. So it

136
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,640
adds value to what's being said. It actually makes the Greek feel like he could stop what he's doing

137
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:19,460
and do this two-hour thing once a week here. But again, pending, there is a project that will have

138
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:26,380
much more information. It won't be this strange stuff that I hear, well, we're giving you the

139
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:32,580
truth, but in my opinion, okay, well, we've got a serious problem here, a little bit of

140
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:38,780
schizophrenia. But anyway, there's a level here of sanity that you folks will find in the future

141
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:45,240
in certain projects that you will find unnerving because you're not used to it. And it will not be

142
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:53,880
pedantic. It will be expressive and explanatory and hopefully edifying. And why not? Because

143
00:13:53,880 --> 00:14:00,160
ultimately, tonight, we're going to be speaking about the gods to some extent, based on other

144
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,600
input, of course, no pun intended, because one of the first sonic productions I've done here with

145
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,220
Ocelli was all external input. And it is managed by the gods. And again, I just want to reiterate

146
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:20,820
the piss poor, the just very piss poor quality of information and what they might call the

147
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:29,420
information matrix, and also the desire of people to learn more about this situation known as

148
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:35,340
man's relation to the gods. Because when you discuss the gods, it's a temporal aspect of

149
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,940
the lifetime that mankind experiences is too short to take these things seriously.

150
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,340
People don't want to think beyond their lifespan. And now you've heard perhaps there are certain

151
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,140
groups that do and fine for them, but I'm discussing people in general. And once you

152
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,880
kind of get an idea of what is going on with the infrastructure, and I've typically given the

153
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:01,300
metaphor, people ride, let's say an infrastructure of a subway system, and they just partake for 20

154
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,400
minutes or an hour a day. They don't really think about what went into it and what it's really about

155
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:13,600
and the effort and the cost and all this. This is almost the same way analogously how people

156
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:22,800
experience their lives on earth. And it's very simple, folks. Let me just throw something else

157
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,700
in. The influence of the gods is on everything. Now, whether you acknowledge it or not or know

158
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:34,340
it or not is not relevant. What is relevant is that a statement like that is true. That is the

159
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:39,820
interesting part about it. Now, the hypocrisy that you find within the entitled classes of any

160
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:47,960
field, whether it's legal, medical, judicial, economic, or even the religious fields, those

161
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:54,220
that have come out of certain ministerial schools, divinity schools, Bible colleges,

162
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,540
it's all the same. These people are in those positions that are trained as professionals in

163
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:06,880
simply to accommodate the mindset of humanity. They have very little information or even the

164
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:13,900
proper mindset. Just without getting into bantering about the entitled classes, who you

165
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,140
call professionals, because that's simple. Anyone who is even half aware sees that they're all

166
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:24,000
idiots. Now, all of them are not necessarily idiots, by the way, because there are a few who

167
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,940
do find out that it's all a scam and they try to make an exit strategy to get out of it.

168
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,400
But the ones that stay definitely are. Now, here's the thing.

169
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:42,840
If there was true education offered on mankind society, no one would go. No one would partake

170
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:48,080
because real education would be so far and different and in contrast from the mindset

171
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,160
that's been instilled for so long that they wouldn't recognize it as such. It would just be

172
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:58,080
gobbledygook to them. So, there's many ways to look at this and we'll discuss more of that in

173
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:04,020
the future using certain exercises of perception. The thing is, do you see what you see or do you

174
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:09,160
see what you want to see or do you see what you think you see? Do you know how to see? You have

175
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:15,540
eyes, but can you see? You have ears, but can you hear? That's why maybe we'll dedicate most of this

176
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:21,680
time on maybe expressing some of the aspects of the number seven as well as the relation to the

177
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:27,800
I haven't looked at the chat. Hopefully, we're going to start steering this sonic event

178
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,160
perhaps into it. So, let's see. We have someone here. Jan is messaging.

179
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,700
Greek, you mentioned in a past broadcast one-third of the gods will be forced down to earth in the

180
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:45,460
future. Will they inhabit human bodies or will they just influence from the unseen realm both?

181
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,000
And even when they're inhabiting a human body, you can have someone x-rayed and you won't see it.

182
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:55,020
There's sort of a counter-spatial. This is a counter-spatial issue which we'll discuss in

183
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:01,480
the future on another project. Now, folks, you have to remember that, yes, there is an audience

184
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,160
for each quote-unquote episode that you hear or go to, but essentially, this is still public

185
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,180
speaking even though if it's private thinking or private conversations, let's say, that just

186
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,900
happen to be on a minor internet platform, it doesn't matter. It still is public and you have

187
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,400
to realize, folks, that the truth, yes, I don't like using that word because everyone's sort of

188
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,520
using it and it's turned into something not very good, but things that are actually accurate and

189
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,460
lawful are, when you start discussing them, they're viewed in bad taste. It doesn't mean

190
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,640
that I'm intimidated by it because I think I've suggested that this planet isn't inherently

191
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,780
inhabited by surface-dwelling earth inhabitants that are specifically, you guessed it, yes.

192
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:48,920
So the issue is not a matter of discussing it because everyone thinks or not discussing it's

193
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:54,320
in bad taste. The issue is the way to do it is a certain way and there is something about live

194
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,740
radio that you're getting right now and even most people get it down the stream. It's in a can,

195
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:04,480
but the future stuff will not be live. It'll sort of be pre-recorded and what's interesting is

196
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:11,340
it'll still be in a neat package and many packages and it'll be useful to most. Well,

197
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,580
it should be useful to anyone who subscribes to that form of thinking.

198
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:21,460
Now, many people say, well, just because I don't think like you, does that mean that what I'm

199
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,680
thinking about is wrong? And I'm like, wait a second, you're presuming that you know what

200
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:30,340
thinking is, you see, because if you've ever heard someone says, well, I don't think like you,

201
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,840
so that can't, you see, so right away that means that they don't even understand that thinking is

202
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:42,860
objective, you see, so it's kind of like what the legal society, what has done to mankind

203
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:51,100
and or any aspect of society. This is the thing before we get more into the gods and also see

204
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:57,020
what questions are posed. One has to comprehend that the more malevolent the force typically

205
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,260
that's designed to be long-term malevolency, the more benevolent it appears,

206
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,160
right? And a good counterfeiter will always make it look like the real thing,

207
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:14,320
the perception of what the real thing or the genuine article should be like, right?

208
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,500
This is where humanity has been. So you're pretty much in a really piss poor shape,

209
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,240
but on the other hand, if you've ever heard Greek speak before, the advice is to do absolutely

210
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,480
nothing because the most important thing for you, yes, you, if you're listening,

211
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:35,060
if you have a general lifespan that those that are descendants of Adam do, which you know what

212
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:41,300
the general lifespan is, you should absolutely consider the most important things in the life

213
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:46,660
that you're living to be food, clothing and shelter and also to consider discovering what

214
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,780
you are made of. You are made of three things and we'll get into that as well.

215
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,020
A spirit, a soul and a body and yes, if you'd start discussing these things with accuracy,

216
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,800
not because the Greeks said so, because you can discover them accurately on your own.

217
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,960
Just like if you're on the telephone and someone says, well, you know, I'm selling windows. I'm

218
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,720
bringing one right over. How big is the window in the room? Well, just a second. I've got a tape

219
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,440
measure. Anyone could look at this stuff, but you don't because you're under the influence. Anyway,

220
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:22,540
you will see that things are not quite as you've thought them to be, but let's see,

221
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:31,180
where were we? To discuss things that people inherently shun. Finding out that you're made

222
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:36,500
up of a soul, a spirit and a body, by the way, when you discover any kind of ancient holy writ,

223
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:42,560
that is brought up very often. I actually had the misfortune today. I've said I don't do this,

224
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,140
but I actually did it for two minutes today. I went around the web and I landed on some

225
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,380
internet radio somewhere and fortunately, I was wearing plastic on the shoes because I didn't

226
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,620
step in shit directly where I had to wash it off the shoes. I just peeled the plastic off and all

227
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,160
the shit fell off real quick. But anyway, that's just a hint. If you're walking through the dog

228
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:05,300
park, put those plastic booties on. So I turned it on and these people are professing reincarnation

229
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,800
in Buddhism and all that. I'm like, what a bunch of idiots. Not that these people are specifically

230
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:15,320
idiots, but just general, you know, idiocy that you see from humankind. And they're discussing

231
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:21,040
aspects of reincarnation in Buddhism and you will not find that in any Buddhist doctrine,

232
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:27,900
by the way. As a matter of fact, these people are so stupid that they're actually, I dropped

233
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,720
some things and I actually saw some links that the Buddhists say, well, how can you reincarnate

234
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,340
if you don't have a soul? So they don't even know what the soul and the spirit and the body is.

235
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:42,060
So when you run into an idiot, a good mark of an idiot is that they believe, quote unquote,

236
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,780
reincarnation over and over and over and all these other religions. When I say other religions,

237
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,680
I mean the conventional religions. And by the way, before we get into the gods,

238
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,220
in prior sonic events, I used to like kind of dispel a biblical cliche. Not because,

239
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,800
oh, the Greek says it's this, because anyone can see it. It's like, wake up, you know, don't be

240
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:07,480
whatever, asleep. You know, it's kind of dangerous falling asleep behind the wheel eventually.

241
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,100
One of the myths I used, well, I dispelled most of the common ones, which are directly

242
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:20,540
mistranslation. But here's one that is kind of based on rationale. And I just want to suggest

243
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,200
this, you know, this is what they call, I'm not going to say it, it's a pagan holiday or whatever

244
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,280
in the springtime, you could guess what these morons are doing, which has nothing to do with

245
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:33,100
anything other than what they've been led to believe. But you know, there's something called

246
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,880
the New Testament. And if you run into someone that's in this convention, by the way,

247
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,400
I'll just say it, this is the Christian era, secularly. It doesn't matter what your religion,

248
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,720
you are the historians, who are typically atheists, considered to be the Christian era. But

249
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:54,340
nonetheless, chocolate eggs and Easter bunnies and stuff, I said it, oops, ridiculous. But

250
00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:00,260
here's the thing, a lot of people that I do come in contact with have fallen for this syndrome.

251
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,840
And they always bring up what's called the New Testament. Now, you've heard me say, yes,

252
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,160
it's one contiguous document. And actually, in reality, it's not even a public document,

253
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,160
but it was made public. But it's fine, because no one will understand anything in there anyway.

254
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:17,580
But the interesting thing is, a certain event happened, let's just say at the resurrection

255
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,720
of the Christ. And almost immediately within a few days or weeks or so, people were,

256
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,840
let's say, tasked, called out and tasked to do something was to spread the Gospels,

257
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,040
what they say in the religious thing. And I'm like, well, hey, wait a second.

258
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:35,140
How are they going to spread the Gospel when it wasn't even written yet?

259
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,940
I'm going to take a pause here and have a sip of coffee. I want you folks to think about that.

260
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:50,110
Because what you're reading about, when you do read the New Testament, are written accounts that

261
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:55,130
were memorialized for recordation, which I will get into in the future more accurately of what

262
00:24:55,130 --> 00:25:00,730
they really are, much later than when those events happened. So when they were told to go spread,

263
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,990
just like when you see people today, well, you got to do this and that, and they're talking,

264
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:08,410
well, not even New Testament, so it's Churchianity, not even Christianity, but Churchianity,

265
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:13,530
because Christianity doesn't really exist. It's broken up. There's many, many thousands of

266
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:18,930
factions that they all go to battle with the same crucifix, you see. But anyway,

267
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:27,630
the thing about it is this. How were those men initially tasked? And when they cursory look,

268
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:33,330
reading into the Bible, what they saw on TV, or church, or Sunday school, or the movies,

269
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:39,430
that they were preaching or teaching the Gospel when it wasn't even written yet. That sounds kind

270
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:44,550
of interesting, but if you're listening on common radio, it should be turning your head inside out

271
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:53,490
like a sock by now. But this is one of the rational dispelling of cliches that are out there,

272
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:58,650
and we will get into the future of what more accurate descriptions of what was going on.

273
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:05,090
But just for the sake of it, this is a seasonal thing or whatever. When you look at the movement

274
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:10,350
that came out of the first century out of the Middle East, what's called the area of Judea,

275
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:18,610
and you as people believe that Christianity and Judaism came out of this first century event,

276
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:26,550
you are completely wrong. You are just as deceived as saying that 19 Arabs with box cutters

277
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:33,270
hijacked the plane and flew it into a 200,000 ton steel tower that disintegrated into dust in

278
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:38,790
eight seconds. And if you believe that, you'll believe pretty much anything. Now the reason why

279
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:44,290
you have the ridiculous official stories that Oswald shot Kennedy, and the 9-11 story, and all

280
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:51,130
these other things is because you have fallen for, yes, you guessed it. Now I'm not anti this,

281
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:55,110
because if you didn't fall for that, you would fall for some other stupid shit. But anyway,

282
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:02,350
this is just the nature of humanity. So just to discuss the gods, and maybe perhaps not discuss

283
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:08,050
the gods, but maybe beat around the bush, so to speak, because discussing them is very, very

284
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:12,550
arduous. I mean, which one are you discussing? The only thing you can discuss about the gods

285
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:18,070
publicly is just make people aware of the general outline, which is still so piss poor.

286
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:26,950
Now there are, you do have the ability, anyone does, by the way, to look at a hair under a

287
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:32,150
microscope. You might even look at several hairs, or a tuft under a microscope. But you will,

288
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:36,550
unless you know where it originated from, or you're able to see, let's say, the animal that

289
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:40,990
it came off of, you don't know what kind of animal that hair comes off of. They all look very similar.

290
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:48,110
Some are extremely identifiable, most are not. So I would say that at this point, just discussing

291
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:55,450
the overall creature, let's just say, is an interesting aspect to it, which is still severely

292
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:02,750
lacking in any circle, whether it's the entitled classes. Now by the way, you might have heard some

293
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:07,130
Greeks speak before, if you have more than an eighth grade formal education, you have irreparable

294
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:16,290
damage to your spirit. What does that mean? Salvage what you can. And I took a pause there,

295
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:22,890
because I'm serious about that. So the irony of humanity at this point is they're actually proud

296
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:30,030
to associate themselves with credentials higher than that. It is just absurd. So most likely,

297
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:33,810
by the way, there is something called cosmic censorship, and I never really got into

298
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:38,870
the aspect of cosmic censorship too deeply. Most people haven't asked. Maybe I'll touch

299
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:45,310
on that a little bit more. If you've ever heard any Greek speak, that cosmic censorship is brought

300
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:48,930
up. And I'm going to perhaps tie that in why I say do nothing at this time period.

301
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:55,390
But maybe just to do a quick recap on the gods, because being redundant is sometimes the way to

302
00:28:55,390 --> 00:29:00,970
go. When you see someone in the second grade and they can't pass the second grade, most likely

303
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:04,370
they're going to do it again. But by the way, since I brought up education before, this is just

304
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:09,670
a commentary on humanity again. What is the most degrading thing you can do to anyone, especially

305
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:15,790
a child? Could it be grading them? Think about it. So when people talk about they had a good

306
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:20,550
education, or they went to a good school, or they need better education, I would just stop and say,

307
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:25,030
hold on a second. Do they have grading in that system? They're like, yeah. I'm like, uh-huh.

308
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,010
Okay. So how is it going to get better? Just because a fast food restaurant serves

309
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:33,570
something that you think is better, guess what? It's still fast food junk food.

310
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:38,330
So you're not going to get that. You're not going to get real education. And like I mentioned earlier,

311
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:43,710
because you wouldn't recognize it, it would be just as alien as anything else that is alien to

312
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:48,690
you. You would just run away from it. I assure you that. Now, you will have education in the next

313
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:53,570
society, but not this one for sure. Now, again, I want to get into just a simple profile of the

314
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:57,310
gods. But one thing I want to throw in here, just as a little bit of a dig on humanity,

315
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:03,330
not on your leaders, by the way, and also tie it in with why I say you shouldn't do anything other

316
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:08,850
than good quality food, clothing, and shelter, and learning about what you're made of, soul,

317
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:13,590
spirit, and body. And someone once mentioned that sounds kind of base and superficial,

318
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:20,050
but if you pursue high quality food, which includes drink as well, food, clothing, and shelter,

319
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:24,350
and you pursue knowledge of what the spirit, the soul, and the body is, you're going to pretty

320
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:28,770
much encounter knowledge of everything else in between as well. It's kind of like one of these

321
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:33,890
alluring things that seem really simple on the surface, but end up being all-encompassing in

322
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:40,850
detail once you engross yourself in them. But just for a dig on mankind, one reason to show that you

323
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:46,030
are, well, censored, first of all, the majority of people are censored, but not you, the listener,

324
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:56,070
specifically, that you are in the credits part of humanity, and the censorship is very strong,

325
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:01,270
and no one is noticing that any discussion, any public discussion, whether it's political,

326
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:08,570
judicial, economic, religious, entertainment especially, you can go on and on, is not done

327
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:13,650
and is incapable of being done. And also, by the way, alternative media, don't leave those guys in

328
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:19,610
because they're all geniuses, of course. And alternative media, it is not possible at this

329
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:23,850
time in this society to have a conversation, especially now that is above a third-grade

330
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:31,770
reading level or eight-year-old mindset. It is not possible, viably. And that means if you're

331
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:37,210
structuring some quote-unquote programming or something directly into society to accommodate

332
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:42,770
the masses thinking you're going to grow and be successful, you better keep it really, really in

333
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:49,390
that range, just at the beginning of your, the end of your formative years. Now, if you have

334
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:54,750
family members or anyone like that, there might be some videos, YouTube, about teaching school

335
00:31:54,750 --> 00:32:01,250
children up until the second or third grade, watch third-grade stuff online and then just carry it

336
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:07,290
over. Now, just do a transcript of it and the mindset, carry it over to when you watch political

337
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:16,570
television or politicians or kings or monarchs speaking or listening to the quote-unquote news

338
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:21,610
or university. Now, what's interesting, the university professors, they tend to be able to

339
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:27,830
mask over that really ridiculously immature mindset because they have a set of ways, they get

340
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:31,470
a training on how to say certain things and structure and they might use some words that

341
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:35,850
might be a little bit beyond third grade, but their mindset, I assure you, is still there.

342
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:42,230
So, and the other thing that you will comprehend when you see that you're in the credits portion

343
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:48,790
and the censorship level right now, and by the way, the censorship is because it's autopilot.

344
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:54,930
In other words, the past 18 years or so, you're on a track, there's nothing that can change,

345
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,910
but perceptively, you might think so, but that doesn't matter because we just mentioned you

346
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:07,590
only perceive, well, anyway, okay, you get the point. So, what you will also see is that

347
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:14,950
the events that are taking place are all reactionary. No one knows what's coming

348
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:18,430
around the corner and speaking about it, by the way. Everything is just reactionary,

349
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:23,430
which will change next decade, by the way. You will have big promises being made,

350
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:29,150
thousand-year type stuff, so you'll all fall for that rosy picture, of course.

351
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:40,570
But you will see also that the censorship is so thick and the autopilot is pretty much instilled

352
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:47,370
that there is no movement outside of that other than what you find to be in your own personal

353
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:51,810
space or personal desires, which leads you back to food, clothing, and shelter,

354
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:57,830
and discovering the soul, the body, and the soul, the spirit, and the body,

355
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:04,490
which I will go over again because there's a reason for it. If you don't know who you are,

356
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,830
then, well, if you are headquarters, if you're made up of those three things,

357
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,770
and you're deceived about it, well, the only thing that you'll resonate with is deception.

358
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:18,770
You ever hear these New Age morons talking about, oh, that resonates with me, or I like it,

359
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:24,670
or that doesn't resonate with me, I don't like it. Well, they don't know anything about themselves,

360
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:28,810
and that's why they're into the New Age stuff. Some of this stuff just sounds dogmatic to a

361
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:37,810
typical moron, but that's fine because if you just take an average common oaf off the street,

362
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:43,050
plebeian or idiot, and put them on a construction site and insist that they use a tape measure and

363
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:47,150
everything, unless they have any training or vocation, they will not see the importance in

364
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:52,170
that, and they will be promptly removed because they will be disturbing production. If you don't

365
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:56,590
think there's any disturbance in the production of the way things are going for mankind, you're not

366
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:01,190
paying attention. But nonetheless, let's just continue a little bit more. I think the promise

367
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:09,690
of going into the idea that there is a society known as the gods is a very, very old concept,

368
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:16,330
more than alluded, but explained not in great detail by the Greek through the years. Why?

369
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:23,230
Because in contrast to what you're being told in any society, and by the way, one of the worst

370
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:31,890
things is when you see this transition, man right now is deliberately cut off from the society of

371
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:38,050
the gods. You're pretty much left with red fire trucks, teddy bears, and whatever is left over

372
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:46,510
from whatever human sacrifices are being done. But what you will see is that essentially there's

373
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:52,670
no knowledge of any of this stuff, and one of the worst things is when you have these

374
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:58,350
societies that have, well, it's not the worst, but typically societies have cultures and traditions

375
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:02,670
that they carry on from generation to generation, like the eastern religions, the western religions,

376
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:08,170
and whatever, north and south also. But one of the worst combinations is when you have these

377
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:15,710
typical westerners, it also happens to easterners, they tend to transition out of their cultural

378
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:20,510
religion that is instilled geographically and traditionally on them, and they switch over to

379
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:25,750
something else. And I'm like, you know, this also happens with Asians. I've seen very often you have

380
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:30,490
a large quote-unquote Christian contingency that has been discovered by the Chinese and Koreans

381
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:35,390
and such and such, and I ran into a Korean individual once and I said, well, you know, they're

382
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:40,870
like adamant Christian, and I'm like, what happened? The demons that you worshipped in

383
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:44,930
Korea, you gave those up for the demons that are worshipped in the west? What's the difference?

384
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:49,330
And the same thing for the westerners, you know, when they go over to eastern

385
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:54,730
cultures and eastern religions, I'm like, you gave up the western demons for demons in the east? I mean,

386
00:36:55,450 --> 00:37:02,730
why? You're just sideways. They're all on the same level. It's all a lie. But it's not a lie

387
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:09,050
because it's a facade. Well, it is a lie, obviously, but it's a lie that you are supposed to follow to

388
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:15,070
be like everyone else, because you don't want everybody to find out what's going on on this

389
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:23,130
planet. You're supposed to live 50, 60, 80, 100 years, die, and then carry on because you're just

390
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:30,010
a number. You're just coming here because a certain number of people have to manifest over a certain

391
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:36,050
period of time. Yeah, that sounds kind of crazy, doesn't it? Yeah, well, you'll find out later. It's

392
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:41,370
true. How do I know? Just the same way you're going to know if you don't know. You just study

393
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:45,090
it, because perhaps even in the future, if you're not interested, you may not even find out.

394
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:53,230
So here's the aspect of the society of the gods that no one understands or comprehends,

395
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:59,450
that there are many, by the way, and they have a hierarchy, yes, just like the military. And by

396
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:04,110
the way, the military has a hierarchy as well, and that hierarchy you will find from the enlisted

397
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:08,810
men all the way up to the officers to be very similar across time and across culture, because

398
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:13,870
that was not invented. That was given to mankind. And sorry, folks, if you think you invented

399
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:20,370
anything, there is no such thing, because all thoughts are external. So thinking you invented

400
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:27,450
something is like having a portable radio on the beach, and you are inspired to open it to get the

401
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:32,810
little tiny jazz band or the little tiny rock and roll band that's inside the radio playing music

402
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:40,350
for you. And it sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? But it's the same thing, folks. So anyway, I would say

403
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:45,530
that there is a society there. Now, what's interesting, again, if you're able to put things

404
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:51,370
together and rationalize, it's been said somewhere that man is of very high importance. And of course,

405
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:56,610
most people don't know what that even the word important means, but let's just say of significance

406
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:04,470
and of great value. And mankind was made to be incorporated into the direct family of the most

407
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:11,490
high of the gods. All right, and we will get into discussions of that in more specifics, because

408
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:15,890
there are three bloodlines on the earth right now, which no one is really discussing. They have been

409
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:24,930
discussed, and they actually quite a bit, but no details. And yeah, so the other aspect of that is

410
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:29,370
once someone asked me once, do the gods have a God? And they said, yes, they do. And that will

411
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:37,250
be discussed in future as well with great detail. And that is the nature of being able to not be

412
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:43,370
pedantic, but be able to offer this information, those that are interested. And you will find out

413
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:47,330
in future projects that what your interest is when you come up to it, and you'll say, well, do I

414
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:53,970
really want to do this? And you will discover that if you do discover within yourself to want to get

415
00:39:53,970 --> 00:40:00,950
this information, and you move forward on it, it will be pretty, pretty rewarding. But personally,

416
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:05,790
you won't make any friends, and your friends and family will hate you even more than they do now,

417
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:13,070
by the way. Because if you're listening to this within 40 minutes or so, you probably figured out

418
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:18,630
enough to know that what's going on on this planet, and it's time for something a little bit

419
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:23,050
better. I wouldn't say a lot better, but just a little bit better really is a lot better.

420
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:30,270
But back to the society of the gods, and they don't exist like humankind does. But even though

421
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:40,770
they made humankind, I would say that at this point, there's an irony, because humankind is at

422
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:49,050
the point very soon, well, two decades or less on the outside, where more overt knowledge and

423
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:55,790
presence will be of the gods on earth, and within your perception, let's just say. But the irony of

424
00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:02,230
it is that you're going to be coming into an aspect of society that will be very convincing

425
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:08,370
that your society, meaning what man believes is his society, let's say the way it's structured,

426
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:14,730
will continue unabated for the next thousand years. But within that, there will be knowledge

427
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:21,390
incorporated of the gods, and the simple reason why is because if the mankind did not have some

428
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:27,670
accurate knowledge regarding the gods, after this thing was wrapped up, meaning man's epic,

429
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:34,450
you will see that there'll be plenty of sniveling humans. We didn't know. We didn't have a chance

430
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:39,530
to straighten up. We didn't know what was going on. Why did you stop us? And the gods don't act

431
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:44,290
in futility. So you will know enough about it, but you will be obviously misguided, just like

432
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:48,170
you've been about everything else. And if you don't think you've been misguided, you got any parents?

433
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:53,730
You want to sit down and ask them some serious questions? Got any grandparents you want to sit down?

434
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:59,610
Or any older individuals? Yeah. You want to ask them basically something outside of what's on the

435
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:04,930
cereal box, or what's on TV, or why they do what they do? Yeah. Do you want to see a real dumb look

436
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:11,290
on people's face? Yeah. This is where you're at, humanity. This is at large now throughout

437
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:15,690
the entire planet. This has nothing to do with just the American culture, which tends to be some

438
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:23,490
of the most interesting when it comes to that. So you will find out more as time goes on.

439
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:29,170
So regarding the gods again, you know, one will say, well, how much do you want to get into? How

440
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:37,430
much can we get into? Much. But I would say that when you start researching anything that is put

441
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:42,310
forward as being spiritual, you'll always run into the concept of the gods, unless you start

442
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:46,410
getting into these pseudo-spiritual things. I mean, well, actually not because spirit is the mind,

443
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:50,910
they're not pseudo, but they sort of are, where they are more of the self-help or something

444
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:56,450
based on integrity. And then you have to understand how to measure it for being lawful, or measurable,

445
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:04,110
or real, or practical. So again, the gods are going to come up somehow. You also have to

446
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:11,090
comprehend that in terms of the earth, there is a central aspect to the earth. Just like the body

447
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:16,390
has the navel, there is a certain part of the earth that is very central, and things emanate

448
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:21,670
from there, from a spiritual perspective, and they're shut down. Sometimes they become a sewer

449
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:26,630
hole for a while, and sometimes they become the most, let's say, set apart sacred places on earth.

450
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:34,090
That's another thing people don't understand, location regarding the gods. The earth is the

451
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:38,030
earth. What makes a place special is not inherent to the earth, even though the earth has ley lines.

452
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:43,930
So these things do change. But you will, if you study any spiritual material, you will find

453
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:51,170
in your studies, talk about the gods. And if you have any formal or informal, or just laymen

454
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:58,030
participation in any of the world's religions, you will not be able to comprehend what the

455
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:01,570
mindset that you've been given that's in the world, anything that's what's called, let's say,

456
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:06,790
a holy writ. It doesn't matter what religion it is. And you might want to think about that for

457
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:13,970
a minute, because again, discussing the gods sounds very new to most. It may not to most

458
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:20,130
tune into this type of talk or Greek speak, but it has absolutely nothing to do with any of the

459
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:25,130
mainstream religions, which are there for pure social control. Now, one of the big fatal mistakes

460
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:32,910
most people make, especially in contemporary times, is that if you bring up, let's say,

461
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:36,810
the biblical text, they say, Oh, well, that's Christian, and I'm not into it or a Christian.

462
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:40,730
Or if you bring up Christianity in a positive light. Oh, yeah, that's all in the Bible. No,

463
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:47,350
it's not none of it. Zero, not even 1%. The same with Judaism, practicing Judaism,

464
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:53,090
which is out of Babylon. And the same with the Quran, if you bring up there's, there's a news

465
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:57,970
site that I sometimes go to, and someone's writing a supposedly a review on the Quran,

466
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:02,490
and none of it's out of the Quran. It's just with Muslim tradition. By the way, Islam is not based

467
00:45:02,490 --> 00:45:09,270
on the Quran. Sorry. Now you can take it out of context and lawyer it. What do you mean by lawyer

468
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:14,510
it like what attorneys you ever read a court case, ever read a court transcript? Yeah, you see what

469
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:21,810
they do in that. But anyway, none of it is scriptural, or out of the Quran or Buddhism.

470
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:25,910
There is no Buddhist that understands what Buddhism is. They're talking about breakfast

471
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:30,830
cereal. Do you know what breakfast cereal is made of? Fruits, nuts and flakes. And you go on and on

472
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:37,090
and on across the entire planet. Humankind is in very sad shape. So why discuss the essence of the

473
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:43,210
gods on many levels, or just on any level to start would be a start. Because it's an essential

474
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:48,710
aspect. Why? Because they're primary, they come before everything else. Why? Because they're higher

475
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:54,430
in power. Why are they higher in power? Because they're primary, they came first. So there's a

476
00:45:54,430 --> 00:46:02,210
very interesting aspect to how society works regarding these things. And let's see if I'm

477
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:09,890
getting a message here. I don't think I am. Am I getting a message? No. Okay. So let's just see

478
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:15,130
go back into the comments here. Let's see if there's anything. I've tried asking those older,

479
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:20,070
allegedly wiser about things of the past, i.e. money, government, slavery, civil rights. And they

480
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:24,950
look at me like I'm growing a pink unicorn. Yeah, they are. Here's the thing, folks. There's nothing

481
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:30,290
sadder than to see the older, wiser people that are supposed to be guiding society as being a

482
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:35,130
pack of fools. And even the ones in alternative media, the ones in university, your own family

483
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:39,770
down the street. And you wonder why there's very little sympathy when they throw them in nursing

484
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:45,910
homes with drugs and slap diapers on them. Think about that. Now, if you folks are not old right

485
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:51,930
now, I'm talking about like 50 plus. When you're not old, you're probably not. You just add 15

486
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:56,090
years to whatever age you are in right now. And you might kind of get an idea of where you're at,

487
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:04,490
but going to be in terms of lifespan. Think about the little ones. Stop considering them to be

488
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:12,350
disposable. You may not with your own mouth say that the children are disposable and who cares.

489
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:18,890
You say that you love them and you care about them, but your actions show otherwise. And by the way,

490
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:25,290
sending them off to institutionalized aspects of society does not mean you love them. It just

491
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:30,050
means, again, it's like you're wheeling out the garbage to the curb. It's funny how I see the

492
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:39,930
people do that. But I would suggest that you've got much that has been lost because the older

493
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:45,690
generation has been reduced to a pack of fools. Not all of them, but pretty much most of them.

494
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:50,410
And let me just, from the Greek's perspective, I haven't met any wise or older people yet

495
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:57,110
in the past couple of decades. None of them. It's been diminishing. Maybe 30 or 40 years ago,

496
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:02,890
I do remember some that were much older that did give me some of the best, wisest comments that

497
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:07,730
I've heard, but they've since died. So you're in really sad shape as a society from that.

498
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:13,470
This is measurable, by the way. It's nothing to do with opinion. I've heard many comments of

499
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:19,710
people going around and listening to, let's say, what can be discussed. And they bring it up to

500
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:22,950
their elders and they're like, no, you have to do what everybody else is doing. I don't want to hear

501
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:27,470
that. So it's not hard to prove it. And I don't want to pretty much stick on the point that the

502
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:32,730
older people are pretty much goners at this point, because when you read in ancient writs to respect

503
00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:38,630
them to a certain degree, that was very specific. By the way, when you read ancient writs, let's

504
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:41,870
say it's the biblical text. I shouldn't say the Bible because that means you're going to go to

505
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:47,870
King James. Anyway, if you do discover that there's something preserved in scriptures in

506
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:53,550
Hebrew and Greek that one day will be translated or go into a good interlinear. And in future

507
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:57,770
endeavors, we're going to show where all the mistakes in the King, the 30 to 50 mistakes

508
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:03,110
that are recur repeatedly, most likely tend to start off with. So you could actually make use

509
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:09,170
of that document instead of having it as a doorstop or something these the goddess religion

510
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:14,050
people make you swear on. Heaven forbid you ever fall into their clutches. But

511
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:21,030
there's, yeah, there's things, things to consider, folks, that the wisdom is not going to be found

512
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:25,490
with the old anymore. It's another sign of the times. And these are specific things. Let's just

513
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:29,530
see here. I agree. Has the crowd been translated? Or is it a version like the King James? Yes,

514
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:36,990
it is a version like the King James. One simple way to see how moronic all of the members of every

515
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:41,950
religion on the planet are. You're ready. This is an interesting thing to try. And this is remember

516
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:46,270
it tonight, we're going to bounce around, but it's all about the gods. Again, we'll do more talk

517
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:50,350
about the body and food and some technical aspects of things, but it's always going to bounce around

518
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:56,990
the gods. If you want to see how moronic a religious person is, and I want to say religious

519
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:01,830
mean, religion means something you do regularly. So it's nothing to do with what you do regularly.

520
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:05,790
It's this institutional thing, every one of them, you know, there's like, I don't know,

521
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:12,070
1000 aspects of Islam. Some people say 2000. I once read a statistic, there are 30,000 or

522
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:17,770
20,000 aspects of Christianity, 5000 aspects of Buddhism, Hinduism, all of that, right?

523
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:24,890
It's just, it's not very good for mankind. Why? Well, you'll find out. But one way to see if

524
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:30,950
these people in any of them have a handle on any of the writs, in terms of it being translated,

525
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:35,710
or them being familiar, are you ready? It's really simple. Just ask them to do define,

526
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:41,050
ask a Christian, a Muslim, a Jew, a Hindu or Buddhist to define what the soul is and to define

527
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:48,230
what the spirit is. They can't. Okay, why? Well, because in order to be able to do that,

528
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:54,270
you have to stop what you're doing for about five minutes. That's all. And look things up and see

529
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:59,170
how it's being used. Right? Well, actually, it helps when you get a hint in the right direction.

530
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:05,190
But it seems like when you have people do it, it has more punch. When you tell them it helps.

531
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:09,470
But here's the other thing about regarding the soul and the spirit. When you go to look it up,

532
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:12,930
they've actually twisted it in the reference manuals. It's like they got a bunch of attorneys

533
00:51:12,930 --> 00:51:17,350
to do it. For good reason, of course. Because, you know, when I say legal society and attorneys,

534
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:25,350
I don't mean that as a dig on a human institution. They represent the adversary, boots on the

535
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:32,550
ground. Okay? So more than just someone with a t-shirt, they are actually functional satanic

536
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:38,630
humans. Now satanic meaning adversarial. There's no escape from that, by the way.

537
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:43,830
That just happens to be one of the realities of being on earth. What you think about them

538
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:50,230
is irrelevant. I'm discussing here what they are. There's a big difference. They're adversarial,

539
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:53,530
and that's otherwise they wouldn't exist. But here's the other thing.

540
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:59,430
This is a long-winded answer regarding if the Quran has been translated. The answer is no.

541
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:03,350
Actually, in some countries, it's illegal to even do it out of what's called Arabic.

542
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:08,790
But none of these people in any of the formal religions know, and they cannot define the soul

543
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:13,830
and the spirit. So they cannot go back and render any useful information from the writ that they

544
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:20,610
subscribe to. Now, why do I say all of them don't? It's very simple math, folks.

545
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:25,830
Because once you go down that path and discover that there is accuracy to be garnered when you

546
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:31,750
read these quote-unquote holy writs, you will find that everything and anything that is done

547
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:36,470
in the religion is in the abominations category of the text that you're studying now.

548
00:52:37,110 --> 00:52:42,270
So now you have a decision to make. For example, if you study the Quran,

549
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:47,110
you'll never call yourself Muslim. And this is a fact, by the way, because I've had many

550
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:50,510
discussions with quote-unquote Muslims about the Quran. They don't know anything out of the Quran.

551
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:52,990
They know a few verses here and there, and they're quite proud of that.

552
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:58,950
And the ones that have discovered it abandon the quote-unquote religion and do understand the text.

553
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:03,210
The same thing with Christianity. It is not possible to call yourself Christian unless

554
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:09,890
you have ulterior means or alternate desires for something. Let's say, and I'll get into what that

555
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:16,230
is, and know what's known as the scripture or even the Bible. There's no way. It's not possible.

556
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:21,450
With every religion, there is no religion on the planet that does anything that's in the writ that

557
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:26,290
they allegedly subscribe to at all. And if they do anything that seems to be out of there, it's in

558
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:33,110
the don't do category. Now, another thing that you can say that is very factual regarding mankind,

559
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:38,890
and we just have a few minutes, is that the people that are in mainstream religion are either evil

560
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:42,910
or ignorant. Ignorant because they don't know, or evil because they do know, but they like to do it

561
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:47,370
because they want to take advantage of the ignorant. And that's one of the realities of being

562
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:52,670
unwelcome to planet Earth. So we've pretty much gone through about an hour. We're going to be

563
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:59,570
coming up on the break, and we will get more into the gods or otherwise. But this is episode seven.

564
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:07,470
We'll see you soon. Greetings on the first week of the second month on the Pope's work schedule

565
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:17,070
known as April 13th, 2017, in the year of their Lord. As I say, I would recommend anyone consider

566
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:22,650
that when you do hear that you have been had, especially when you're coming to a venue like

567
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:29,610
what's called alternative media, and yes, I just happen to be here as well at the moment, you hear

568
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:34,510
about very often mankind has been deceived, but yet they cannot discern what is just right in

569
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:38,950
front of them and what they're using, and the quality of what they're using. That's why one of the

570
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:43,830
things that you can't just lay off of is the Pope's work schedule, folks. Sorry. And that is, by the

571
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:49,330
way, is a really quick litmus test to see who's super glazed, you know, like a raised and glazed

572
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:54,210
donut kind of thing. No, not that, but just like glazed over. Bring up lawful, anything lawful.

573
00:54:54,730 --> 00:55:00,390
Timekeeping is the easiest way to do it, just to see. Now, I mentioned earlier that the members of

574
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:06,430
mainstream religions for thousands of years are either ignorant or evil. Now, I say thousands,

575
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:12,070
meaning at least a good 1,500 for sure, because prior to that, you had a little more knowledge

576
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:17,270
and interaction with the gods. They tried to, even though it's been basically cut off on many levels.

577
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:24,710
I would suggest that if you were to come to a planet like this one and leave with a report,

578
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:31,070
and the category of religion would be brought up, you would say the participants across the board

579
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:36,290
on the planet are either evil or ignorant. Why? Think about it for a moment. Should I take a

580
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:42,330
pause? I just mentioned it earlier. And the pause is there. It's a rhetorical pause, maybe to relax

581
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:46,610
the brain, because you've probably never heard this before. And it's very, very simple. It's

582
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:51,470
not something you have to memorize. Or even like one, what did he say? It's just a realization

583
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:57,950
moment, right? And it's very easy. Why are they ignorant or evil? Well, very simple.

584
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:01,870
The ignorant kind of speaks for itself, because none of them know anything about what they're

585
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:06,610
supposed to be doing or what anything is based on. But the evil ones are quite interesting,

586
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:12,410
because they do know. But see, they're what's called opportunists, or even to the point of

587
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:18,890
being predacious or predatory. Think about it. And then there's a whole other level to it. When

588
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:25,030
you hear about the molestations, right, of children from these mainstream religions,

589
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:30,670
and not so mainstream ones. It's not because it's a horny rabbi or a priest or something like that,

590
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:34,950
or an imam. It's because it's part of their religion, meaning that the religion that you

591
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:41,330
know about, but because the entities that are behind such a structure. Now, one thing that I'd

592
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:46,230
like to bring up is that the earth has been under the influence of malevolent entities for since the

593
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:51,370
beginning of known history. There are several ways to discern that. Let's just discern the more

594
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:57,450
typical modern one. Actually, they're both typically modern, but changing. The typical

595
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:04,330
modern one is, if you have a discussion, and when I say religion, I mean also anyone in the legal

596
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:09,530
society, medical society, what's called the homosexual community, the judicial society,

597
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:14,590
economic society. These are all based on religions. These people do these things regularly.

598
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:21,890
They're all unlawful, by the way, at this point. When you start bringing up the history of what

599
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:30,630
they are involved in, or anything with precision or accuracy, typically they will bring up the

600
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:37,790
notion that they're not interested. But if you pursue it, you start to see a look in their eye

601
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:41,210
and the expression, body language, and other things that they actually want to bring violence

602
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:47,090
to you. Whether it's verbal or physical, it can go in either way. That is because they are so

603
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:53,650
heavily under the influence of malevolency cloaked as benevolency, as a necessary thing.

604
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:57,690
How many times have you criticized, let's say in the Western culture or even Eastern culture,

605
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:02,170
why people do the same thing they do? Especially an older person will say,

606
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:06,990
well, that's the way we do it. That's the system we have, and they're so proud of it.

607
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:13,310
Now, right there is an indirect proof right now, but it'll be more direct proof later as one's

608
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:18,170
experience and knowledge increases on how humankind, the majority of the people,

609
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:26,930
can be dubbed as unrehabilitatable. Another way to see that humankind has been under malevolent

610
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:30,670
influence, and they don't notice it. It could be the same group and others.

611
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:37,330
Is mankind, it can be established whether you're into the creation aspect or the evolution aspect,

612
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:42,410
which, by the way, what is put out academically and colloquially and conventionally about

613
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:49,710
evolution and creation is wrong. Yes, they're both incorrect. That will be discussed in the future

614
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:54,870
with specifics how, but anyone who's listened to Greek speak to this point can figure that out

615
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:58,870
to some extent, but it'll be illustrated and demonstrated.

616
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:05,310
But even if you look at evolution or creation, you will see that there is a very deep and

617
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:12,270
heavy integration of mankind in the natural environment. Whenever you see man and his

618
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:17,930
industry and his culture or whatever start to disintegrate from the natural reality,

619
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,910
okay, what does that mean? Well, not disintegrate like the disintegrating rate,

620
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:26,790
but the opposite of integrate. For example, putting fluids in flat bottom containers just

621
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:30,450
for the sake of commerce and not really realizing that it degrades the liquid,

622
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:38,150
okay, not wondering about the subtle energies of food, okay, or, you know, whatever, you know,

623
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:43,130
these things that are seem to be not natural. Now, why do I say both of these things change?

624
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:50,410
Because you'll see through as the censorship is lifted to a certain extent, people that were

625
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:54,970
didn't want to hear about anything with precision and accuracy regarding the past or even spiritual

626
00:59:54,970 --> 01:00:01,610
matters of the mind, let's say, will start to open up to it. Okay, and also on the physical

627
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:06,630
aspect, you will see that there is something called a biomimicry movement that has been coming

628
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:11,650
around. Biomimicry is where you don't have to reinvent the wheel because nature has done it

629
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:16,770
already for you. In other words, if you have a certain task in industry or otherwise that you

630
01:00:16,770 --> 01:00:21,570
would like to accomplish efficiently, see where it's being done in nature and try to copy the

631
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:28,070
structure, the movement, and the approach. You'll be more successful. This has to do with, let's say,

632
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:33,430
aerodynamics, fluid dynamics, energies, kinesthetics, you know, the movement of bodies,

633
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:38,730
all these things copy nature. So there is a little bit of a movement on that, but still,

634
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:43,430
society at large is, you know, if you ever look at the architecture, even in art and industry,

635
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:51,330
you will see it is not natural, meaning not because people don't have the freedom to express

636
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:56,350
something different. It's just that if you're going to employ something within this environment,

637
01:00:56,510 --> 01:01:02,870
it should be in accordance or in some harmony instead of being disharmonious. So those are

638
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:08,910
just two simple ways to see how the malevolent forces have influenced mankind. They're not

639
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:13,210
necessarily coming at you directly. They're coming at you sideways. That's the thing that

640
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:18,490
people don't understand either, is that when you get an influence, it tends to be lateral, right?

641
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:24,070
When I say lateral, I mean it doesn't come head-on. That's part of the deception. It's like

642
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:31,010
a sideways push instead of head-on that you can directly resist. I wanted to bring those things

643
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:36,130
up because they're little tidbits, like a potpourri of various thoughts when we discuss the gods.

644
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:40,450
Another thing I wanted to bring up, which I did bring up originally, is the number seven.

645
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:44,590
Let's just bounce around here. In case there are any other questions, I'll just be bouncing around

646
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:48,690
trying to stick within the topic of the gods because on previous Sonic episodes that you

647
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:54,890
might find on archives, that's been discussed quite a bit. Now, it's interesting how discussing

648
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:59,150
and bringing it up is one thing. There's always going to be a very small group of people that

649
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:05,070
are going to have an aha moment to see how simple this is. It's not a matter of the Greeks said this

650
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:09,050
or the Greeks, if I don't think like that. No, it has nothing to do with that. It has to do with

651
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:13,570
precision and accuracy. It also has to do with if you're listening to the Greek, it's because

652
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:19,950
there's still no one discussing anything like this at all. If they were, very simply, I wouldn't

653
01:02:19,950 --> 01:02:27,330
be doing this now. However you want to take that, there's probably better things to do than trying

654
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:33,430
to figure out how to impart, let's say, 10 or 15 years' worth of almost full-time study to a society

655
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:40,130
that is just completely ignorant of anything basic and real. There's better things to do like

656
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:46,410
go live in the forest or something. Nonetheless, at this point, we're here. If you're seeing the

657
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:50,290
Greek speak, it's because still there's probably a job that needs to be done. Unfortunately,

658
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:56,430
the Greek maybe is the one that's doing it. The thing is, it has to be simple. It has to be able

659
01:02:56,430 --> 01:03:04,370
to have a formative aspect to it. One thing about it is the number seven. When you bring up the

660
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:09,130
number seven, people say lucky seven. Well, think about it. Luck is a lady. Again, it ties into that

661
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:14,490
goddess religion. Are all goddess religions bad? No, I wouldn't say so. Being influenced by a

662
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:21,650
goddess is not necessarily malevolent unless she's bent on being malevolent. It tends to be the case

663
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:29,410
on earth at this time. By the way, wisdom is personified by a goddess also. She is not

664
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:33,930
malevolent, but you are under the influence of a malevolent one right now.

665
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:36,910
One of the ways, by the way, I'll just throw this in there, you've heard in the past,

666
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:43,410
what do you know about justice? A woman with scales has nothing to do with law, by the way,

667
01:03:43,650 --> 01:03:48,370
but it does because your law comes from your god. Anyway, what do you know about that ancient

668
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:55,370
goddess religion? Very cruel, isn't it? The number seven, when you look at primary aspects,

669
01:03:55,570 --> 01:04:00,350
it needs to be reckoned again. I've done this in prior times. Let's just do it again for the

670
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:04,450
sake of redundancy. Of course, I do get comments of private, well, you've just been repeating

671
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:09,130
yourself. I'm saying, yeah, that's pretty much what you folks are going to get from now on until

672
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:15,590
maybe another project that has a little more detail. It may not be so public, but it'll be

673
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:20,090
quite enthralling. There might be some new stuff. Occasionally, coming around here, there might be

674
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:25,690
some new stuff as well because even tonight, a couple extra things were thrown in. You got to

675
01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:29,230
go slow with this stuff because remember, we still have about another year before some of

676
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:34,970
the censorship is lifted. The censorship will be lifted because it's one of the prerequisites of

677
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:40,290
having some comprehension of why things are happening the way they are. You're not so shocked

678
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:45,490
when roughly seven or eight years from now, a Middle East union that has centralized all

679
01:04:45,490 --> 01:04:49,630
of mankind's power has taken form. You won't be in so much of a shock.

680
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:53,850
But anyway, going back to the number seven, what's interesting about the number seven

681
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:58,510
and considered lucky, I wouldn't use that term. Let's just say fortunate. I wouldn't use that

682
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:04,750
term either because one of the greatest misfortunes you can have right now is being in the explicit

683
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:11,490
presence of a god. You will not last too long. Anyway, this has been discussed also before.

684
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:18,210
Also, understanding that what is known as dreaming is a deception that is put upon you by the lower

685
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:22,650
gods. When the higher gods send a dream to you, they identify themselves. If you're not getting

686
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:28,870
that kind of stuff, you're being messed with. There's another reality that can be discussed

687
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:35,570
with the number seven regarding the gods. What makes it so interesting is that it's been

688
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:41,930
sort of associated with the gods and also good fortune. You could take it as you wish. I gave

689
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:45,830
you some reasons why it might be otherwise. But what you can examine about the number seven

690
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:50,650
is let's say you look at something that has seven elements. You just spread out seven items in front

691
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:56,550
of you. You'll notice that the fourth item is in the center of the seven items. You'll have three

692
01:05:56,550 --> 01:06:01,330
on the left, three on the right, or however you want to look at it. That central element of number

693
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:06,870
four is really the first position when you're reckoning what those seven things are. Think

694
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:15,220
about it. What's interesting about the first position, which we could number one, and the

695
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:21,160
seventh position is that they equal each other. When you're looking at number one, it's also

696
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:25,720
number seven. When you're looking at number seven, it's actually number one. But the fourth position

697
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:31,620
is where you start your count. Isn't that interesting? Have you guys heard this before?

698
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:37,460
If the answer is no, that's okay. That's right, because you probably haven't. Now why bringing

699
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:42,120
this up matters anything? Whenever you see that multiplicity of the number seven,

700
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:46,880
yeah, you scratch your head and say, well, I guess that's good. It's the number of the gods or

701
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:51,880
whatever. Yeah, but now you've got some discernment. Let me just go through that again. If you have

702
01:06:51,880 --> 01:07:00,040
seven items, whether they're literary items, hint, hint, literary points, something that comes in

703
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:09,520
sevens, hint, ancient writs, it's the fourth one that is the first one, and the first and the last

704
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:17,680
are equal. But you can count one, two, three, and then you go five, six, seven. The fourth one is

705
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:23,320
still the first one. So you can go four, five, six, seven, or you can go four, one, two, three,

706
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:31,340
or you get the picture. It's really interesting. In a particular culture, in their tradition,

707
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:35,620
they have something with seven lamps on it, even though it's unlawful what they're doing.

708
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:41,480
It's not in the writ that they're supposed to be subscribed to the way they do it. But what's

709
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:47,880
interesting in their culture and tradition, they light the fourth position first. Interesting.

710
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:56,120
So this is a secret. Now, what a better place than a minor internet radio platform with this

711
01:07:56,120 --> 01:08:01,880
arrogant son-of-a-bitch known as the Greek coming out and giving out a secret that is really a

712
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:10,980
secret. What a better place to do it than this, than here, now. Why not? So why did I say the

713
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:18,260
word hidden? I'll just go over it again. Think about it. The numerics of seven. Just remember

714
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:24,279
the fourth one is the first one, and the first and the last are the same. And what does that do for

715
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:28,620
you? Well, you won't see the number seven the same way. And you see when you see seven, instead of

716
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:33,359
just walking away or hitting what they say the gas pedal, by the way, and going faster, it's

717
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:37,819
really a speed bump. You're supposed to consider what's going on there by the arrangement of the

718
01:08:37,819 --> 01:08:44,399
number seven. So why not give that out? Now, what's interesting about the other numbers is

719
01:08:44,899 --> 01:08:50,520
you will find a similar center always in odd numbers. Even numbers don't have a central

720
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:55,880
position like that. They have a space or a gap or no number or no position in the middle with

721
01:08:55,880 --> 01:09:01,760
the even numbers. So not to discuss getting into what's called numerology or gematria,

722
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:07,920
but there is a rational lawful aspect to it that can be, you know, it's a form of measuring

723
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:13,260
something or considering when a number is an aspect of something, you can consider a little

724
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:19,660
bit more, you see, and it's functional. How does that help? Well, it'll help for those that have

725
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:25,840
interest. And for those that don't, well, you don't. So that's how one can pursue the functional

726
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:31,100
aspects of what's called knowledge. For example, you know, you've heard knowledge is power. That's

727
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:36,960
you know what? It's not. Because you can ask anyone, is knowledge power in the knower or is

728
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:43,479
knowledge power in the doer? And even if the knower is a delegator telling someone to do something,

729
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:50,760
he's still a doer by proxy. So knowledge alone is not power. Now, there is a level of knowledge

730
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:57,340
when you're not animated or strictly animated by physical form. If you are in a godlike state,

731
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:01,660
then it is power as well, because then you are an emanator, you're capable of more than that.

732
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:06,160
But we're discussing it now, in terms of sentient beings are eliminated by being in an animated

733
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:10,740
state. What a better time to segue into the spirit, the soul and the body. And we'll just do it again.

734
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,900
And of course, people are, whoever's listening, or the one or two people that aren't listening

735
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:18,140
live right now, probably turning around in their chair saying, Oh, no, he's going to do the spirit

736
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:24,260
and soul again. Yes. It's very simple, folks. Whenever you see the PSY prefix, that is the

737
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:31,420
mind or the spirit. Whenever you see the PNU prefix, that is the soul or the breath. The PNU

738
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:35,840
is where you get pneumatic or pneumonia, that is the breath. So when you see the interchangeability

739
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:42,100
of the mind and the breath, you know that that's been lawyered or twisted to some degree,

740
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:49,040
where you're not really, there's no intent there to be clear. Yep. And the body is the

741
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:56,680
which is very similar to the earth material. Now, this is like an interesting sort of Damocles,

742
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,920
not really such, but it's more like the thread that you pull from a cheap sweater.

743
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,480
Whenever you go into a conversation with those that claim to have wisdom or spirituality, or

744
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:11,400
whatever, whatever, whatever, even knowledge, ask them to define soul and spirit and watch what

745
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:18,460
happens. Yeah, you've guessed it, they fall apart. It's a good thread to pull on. Because

746
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:22,240
if you have a cheap sweater, you just keep pulling on that thread and what happens, it

747
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:27,360
unravels very, very quickly. Now, this is not meant to be adversarial or confrontational with

748
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:33,620
the morons on this planet. But you are going to be subject to idiocy pretty much wherever you go.

749
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:41,940
So be prepared. I would also suggest that when you do bring up discussions regarding the gods or the

750
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:47,040
spiritual realm, you always have to assess who you're discussing it with, always have to assess

751
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:52,120
the audience, you always have to assess the listener. Why? Because if you're not accommodating

752
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:56,280
them, they don't want to listen, they don't want to be present. Okay, so what does that lead to?

753
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:01,620
You're going to find yourself alone. Yes, you will. There's no group to join regarding this.

754
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:07,600
Why? Because the entire society has been under siege for a very, very long time. And just to

755
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:13,200
bring it up from one aspect, if you don't think that it's been under siege, you haven't been

756
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:17,900
paying attention. Have you looked at all of your leaders? Have you looked at all of those that are

757
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:22,840
supposed to be your teachers? Are they saying anything with any merit? And by the way, I have

758
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:31,020
someone calling. Let's see if I can bring him in. And maybe we can have them come on. This device is

759
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:36,220
misbehaving at the moment. So let's just see. I believe it's Seth. Let's see. I'm going to try

760
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:43,740
calling him again. If he has hardware in order, perhaps it will be successful. Greetings, Seth.

761
01:12:43,740 --> 01:12:52,880
I think you've made it, but no sound. You're coming in very low, but that's all right. Actually,

762
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:57,260
that's not all right. I can be fixed. Oh, there you go. Okay. Greetings. How are you?

763
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:02,960
I'm well. I've been listening to the conversation. I thought that I might be able to

764
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:11,060
ask a few questions directly based upon the gods and the subject matter at hand.

765
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:20,040
Oh, yeah, please. First, I would say for my own benefit and for the benefit of anyone else that's

766
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:27,240
listening, just for being that we lack definitionaries in the society we find ourselves,

767
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:38,420
just to define what a god is. What is a god? Well, loosely, just like we don't know what a bear is,

768
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:43,660
but we know enough about bears to say that we know what bears are, but no one's really sat down

769
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:47,920
with a bear and had an eight-hour conversation that I know of. Maybe someone has, but I never

770
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:53,120
heard of it. But when we communicate the term bear, we know its qualities and characteristics

771
01:13:53,120 --> 01:14:01,380
enough to discern it. The qualities of the gods is that they do not need a physical body to be

772
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:07,060
animated spiritually or to be animated or conscious. That would be the first thing that I would suggest

773
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:16,840
is the definition of a god. Okay. Then, looking at it as well from a perspective that is admittedly

774
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:21,920
difficult for myself because I grew up in the Western tradition of things, but looking at it

775
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:32,320
from the tradition of the Near East or works such as the epic poems of the Mahabharata and things

776
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:41,200
like that, they speak of gods and purport to be stories of gods and things of that nature that are

777
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:49,640
significantly different than the monotheistic bent that has been forced upon those interested in such

778
01:14:49,640 --> 01:15:00,720
things in the Western society. I found, I should say, in my own studies that reading such things

779
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:11,820
helps to add another aspect to one's perspective on it because the Western society and things like

780
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:20,620
that is certainly not the only culture that has traditions that involve these entities that we

781
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:33,720
refer to as gods. I guess the question is what are they? It's a passing thing no matter how

782
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:41,960
accurate you want to be. The same thing is going on not regarding what are the gods, but almost

783
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:48,960
what is anything. What is money? What is law? It needs to be communicated simply just like if you

784
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:53,480
look at a large building made up of all these thousands of bricks, how did it get there one

785
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:58,440
brick at a time? They're all very simple and they come in pallets. If you drop them on your foot,

786
01:15:58,500 --> 01:16:06,120
they hurt. One little simple concept, one little bit at a time to carry over. The simplest thing

787
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:12,760
to regard what the gods are, they do not need a physical reality as we do to be conscious,

788
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:18,940
to be awake. That is a place to start. Right there, it does not discuss the hierarchy. It

789
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:25,520
does not discuss what level of power they're endowed with. It doesn't, does it? The question

790
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:34,080
was what are the gods? Very simple. The problem with the Western side is let's go back to the

791
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:39,160
historical aspect that's been pretty clear in a certain writ that 2,000 years ago there was a

792
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:43,780
calling that there will be no more calling. In other words, everything is shut down from a

793
01:16:43,780 --> 01:16:48,760
certain part of the god's realm. You have 2,000 years of being, let's say, in the metaphor that

794
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:53,760
was used, the grave. When you're in the grave, not much happens, not even tic-tac-toe or solitaire,

795
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:59,720
you know, you're dead, right? The aspect of the spiritual world regarding mankind has been very

796
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:05,640
dead for the past 2,000 years. I would say when I mean dead, I don't mean the literal sense,

797
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:11,340
but an analogous sense in regarding to what has come out of it. When you open up something that

798
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:16,240
has been dead for a long time, it typically stinks. If you look at what mankind has been

799
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:22,740
discussing regarding the gods for the past 2,000 years, it also stinks. It's a very good analogy

800
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:30,220
to say that it's from the grave. Just a little hint, when you discuss the thing about the gods,

801
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:34,940
most people will reference, let's say, biblical and other things. One of the things that you'll

802
01:17:34,940 --> 01:17:39,320
notice is there's a hierarchy in information. What makes a hierarchy in information is things

803
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:44,360
to come. The less prophecy a document has about the future of mankind with accuracy,

804
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:49,880
the less bona fide it is or less ranking. The other thing that you will find is that people

805
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:56,240
always wanted to be about what they like. That's why when you read something known as the Bible or

806
01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:01,060
the Scripture, you see there's very little health remedy in there. There's very little history that

807
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:06,560
you might be interested in. There's very little, let's say, technical information that you might

808
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:14,300
be interested in. When you read the biblical text, it's not about you. It's about them and

809
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:21,220
how they view you and what you need to know about them. When you consider that they have an IQ of,

810
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:24,100
let's say, 2 million, I don't like that term IQ, but it's just a reference here.

811
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:28,980
When you read the writ, let's say something like the Scripture, it's their baby talk.

812
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:34,800
Okay, so it's not all-encompassing. Just like when you first started having a conversation,

813
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:40,640
let's say, with a three- or four-year-old, you don't get that all-encompassing regarding aspects

814
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:44,440
of being on this planet, do you? You just pretty much want to discuss things that

815
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:49,040
you think are important for them to know about in that conversation. It tends to be minimal.

816
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:57,180
But the proof of Scripture is in there simply by showing you things to come with great accuracy,

817
01:18:57,180 --> 01:19:05,060
and that's the proof of it. I would say that the three- and four-year-olds actually have

818
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:10,740
a slight advantage because, at least my own experience in speaking with my own progeny,

819
01:19:10,820 --> 01:19:19,020
is that when they ask questions and you attempt to answer them with earnestness and to the best

820
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:25,860
of your ability, oftentimes you will say things that they've not heard before, specific words and

821
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:32,140
things like that. And at that age, it's very common and encouraged, or at least should be

822
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:38,980
encouraged, that when one hears a word that they are unfamiliar with or does not have a grasp of,

823
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:42,420
they immediately ask, well, what is that? Right, more objective.

824
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:57,520
Yeah, that aspect of learning is very lacking. It's frowned upon, it seems like,

825
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:05,460
in conversation to do that, to ask, well, what does that mean? What does this word mean?

826
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:09,880
And in doing that, you can unravel a lot of what's being said.

827
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:16,760
But what's interesting about the writ, the memorialization of this, is it's not a true

828
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:23,160
conversation directly, literally, but it actually gives you instruction on how to impart a two-way

829
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:27,100
communication as well, the irony of it, right? It's called prayer, right? And it's not what

830
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:33,460
people think. But the other aspect is that they're not speaking with you, they're speaking at you,

831
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:38,840
even though there are certain instances in there where there is seemingly a conversation going on.

832
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:43,520
Again, it's all memorialized, so it's not in real time. But the interesting thing about

833
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:48,480
understanding this is just like understanding, like, when you ask what are the gods, or we

834
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:54,960
go back to the writs that have been memorialized, is that there has to be somewhere in society,

835
01:20:55,120 --> 01:21:00,140
an exhaustion of that information. And not only is it exhausted, meaning looked over,

836
01:21:00,260 --> 01:21:05,720
picked over completely, a place where it can be imparted holistically. And without,

837
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:11,360
what do you call it, when you skew something, without being colored or skewed. And that does

838
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:18,820
not exist at this point on the planet. You ever think about that? It does not exist.

839
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:25,000
But here's the other thing, it doesn't even exist in any of the fields. If you go study economics,

840
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:31,260
you will leave there not knowing any more than you could have learned on your own in a third or

841
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:37,460
quarter of the time. You can learn how they put their jargon to use, I suppose. That's right.

842
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:42,500
Technical aspects on how to present yourself, just like the dictionary, is how the subject

843
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:47,780
should pronounce the word and not necessarily what it really means when it was in its inception.

844
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:57,700
So there's a technical, yeah, so the aspect of this is, not only is it, but most people call

845
01:21:57,700 --> 01:22:04,180
it religious talk, and it's not. It's primary talk. If we can infer, even if we don't have

846
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:09,200
knowledge about that the gods are more powerful and they're primary and they came before us,

847
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:14,720
well, it's a primary aspect of the subject matter of existence. Just like in medicine,

848
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:18,800
if you don't deal with the primary causes, you're only dealing with the symptom.

849
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:27,020
So one can say it's not difficult to go into obsession about learning more about the gods

850
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:31,800
as much as you can, simply for the reason that there is no place you can go and get

851
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:36,020
that information anywhere on the planet right now. And there was at one point,

852
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:43,220
and that's part of the censorship. But again, it holds true for almost any subject.

853
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:50,480
But the thing is, any subject has a primary aspect to it. When you bring up money, very simple,

854
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:55,360
what is money? Portable land, very simple. It's a representation of what you have from your

855
01:22:55,360 --> 01:23:00,000
environment when you move from your environment. Very simple. What is law? Law is the way that

856
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,620
you function within the environment without severe or malconsequence. Very simple. Very,

857
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:10,100
very simple. What's the soul? What's the spirit? Very simple. Let's just come down to basics and

858
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:14,460
explain these things. And then if there's interest and it seems to accommodate the mindset,

859
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:18,100
because you have to accommodate the mindset, then you can expand on it.

860
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:25,100
But right now, the expansion just seems to be very well directed by malevolent forces,

861
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:29,300
which always present themselves as benevolent, which again, leaps forward into the gods.

862
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:34,860
So this is the condition. We've just pretty much covered 6,000 years of human history. Well,

863
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:37,960
let's say 2,500 years of human history in less than three minutes.

864
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:48,500
Which leads to another question, which is very, very basic, I suppose. But between

865
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:57,120
maleficent and beneficent, and good and bad, or good and evil, or righteous and wicked,

866
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:04,980
that's kind of a hint in and of itself, I suppose. But what is good? What is bad?

867
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:09,040
Oh, that's interesting. I've kind of been meditating on that

868
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:14,500
all week. And here's the thing about bringing it all to recall at the moment.

869
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:23,120
But typically, from a sociological perspective, or man's perception based on his traditions and

870
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:28,920
his cultures, pretty much most of the things that man considers to be good is downright evil.

871
01:24:29,420 --> 01:24:33,260
And if they were made aware of what is really good, they would call that evil.

872
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:37,940
So you notice, I didn't say what they think is evil is really good. And what they think

873
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:43,800
is good is really evil, as you'll find in the writ, let's say, right? I said that the majority

874
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:47,560
of what they consider to be good is just downright evil. But if they were presented with

875
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:52,860
what is good, they would reckon it as being evil. So that shows immobility. That is from the human

876
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:57,460
perspective. And I think that's the best way to communicate it, because it's always going to be

877
01:24:57,460 --> 01:25:02,000
taken as a human perspective, because you're speaking to people, not bears. Right?

878
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:03,560
Correct. Yeah, absolutely.

879
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:14,140
Yeah. So would good? And I guess another question would be, could one define good and evil,

880
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:22,300
separate from one another? And was what is evil? Simply, just very,

881
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:25,560
very basically and simply be defined as what does harm?

882
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:31,580
Sure, it can. But here's the interesting part. And this kind of messes around with a lot of the

883
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:37,820
conventional religion. But if one, again, goes into more, not so exhaustive, but looks very

884
01:25:37,820 --> 01:25:42,180
closely at what's been memorialized about the gods, you will find out that both good and evil,

885
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:45,720
ultimately, in a primary sense, come from the same source.

886
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:48,840
Oh, certainly, certainly, everything comes from the same source.

887
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:53,300
It's not fair to say certainly, because most people think, for example, especially if you turn

888
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:57,720
on the television, the History Channel, you've seen God versus Satan or God versus the devil,

889
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:04,200
so you know what I mean. If you remember earlier, I said that the best specimen,

890
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:08,700
representative specimen, if you went on this planet right now, and you said,

891
01:26:08,900 --> 01:26:12,960
who are your best people, you took a specimen of what they thought was the best, I can prove to you

892
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:17,120
they have not developed beyond eight years old, or they're in a third grade mentality.

893
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:22,980
So this is what's being accommodated still. And if you can tell, I've been very, very patient

894
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:27,420
through the years, if you and I have been speaking, about a time when these things will,

895
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:32,360
going, let's say, to a nine-year-old or 10-year-old mentality or 12-year-old mentality is

896
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:40,860
what I'm really waiting for. But again, just to go back to the good and evil, what's interesting

897
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:45,580
is that ultimately, let's just go back, you can only discuss these things from a human perspective,

898
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:51,260
because we are solely animated through this material realm. I said earlier that mankind is

899
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:57,280
very strictly integrated into his environment, air breathing, whatever. You don't do well

900
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:03,160
underwater, you don't do well in outer space without aid or assistance. Our position is

901
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:11,500
very well known in the environment. And the precursor to mankind was adjusting the environment

902
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:18,540
so mankind can inhabit. So the majority of the laws that you see, especially in the Holy Writs,

903
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:24,740
are how man should behave in order to keep or maintain harmony with the spiritual or mind

904
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:31,140
of the environment. It has a spirit in itself, albeit different from mankind. So in this case,

905
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:36,280
specifically, it would be the earth. So if you understand most of what is considered good,

906
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:42,100
it is proper fit and proper behavior to sustain life on earth, basically. And if you don't do

907
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:47,280
that, then you're sustaining the opposite. And sometimes that's accelerated, known as evil,

908
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:55,800
just to stop you, you see. So some remnant or something will remain. What it means very simply

909
01:27:55,800 --> 01:28:04,340
is it seems like even in man's system, when someone does bad versus good or evil versus good,

910
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:10,620
they mete out punishment to that, don't they? Even in man's law. And the term of punishment is

911
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:17,080
supposed to be edifying, but at the same time it's also supposed to settle some kind of deficiency.

912
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:24,780
Right. Yeah. So there's an interesting aspect to that as well. But I assure anyone that's

913
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:28,860
listening or anyone that has been on this planet long enough that is even can rub two brain cells

914
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:34,760
together, does any research, will find out what they think has been projected as being good or

915
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:39,180
within the convention and tradition, the culture of society. With a little bit of research,

916
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:44,220
they could find out that it's actually not very good. And you can give examples in just about

917
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:52,820
everything. Yeah, absolutely. I suppose what led me to that question was a conversation I had

918
01:28:52,820 --> 01:29:01,040
with my wife earlier in the week was we were discussing the moon and, you know,

919
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:09,790
the full moon versus the new moon. And there's a passage in what is it, Enoch, that speaks of

920
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:15,930
the path of the moon. I'm quoting this from memory, so it's probably not a direct quote.

921
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:24,030
For the righteous. Yeah. The path of the moon is light to the righteous and darkness to,

922
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:34,050
I believe the word or the term used is wicked. And I was, you know, prefacing the statement

923
01:29:34,050 --> 01:29:40,590
itself with the, you know, looking at it as righteous is a much easier word to discern

924
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:46,930
its actual meaning than wicked, because righteous is just correct. It's just right.

925
01:29:47,150 --> 01:29:54,730
It's been given a as you as you would say, you know, a religious taint to it. But that is right

926
01:29:54,730 --> 01:30:00,450
is just that's simply what it is. The righteous is something that is correct and right where it is.

927
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:10,890
The getting through the the religious jargon and its obfuscation can be challenging,

928
01:30:11,230 --> 01:30:18,050
but I've found it to be rewarding in my own comprehension of anything from driving around

929
01:30:18,550 --> 01:30:25,130
and, you know, maintaining one's health with all of the people driving these incredibly quick

930
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:32,410
and heavy machinery, you know, every day to studying, you know, ancient ancient writings.

931
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:36,890
So, yeah, but the other thing, you know, let's just throw this in just a couple of things.

932
01:30:38,270 --> 01:30:42,770
The when you say the Book of Enoch, that's typically been in the mindset of most people

933
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:49,210
attributed as authorship as well. Let me just give a little history on that. Yeah, it's a it's a

934
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:54,370
group of it's a writings that perhaps started around, let's say, 1000 BC that were finally

935
01:30:54,370 --> 01:31:00,350
compiled a chronicle writings of those that were functioning within the temple. Let's say, let's

936
01:31:00,350 --> 01:31:05,550
say from Solomon Temple all the way down. And it was kind of like led out into the world around the

937
01:31:05,550 --> 01:31:10,750
first century BC. Right. So it was attributed, you know, to be called the Book of Enoch. But

938
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:15,910
essentially, it was chronicles of those that worked. It's almost as if you, you know, people

939
01:31:15,910 --> 01:31:21,290
that work in the fire department, you know, had all these stories for 1000 years or 900 years or

940
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:27,330
800 years and compiled them and put them out. And these are basically oral, oral information that

941
01:31:27,330 --> 01:31:32,030
correlates quite nicely, let's just say, in the British sense are quite well, not nice, but,

942
01:31:32,050 --> 01:31:38,690
but harmonious harmoniously with a lot of other aspects of what's known as scripture.

943
01:31:39,190 --> 01:31:45,190
It actually shows that there's a level of meditation, you know, thought being put into

944
01:31:45,190 --> 01:31:51,190
these matters as they were put together, because it's almost when you look at, let's say, the central

945
01:31:51,190 --> 01:31:57,510
part of the book, it's very didactic and technical regarding a lawful timekeeping. Right, right. And

946
01:31:57,510 --> 01:32:03,750
it's also further into the what they called what second and third Enoch, they shouldn't be looked

947
01:32:03,750 --> 01:32:08,790
at as chapters of the same book, because just in just in reading the poor translations that we have

948
01:32:08,790 --> 01:32:15,910
available to us in English, it's the authorship of each one of those books is very, very obviously

949
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:24,330
different. And as they're referred to as pseudographic, just means falsely attributed to an author.

950
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:31,610
So as, as you said, as they're known as the books of Enoch, the, the idea of them actually being

951
01:32:31,610 --> 01:32:39,650
penned by the hand of the, the, you know, the historical figure that goes by that,

952
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:45,350
that nomenclature, that's not the case. But I haven't, like I said, I just I'm the only reason

953
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:51,050
I brought it up is because of that, that, that passage in particular. And there are there are

954
01:32:51,050 --> 01:32:55,830
others, I mean, there's certainly information in it. But yeah, the moon, the moon, just for everyone

955
01:32:55,830 --> 01:33:02,430
listening, again, is your the fixture that that reckons or governs the month, what's known as the

956
01:33:02,430 --> 01:33:09,610
function of time known as the month. And the month is basically a function of the year. And the weeks

957
01:33:09,610 --> 01:33:14,770
function within the month and then the days function both through the year or the or the weeks or the

958
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:23,730
month. So it's just the moon governs the month, and the sun governs the day. And together, with

959
01:33:23,730 --> 01:33:31,070
certain movements, you can determine year the year. And then if you want to go beyond the year

960
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:36,650
in large swaths of years, you're looking at constellations for that. And even though there

961
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:40,290
are subtle movements in between, but that's why, for example, you still hear very often,

962
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:46,450
is that a lunar calendar, you know, or we follow a solar calendar, you can't, it's not, it would be

963
01:33:46,450 --> 01:33:51,010
when someone brings up solar calendar or lunar calendar, it's like, you know, the wind up toy

964
01:33:51,010 --> 01:33:56,050
taking one of the hands off, you know, taking the long, let's say, you know, the sun is the long one

965
01:33:56,050 --> 01:33:59,770
and the moon is the short take one of the hands off the mechanical clock. And can you reckon much

966
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:04,430
with that? No, it's going to be arbitrary, you're gonna have to start making stuff up and getting

967
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:09,430
people to agree with it, and you can't measure anything with it. Right. So that's pretty much

968
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:13,270
the function. But this is the state of mankind. One of the things I brought up Seth earlier was

969
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:20,270
that if one can get over their relatively short lifespan, in contrast, or comparison to the

970
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:25,310
infrastructure that's in place known as the natural world or the way the gods function and take a

971
01:34:25,310 --> 01:34:29,970
more than a step back, at least in the mind and look at what's been memorialized over the years

972
01:34:29,970 --> 01:34:36,650
and see how it actually works out quite well. You won't have so many people walking around

973
01:34:36,650 --> 01:34:42,610
on the planet wondering why we're here asking the questions that they're asking, or, you know,

974
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:48,370
what am I, you see, you know, in other words, the level of inefficiency that mankind has experienced

975
01:34:48,370 --> 01:34:54,050
because of this lack of knowledge of the basic infrastructure, that is way beyond his lifespan

976
01:34:54,050 --> 01:34:58,990
has caused the majority of the grief that one is witness, you know, one can witness in modern

977
01:34:58,990 --> 01:35:05,570
society, let's just say, especially now. Because what I say, especially now is because of the almost

978
01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:12,690
instant access to the information and still, it's not being garnered, you know, I mean, you know,

979
01:35:12,770 --> 01:35:18,630
books, I would say they're very expensive. Yeah, good books are expensive. They that is something

980
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:26,490
that I've noticed actually, in the last several years, is having access to the internet, and

981
01:35:26,490 --> 01:35:35,550
information and whatnot is that at first, let's say the first 2025 years, you know, we have this

982
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:45,490
great tool to use. But actually finding books was not incredibly easy, at least in the digital

983
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:52,730
formats, came very easy. But recently, recently being within the last decade, let's say,

984
01:35:53,270 --> 01:36:00,430
there has been much more of a push to the digitization of scripts of just books.

985
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:05,170
Well, the point I was going to make was that books were very, very expensive, let's say an eon ago.

986
01:36:05,970 --> 01:36:10,150
And then when they became cheap, there was one of the major complaints, you know, with the printing

987
01:36:10,150 --> 01:36:14,270
press was now that everything we're everyone's talking about all this crap is going to be

988
01:36:14,270 --> 01:36:19,810
published. So we're going to be inundated with junk, right? Okay, so then, you know, so then,

989
01:36:19,930 --> 01:36:24,310
you know, computers were very expensive, and electronic access to media was very expensive

990
01:36:24,310 --> 01:36:29,710
when it was, you know, it's Advent. And then as it became more popular, anyone who was paying

991
01:36:29,710 --> 01:36:33,790
attention could readily said the same thing that Oh, now that it's going to be inexpensive and

992
01:36:33,790 --> 01:36:38,970
accessible to everyone, it's going to be lots of junk, which is true. But it doesn't mean you

993
01:36:38,970 --> 01:36:45,030
know, you can't discern the, the easy, you know, the good stuff and enjoy the easy access to it

994
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:46,130
where it wasn't there before.

995
01:36:47,130 --> 01:36:54,050
Certainly there you have to, or one not you in particular, but anyone has to deal with,

996
01:36:54,750 --> 01:37:01,710
I think it's been termed the fire hose of falsehood. And that refers specifically to

997
01:37:02,110 --> 01:37:08,770
bad information being intentionally disseminated, and then, you know, repeated, and how easy it is

998
01:37:08,770 --> 01:37:20,310
to do that now. And it's one of the reasons that I continually just avoid most forms of what people

999
01:37:20,310 --> 01:37:28,770
call that that show they call the news. And I, there's been specifically within the last,

1000
01:37:28,770 --> 01:37:38,930
I don't know, two to five years, the inundation of the information that just makes no pretense

1001
01:37:38,930 --> 01:37:44,790
at all towards accuracy, things that are just being said to be said, the idea of the headline

1002
01:37:44,790 --> 01:37:53,290
is the entire story has become much more prevalent. And we're currently seeing that in, in effect,

1003
01:37:53,290 --> 01:38:03,610
and in, in everyday conversation, the opinions that people espouse, and the it's, it's, it makes

1004
01:38:03,610 --> 01:38:07,970
your stomach turn. Well, it's a sign, it's still the sign of the time we have about another year

1005
01:38:07,970 --> 01:38:15,310
before it starts to change. What you will see coming after the next springtime is more of

1006
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:22,310
an understanding that, yeah, the Middle East is very, very important. And offering, you know,

1007
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:27,830
mental and material support to what is going on there is going to be more important than it is now

1008
01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:36,590
than just a fight over there, you know, and when and also while that attention is changing in that

1009
01:38:36,590 --> 01:38:41,310
direction, there's going to be a little more access of the information of the stuff that you

1010
01:38:41,310 --> 01:38:46,690
call, you know, it's called Greek speak coming around. I think you and I have had discussions

1011
01:38:46,690 --> 01:38:51,770
in the past, that it's not just the news, the news is part of this frustration, this tension,

1012
01:38:52,830 --> 01:38:58,530
time. And I think I've briefly mentioned what's going on in this time period, which is one third

1013
01:38:58,530 --> 01:39:04,050
of the host, you know, the spiritual realm is being those that are to be quarantined and corral to the

1014
01:39:04,050 --> 01:39:07,270
earth are being brought, being brought here at this time, and no one's really noticing.

1015
01:39:07,970 --> 01:39:13,110
Because you can't, they're very discreet, right? Unless you're able to discern that

1016
01:39:13,870 --> 01:39:20,470
through information. But But the other thing that I wanted to say about this time period and the

1017
01:39:20,470 --> 01:39:25,290
time period that's coming, is that it's not just about the Middle East, that's just things to

1018
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:31,070
look at, because the gods function very simply, you know, where where it started is where it's

1019
01:39:31,070 --> 01:39:37,150
going to end. You see, when when you watch a play, the curtains open, and the play resumes,

1020
01:39:37,370 --> 01:39:41,730
you know, or continue or begins, commences. And when the play is over, the curtains close. So

1021
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:47,650
there's a lot of, you know, opening and closing in circular fashion here of what you can you can see

1022
01:39:47,650 --> 01:39:54,930
with mankind. And it's ultimately, those who know are not going to be better off than those who don't

1023
01:39:54,930 --> 01:40:01,010
know, ultimately, in this condition, right? But then it brings up the question, would you rather

1024
01:40:01,010 --> 01:40:04,950
know, would you rather not know? And you know what, I've heard directly from people's mouths,

1025
01:40:05,050 --> 01:40:11,770
they would rather not know many things. So likewise, so yeah, so that mindset, okay,

1026
01:40:11,770 --> 01:40:17,870
that stubbornness, that rebelliousness, and that just, you know, spitting in the face of what is

1027
01:40:17,870 --> 01:40:23,290
real. When you said about good and evil, evil will be brought upon them. In other words,

1028
01:40:23,330 --> 01:40:30,850
what you will see is they will be rewarded for that attitude. You see, and quite handsomely,

1029
01:40:30,970 --> 01:40:38,170
actually. But the the aspect of the information in the news and what people are concerned about

1030
01:40:38,170 --> 01:40:41,490
and all that, no, that's still not really important, unless you know what's coming,

1031
01:40:41,590 --> 01:40:49,430
and you have to sift through it. But the general state of those even putting out information is

1032
01:40:49,430 --> 01:40:55,150
very, very piss poor. You see, so in other words, the people that the general people at large,

1033
01:40:55,270 --> 01:40:59,890
the layman, looking up to the entitled classes, even those in alternative media,

1034
01:41:00,410 --> 01:41:05,210
and they're not getting anything with any anything to bite into. There's occasionally

1035
01:41:05,210 --> 01:41:10,450
something good and edible, but it's like sifting through someone's poop to get undigested corn.

1036
01:41:11,810 --> 01:41:16,790
So you don't want to do that as pleasant. Yeah, about as pleasant. Yeah, typically, you will,

1037
01:41:16,910 --> 01:41:20,170
you will find there are things out there, there are little tidbits, but it's very,

1038
01:41:20,250 --> 01:41:24,730
very distasteful to do so. So obstinance is what I've been recommending. And it's kind of ironic,

1039
01:41:24,730 --> 01:41:30,290
because, you know, you want to promote, you know, this kind of platform, and I can't, it's just that

1040
01:41:30,290 --> 01:41:35,310
I happen to be here and, you know, speaking, because no one else is, and it's simply that.

1041
01:41:35,450 --> 01:41:41,750
But I think the time period that's coming, and to do more diligence for others, if you can do it,

1042
01:41:41,810 --> 01:41:47,010
that's why it's probably going to be pending a project where it will be more specific and elaborate.

1043
01:41:47,870 --> 01:41:52,290
And it won't be live, there'll be something people can access, quote, unquote, files,

1044
01:41:52,450 --> 01:41:56,970
and it'll be much more detailed, and give references and things which might sound,

1045
01:41:56,970 --> 01:42:01,510
you know, two hours, we have the liberty here to do that, you know, do like four or five

1046
01:42:01,510 --> 01:42:06,570
continue, you know, weeks on one subject, but I believe that just coming and being redundant

1047
01:42:07,190 --> 01:42:15,370
is important. You know, to some extent, just repeating the basics is really where it's at,

1048
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:24,630
at this point. I have one more question. Before time escapes us directly to the theme of the

1049
01:42:24,630 --> 01:42:33,970
program, or not the program, but, you know, the sonic endeavor, and that is, are we one and all,

1050
01:42:34,210 --> 01:42:37,770
whether wittingly or unwittingly, servants of the gods?

1051
01:42:39,290 --> 01:42:45,190
No, you're not. Well, yes, you are. In other words, your law, yes and no. When I say no,

1052
01:42:45,310 --> 01:42:52,950
I meant more specifically the, a certain part of the hierarchy, but everyone is serving some

1053
01:42:52,950 --> 01:42:59,050
form of god, because your law comes from there, right? Even a staunch atheist says, you know,

1054
01:42:59,070 --> 01:43:03,210
it's very easy, it's like, well, I don't believe in any gods, Greek, I got you there. Well, no,

1055
01:43:03,270 --> 01:43:06,470
will you follow the laws of the state, or do you acknowledge the laws of the state?

1056
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:10,890
And they'll typically say yes. Well, then, you know, the state is your god, and April 1st is

1057
01:43:10,890 --> 01:43:16,830
your holiday, and the state even provides you a god in statuary and iconography, don't they?

1058
01:43:16,830 --> 01:43:22,330
And in name, they provide you a god. Okay, let me rephrase the question then.

1059
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:31,410
Is all of creation a servant of the Most High, whether they are aware or unaware?

1060
01:43:32,670 --> 01:43:37,150
No, oh yeah, yes they are, but they're not aware of it, right? In other words, even the most

1061
01:43:37,150 --> 01:43:41,530
malevolent entities are still taking marching orders from the Most High, because that is their

1062
01:43:41,530 --> 01:43:47,770
god. That is exactly what I was looking for. Yeah, and that is, I'll just give a little tidbit,

1063
01:43:47,870 --> 01:43:51,230
which I'll discuss more. The gods do have a god, and it happens to be the Most High,

1064
01:43:51,790 --> 01:43:56,970
because he is not subject to death. That's what makes the Most High the god of the gods,

1065
01:43:57,150 --> 01:44:03,050
where the other gods are still subject to death. Right. So, they're almost mortal,

1066
01:44:03,210 --> 01:44:06,370
well, they are mortal in their own realm, which is the immaterial realm.

1067
01:44:07,470 --> 01:44:14,890
Uh-huh, and more information and examples, and it's sort of, and it could be pedantic,

1068
01:44:15,010 --> 01:44:18,870
you know, if someone wants more detail, it could be given, and descriptions can be given,

1069
01:44:18,990 --> 01:44:23,490
and the whole thing is it always has to tie into something that's tangible, because you're still

1070
01:44:23,490 --> 01:44:29,890
dealing with, you know, you're dealing with an aspect of existence that we are in right now,

1071
01:44:29,890 --> 01:44:34,890
that it has to be somehow materialized, it has to be tangible. Even if you can imagine it,

1072
01:44:35,410 --> 01:44:40,130
a material metaphor has to be given, you know, this is just the thing to consider,

1073
01:44:40,290 --> 01:44:46,250
to accommodate the human mindset right now. Otherwise, you end up going off, and you try to,

1074
01:44:46,410 --> 01:44:53,750
you know, people make things up, and it's easier to give a material analogy. You know, that's why

1075
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:59,770
you hear things like quantum physics, and it's ridiculous, and initially the concept sounds good,

1076
01:45:00,330 --> 01:45:03,850
you know, yeah, of course, you know, strange things can happen, and it's wonderful that the

1077
01:45:03,850 --> 01:45:10,350
mainstream acknowledges it, but when you look at the premise of it, it's absurd. So there's the

1078
01:45:10,350 --> 01:45:14,970
essence of counter space, how that exists, because like, let's say, electricity can only be

1079
01:45:14,970 --> 01:45:22,050
reckoned with in counter space, let's say, it's a notion that someone brought up in the early

1080
01:45:22,050 --> 01:45:25,630
20th century, his name escapes me right now, the German fellow, the naturalist,

1081
01:45:25,790 --> 01:45:31,690
but most of the stuff is very flaky. But nonetheless, that'll be brought up.

1082
01:45:32,290 --> 01:45:37,130
And here's the thing, folks, if you really want to comprehend one essence of the gods,

1083
01:45:37,270 --> 01:45:43,510
try to wrap your mind around electricity. That is directly an essence of the gods, basically,

1084
01:45:43,590 --> 01:45:48,690
when you're dealing with electricity, it's the closest, most direct, intangible, or intangible,

1085
01:45:48,770 --> 01:45:56,390
if you go to science, godlike type energy you can deal with at this point, that most people

1086
01:45:56,390 --> 01:46:01,670
are interacting with or considering. So we'll get into that as well. And essentially, maybe,

1087
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:07,350
how about this, Seth, because we're running out of time, is that what separates the man from the

1088
01:46:07,350 --> 01:46:13,970
gods is very simple. Well, man needs material to be animated, right? And the gods don't. And also,

1089
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:23,290
the gods have technology that man doesn't. What separates the animating spirit

1090
01:46:23,290 --> 01:46:30,430
from the gods? What separates the animation of man, aside from the corporal?

1091
01:46:31,850 --> 01:46:34,150
You have to rephrase that, I'm not getting the question.

1092
01:46:36,630 --> 01:46:42,750
You say that what separates man is the need for material for the animation.

1093
01:46:43,410 --> 01:46:44,270
To be conscious.

1094
01:46:45,170 --> 01:46:48,990
What comes when the spirit is removed?

1095
01:46:49,890 --> 01:46:50,990
Oh, unconsciousness.

1096
01:46:51,850 --> 01:46:54,850
Okay, so the spirit without the body is unconscious.

1097
01:46:55,590 --> 01:47:01,470
That's right. And typically, it works the other way around. In other words, the body is subject,

1098
01:47:01,870 --> 01:47:06,910
and the soul, and the body becomes subject to death, which then it goes into chemical,

1099
01:47:07,110 --> 01:47:12,070
the soul dies, it ceases to exist, which the soul can also be attributed to the metabolism, right?

1100
01:47:12,710 --> 01:47:17,270
Because when you're breathing, it's obviously more than just breathing, you know, diaphragm,

1101
01:47:17,270 --> 01:47:22,850
fluids, all these other things, right? So the soul is terminated, and the body then goes into

1102
01:47:22,850 --> 01:47:28,210
chemical decomposition. And fortunately, when those things happen, you go into a light out

1103
01:47:28,210 --> 01:47:34,150
condition, typically, which is just like being asleep, without dreaming. And that's basically

1104
01:47:34,150 --> 01:47:39,830
what death is. Is there any concept of time? Do you think? No, I suppose I'm asking for

1105
01:47:39,830 --> 01:47:43,910
no concept of time. No, just like when you're sleeping, there's no concept of time. Yeah.

1106
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:50,210
So to one who may be reincarnated in the future, it could appear to be nothing more than

1107
01:47:50,210 --> 01:47:55,670
the blink of an eye. Correct. And when most people will find that out.

1108
01:47:57,790 --> 01:48:01,470
Okay, well, thank you. Thanks for calling in Seth. This is Uncommon Radio.

1109
01:48:02,190 --> 01:48:06,690
And we will see you folks for solo eight, hopefully. Thank you very much.
