00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Greetings, everyone, and welcome to Uncommon Radio.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,740
This is the Greek with Greek speak speaking at you.

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,740
Yes, it is the second month.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:13,480
I would propose it is the beginning of the second week or more into the second week.

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,220
I'd say about the middle, I'm reckoning around the twelfth day after noon.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,460
And I think giving the lawful timekeeping should take precedent over the ridiculous pagan papal stuff.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,900
And I guess I said it, you heard me.

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,760
And when I say pagan, I'm not talking about the fashion where people, you know, I'm a

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,400
pagan. Well, what they do is let their hair grow.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,520
They wear sunglasses and get all these tattoos and wear, you know, whatever, you know, the

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,180
look, paint their toenails black.

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,220
That's just a ridiculous fashion.

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,200
I'm talking about the mindset that is on prevailing this planet.

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,100
Now, that just means however you want to take it.

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,800
Is it a pejorative term?

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,580
Is it kind of bad?

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,200
I wouldn't say it's bad, but it ain't good.

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,060
And later on, you'll find that it ain't it's pretty bad, but you'll have to find out.

19
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,900
See, I don't want to talk about what's really bad because I think people need to find that out on

20
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:08,240
their own. But at the same time, it's around what they call April 20th, 2017, for that

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,220
ridiculous mindset, which everyone tends to have at some point in their life till they

22
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,620
discover that they've been caught out there.

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,780
But here's the thing, folks.

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,700
I hope you're sucker free for the next two hours because I don't know what we're going to be

25
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,020
talking about. Basically, I've been keeping a sort of a numeric sequence coming around here.

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,020
And remember, this is speaking in public.

27
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,580
So, you know, if I ride the public bus or use the public bathroom, I was speaking to

28
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,340
someone, a forest like, I don't know what to say tonight, and I hope the audience isn't like

29
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,340
who I see in public.

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,800
It's just deplorable.

31
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,500
But anyway, and when I say that, I don't mean just, you know, some dark alleyway or

32
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,140
something, which I've never really been down.

33
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,680
But I just mean the public at large.

34
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,080
And really, if you want to discern the public, you don't look at them or a mass of

35
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,560
people. By the way, when they take a cancer out of a body, they call it a mass.

36
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:03,060
So anyway, when they decide this, the suspect society is to be viewed.

37
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,060
Do you folks remember the 1950s propaganda films about UFOs and all that?

38
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,420
You know, the little green man lands and says, what?

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,180
Take me to your leader.

40
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,160
Well, why don't I? What is it?

41
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,760
Why does he talk to just whoever he ran into?

42
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,940
Well, think about it, you know.

43
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,240
OK, anyway, well, the leader's got the power and also he represents the people.

44
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,060
That's what I want to just maybe talk a little bit about.

45
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,420
You hear a lot of, I don't know, I'm laughing because it's like I really just I

46
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,540
mean, it's not even worth bringing up.

47
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,620
I'll bring it up just for about maybe 10 seconds.

48
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,940
You've been thoroughly dummy loaded all week.

49
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,640
I don't need to know what you've listened to, what you like, what you don't like.

50
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,620
If you've turned on any alternative media, any mainstream media, go to university,

51
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,100
read the newspaper, even talk to someone next to you.

52
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,880
You have been dummy loaded.

53
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,100
That is the condition on this planet, folks.

54
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,260
And, you know, showing up here for two hours a week to kind of rationalize is

55
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:07,060
insane. One of the things you might have discovered from especially the archives,

56
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,620
this is sort of cumulative, by the way, when you hear Greek speak, it's

57
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:18,700
cumulative. When you when you listen to the archives, there's a long chain of

58
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,780
descriptions and explanations on why humanity is in such bad shape.

59
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,840
And an idiot with a microphone telling you things are going to be better or an

60
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,880
idiot with a printing press saying the same or telling you that some warships

61
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,920
are going to end the world is ridiculous.

62
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,640
I mean, on and on and on and on.

63
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,920
I mean, it just there is no rationale whatsoever.

64
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,060
I mean, you won't find it.

65
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,300
Now, speaking of finding some rationale, why don't we just say for a moment that

66
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,780
this is also a forum that is kind of open?

67
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,360
I've just been the phones are ready and I will give that and I will give out the

68
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,700
information, meaning that you can participate.

69
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:05,180
And the call in number is 218-339-8525, 218-339-8525.

70
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,100
And I will bring up the phones here momentarily.

71
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,460
The other thing to consider is if you like the Skype convention, you could always

72
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,360
go to Skype and that would be the email for Uncommon Radio, which is

73
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,040
UncommonSenseRadio1, numeric one, that is, at gmail.com.

74
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,940
And that is also the Skype request contact.

75
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,320
So if you'd like to join somehow, you may.

76
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,400
All right.

77
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,500
And I'll keep an eye on what's called the chat at American Freedom Radio and perhaps

78
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,260
have the emails available as well.

79
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:43,760
Many people have been emailing all positive, but positive in a sense that it

80
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,620
shows that they're listening.

81
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,100
The questions and the comments are very specific.

82
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,760
The worst thing you could do is email, oh, I really like you.

83
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,480
It's like, you know, I very often, you know, well, what's what do you like

84
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,900
listening or what do you like reading or what do you like?

85
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,420
I really like it.

86
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
Well, what's about it?

87
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,520
Just like it.

88
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,020
Right.

89
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,320
It's just I get none of that, thankfully.

90
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,940
And by the way, when I also gotten some private comments about, well, you know,

91
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,200
when you give descriptions of humanity or religious types or scientific types,

92
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,840
you're discussing the low hanging fruit.

93
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,640
Well, perhaps perhaps commenting on the low hanging fruit, because the majority

94
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,840
of all of it is not even on the tree.

95
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,080
It has fallen off the tree and it is rotten.

96
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,120
The best of the best is the low hanging fruit.

97
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,560
There is the top of the tree has been cut off.

98
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:36,500
So anyway, well, let's let's just see if I could bring up the phones and just

99
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,440
make those available in case someone would like to make themselves available

100
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,940
to speak at everyone else.

101
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,840
So we'll see now it's just a conference manager.

102
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,340
Let's see.

103
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,240
We are on.

104
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,220
OK, so the caller network is open.

105
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,400
Please call if you want to just voice something.

106
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:53,980
That's fine.

107
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,900
Used to give several criteria about calling in and one was if you're intoxicated

108
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,840
or under the influence, please don't do it because you might think you're fine,

109
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,320
but you're not.

110
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,520
The rest is don't speak about yourself too much because you know what?

111
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,000
People might act politely, socially, that they care, but no one really cares.

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,600
They're waiting for you to shut up so they could tell you what they want to tell you.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,420
So if you call in, be edifying, share something, give us some good testimony

114
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,260
and provoke some thought.

115
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,920
So with that said, let's just see what's going on over here.

116
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,360
OK, I don't know.

117
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,360
I don't see much happening in chat.

118
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,980
Well, there's always something happening in chat other than cobwebs and tumbleweeds.

119
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:36,800
Whatever.

120
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,060
OK, not much that I could discuss.

121
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,460
Let's see.

122
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,500
Check the emails right now.

123
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,340
OK, so basically, if anyone's noticed through archives that there's been a

124
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,960
successive solo progression and this would be the eighth one coming around and

125
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,380
suggesting that eight is a number of completions, suggesting the eight is

126
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,280
infinity sign, you know, for the you know, the eighth the eight year old mentality

127
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,880
thing because it looks like an infinity sign or whatever.

128
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,280
That is another another approach.

129
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,340
If one is going to discuss this from, let's say, a cosmic perspective, we don't

130
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,280
really have a lot of information or how it can be attributed to something.

131
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,360
You know, it's too specific.

132
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,100
The specifics is that this particular epoch of humankind will be finished,

133
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,400
thankfully. Now, what does that mean?

134
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:36,240
Well, it means that life as as is known will not will not exist the way it is

135
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,300
now, which which is something else to to discuss.

136
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,020
You know, some people say, well, you know, Greek talking about the end all the

137
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,060
time, you know, this and that.

138
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,260
And some people, a couple of people would say.

139
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,160
And it's not about the end.

140
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,060
It's about the end of this condition.

141
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,480
Here's the thing.

142
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,380
Let's just let's just give a little bit of a preface on the condition.

143
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,880
For those of you that are have a pulse and can walk and I know you get I know

144
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,380
you're taking up space and giving off heat, but it might be considered a smart

145
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,280
space heater. You know how they have smartphones anyway.

146
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,720
There's a pun on that, by the way.

147
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,340
And it's not a pun like you can say, well, I'm waiting for people to be smart

148
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,040
phones to be dumb again, because, you know, are you waiting for space here is

149
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,400
to be smart and whatever, you know, I don't know, or dumb or so people can be

150
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,920
smart. People are space heaters.

151
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,840
You take up space, you give off heat.

152
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,360
What are you going to do with the rest of the time?

153
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,960
Now, one thing that, you know, cutting to the chase is very simple.

154
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,080
You know, there's a lot of you can go to art.

155
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,659
Art is the best way to maybe think about this or philosophy is another good way to

156
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,640
think about it. Not that philosophy and art is good, necessarily.

157
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,220
It just happens to be an expression.

158
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,540
The meaning of this is so simple, just like what's the meaning of two?

159
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,920
And people tend to illustrate it.

160
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,960
Or what's the meaning of this?

161
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,820
You have to have a very simple meaning, not oversimplifying it for the dumb crowd.

162
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,060
You know, or to dummy load anyone.

163
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,860
But it's very simple. If you're looking around for answers, you are it.

164
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,420
What I mean by that is very simple.

165
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:10,000
If you start seeing the infrastructure of how society cosmically has been set up and

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,300
how things are going to take place and why, right, the key why is the key word there

167
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:20,200
or the key aspect, you will discover that a certain amount of time and a certain

168
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,720
amount of people need to come through here.

169
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,480
So if you've shown up, if you are born into this reality, even if you've died within

170
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,100
the first 30 seconds, it doesn't matter.

171
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,340
If you have lived even a short life, it doesn't matter.

172
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,240
You have showed up. You have taken a place number.

173
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,980
Yes, the gods are into numbers and you will find that out later.

174
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,940
You have taken up a place and your job is finished.

175
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,460
All you have to do is show up.

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,840
Once I give the metaphor, and this is true, where a project had to be done, need a lot

177
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,320
of bodies, a crane situation type thing, get the picture, heavy lifting, rigging.

178
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,200
And you need a lot of people around in case something goes wrong.

179
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,200
And I called a lot of people and they said, well, describe what I should show up for.

180
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,980
And I described, I said, I know nothing about that.

181
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,180
And I said, well, you don't have to.

182
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,100
If you show up, it's 90 percent to show up at the time and you'll be fine.

183
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,040
And guess what? You're 90 percent done if you're in this world.

184
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,420
Now, think about that for a minute.

185
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,060
Actually, don't think for a minute.

186
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,000
Well, OK. All right.

187
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,200
Think about it for a minute.

188
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,040
Why should you think about it?

189
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,620
Because doesn't it start to put all of this into a different perspective?

190
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,000
You know, when you hear about things like fate, I'm not talking about just from the

191
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,140
Greek mythological point where there are three aspects and even the gods are subject

192
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,520
to that. By the way, if anyone wants to look into Greek mythology, look at it

193
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,260
specifically. Don't look at it based on what you think you know about it.

194
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,860
And don't read something that someone wrote about someone else with someone else

195
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,940
wrote about it. Get a little more functional.

196
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,360
You'll see even because there's the aspect of the gods, it's brought up there.

197
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,180
But this is a concept of fate.

198
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,240
OK. And then there's the concept of free will.

199
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,200
And you will see there's no there is no difficulty with that.

200
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,660
You see, there is no how would you say, well, is it a paradox?

201
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,760
What about free will? What about it?

202
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,460
Everything ties together very, very neatly.

203
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,200
What about this? What about that?

204
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,800
Now, if you understand that you are here, your job is done when you show up and

205
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,360
you're functional. Even if you're not functional, you came, you came, you saw, you

206
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,760
did nothing. That's pretty much what it's about.

207
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,600
There's a saga. There's a story.

208
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,880
There's like I said earlier, there's art, there's philosophy, there's works, there's

209
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,220
war, there's growing, all this other stuff.

210
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,500
Now, when you consider the growth aspect, you're an agricultural based society,

211
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,040
period. Right.

212
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,880
And here's the other aspect to it.

213
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,820
You probably walked around today and didn't didn't mind that very much being called a

214
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,800
filter bag, did you?

215
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,100
What do I mean by that? You know, how many times have you heard?

216
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,140
Well, you know, tying this with the agricultural aspect that you absorb things like

217
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,480
you're a sponge or a filter bag.

218
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,740
This is what you've been told now.

219
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,400
Why tying this back together, if you show up, you're just you're done, you've pretty

220
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,300
much accomplished most of what you should accomplish.

221
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:10,300
It's because everything around you has been indirectly and directly designed

222
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,580
indirectly, meaning it's not the exact meaning from here on out, but it is what

223
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,800
you've got right now as a deception.

224
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:24,320
It's a deception to keep you in a place where you have what's called culture,

225
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,140
tradition, society, your aspirations, your desires, your perceptions have all been

226
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,760
pre-planted or preset for you.

227
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,600
So basically, right now, if you are in any culture, in any society, there's really

228
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,780
very little you can think about that you cannot find that either someone has written

229
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:44,280
a book about or a cult of a society, a culture or tradition that has something to do

230
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,260
with it. Even these new emerging technologies tend to fit within that realm or that

231
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,240
realm, meaning the earthly realm of what's in the world right now.

232
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,320
So, again, back to the filter bag.

233
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,180
You folks believe at this point still that what you are being told and what you are

234
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:08,600
happy with hearing and being in agreement and believing tends to supersede your

235
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,340
ability to perceive what's going on with your own body, with your own body.

236
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,300
I'm not talking about stupid stuff that is put in front of you by the scientific

237
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:23,100
society, the medical society or the legal society or the religious society, anything

238
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,760
else. It's just you and yourself.

239
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:31,760
When you put your feet and your hands in water, do they shrivel up when the membrane

240
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,720
softens or do they expand like a frog?

241
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:41,060
Think about it. When a soft membrane shrivels up, that means that it's under a slight

242
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,300
vacuum. Put a slab of meat in a plastic bag and put a little suction on it.

243
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,600
Does that plastic bag expand or does it shrivel up around that slab of meat and bone or

244
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,760
whatever you got in the bag?

245
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,820
Think about it. Notice how plants dry out, how they shrivel up.

246
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,160
Well, you have something called a biological vacuum.

247
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,600
Biology just means life.

248
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,780
OK, how can one start to define life, right?

249
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,700
Because if you're not alive, you're not here and if you're not here, nothing matters,

250
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,840
does it? By the way, I just want to throw in a little dig to you older guys out there and

251
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:18,560
women. You know, very often I do make a comment about how the older people have rendered

252
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,860
themselves useless, especially in the past half century.

253
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,980
I recently had someone, this has happened many, many times.

254
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,560
It's just been reoccurring.

255
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,540
If you don't just say it on radio, I just thought about it again, is when you speak to an

256
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:35,700
old person or older, meaning older than 50 typically, and you start, let's say,

257
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,520
mentioning things that are coming in the future because it's not difficult to know what's

258
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,640
coming in the future. You've just been trained that you shouldn't.

259
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,600
Basically, when you start going 5, 10, 20 years beyond, when you hear an answer like,

260
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,780
well, I'm not going to be around then, so it doesn't matter.

261
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,780
Think about the fatalism there.

262
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,540
Here you have an elder in society that actually professes with their own mouth that

263
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,320
because they will not be here, they are apathetic and don't care.

264
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,500
Isn't that the same thing as saying that you don't care right now?

265
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,760
And if you actually look at their behavior, you guessed it.

266
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,040
Yep, that's right. That's why they slap diapers on them, throw them in nursing homes and

267
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,060
pump them up with drugs.

268
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,900
You see, it's not pretty, but it's true.

269
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,180
Not all the old people, but the majority.

270
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,240
If you're around any elders, go ahead and ask them, try to discuss anything that's beyond a

271
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,360
cereal box or what's in the newspaper or whatever kind of indoctrination or pranking

272
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,060
they've suffered. What are you going to get?

273
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,280
Pretty much nothing. And this is the condition of society.

274
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,260
Now, look, if you're just visiting this planet, taking notes, it's not going to be really

275
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,480
hard to come back wherever you came from and describe it.

276
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,560
It's very, very simple.

277
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,060
There isn't much going on other than what you are doing.

278
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:01,180
Think about it for a moment, what you are doing, because the purpose behind it, I just

279
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:07,420
hopefully illustrated and demonstrated, has been wiped away because your purpose is to

280
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:13,460
show up. If you were born into this reality and you are functioning even now, your job

281
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,700
is done because there is a big plan.

282
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,900
There is a big infrastructure.

283
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,500
I'll give you another example, perhaps.

284
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,040
I always discuss the infrastructure, not always, but tend to.

285
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,620
Remember, this is all cumulative.

286
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,580
A lot of the things that were brought up, let's say I maybe did a couple of talk shows and

287
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:32,640
did a few things, did a project with Chuck O'Chelly and whatever, all those things I

288
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,880
tend to repeat, but not really get into things too much.

289
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,600
It's cumulative. If you want to go into archives and hear other stuff, elaborate on other

290
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,800
topics. But essentially, just being here.

291
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,080
And showing up is it.

292
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,240
So how do you tie it all together?

293
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,700
What's there to tie together?

294
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,900
What do you want to tie together?

295
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,280
What do you see, what do you perceive?

296
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,200
Coming to this planet, let's say coming into this existence and realizing that your life

297
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,780
is as short as it is, is going to require a little bit of effort for you to understand

298
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,500
the infrastructure, which is whatever.

299
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,880
Just thinking of how else can this be explained?

300
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,859
The infrastructure example that I give, for example, is someone riding a commuter train

301
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:25,000
and this commuter train, you know, whatever, however long they ride it, you know, it's

302
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,140
not built for them. It's built for society at large or wherever it wants to buy a

303
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,900
ticket or whatever, gain access to it.

304
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,820
There's a tremendous infrastructure there, all the tracks being laid down, all the

305
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,280
planning, the actual manufacture of the equipment, on and on and on and on.

306
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,000
And the maintenance, it's massive infrastructure.

307
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,440
Most people that commute and ride that are not aware of what went into it.

308
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,220
Yes, let's say, you know, maybe there's some civil engineers or whatever that might

309
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,240
be to a degree.

310
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,980
You see, so when do you actually appreciate what has been done so you could just take

311
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,340
a simple, you know, train ride to your slave job and get a piece of paper that you think

312
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,460
is being paid? You see how everything ties together.

313
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,280
So when you look at the infrastructure and how everything is put in place cosmically,

314
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,040
right? You're done.

315
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,460
You showed up. You're pretty much.

316
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,620
Think about it, you know, if you're here.

317
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,800
So what does this do?

318
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,620
Well, it's not it's actually the opposite of it should be very optimistic, not

319
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,440
fatalistic. I would suggest that it would be the most probably one of the most

320
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,740
enlightening things and one of the most inspirational things that could be said to

321
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,640
anyone. If you're here, you've done 90 percent of it.

322
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,020
Why? Because now you can start filtering and start thinking objectively of what's

323
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,980
going on around you. Well, what's going on around you?

324
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,000
Well, at large, if you anyone in general, if you are dealing with

325
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,540
any type of, let's say, crowd, this goes all the way from

326
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,340
the most loosely assembled or figured social groups,

327
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,520
meaning like, you know, movie clubs, music clubs or whatever, all the way

328
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,300
into political stuff, activists, activists.

329
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,880
Anyway. OK, I'm not going to lie.

330
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,240
All right. So then then you then you go up into other more structures and industry

331
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,840
and what's called government.

332
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,060
Those cannot exist without many of the outlines set forth.

333
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,260
And this is not a recommendation.

334
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,720
Take it as you will. But I mention it because it's quick and easy and it's a good

335
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,040
reference. Gustav Le Bon's The Crowd.

336
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,760
He actually wrote about about 1895 or something,

337
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,380
the technical aspects of how a crowd forms.

338
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,840
Let me just reiterate that real quick.

339
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,100
In order to form a crowd of people, they do come together under a thought and

340
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,860
idea, religious, technical, political, whatever.

341
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,420
Now, in order to get the common masses to form that crowd,

342
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,000
that idea has to be made so simple.

343
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:51,080
That when you examine the idea, once it's been adjusted for the crowd mentality,

344
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,160
it hardly represents its original form anymore.

345
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,320
Right. You ever. OK, let's pick on the activists a little bit.

346
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,060
I mean, I shouldn't because they're in really bad shape.

347
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,160
You know, they're very sensitive in their act, whatever.

348
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,360
Ask them what they're protesting about.

349
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,180
But their activism is about it's not even skin deep, it's paper thin,

350
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,400
paper, paper thin, not even to have no clue, but it's a crowd.

351
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:23,160
OK, the same, you know, the arts might be interesting because that's so subjective.

352
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:29,620
Fine. You want to go into industry, look at the compartmentalization.

353
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:36,220
You want to get into more directive institutions, perhaps what's called

354
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:41,180
government or whatever. I mean, that's when you get up to that level,

355
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,480
by the way, when you're actually ruling the ignorant masses.

356
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,880
You know, I think that the ones that are in what's called government are a

357
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,880
different species.

358
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,440
Almost so.

359
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:59,600
So the situation is very, very, very clear.

360
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,580
Now, who it's clear to?

361
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,980
Well, I guess that's up to whoever it's clear to and who it's not.

362
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,360
But it's really simple, folks.

363
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,480
One of the simplest maxims is food, clothing, shelter and find out what the

364
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,880
soul, the spirit and the body is.

365
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,360
I'll just keep plugging that away.

366
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,940
And it all ties back together.

367
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,660
You know, you think you're a filter bag.

368
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,580
Now, calories matter, don't they?

369
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:21,820
Huh?

370
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,660
The definition of a calorie, by the way, is, you know, the amount of heat given

371
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,300
off in a certain thermal unit.

372
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,060
Versus the amount that's being tested, you know, in weight compared to how

373
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,060
much heat it takes to raise given amount of water, one degree.

374
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,640
That's basically OK.

375
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,580
That's the definition of it without using too many technical terms.

376
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:52,160
So when that experiment is given and in order to determine the caloric value,

377
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,080
it is carbonized, is burned until it can't burn anymore.

378
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,080
So if you eat a piece of toast or a banana or whatever, when you pass it

379
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,220
through the body, is it charcoal briquette?

380
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,620
Or is it, you see, so what do calories have to do with food?

381
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,780
And vitamins and all this other stuff, what do you where you how come your

382
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,120
references are so screwed up?

383
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,520
Could it be because you are?

384
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,460
Well, I mean, you not meaning you, but, you know, I'm not talking about the

385
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,540
furry animal called you.

386
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,820
Yeah, well, they're accommodating you.

387
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,640
It's very, very, very simple.

388
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,640
Now, it's easy to sound rantish about this, but how about discussing the

389
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,680
simplicity of it?

390
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,480
Right. You don't even know how the body works.

391
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,560
Now, you have these idiots called doctors or whatever.

392
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,340
They're entitled classes and they're very stupid, by the way.

393
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,800
I mean, because, OK, here's the thing.

394
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,940
I recently did an experiment more than once.

395
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,420
And fortunately, I try to avoid this type.

396
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,220
They're called academics, people with degrees.

397
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,280
And I'm not saying you should, but I do.

398
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,200
I avoid them.

399
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,760
And with anyone, any one of them just have a discussion, discussion regarding

400
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:03,920
information and education and just bring up that anyone with more than an eighth

401
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,400
grade education has almost irreparable damage done to them by the system, whether

402
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,480
it's private or public school.

403
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,340
And they always agree.

404
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,120
The academics always agree.

405
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,560
And I'm talking about the Ph.D.

406
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,400
professor types.

407
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,900
And they say, yes, that's true.

408
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,740
And the idiot just didn't realize that they have double that and they haven't

409
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,060
noticed. I mean, it's amazing what people will say.

410
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,700
Now, I'm not saying the lawyer, these morons, a lawyer, meaning, you know,

411
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,900
attorneys like, for example, here, let's just get a little bit into legal

412
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:34,780
society, because people still are and rightfully so afraid of them.

413
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:40,180
And you should be to a certain degree if you encounter them, because if just

414
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:44,120
like if you're a hunter in the forest and you see a big grizzly bear, there's a

415
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,360
sense of fear because they're not there to be your friend.

416
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,980
But what the attorneys do is they don't don't know, especially bar members, they

417
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,020
know nothing about law.

418
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:58,180
I assure you that because if they did and they spoke about it, which usually they

419
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:02,540
do when they find out because they're so excited, they get disbarred across the

420
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,080
board. Now, there might be some of them that do know some law, but they don't

421
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,100
talk about it or exhibit it because, again, they will lose their position

422
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,800
because they are actually boots on the ground representation of the malevolent

423
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,340
spirits that are ruling the earth, meaning all of your religions.

424
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:24,160
Yes, all of them, some of them, all of your sciences, all of your arts, right?

425
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,760
All of your medicine is ruled by malevolent inspiration.

426
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,740
Now, in order to pull it off, they have to appear as benevolent.

427
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:40,440
Because it is quite well known that if you consider yourself human or man or

428
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,600
woman or however surface dwelling earth inhabitant, you're easily deceived and

429
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,860
easily accept the prank.

430
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,400
This has been going on.

431
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,520
It's almost it's been going on for so long that it's inherent within the

432
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,280
quality of the species at this point.

433
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,520
Now, why am I bringing this up?

434
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,220
Because if you showed up, your job is done.

435
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,780
But at the same time, you need food, clothing and shelter.

436
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,720
Now, most of the time, people engage in what's called commercial activity

437
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:08,980
commerce. I need a job or I need to buy stuff or whatever.

438
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,740
The entire world is pretty much under a credit based economy.

439
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,540
And yes, some people like to hear more.

440
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,940
Some people hear it and they don't know what's being said.

441
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:22,040
That's fine because you have the censorship against certain information is

442
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,320
very, very thick. But if you realize that there is no debt.

443
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,460
Now, if you have someone emphatically suggesting because all they could do is

444
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,000
they can't prove it. Notice I didn't say speaking, whatever they're suggesting

445
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,940
that it's all based on debt, which is a perception at this point, because no

446
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,120
material substance lawful or even unlawful has been exchanged.

447
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,620
That is the mark of a moron with a capital R and it doesn't matter who they

448
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:55,000
are. This is explicit in terms of the description of the people and what is

449
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,760
going on on this planet right now.

450
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,460
Now, of course, the concept of debt within a credit based economy can only

451
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,060
be hatched and propagated by the legal society, of course.

452
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,500
So there's many, many.

453
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,960
And by the way, when I say legal side, I mean, these are the head pranksters

454
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,020
and then it's the medical society and, of course, the academic society, because

455
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:21,540
that's where the pranks are structured, packaged and distributed from all

456
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:26,920
meaning in your within your social, tangible realm, discussing the

457
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,020
entities, let's say, behind it.

458
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,860
What inspiration means is coming from out there somewhere.

459
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,860
Right. So for many, many aspects, if you're here, you're already done.

460
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,240
You've showed up. You've done everything.

461
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,520
OK, so now in terms of the from a cosmic point of view.

462
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,160
So what do you do while you're here?

463
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,280
Because, you know, you're susceptible to being pranked pretty much every day of

464
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,440
your life. And it starts when you're an infant by the parents.

465
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,680
Now, it's very rare that parents don't prank the children.

466
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,880
You know, basically tell them something that's untrue deliberately.

467
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,860
Now, I don't mean like they don't know.

468
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,740
And because they don't know, they're just saying what they know, which is what

469
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,920
they don't know about.

470
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,100
I'm talking about deliberately pranking the children, for example, here.

471
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,120
Fortunately, it's tapered down right now a little bit, but there's a lot of talk

472
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,300
about vaccines and being mandatory.

473
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,780
And I'm like, oh, wait a second. If you read the codes and laws, you have to be

474
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,760
part of the administration or whatever.

475
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,480
You know, you don't want to talk about law in public because it really is scary.

476
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,580
What's what is memorialized and documented in terms of code, statutes and

477
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:37,640
laws that are written by men, for example, are almost not known by anyone, even

478
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,860
though anyone can access them.

479
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,260
Again, don't don't try to make sense of crazy people.

480
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,800
But for example, the vaccines came up quite a while and I'm like, oh, wait a

481
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:50,020
second. Why is vaccine vaccination in the child an issue?

482
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,200
Well, I went to the doctor and he said, I have to vaccinate the law.

483
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,520
Well, you go to a doctor.

484
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,780
What did the child fall off a roof or get hit by a car?

485
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,420
Do you have an emergency?

486
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,820
Why are you going to them?

487
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,540
Because they have not evaluated what they're doing, see, or they can't go to

488
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,760
school to get a vaccine.

489
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,700
You mean you mean you're sending the child to school?

490
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,080
The vaccines are not the problem.

491
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,760
Oh, boy, do you see the point?

492
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,800
It's so simple.

493
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,500
I mean, the idiocy is just to reach the point.

494
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,700
Well, here's the thing.

495
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,360
It's not this is not a rant, it might sound like a rant to the unaware,

496
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:33,520
obviously, but it's just a discussion or maybe I'm just talking at you because no

497
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,260
one's called in yet.

498
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,760
So here's the thing.

499
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,680
Well, there are many things, of course, but the level of pranking, the level of

500
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,920
malevancy and all these things that are packaged as being good or the way we do

501
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,940
things need to be discerned by those that are able to discern them.

502
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,260
And you can't go out and change it because it's not there for you.

503
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,140
Once you figure out it's a prank or malevolent, you get it.

504
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,780
You see, when you don't know that it's a prank and you don't know that it's

505
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:06,240
malevolent and you don't know that it's a lie, you think it's directed at you.

506
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,020
And it is.

507
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:15,640
So is there's a voluntary aspect to this somewhat, I would say, but do you really

508
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,300
have a choice?

509
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,860
You know, again, there's something called cosmic censorship that is filtering

510
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,120
pretty much everyone, but it's not difficult to look through it once you're

511
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,440
made aware of it to a certain degree.

512
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,400
Now, it's possible to ponder these things on your own.

513
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,600
But anyway, so if you're here, you've accomplished the place marker, you mean

514
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,860
the number, you know, like the World Bank, you know, is the one that keeps the

515
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,340
stats allegedly and how many people are on the planet, seven and a half billion,

516
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,340
they say, whatever, right?

517
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,980
Why is it the World Bank?

518
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,480
You know, because the credit system, everyone, you know, it's like if you go

519
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,180
and you want to figure out how many people are in a casino, well, it's the

520
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,380
cashier. And that part needs to know how many people are out there because of the

521
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:07,280
chips, you know, but well, OK, so the various aspects of it are very simple.

522
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,020
Why are you going to stress things, be worried about things?

523
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,960
For example, some recall ancient writ says, don't worry about anything, of

524
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,980
course. Think about it for a moment.

525
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:24,560
Why would you worry if you've already taken place, your highest achievement in

526
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,940
life, which is showing up on this miserable society and miserable condition right now

527
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,900
has been taken place and done the rest of just filler.

528
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,260
And it could be wonderful filler.

529
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,720
It could be just blah, blank filler like most people, or it could be real torturous,

530
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,980
arduous and tormenting filler.

531
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,240
That's what we're talking about, the events known as life.

532
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,800
So once you're aware of pretty much everything around you is set up to either

533
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,580
prank you or deceive you just to take up your time.

534
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:02,640
And if you fall for it or let's say if you're going with it, accepting it or don't

535
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,520
know, it's still OK.

536
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,960
But if you do know what's going on, it makes life a little more adventurous, doesn't

537
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,540
it? All right, think about it.

538
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,460
You ever hear someone say I'm bored?

539
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:18,400
Well, I always suggest could think about it this way.

540
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,560
Could boredom be a form of anger?

541
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,680
Can it? Well, all right, something to ponder.

542
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,660
But how can you be bored?

543
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:34,920
You know, you have a lot of choices, but you also have to determine the position that

544
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,920
you are. You know, you're in this, you know, plastic is great, by the way, you wrap

545
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,560
yourself in plastic, someone throws dog poo at you, you just peel the plastic off.

546
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,020
It's you see, insulation can be good.

547
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
Distance can be good.

548
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,740
Certain things have a range, and if you're beyond the range, you might be in the

549
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:57,520
clear. So it is quite interesting to see things from a very basic, almost like a

550
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,460
maxim. A maxim is something that is not discussed, doesn't have to be written.

551
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,860
People know it like don't harm.

552
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,660
Right. You can't be a borrower and a lender at the same time.

553
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,940
You know, all the stuff that the legal society, medical society tells you is real is

554
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,620
anti-maxim positions kind of.

555
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,300
But it doesn't make sense.

556
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,880
And there's a certain fear that underlying fear people have simply tried to define

557
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,900
fear as a weak spirit or a weak mind combined with lack of skill.

558
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,760
You know, so when you hear a lot of this again on this what's called alternative

559
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:41,120
radio, and I think it's everywhere, sort of the private discussions that have been

560
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,740
done in cafes on the streets and within bedrooms and closets and living rooms or

561
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:52,220
wherever have now reached a proportion or a level where you have what's called

562
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,520
Internet radio podcasts and the like.

563
00:32:55,820 --> 00:33:02,940
And people start voicing and littering the entire population with just more of the

564
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:08,420
same. Inaccurate, loosely fitting and less than paper thin.

565
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,140
So what is one to do?

566
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,780
Well, you have a lot of choices.

567
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:16,460
First suggestion would be don't worry if you're here.

568
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:22,500
Yeah. If you're and you're conscious to whatever degree you've accomplished most

569
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:26,320
of the purpose while you're here and the rest of it, you'll get over it, man.

570
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,200
Think about it. That's really, really simple, isn't it?

571
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,860
There are things in place that are lawful that you might find lawful in certain

572
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,280
cultures and certain societies.

573
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,680
I think every society tends to have the concept of lawfulness or whatever.

574
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,880
You have things known as inheritance to a certain degree.

575
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,080
You have things known as a family unit to a certain degree or a social unit based on

576
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,180
religion and other similarities.

577
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,520
Yeah, that's fine. You know, all these things are here in place.

578
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:03,980
So your movements on this in this world world is the way the society structure has

579
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,560
nothing to do with the Earth or the planet.

580
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:10,159
If by the way, if everyone was put on a big mothership and taken and just floating

581
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,500
out in space, that's still the world.

582
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,620
And just the planet is just barren, you see, just man's society on Earth.

583
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,480
But you have all of these things put in place for thousands of years that you can

584
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,920
choose from. Now, here's the other thing, folks.

585
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,679
I've noticed this by listening to people and watching them and also watching what

586
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,679
they watch and what they listen to.

587
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,139
And if you were to walk away with an outline of it in terms of placement in

588
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:41,400
history or time, the morons in this planet right now think that everything was

589
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,080
created about 100 to 150 years ago.

590
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:51,560
Now, obviously, if you ask them, they will know they won't say that, but their

591
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:56,160
behavior and their perception of information and agreement and acceptance of

592
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,500
information around them is definitely so.

593
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,300
And they're not asking any questions about anything or you get some ridiculous

594
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:08,100
stuff like, oh, this civilization was around 70,000 years ago, what does it

595
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:12,140
matter? Or diners around 60 million years ago, or you want to hear a real

596
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,680
ridiculous thing about time or really ridiculous.

597
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,980
They're God created everything 6,000 years ago.

598
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,620
That's the creationist crap that they want to put in school.

599
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,840
By the way, there's certain places in the world that want to start teaching

600
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,620
creation. Well, listen, if you knew enough about creation to teach it, you

601
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,640
wouldn't be here. Think about it.

602
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,900
This is idiocy.

603
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,680
And this is just to bring it up in terms of time, the evolutionists and the

604
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,040
creationists are both wrong.

605
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,960
And you don't even have to go outside to prove it.

606
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,880
Just look at what they're saying, what they're referencing.

607
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,120
So anyway, who wants to explain the insane?

608
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,340
Does it take an insane mind to explain the insane?

609
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,520
No, I wouldn't say so.

610
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,800
Right, because it doesn't.

611
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,820
There are a couple of idiots that sometimes get around, they have like a

612
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,480
certain group or following or whatever, like it takes one to know one.

613
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,220
I'm like, not really, because if you got a horse and he's sick, do you need

614
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,820
another horse to tell you what's wrong with him?

615
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,960
No, take him to a vet, someone who's competent.

616
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,460
You always have to see things from a human perspective because that's all you

617
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:20,300
got. Once you got one of those fish eyeball cameras, those are fun to look at

618
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,580
or, you know, photos kind of warp everything around.

619
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:24,600
They call it a fish eye.

620
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,060
Who knows what a fish sees?

621
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:30,860
Have you ever asked him? You can get through to him or her.

622
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,320
So the point here is that there is no point.

623
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,980
The thing is, are you taking time to not worry and to not be pranked and to not

624
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,060
fall for the deception?

625
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,040
No, probably not, because you're probably working on what's called heresy.

626
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,260
Heresy is just a Greek word that means what you like.

627
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,680
Like, for example, if you went with a bunch of friends to an ice cream shop and

628
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,920
they were to ask you, like, what flavor do you like?

629
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,780
It's like, well, what what is your heresy?

630
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:07,460
Right. Heresy means what you like, personal, personally, subjective liking.

631
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,160
So and then I've also mentioned this before.

632
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,040
And then you have this thing being brought up, a cliche.

633
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,980
Well, you know, Hades, you're going to Hades.

634
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,220
You know, people think it's hell or something like that word just means

635
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:19,620
emptiness.

636
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,500
So if the ice cream store was empty, you couldn't get your heresy because it was

637
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,020
Hades.

638
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,300
Are we communicating here?

639
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,720
Probably not. That's fine.

640
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,120
Do you see how the technological aspects of communication known as language and

641
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,220
words have been abandoned?

642
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,160
What hasn't been abandoned?

643
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,600
Now, there's going to be a discovery of things that's coming in the near future.

644
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,480
And these things are just going to be part of the setup, of course.

645
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,960
But it's going to be more interesting and more interesting.

646
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,580
And I just wanted to bring up for those that are paying attention to some degree.

647
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,780
Have you ever noticed that whether you're turning on the television, Internet,

648
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:05,560
newspaper, university, that people are getting dumber, not dumber, but are doing

649
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,340
stupid things and saying stupid things and being irrational?

650
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,080
For example, this week, I was kind of going around a little bit, these news

651
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,120
agencies and such.

652
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,720
And the stuff that they're reporting on is just really, really, really.

653
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,380
Yeah, you guessed it. It's a dummy load.

654
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,820
So I'm thinking in the future to offer a dummy load filter.

655
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,720
And it goes in between the device that you're using.

656
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,900
It's visual and audio.

657
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,800
And we tested it recently and I had someone spend about 10 hours on the Internet.

658
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:40,140
And they said, I don't think it works because every time, every time I try to hear

659
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,020
something, I didn't hear anything at all.

660
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,220
And I said, well, that's right. It works just fine.

661
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,440
It's a dummy load filter.

662
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,440
Anyway, you get it.

663
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,520
So if you want to be dummy loaded, you can.

664
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,080
Dummy load is just a technical term, meaning putting a load on something to test it

665
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,820
and see if you can handle it before you put it into its proper use.

666
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,280
So by the way, let's just see.

667
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,000
We're about 40 minutes into this sonic event.

668
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,180
And oh, good.

669
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,340
Now I know the meaning of life.

670
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,500
That's a load off my mind.

671
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,700
Yeah, I'm just reading something out of chat here.

672
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,180
OK, well, that's brilliant.

673
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,280
I don't know about that, but that's fine.

674
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,140
Is that brilliant?

675
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,340
Is it like a 20 watt light bulb in total pitch dark?

676
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,400
Because that'll be real bright.

677
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,680
Or is it a thousand watt light bulb during the day?

678
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,220
So anyway, there's many things to consider.

679
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,000
So but the thing to consider is this.

680
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,300
There are disciplines out there, by the way, folks.

681
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,440
There's a lot of discipline that's been put.

682
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,100
Like one discipline is martial arts.

683
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,060
And, you know, unfortunately, when you say that, it goes.

684
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,300
People are like, oh, Bruce Lee, you know, the Asian karate, Aikido.

685
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,660
Well, every society, every culture had that form of discipline.

686
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,160
It's just that you don't know about it.

687
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,940
You know, have you ever heard of Pankration?

688
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,940
That would have been known in the ancient world by the Greeks.

689
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,860
Yeah. Capoeira in Brazil today.

690
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,820
You have very various disciplines and they're not just for fighting folks.

691
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,020
It's how to move the body in within the medium

692
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:15,140
known as the air and solid material and maybe greeting space

693
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,120
heaters with it sometimes.

694
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:20,580
So these disciplines that have been put out discern those as well.

695
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,580
There are disciplines that help one move the body with

696
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,360
economy of movement, let's just say.

697
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,600
So you're more efficient.

698
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,220
I would suggest learning some disciplines, whether they are,

699
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,440
you know, this is the physical side, of course.

700
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:40,820
But when you get into what's called martial arts of various disciplines,

701
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,220
even a sport would be a discipline.

702
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,520
You notice that it also is not purely physical,

703
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,380
that it has to do with the mind or the spirit.

704
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,520
It's not a discipline, like, for example, even, let's say,

705
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,760
bodybuilding or powerlifting, where you have a limited movement.

706
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,040
But even there, there's technique.

707
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:59,760
So the aspect of gaining a discipline

708
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,200
while you're here makes life a lot easier.

709
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,900
It can and it should, especially even if you're not doing it properly.

710
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,780
You're aware that there is more of a proper way to do things.

711
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,760
Or let's say if you're not good at it, you're aware that something takes skill.

712
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,640
That's the other thing.

713
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:18,400
If people tend to shy away with things that they find that they do not have

714
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,120
a natural talent to gravitate towards or excel in,

715
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:26,260
the most common one that you hear spiritually or mentally is I'm not good at math.

716
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,460
Now, maybe we should do some quick math primers one day.

717
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,780
But what will happen is even if you encounter a particular discipline

718
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:38,560
that you may not have, quote unquote, personal interest or find that you're good at

719
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,000
or whatever, whatever, whatever, at least you realize

720
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,500
that there is a higher form to it that you may not want to partake or just can't do.

721
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,080
So it gives you a little bit more of an appreciation of what you can do.

722
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,840
So when you are accepting a discipline and you're doing well with it,

723
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,500
well, then you might say, hey, this is this is a sign that I am getting

724
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,420
a little bit closer to finding, let's say, what's called a natural calling.

725
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:08,040
Yeah. So having appreciation for what you don't find a liking to or not good at

726
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,180
will lead you to more appreciate what you are good at.

727
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,340
You know. Now, by the way, whenever a suggestion is given to anyone,

728
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:19,700
and I just want to say this because the old people are just you suck.

729
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,080
Sorry about that. You do.

730
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,160
I feel bad for the younger people.

731
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:28,140
But whenever you're giving suggestions, you have to consider,

732
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,060
you know, who you're speaking to and where you are and is it appropriate.

733
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:34,320
Now, I wouldn't say this is really appropriate.

734
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:38,040
It's a public venue. It's a minor Internet platform.

735
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,220
It's an uncommon radio. I mean, what does that have to do?

736
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,740
You know, it doesn't mean much, does it?

737
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,940
But at least it's being said.

738
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,140
I know you're not getting much anywhere else and I don't even have to look anymore.

739
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,920
I stopped looking. You know, I mean, like if you spend a couple,

740
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,720
you know, a couple of years or so with horses and you haven't seen a horse in 20

741
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,200
years, you don't have to know that it's still going to want to eat.

742
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,940
Pee and poop while it's standing up and what it looks like and what it does.

743
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,320
Horses haven't changed much. People haven't changed much.

744
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,500
Your information streams haven't changed much.

745
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,180
Your academic streams haven't changed much.

746
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,180
Your religious streams haven't changed much.

747
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,420
Your legal streams haven't changed much.

748
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,340
Governmental streams get it.

749
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,880
Medical streams. It's all the same.

750
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,600
You don't have to stay.

751
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,200
You don't have to stay and listen and see what's going on today or what medical

752
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,920
development or what the government's going to do or what the legal society

753
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,440
is going to do or the scientific society, religious society.

754
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,400
It's all the same, slightly rehashed.

755
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,480
So, yeah, there's been no surprises there.

756
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,560
Yeah, you might get a little surprise, something out of place.

757
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,900
You know, things do happen.

758
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,900
You know, things do shock people or whatever.

759
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,020
And by the way, speaking of shocking people, it's still around springtime on the,

760
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,580
let's say, the latitude that's considered the central part of the earth.

761
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,220
You know, of course, the friends down below, down under and other places like that,

762
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,620
they're experiencing colder weather.

763
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,360
Well, it's too bad.

764
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,620
So, but you're up here where it's still springtime.

765
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,320
What's spring about?

766
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:08,660
Mostly quiet.

767
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:09,940
Planting.

768
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,020
There's a little bit of noise when they're planting.

769
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:16,640
You don't see a lot of growth yet, but things are planted to grow in summer and

770
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,680
harvested in the fall.

771
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,220
By the way, I just want to throw this in there.

772
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:25,400
If you guys know anything about the corporate culture, if you know anyone, you

773
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,480
know, that might be in the corporate culture, even you could do research on your

774
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:29,660
own.

775
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:34,500
Isn't it interesting that typically, not always, but most typically CEOs of

776
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:40,960
corporations or let's say let go or their contracts terminate around the fall and

777
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,260
they're typically hired around the springtime.

778
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:44,600
Yeah.

779
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:45,480
Think about that.

780
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,000
You'll start noticing things like that.

781
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,320
Especially things that matter.

782
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:50,960
Why?

783
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,600
Because things that are planted in the spring tend to matter more because

784
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,480
agriculture works that way and you're agriculturally based.

785
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,880
Like for example, if you think about water, you know, it's when you're thirsty

786
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,260
or you want to wash, hopefully you do, and other things like that.

787
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,800
But when you're a fish, water has a different meaning to you, doesn't it?

788
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,320
Because it's the ambient environment you partake in.

789
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,300
And by the way, I just want to throw this out there because I've been known a

790
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,260
little bit to know a little bit about water.

791
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,000
And you know, fish drink water also.

792
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,440
Yeah, Greek, you're funny.

793
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,160
Yeah, fish drink water.

794
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:24,680
Ha ha ha.

795
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,460
Yeah, they do.

796
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,560
Just because they're in the water doesn't mean they're drinking water.

797
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:34,480
I mean, having it pass through their body for nourishment, you know, to reproduce

798
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,200
the water inside the body because when you drink water, it doesn't get absorbed.

799
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:42,720
But anyway, there was something, if you look at some previous sonic events, I

800
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,060
did one called The Container.

801
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,180
I think it was the second one.

802
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,560
I might get into that again in a future project that is being put together.

803
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,380
But yeah, fish drink water.

804
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:56,040
So when poison, when let's say a lake is poisoned or a river is poisoned or an

805
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,900
aquarium, you'll notice that not all the fish die right away.

806
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,720
Well, it's the ones that were thirsty that died first.

807
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:08,540
You know, ones that are just swimming around, not in taking it through certain

808
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,260
parts of the body, tend to last a little longer.

809
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,640
Yeah, because fish get thirsty too.

810
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,600
So yeah, what a concept.

811
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:24,470
So I just wanted to, there's not much to hint anymore other than suggesting when

812
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:27,250
the time is right, there is a new project that has been going on.

813
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:29,170
It will be in the form of a podcast.

814
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:33,970
You will not have the allure and the mysticism and the excitement of live

815
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:37,190
radio as you do right now, even though there's only five people listening.

816
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:39,850
It will be informational.

817
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:42,990
It will be very much more in depth.

818
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:48,210
It will be solo most likely if there's anyone that would like to pair and do a

819
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:51,370
sonic event with the Greek in the future, let me know.

820
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:53,950
We can arrange that.

821
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:59,510
And there will be things spoken of more in depth and you'll have to access it

822
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:01,390
somehow and it might be expensive.

823
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:08,790
So just letting you know up ahead, it's not going to be cheap.

824
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:11,310
It's not just to filter out the riffraff.

825
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:13,250
It's just because it's worth a lot.

826
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:18,090
And for quote unquote, for every credit you give, you'll get ten times back

827
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:22,870
worth in information and at least in whatever you consider to be valuable.

828
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:28,110
Hopefully you will find it as valuable as it is and to come with an objective mind.

829
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:32,230
So there's not much to hint at that's been hinted at before and until it's

830
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:38,290
finally ready, the only thing I would suggest is stay abreast on the Uncommon

831
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:40,230
Radio site for the Greek.

832
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:47,750
It's www.uncommonradio.com and that will let you know where more stuff is coming

833
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:52,330
around because there is a lot to discuss and there is a lot to think about and

834
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:55,110
there's a lot to think about and discuss that will actually help you.

835
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:59,270
Yes, concepts about water, not only concepts, but what is water?

836
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:00,550
How does it work?

837
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:05,090
Well, you know, people don't know what water is when they're putting it in flat

838
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:10,750
bottom containers and in the light and at room temperature, obviously, you don't

839
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:18,850
have to ask usually, well, sometimes you do, but usually, especially through

840
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:23,590
industry or commerce or in the crowd, what they know.

841
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:27,230
They typically exhibit it through their behavior and their wares.

842
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:35,990
So if you are in a society and you see, for example, water or fluids that are to

843
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:41,850
be taken by the body or considered important fluids in flat bottom

844
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:46,230
containers that are exposed to the light at room temperature, typically, that

845
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:50,930
society does not understand the purpose of fluids in biology.

846
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:52,710
That's quite simple.

847
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:58,170
Now you can go to a university idiot, meaning the professors and morons there

848
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:02,610
and the scientists and all that, and they will show you reams and volumes of just

849
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:05,350
rubbish to talk about things that have nothing to do.

850
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:09,630
With reality, and they still can't explain it, obviously.

851
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:11,070
Right.

852
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:13,710
So you just look around, things like that.

853
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:18,510
You talk to someone in the medical society, you know, they don't know what

854
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:18,870
they're doing.

855
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:23,210
If you spend, let's say you want a particular thing done, a process, a

856
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,750
procedure with someone in the medical society, go research right now.

857
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:32,710
What's great about the internet is you might get a little bit of access to what

858
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:35,890
they did when in their, let's say, consider part of their training.

859
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:40,930
And you look at the proper way to do that procedure and then approach this

860
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:44,050
medical moron about the procedure.

861
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:47,430
And he'll say, well, I know about which, yeah, that's interesting that you know

862
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:47,930
about that.

863
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:51,010
I haven't really, I haven't heard about that since I was in college.

864
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:52,270
No, wait a second.

865
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:55,510
How many of these procedures have you done in the last 20 years?

866
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:58,770
And you're not sure about what's going on here.

867
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:02,150
It goes on and on and on in every field.

868
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:06,950
Now, by the way, in private more than public, I'll be crashing the religious

869
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:08,070
societies also.

870
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:12,970
They, they're the worst, um, see, because the, well, the legal society ties

871
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:16,910
into it also, cause they're representing a God known as justice, but the medical

872
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:21,030
society, uh, and all these other societies or whatever, they're, they're

873
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:23,770
not claiming to represent any of the gods.

874
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:26,050
And they're, they've really screwed up big time.

875
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:31,370
The religious societies, because they stepped in, um, a really, really, really

876
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:33,070
high level of responsibility.

877
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:37,170
Not, not the way people think about it, because the common idiot on this planet,

878
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:41,930
you know, that when they say religion, um, it's just a box that they check on a

879
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:45,050
form, like, you know, a form of you, male, female, you know, how to, what color

880
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:47,190
your eyes, what religion is check a box.

881
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:47,370
Yeah.

882
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:49,810
I'm this, you know, and forget about what they profess.

883
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:50,890
You just watch what they do.

884
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:56,590
But, uh, crashing the religious societies, um, is going to be a lot of fun.

885
00:50:56,590 --> 00:51:02,170
Um, informationally, informationally and the contrast I've done this before

886
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:08,210
in previous sonic events, if anyone wants to consider, for example, um, uh,

887
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:14,090
any of any religion at all, uh, you're, you will find that, uh, typically they

888
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:18,010
have a text that they subscribe to or alleged to subscribe to that is the

889
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:23,030
basis that they're in that holy writ that they have there in contains and

890
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:27,610
memorializes the purpose of their quote unquote faith, right?

891
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:29,430
This is what they say with their mouth.

892
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:30,510
Okay.

893
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:31,910
And that's all.

894
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:35,070
And, and you go look into it a little bit, right?

895
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:36,330
Just a little, not much.

896
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:40,150
And you will see that they know nothing or do anything that is in there

897
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:41,250
that is on the positive side.

898
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:45,090
Actually, very often I've said, I'm not really, this is not a correction, but

899
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:48,310
there's not a religion on the planet that does or knows anything in the text

900
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:49,650
that they allegedly subscribe to.

901
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:51,550
That is not exactly wholly true.

902
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:54,670
And I mean that from an optimistic perspective, because what they are

903
00:51:54,670 --> 00:52:01,870
actually doing is in the don't do or the abominations, the things that the

904
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:05,570
gods find repugnant is what these religions are doing according to their,

905
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:10,510
each to each one of their, uh, let's say relative, uh, text.

906
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:15,530
So, so those are going to be very, very simple to, to go through.

907
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,370
But the thing is, um, why do that?

908
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:21,890
Because it's going to give people a good preface on what's coming in the future.

909
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:27,970
Um, and I think I've mentioned this before that, uh, the gods are surely

910
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:32,290
going to tear down and piss on everything that you consider sacred or believe in

911
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:36,190
or think about it, because what the majority of the people have as their

912
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:39,010
faith, quote unquote, and they actually kill other people for it.

913
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:41,890
This is, you can get into that, why, how that's been done.

914
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:45,630
Um, yeah, they will kill other people.

915
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:49,270
As you see, it doesn't matter that, you know, it's a cross versus cross, uh,

916
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:51,590
Muslim versus Muslim, Buddhist versus Buddhist.

917
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:53,770
They do it because that's just the way people are there.

918
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:55,750
They have legitimized savagery.

919
00:52:56,130 --> 00:53:01,010
But when you go through the aspects of, uh, what is going on from a religious

920
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:07,310
perspective, there's only one way, only one description, uh, to give on why this

921
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:12,310
is happening, the way it's happening is because again, the world is under a, uh,

922
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:13,990
very heavily malevolent control.

923
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:19,570
And in order to be successful as a malevolent, you must present yourself as

924
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:24,730
being benevolent every time you get away from the Hollywood mentality, get away

925
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:28,570
from all this stuff that you've been told because really bad people don't

926
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:30,030
look like really bad people.

927
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:33,570
I mean, you know, I mean, if they do, they don't last very long.

928
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:34,530
Right.

929
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:40,210
So, and when I am saying that on a very base level, um, uh, you know, can you

930
00:53:40,210 --> 00:53:41,330
say that people are bad?

931
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:42,850
No, but can you say that they're good?

932
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:43,830
Definitely not.

933
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:45,010
You see?

934
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:49,890
So again, this, this is not clear cut, but we have just a few more minutes

935
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:51,070
before the end of this first hour.

936
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,310
Uh, I appreciate anyone who's listening.

937
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:57,490
Uh, let's see in the chat, we have just a handful and maybe we'll have

938
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:58,890
another handful for the second hour.

939
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:00,710
We will see you after the break folks.

940
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:07,830
So, uh, I just want to, uh, just the first hour is got a comment.

941
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:11,530
Oh, you're a little scattered or whatever, but you know, welcome to the world.

942
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:14,350
Uh, how can you say everything at the same time?

943
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:20,470
But, uh, you know, one thing that I do mention, uh, coming on is Colin Skype

944
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:23,450
in right in, uh, try to look at the chat.

945
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:27,870
Um, but I just want to, uh, also give a little bit more of a hint of what

946
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:31,910
will be discussed in the future because the mindset of the people that are

947
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:37,810
communicating, uh, through emails and other messaging, uh, has been all very

948
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:42,790
much in common now, now I just wanted to, they very uncommon, but the theme

949
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:48,090
seems to be the same and I'm going to read this, um, Email, uh, anonymously.

950
00:54:48,130 --> 00:54:54,190
And, and it, it, it's going to reflect, I'd say 90%, if not a hundred percent

951
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,170
of the emails, uh, that are gotten.

952
00:54:56,310 --> 00:55:00,210
And this is going to be the direction, which I believe, uh, uh, it will be.

953
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:06,290
Future presentations should go into, because again, when I think Sarah Vaughn

954
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:08,810
was asked, uh, what makes a great jazz musician?

955
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:12,250
She said, it's the audience now not looking to be great or anything, but

956
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:13,810
you must accommodate the listener.

957
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:18,430
It, you know, you must accommodate who you are serving to some extent.

958
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:19,910
So here's the email.

959
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:24,170
Um, this was sent, uh, roughly four or five days ago.

960
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:27,190
Uh, so it starts like this.

961
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:30,870
Uh, what have Leviticus nine 1926 Greek, and that's an old caps.

962
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:34,310
Uh, does it make steakhouses and local weather news off limits?

963
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:36,710
What's the actual translation there.

964
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:41,310
Also, can you speak about the ethnicities in relation to sons of the Elohim,

965
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:42,970
daughters of Adam and the Nephilim?

966
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:44,510
Is there a relationship?

967
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:48,070
Why is there so much black hair on the planet?

968
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:50,410
Who was Quasi Quattro really?

969
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:52,910
Why are Mormons obsessed with ancestry?

970
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:55,830
You said the leaders were changed at a certain time.

971
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:58,690
What will they change into from your description?

972
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:02,390
One of the kill shots sounds like a pyramid, which fits

973
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:03,390
scripture as a mountain.

974
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:05,430
But what about the millstone?

975
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:10,150
If I comprehend you correctly, when ingesting the body is actually

976
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:12,950
being told to create whatever is in the food, drug, et cetera.

977
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:16,650
And in all caps, that is paradigm shifting, exclamation, exclamation,

978
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:17,310
exclamation.

979
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:20,070
Could the body be tricked into making things?

980
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:25,210
Sorry about the 20 questions, but asking you shall receive my reply

981
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:29,830
simply to that was received some, but most people just need a little

982
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:31,090
direction, essentially.

983
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:38,670
So that's basically the a good representative sample of what has

984
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:43,310
been, let's say, invoked or jostled in the minds of people.

985
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:48,010
And you notice there's a there's an underlying thing theme there.

986
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:52,470
It's sort of, quote, unquote, religious, and of a certain rate.

987
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:58,910
It's sort of social in a way, and it's also has to do with the physical body.

988
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,070
These things are all very real, by the way.

989
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:05,610
And the reason why I read it, because it was written in a certain with

990
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:07,490
certain sense of enthusiasm and excitement.

991
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:14,310
And some do get that when they hear things that they haven't heard before,

992
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,890
but not just like that, because look, you can hear bullshit you've never

993
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:18,010
heard before all the time.

994
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:20,590
This is a different way.

995
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:24,810
Now, one of the comments here within, you know, is that is paradigm

996
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:25,310
shifting?

997
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,430
Well, is it really?

998
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:31,230
Or does it actually completely negate the paradigm that has been put in

999
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:32,050
everyone's mind?

1000
00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:37,270
And it's not just for the series of negating or just being contra or against

1001
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:38,750
because that's actually satanic.

1002
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:42,130
The term satanic means to be adversarial.

1003
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:44,410
Key here is not to be adversarial.

1004
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:48,830
The key here is just to get some keys because it seems like there are doors

1005
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:53,490
everywhere that people are sleeping at, if you get what I mean.

1006
00:57:54,130 --> 00:58:00,630
So the the paradigm here again, just to bring this up again, the paradigm

1007
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:02,550
shifting is not going to shift.

1008
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:06,210
The paradigm is winding down and going away, but no one's going to notice.

1009
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:11,870
Now, what I mean by that is let's just look at secular history for a moment.

1010
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:15,770
20th century, perhaps anyone remember that?

1011
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:18,750
You know, it's around the time everything that you think about was created.

1012
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:24,690
You know, typically, if you look at some of the events all the way up to 9-11,

1013
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:29,070
for example, and the absurdities before that, you know, you had a president, a

1014
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:32,370
major event, American president was assassinated.

1015
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:38,450
9-11 would be the two main things you had, what's dubbed as World War Two, which

1016
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:39,730
is not what you think it is.

1017
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:46,010
For example, this aspect of being in industrial society, then leading to

1018
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:47,590
information based and all that.

1019
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:48,650
Uh-huh.

1020
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:52,290
So there's a mindset that's been put behind there that hasn't really

1021
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:53,630
been followed through, has it?

1022
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:59,010
You know, what paradigms have been set other than some of these

1023
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:03,430
shocking, let's say, historical milestones, which, by the way, regarding

1024
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:08,270
the assassination of a president and what supposedly happened on 7-11, as

1025
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:12,250
someone once said, which is because septem means seven, and I just want to

1026
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:16,590
give a shout out to, I think it's Master Lewis out there for that.

1027
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:18,190
It's very rare.

1028
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:18,690
Yes.

1029
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:23,590
It's very rare that you engage human, surface-dwelling earth inhabitants in

1030
00:59:23,590 --> 00:59:29,190
conversation and find one, just one, that is aware of something, just one thing.

1031
00:59:29,530 --> 00:59:30,070
It's very rare.

1032
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:34,370
They all tend to go with the flow, but I was in a conversation once and he says,

1033
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:35,690
well, 9-11 is really 7-11.

1034
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:36,570
I said, really?

1035
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:37,390
Why do you say that?

1036
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:39,350
Because September is the seventh month.

1037
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:39,910
It means that.

1038
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:43,070
I said, wow, that is really cool.

1039
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:50,670
So, but even if you go from an event like that, the major assassinations

1040
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:54,890
and the explanations or descriptions that were given are completely absurd.

1041
00:59:55,430 --> 01:00:03,010
If you look at the fashion trends and what you might call industrial trends,

1042
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:08,070
technological trends, absurdities, again, you know, what they're doing

1043
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:09,750
is repackaging, rehashing.

1044
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:14,290
By the way, when it comes to anything geopolitical, you have to lie to the

1045
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:18,590
people, I'm sorry, you know, meaning from their perspective, the mainstream

1046
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:23,110
quote-unquote establishment, regardless if it's a religious, scientific,

1047
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:28,590
medical, political, governmental, whatever, you cannot tell people the truth.

1048
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:29,090
Why?

1049
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:30,390
Think about it.

1050
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,560
Well, of course you got to keep the masses asleep.

1051
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,620
Well, you don't have to keep them asleep because they'll do that fine on their own.

1052
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:42,300
First hour discussed that your job is pretty much done just by showing up.

1053
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,620
When you show up, you've done 90%.

1054
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:46,980
The last thing you want to do is disturb the people.

1055
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:50,740
But the thing that is disturbing about how some of these major events are

1056
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:55,000
explained, which is minimal, they like it showing a lot of descriptions,

1057
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,240
but no explanations.

1058
01:00:56,860 --> 01:01:00,380
What's really disturbing is they seem to counteract all the other aspects of

1059
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:04,820
their sciences and medicine when they explain them, which is proof positive

1060
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,740
that this is a society of morons.

1061
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:10,600
But when you spell moron, you got to put, you got to capitalize the R somehow,

1062
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:11,240
figure it out.

1063
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:13,060
It could, anyway, you get the point.

1064
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:20,160
Now, how else can anyone explain simply what you're doing here?

1065
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:23,820
I'm talking about simply, can you prove otherwise?

1066
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,360
No, very difficult to.

1067
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:31,580
Now, the paradigms that you see that were established now, you're pretty much, you

1068
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:36,960
consider roughly the computer monitor shows here roughly 17 years past the year

1069
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:37,900
2000 or so.

1070
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,420
I'd say you're about 20% civil, 17% into the next century.

1071
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:47,120
And you're still just dragging along and rehashing all the same old crap over and

1072
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:47,800
over and over.

1073
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:48,700
Yeah, of course.

1074
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,340
You got a bunch of people making noise.

1075
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:50,840
Oh yeah.

1076
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:51,740
Mainstream's bad.

1077
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:55,320
They got fake news or the doctors don't know what they're doing when they say,

1078
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,920
yeah, really, really?

1079
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:01,280
That's just a little bit of a complaint, but not much is changing and it won't.

1080
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,340
Here's an example.

1081
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:07,780
I was in a conversation recently with someone who works in industry and they think

1082
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:08,460
they're cutting edge.

1083
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:10,740
And I said, what you have now is what you're going to get.

1084
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:16,100
You're not going to get any jet packs or a hotel on the moon or any miraculous stuff.

1085
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:18,580
This is what you need to do.

1086
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:23,440
Yes, you need to do is figure out what is available and make it hyper efficient, not

1087
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,160
just efficient or super efficient, but hyper efficient and function.

1088
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:28,380
So you have less waste.

1089
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:34,040
And by the way, have you ever heard of, for example, when a new product or

1090
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,700
technologies put out, they call it a miracle of science.

1091
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,020
They call it, Oh, this is miraculous.

1092
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,200
This is a fantastic, um, whatever.

1093
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:42,960
Right?

1094
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,500
Well, you know what?

1095
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:46,060
There's a lot of truth in that.

1096
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:47,520
Why do you say that?

1097
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:53,260
Well, have you ever met anyone that works or more than one person that works or

1098
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:57,080
manages what's called a government research lab or a corporate research lab?

1099
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,740
Now, do you want to tie that back with it?

1100
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:03,060
If you've got more than an eighth grade education, you've got irreparable damage.

1101
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:04,140
Uh-huh.

1102
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,700
And he actually, someone with a PhD will agree to that.

1103
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:11,060
And they've got double because these are all of these labs and developmental,

1104
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:15,860
whether it's medical, even the social engineering aspect of it, scientific,

1105
01:03:16,180 --> 01:03:19,400
technical, or whatever, even religious, because they were hatching new ways to,

1106
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,980
to reform your, the religions that everyone buys into.

1107
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,760
These people are morons.

1108
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:30,920
And speaking from firsthand experience, meeting people that work within these

1109
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:35,260
institutions and the cutting edge, just like, for example, if you've ever heard

1110
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:41,040
anyone ask about CERN, I remember being aware of CERN before they started building

1111
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:43,640
that, I said, there's no way these idiots are going to build this.

1112
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:47,440
This is just like, you know, the, you know, the elevator is space or whatever

1113
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,140
that they're not going to build because it just doesn't work.

1114
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:52,600
Now what's interesting is when I saw when they built it, I was like, Oh,

1115
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:54,520
that's, that's completely out of control.

1116
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:57,420
Because that's just like pimp my ride.

1117
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:59,840
That's like taking a $200 car.

1118
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,440
That's ready for the junkyard and putting in a hundred grand to make it whatever

1119
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:07,740
that is just, and also is to show you that we have access to the credit

1120
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:11,660
system and you don't mother efforts, right?

1121
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:17,880
Basically they're like CERN is like about as ghetto ghetto can get on a planetary

1122
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:23,720
level when I mean ghetto, I mean, in the colloquial term, just like, you know,

1123
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,460
another colloquial term that is like redneck, you know, they got all these

1124
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:31,660
pejorative terms of something that just is out of place or overdone.

1125
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:36,120
CERN is just pimp my ride, ghetto in your face, sucka.

1126
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,420
We could do whatever we want.

1127
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:38,680
Yeah.

1128
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:39,240
It's junk.

1129
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:40,440
Now here's the interesting part.

1130
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,240
I've always been telling people that's total rubbish.

1131
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:47,760
And, and of course that's a really good filter, uh, to look at the who is

1132
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,100
and how CERN is being commented on.

1133
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:54,080
And, and by the way, I could back up every aspect of what I'm saying, but I'm not

1134
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,980
going to do it cause it's not even worth it.

1135
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:00,920
Um, but there actually have been people that have been have firsthand experience

1136
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:03,800
since her and I don't that have come out and said, this is all fraud.

1137
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:08,040
And obviously, you know, I've just told, I just pretty much gave you a very, very

1138
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:11,760
deep rooted, truthful explanation of what's going on there, right?

1139
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,280
This is what you're going to be subjected to until you're not.

1140
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:22,760
So there's a very interesting way to filter out what is going on in people's

1141
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:26,840
minds by looking at how they comment and what they're commenting on and how they're

1142
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,680
calm and how significant it is to them.

1143
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,880
So for example, if you are in a discussion when they bring up CERN and

1144
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,080
they, so the, the, the more, it's amazing how creative these people get.

1145
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,660
I mean, these people meeting on this planet.

1146
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,440
Oh, they say they're trying to open a portal.

1147
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:40,680
Oh, they're trying to do this.

1148
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:43,020
None of it's just a piece of junk.

1149
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:48,200
It's not going to do anything other than, you know, whatever you want it to do.

1150
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,000
I guess.

1151
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,740
And you could look at how seriously people take this.

1152
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:56,680
I mean, there's people that do, you know, host a guest and I mean, the

1153
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,820
absurdity is just beyond whatever.

1154
01:05:59,560 --> 01:05:59,740
Right.

1155
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:02,200
So this is what you have access to, by the way.

1156
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:06,400
You know, when you, when you go on the internet and, or in print or whatever,

1157
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:13,620
start discerning what, not who and how it's being spoken of, but what

1158
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:17,940
really is being spoken of the, do you folks remember all the asteroids and

1159
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:21,960
the, and the government crackdowns and social chaos that was supposed to

1160
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,520
ensue from 2012 on or before, you know, what happened to that?

1161
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:26,360
Yeah.

1162
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:26,920
Yeah.

1163
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:27,240
Yeah.

1164
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,320
You guessed it right.

1165
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,240
Because it's very, very simple folks.

1166
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,120
It's very, very simple.

1167
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:37,560
Um, when you look at anything, it tends, that's circular or cyclical.

1168
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,840
It tends to end up terminating where it began.

1169
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:41,960
Yeah.

1170
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:45,000
And if you've heard any Greek speak before, you know what I'm going to say,

1171
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:46,420
but I'm not going to say it this time.

1172
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,120
So it's very, very simple.

1173
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,300
It's about being efficient.

1174
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:54,920
And, and again, I read the email to bring up the mindset.

1175
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:57,220
Um, these people are listening.

1176
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,560
Uh, there are, um, there, there are pursuits that people are beginning to

1177
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:04,720
discover that, excuse me, that are worth taking that are uncommon.

1178
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,340
Well, hence, hence forth.

1179
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,320
That's what it's called uncommon radio.

1180
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:14,920
In a sense, um, uncommon, but edifying and satisfying, um, who doesn't want

1181
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,400
to know how the body really works.

1182
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:19,620
And, and just to go back to the email, this, cause this was an interesting

1183
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:24,740
perspective, you know, uh, that means that the body can, can be made to create things.

1184
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:25,600
Yes.

1185
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:27,260
That that's exactly correct.

1186
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:29,000
And that's exactly what's going on.

1187
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:35,680
And you don't realize it because you have, um, covered that ability to perceive that

1188
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:39,840
or, or, and actually, well, how are you going to perceive it if you've never been

1189
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:44,380
told, but nonetheless, you, you, you're not aware of it cause you, you, you just

1190
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:48,260
blanket it over with the stuff that you are a filter bag and you absorb things

1191
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:48,840
and whatever.

1192
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,860
So how are you going to, well, what does that mean?

1193
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:55,980
You have to take time and actually observe what's happening now in science.

1194
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:57,680
Um, they're supposed to do that.

1195
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:00,880
They're supposed to have a theory and a hypothesis and experiment and conclusion,

1196
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,640
but they only talk about theory because it's a prank.

1197
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,280
Remember the eighth grade?

1198
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:11,600
Well, anyway, you get the point, you know, uh, if you, so, so the point, the point

1199
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:15,939
is, how do you start perceiving what is happening around you objectively?

1200
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,880
How can you really see what's going on?

1201
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,840
I mean, back to the body.

1202
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,060
I started off with this tonight.

1203
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,840
Uh, when you, the skin being a soft membrane, when it's soaked in water, we

1204
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,439
tend to notice that it shrivels up.

1205
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:30,640
Well, that means that there is a slight vacuum on the backside of it or on the

1206
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,080
inside.

1207
01:08:31,939 --> 01:08:36,100
How come, um, everyone, I say everyone, well, actually I don't know anyone called

1208
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:38,540
everyone, never met anyone called everyone.

1209
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:39,640
So let's not use that.

1210
01:08:39,819 --> 01:08:41,899
Statistically, most people will ignore that.

1211
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:43,060
Why is that?

1212
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:48,740
Why is, why is it that everyone, again, why is it that the majority of the people

1213
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:53,700
on the planet are ignoring, uh, what they can perceive objectively?

1214
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:55,279
Think about it.

1215
01:08:55,760 --> 01:09:00,660
So if, if the society at large and the majority of the people are ignoring, uh,

1216
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:04,279
their own perceptions, you know, and this is not just being deceived by your

1217
01:09:04,279 --> 01:09:08,939
perception, like a lady being sawed in half on, on stage and put back together.

1218
01:09:08,939 --> 01:09:10,420
And you swear that you saw that.

1219
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,600
No, it's not talking about that.

1220
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:15,960
Start with the body itself, right?

1221
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,140
What's the purpose of sleep?

1222
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:19,020
What's the purpose of all these other things?

1223
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,540
What do you notice is going on?

1224
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:24,420
How come there is no rational discussion or objective

1225
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:25,840
discussion about that at all?

1226
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:26,800
Right.

1227
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:31,399
You've given up your ability to rationalize that and utilize any.

1228
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:33,580
Power through knowledge of that.

1229
01:09:33,979 --> 01:09:36,100
You've given it all up to the entitled classes.

1230
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:40,080
Now, if that is not laziness, I don't know what can be considered laziness.

1231
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:44,540
The same with law, the same with your spirituality, meaning your mentality.

1232
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:51,120
Um, by the way, I was looking at something, um, and what category, a category,

1233
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:53,320
let's say, and it was religion and spirituality.

1234
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,460
That was actually the proper way to say that it was religion and mentality

1235
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:59,000
because spirituality is mentality.

1236
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,860
You know, spirit psyche means the mind get it.

1237
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,200
That's why psychiatrists have to do with the mind.

1238
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:06,540
Psychologists do with the mind.

1239
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:08,620
PSY prefix, right.

1240
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,220
That has to, well, anyway, you get the point.

1241
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:15,700
Um, so what is going on here?

1242
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,600
Uh, what is going on on the surface of the planet?

1243
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,880
Well, the same thing that's been going on for a very long time, very long time.

1244
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:21,900
And that is going to change.

1245
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:25,900
It is only going to change because objectivity and acknowledgement of certain

1246
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:27,620
things is going to be required in the future.

1247
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:34,480
Now, when I say the future, it is not a future that will be continuing as, as you

1248
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:38,720
folks are right now, because if, if it was uninterrupted, there would be no,

1249
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,680
nothing left in less than 50 years.

1250
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:42,240
That's a fact.

1251
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:45,040
Now, how, how was it a fact?

1252
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:47,520
Well, let's just say, let's discuss it after that point.

1253
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,400
Now, why?

1254
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:53,060
Because it has a lot to do with what's called religion.

1255
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:54,040
What is religion?

1256
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:55,580
Something you do regularly.

1257
01:10:56,140 --> 01:11:00,440
So if one says, you know, this is about religion, it means something you do

1258
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:01,660
regularly, you get it.

1259
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:06,700
So this, this thing that people have just marked on a government form or whatever,

1260
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:11,040
oh, I'm this, I'm Christian or Muslim or Jewish, or I'm Mormon, or I'm this,

1261
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:15,300
I'm a Buddhist or whatever, that's just a little, they've trivialized that to a

1262
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:18,880
category, just check the box, you know, get to the religion, check this one,

1263
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,340
check this one, check and go back to just existing, right?

1264
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:24,660
They don't know what they're doing or what they're saying.

1265
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,760
So there's the importance of quote unquote, religion is that it gives you

1266
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,620
the laws of which you live by.

1267
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:32,300
It's a system.

1268
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:39,740
It really literally is a systematic process, you know, where you don't have to

1269
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:40,480
make things up.

1270
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:43,260
And also you have the support of others that have a similar religion.

1271
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:47,360
And by the way, what I'm discussing is an objectification of what it means and not

1272
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,620
what's in the world right now.

1273
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:54,260
Because what's in the world right now, it's seemingly a society at large has

1274
01:11:54,260 --> 01:12:00,880
acknowledged unspokenly that the purpose of being here is just being here.

1275
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:06,340
And it should be obvious if you're looking into depth or looking into mastery of

1276
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:06,640
things.

1277
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:14,300
So back to the religion aspect, there's a, when you do things regularly, like in

1278
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:20,080
certain shokun in Japan, their objective is to do the same thing every day and

1279
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:23,380
become a master at it by doing the same thing every day and seeking high quality.

1280
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:28,820
There is a level of repetition, there's a level of adherence to things that work,

1281
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:32,160
things that have been, if they're important, they've been memorialized

1282
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:35,260
because the lifespan is too short, you know, many generations will come through.

1283
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:37,540
And that is the nature of what's called religion.

1284
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:42,420
Now, earlier, I mentioned why people kill each other over that for a certain

1285
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:45,980
degree, it is not the degree at which it is being used.

1286
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:52,000
The quote unquote religion, when people fight over religion, it is just again,

1287
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:57,580
the Gustave Le Bon aspect, where it's like a crowd has formed and they're

1288
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:01,740
impassioned, they have a lot of energy, and you custom tailor the crowd and the

1289
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:03,760
mindset to do certain things.

1290
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:07,260
And people like killing, they like maiming, they like destruction.

1291
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:12,440
You don't believe that you ever watch what's called Hollywood, right?

1292
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,660
You ever watch what's called the news?

1293
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:18,860
You know, you look at what people are concerned about.

1294
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:24,720
Now, there's a lot of that look at their holidays, look at Okay, so what's going

1295
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:29,460
on is typically you have a group of people, it could be a very small group or

1296
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:34,780
a very large group, and you sequester the concept of their mind that has to

1297
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:39,580
deal with a deity or a god now they don't know, that's all you have to do is

1298
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:45,440
separate a part of their mind and have it adhere passionately to a concept of a

1299
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:45,720
deity.

1300
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:50,760
Now, when this is done, you cannot inform them or supply information more about the

1301
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:55,920
gods plural or, or even that particular God, because well, then that leads to a

1302
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,540
path of gaining knowledge.

1303
01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,460
And there's no way you can get them to do what I'm going to describe here.

1304
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:06,640
So what you do then is that you once you see that they're impassioned about this,

1305
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:08,840
you know, the information is it has to be very minimal.

1306
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:12,380
And it doesn't have you don't have to be true, which it's not you can't show me

1307
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:17,000
any religion in the world that has any truth to it, other than the truth that it

1308
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,500
is actually a spiritual guidance of sorts, but it's not what they think it is.

1309
01:14:21,140 --> 01:14:21,400
Right.

1310
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:29,280
So once once you get these individuals impassioned, you break up the that

1311
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:33,020
impassionment into subgroups, you have the various classes, you know, you might

1312
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:36,320
have one with more training in a certain field than another, and you start

1313
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:40,840
subdividing them, and you give them an even stronger reason in private why this

1314
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,380
religion needs to be aggressively promoted.

1315
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:49,400
You see, and again, you have to keep the information to an absolute minimum, you

1316
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:53,540
have to keep it, quote unquote, dummy loaded, no specifics, because once you

1317
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:57,940
start giving specifics, then the individual becomes edified.

1318
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:02,240
And it starts in the individual, then we'll see that there is nothing to do with

1319
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:04,780
what they believe, or told to believe.

1320
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:08,100
So you have to keep it very limited and out of context.

1321
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:14,200
Now, once you have them impassioned about a deity of some sort, whether it exists

1322
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,220
or not, is not the point.

1323
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:20,060
Because remember, the information is so minimal, and it's about impassioning the

1324
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:23,080
individual various types, you know, common oath, people that are completely

1325
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:26,140
illiterate, and then like, then you have the ones that are functionally

1326
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:28,780
illiterate, like most people on the planet today just means you know how to

1327
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:30,240
read, but you don't know what anything means.

1328
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:33,800
Then you have the other ones with specific training, like doctors, lawyers,

1329
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:38,600
engineers and scientists, and you keep them all impassioned with minimal

1330
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,240
information.

1331
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,960
And then you tell them that it's a matter of life and death, and they're going to

1332
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:47,200
get a reward that is that in another place for doing this.

1333
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:53,560
And you need to keep this passion and fervor going with very, very little

1334
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:54,860
information at all.

1335
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:56,760
This is how you do it.

1336
01:15:56,800 --> 01:15:58,000
It's like a rabid dog.

1337
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:03,240
And that, on the other hand, this is something that anyone can research, it

1338
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:07,040
might be difficult, but you when you start looking, you'll see that it's true.

1339
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:12,220
That if you can't just do it through the mind with, you know, probate, provoking

1340
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:16,740
them through little bits of information, how what they're doing is so noble, you

1341
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:17,560
do it chemically.

1342
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:21,620
Like, for example, you hear about a lot of these, quote, unquote, especially what

1343
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:23,720
you know, this, this show has been time marked.

1344
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:25,600
It's what they call 2017, April.

1345
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:29,960
So if you look at what's going on in the Middle East, these quote, unquote, people

1346
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:34,980
that are running around shooting up other people of their own kind, let's say, kind

1347
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:39,840
meaning relative, are pretty much all doped up on amphetamines and all kinds of

1348
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,400
other stuff and alcohol, whatever.

1349
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:46,600
And yeah, it's pretty ridiculous, because the whole thing is ridiculous.

1350
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:51,220
You know that, for example, if anyone does some history, again, you'll find that

1351
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:54,700
there's something called a uniform that you recognize someone's profession by

1352
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:59,700
visually, it's a community form of communication, that when a woman was

1353
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:05,600
covered, as it as they are considered to be in certain religions, or religion

1354
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,980
today, that was the symbol of a particular profession.

1355
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:13,640
Yeah, and you might want to guess what it is, if you mentioned this before.

1356
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:18,520
So the insanity of that, and by the way, covering of any kind like that is not

1357
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:23,800
even suggested in, in the book that they allegedly subscribe to.

1358
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:27,200
And what that profession is, you might find to be shocking.

1359
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:28,680
It's called the oldest profession.

1360
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:30,660
This was the uniform.

1361
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:36,700
And now there is actually a mass demand that it is symbol of righteousness.

1362
01:17:36,700 --> 01:17:40,240
So, so, yeah, insanity.

1363
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:44,880
Now, this can be said about any and every religion on the planet at this point.

1364
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:49,760
Meaning, I gave you a definition of religion from the extreme sense of

1365
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:54,000
getting people to promote it through violence, because that is, it sounds extreme.

1366
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:58,060
Now, there's different levels of promotion of various religions.

1367
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:04,260
Now, you have to remember, historically, and academic historians, which are atheists,

1368
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,120
by the way, have dubbed this the Christian era.

1369
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:11,440
The, I don't, there's no reason to knock Christianity or criticize Christianity or

1370
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:15,900
not, because, I mean, look, I'm just gonna say a few things and you could figure it

1371
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:16,460
out yourself.

1372
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:19,880
Look, Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, chocolate eggs, Christmas tree.

1373
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,580
I mean, you don't have to say anything else.

1374
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,460
I mean, that's, it doesn't get worse than that.

1375
01:18:24,500 --> 01:18:30,400
But, but on the, from, from the spiritual perspective, but you also have to look at

1376
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:34,880
the character of the individual that defends that.

1377
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:39,980
When you look at people that defend that aspect of, of the, one of the world's

1378
01:18:39,980 --> 01:18:43,340
religions, which is known as the Christian era, you will find nothing but a poor

1379
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,200
character there.

1380
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:50,400
Now, what I mean by that is they typically will defend that idiocy by saying, it

1381
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:58,240
doesn't matter, and you will get, after about 150, it doesn't matter, then what

1382
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:01,340
the hell does matter, right?

1383
01:19:01,900 --> 01:19:07,540
So, and, and also when you hear about these religions, by the way, they discuss

1384
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:11,780
they, what they're doing as being good because that is part of their tradition,

1385
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:14,400
you see?

1386
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:17,600
So, is it bad?

1387
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:18,480
No, but is it good?

1388
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:19,500
Definitely not.

1389
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:23,580
You can't say it's bad because then, you know, how, well, if you did, then you'd

1390
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:26,420
have to get off this planet, you see?

1391
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,040
And this goes across the board with everything and anything in, in terms of

1392
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:31,760
what man considers religion.

1393
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:38,440
But one thing that you will find that is interesting about religion, when you say

1394
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:46,280
that term, it's not like when you say legal or medical or film or entertainment

1395
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:51,420
or whatever, because most, when you say religion, typically the mindset goes

1396
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:55,600
right to a god or a demon or a deity of some sort, meaning it's not worldly.

1397
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:57,600
And that's correct about that.

1398
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:01,800
But what's not correct is the way that they comprehend and use the term, and

1399
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,080
it's not correct at all.

1400
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,320
Because nothing good can come out of it in the strictest and even in the loose

1401
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:14,220
sense, because as I mentioned earlier, Gustav Le Bon's The Crowd, when you

1402
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:18,920
assemble such a group of people together, the information that brings them together

1403
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:23,420
has to be so simplified that it no longer represents its original form.

1404
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:28,680
It's completely corrupt by that, by operation, right?

1405
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:35,400
So the, the way that, quote unquote, religion on the planet through man's

1406
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,400
tradition, because, you know, it has to be tradition, right?

1407
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:39,060
That's what they say.

1408
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:44,180
The only way that it could, it could thrive as it has or has not, because some

1409
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:50,920
have not, is strictly by keeping the adherents ignorant of a full scope,

1410
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:57,240
showing them an extremely narrow view, very, very narrow view with very little

1411
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:02,000
information about what's known as the gods, right?

1412
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:06,320
And what you need to do if you're going to influence people in such a negative

1413
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:11,460
way is keep them ignorant of their own stuff.

1414
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:17,480
Because when I, when I say their own stuff, there is no one religion, but they

1415
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:21,600
typically are all under the goddess religion, which I've discussed loosely,

1416
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:23,880
and I will discuss in greater detail in the future.

1417
01:21:24,780 --> 01:21:26,080
They're not aware of that at all.

1418
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:31,980
But what I mean about keep them ignorant is that the same level of ignorance you

1419
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:35,840
will find in the, in the, what's called the major world religions today.

1420
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:40,520
The, the practitioner and the adherent must remain ignorant.

1421
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:45,340
That is a, that is a definite requirement.

1422
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:52,000
And when I say this, this includes academia and the quote unquote priesthood.

1423
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:56,260
Now, why is the ignorance very important?

1424
01:21:56,620 --> 01:22:01,600
Because when you get knowledge, now you can make better choices, you see?

1425
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:06,160
And also when you get knowledge of all these ancient holy writs, what you will

1426
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:09,800
see is there's a hierarchy in quality, right?

1427
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:12,780
And also what you will see within that hierarchy of qualities,

1428
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,000
they're all saying the same thing.

1429
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,520
Even the mythology says the same thing.

1430
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:20,400
The psyche, for example, in, in, in, in Greek mythology,

1431
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:26,160
has no consciousness whatsoever in Hades, meaning the spirit after you die.

1432
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,540
There's no consciousness at all.

1433
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:32,340
Now, this is not a cartoon type thing where you've probably learned about

1434
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:36,740
Greek mythology from a cartoon or a coloring book or something, some kind of

1435
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:39,260
hearsay, but if you actually look what's been memorialized about it,

1436
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:44,940
mostly by Homer and others, you will see that there is no consciousness after death.

1437
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:47,920
And this is what you will find in any of the ancient writs.

1438
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:52,200
So I'm just giving that as a thin slice, because that shows how they're all similar.

1439
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:55,420
So, so why am I bringing this up now?

1440
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:58,120
Well, it's springtime and springtime is a time to plant things.

1441
01:22:58,260 --> 01:23:05,600
So be aware that there's going to be let's say a nonspecific view of in

1442
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,620
the forefront of the topic of religion as being a significant,

1443
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,100
more significant than it has in the past.

1444
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:18,860
Not necessarily, you know, there's, there's a lot of comment about it.

1445
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:19,700
It's all false.

1446
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:23,640
Obviously, you can see it, you know, if we get a little bit of information.

1447
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:26,200
There's talk about this, talk about that.

1448
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:30,140
You know, the war of the religions or a coming world order religion and all that.

1449
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:35,100
Earlier, like I said, both creationists and evolutionists are wrong.

1450
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:37,540
That's simple to, to prove.

1451
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:40,600
And we'll, we'll give proofs on that in the future presentations.

1452
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:48,240
The same thing holds true for what's being discussed on the future of these

1453
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:52,320
mainstream religions and the aggressions of some and not the others.

1454
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:58,120
But you have to realize that at this point in history, especially at this point of

1455
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:02,480
history, like I mentioned earlier, you ever notice that if you speak to people or

1456
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:06,460
go to internet radio or mainstream or even university, you notice that people

1457
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:12,180
are starting to be seemingly getting dumber or saying things that are stupid.

1458
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:17,680
It's just, it's just getting worse, but incrementally.

1459
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:21,200
What I wanted to throw in earlier, how it gets worse.

1460
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:23,960
You see, today, it's like the frog in the pot.

1461
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,740
Today is a little bit worse than yesterday, but

1462
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:28,480
not as bad as it's going to be tomorrow.

1463
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:33,700
Because if it was as bad as it's going to be tomorrow, today, everyone would stop and

1464
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:34,800
say, okay, enough is enough.

1465
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:35,880
This is shocking.

1466
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:36,580
Stop.

1467
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:39,560
Right? But it's, it's just so incremental.

1468
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:43,580
And when you're made aware of the incremental change and

1469
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:48,340
the gradualness of it, then it's, you know, just start raving, you know, clear.

1470
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:52,700
But if you're not aware of it and you're in it, obviously you're in it and

1471
01:24:52,700 --> 01:24:56,280
you're of it, you're going to be partaking and exhibiting that quality.

1472
01:24:57,020 --> 01:25:00,580
So, I mean, that's why, for example, there's no reason.

1473
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,680
The Greek is not a public type person, but

1474
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:06,340
the reason I come around here every week or so now for this,

1475
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:09,060
which is probably going to be limited, this is the eighth solo,

1476
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:14,380
might be just 12 again, or something, is because there is nothing out there.

1477
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:19,740
Sorry, folks, anywhere that has anything that you want to sink your teeth in.

1478
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:23,340
Now, you want to say that as a subjective, personal comment, well,

1479
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,840
the Greek doesn't like this, yeah, you can take it that way, but

1480
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:28,080
learn to objectify and you'll see what I just said is true.

1481
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:30,280
There's just nothing there.

1482
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:33,880
I'm talking about, now forget about internet radio, alternative media,

1483
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:35,700
that too, but I mean, even academia.

1484
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:39,680
Your religious institutions, your academic institutions, your scientific,

1485
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:44,500
even I just mentioned the high level labs that you have.

1486
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:47,460
Have you met anyone that works in a research lab of any variety,

1487
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:49,020
whether it's private or government or anything?

1488
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:50,980
No, you probably haven't, right?

1489
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:51,860
Maybe someone has.

1490
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:53,200
They're morons, yo.

1491
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,740
Anyway, so there's a reason to come around here and

1492
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:04,060
do this for two hours every week, because you just never know.

1493
01:26:04,340 --> 01:26:07,160
And the thing is, there's no movement, there's no following.

1494
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:10,020
Hopefully you have bowel movements and other movements, but

1495
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:12,360
not with anything that's being done here.

1496
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:16,520
Because the suggestion that I would give to anyone is if you've showed up,

1497
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:18,320
you've showed up, you're done.

1498
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:20,780
You've pretty much done your thing cosmically.

1499
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:23,620
Now the rest of it, of course you're going to be directed,

1500
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,580
because it's all external input.

1501
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:28,800
You're going to be directed, of course, to partake in the cosmic plan, and

1502
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,680
you don't know what it is or what makes it even more elusive, right?

1503
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:35,320
And the other thing is to do nothing, meaning do nothing,

1504
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:39,680
don't start chasing these, I don't know, chasing the wind.

1505
01:26:40,460 --> 01:26:42,700
You ever heard of activism, right?

1506
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:45,740
Or this or that, or you've got to change this.

1507
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:49,880
Or someone said today, well, if you have knowledge,

1508
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:50,880
now you have to do something.

1509
01:26:51,020 --> 01:26:51,660
I said, it says who?

1510
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:52,820
It says why?

1511
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:56,300
You're joking, right?

1512
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:01,000
The thing is to set yourself apart and sustain food, clothing, and

1513
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,580
shelter of whatever quality you want.

1514
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:05,040
Now someone, of course, has said that's oversimplified.

1515
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,500
But what kind of quality food would you like?

1516
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,080
It takes a lot of work to do that.

1517
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:13,080
By the way, in societies where they were not industrialized or

1518
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,300
commercialized, you spent most of the day doing that.

1519
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:19,100
But now you do something else and you exchange it for food.

1520
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:23,020
And then clothing, what level of clothing would you like?

1521
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:26,700
Of course, and then shelter, what level of shelter?

1522
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:29,240
And even in today's credit system,

1523
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:33,500
do you know what it takes to maintain a four-bathroom house on a hill?

1524
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:35,900
So it's part of shelter.

1525
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:38,420
It's a lot of maintenance there and cost.

1526
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,240
So when I say food, clothing, and shelter, you'll start noticing that you have

1527
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:46,240
a basic, not a derivative, but a basic foundation on how to function here.

1528
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:50,460
Now, I've also said before, there's a lot of the Greeks that I've said,

1529
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:52,900
you should do this, I shouldn't do any of this, shouldn't listen to any of this.

1530
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:55,560
But the thing is, it needs to be said, right?

1531
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:58,340
Now, what needs to, another thing that could be said,

1532
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,460
it just seems like I have a Skype call, or Seth probably.

1533
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:02,100
I'm gonna see if I could bring him in.

1534
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:08,040
But to set yourself apart, and I gave someone an example of this.

1535
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:09,160
What do you mean, set yourself apart?

1536
01:28:09,220 --> 01:28:10,140
How can you set yourself apart?

1537
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:13,400
I said, okay, if everyone around you, even on the whole planet,

1538
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:15,780
decided to turn the Earth into a paradise tomorrow,

1539
01:28:15,780 --> 01:28:18,920
I'm still gonna be a part, good, apart from it, set apart from it.

1540
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,860
Go ahead, do what you gotta do, leave me alone.

1541
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:24,680
Now, if everyone tomorrow wanted to just go and kill each other,

1542
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,980
that's fine with me, just go and leave me alone.

1543
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,220
I don't want anything to do with it.

1544
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:32,280
So whether everyone wants to hold hands and

1545
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:37,060
sing Kumbaya and make a perfect society, I'm gonna be set apart from it.

1546
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:40,220
You guys go ahead, knock yourselves out, have fun, leave me alone.

1547
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:44,240
And the other aspect of it is if they wanna just go and

1548
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:49,140
wreak destruction on each other for no reason, leave me alone and set yourself apart.

1549
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:52,280
Now, it's gonna take a lot of work to do it either way, see?

1550
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:55,480
So it's not like just leave me alone, go sit in a corner like a lump on a log.

1551
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:58,220
If people are fixing on killing each other,

1552
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:01,480
it's gonna take a lot of your energy to set yourself apart from that.

1553
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:05,260
And if people are fixing on creating paradise on Earth, wink, wink,

1554
01:29:06,040 --> 01:29:08,620
it's gonna take a lot to set yourself apart from that also.

1555
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:15,920
So let's see if I can drag in Seth, otherwise there's a,

1556
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:22,840
Skype tends to be sort of temperamental, let's see.

1557
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:27,140
Yep, okay, let's see if he comes on and maybe he'll have his microphone on as well.

1558
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:30,270
Greetings, Seth, are you there?

1559
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:32,010
Greetings, I am.

1560
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:33,710
Oh, good, you sound good, how are you?

1561
01:29:34,730 --> 01:29:35,830
I'm well, how about yourself?

1562
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:42,010
Oh, here on Uncommon Radio, and you were calling,

1563
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:43,950
perhaps you knew it knowing that we're on the air,

1564
01:29:44,110 --> 01:29:46,430
so speak your mind if you've got one left.

1565
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:51,010
Yeah, well, I'd like to hope that I have one left,

1566
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:53,490
at least what I've been given, if nothing else.

1567
01:29:56,130 --> 01:30:01,990
I guess there's a lot that could be said, you know, I like to ask questions.

1568
01:30:02,740 --> 01:30:07,350
And you've said, you know, what I was listening to earlier

1569
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:15,550
while I was still doing the yob was, you know, that showing up is 90% of it,

1570
01:30:16,650 --> 01:30:25,350
which is very accurate in most yobs, I suppose, is just showing up.

1571
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:34,170
But other than food, clothing, and shelter, which are important, obviously,

1572
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:40,070
I mean, those are the main ways that we interact with our environment.

1573
01:30:42,090 --> 01:30:45,710
But beyond that, what is there?

1574
01:30:47,770 --> 01:30:49,550
A very broad question, obviously.

1575
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:53,310
Well, the other thing is step two, or is that, you know,

1576
01:30:53,310 --> 01:30:58,950
another chunk of what to pursue is to learn about what the soul,

1577
01:30:59,130 --> 01:31:02,870
the spirit, and the body is, and as you learn and know about it,

1578
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:03,830
to act accordingly.

1579
01:31:07,210 --> 01:31:12,750
Which brings us directly back to food, water, and shelter.

1580
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:14,730
Well, yeah, it does.

1581
01:31:14,890 --> 01:31:17,970
And also, you know, if you've got food, clothing, and shelter taken care of,

1582
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:19,470
you've got a lot of free time on your hands.

1583
01:31:20,070 --> 01:31:22,850
But again, do you know what it takes to maintain a four-bedroom,

1584
01:31:22,850 --> 01:31:26,410
four-bathroom house on the side of a hill in a golden ghetto?

1585
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:28,290
Let's say golden ghettos where rich people live.

1586
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:32,090
Or it depends on what kind of clothing you like to wear because, you know,

1587
01:31:32,190 --> 01:31:37,170
if you fit good Spanish or good Italian shoes, it's a form of a blessing.

1588
01:31:37,350 --> 01:31:38,830
You want the best shoes you can afford.

1589
01:31:39,610 --> 01:31:42,390
And for food, do you want to eat junk food, right,

1590
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:44,630
or do you want to eat the stuff they're telling you is food?

1591
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:48,330
So those pursuits right there, you're going to have to structure a way

1592
01:31:48,330 --> 01:31:52,070
to acquire all those things, which might take up most of your time anyway.

1593
01:31:52,810 --> 01:31:53,590
Oh, yeah.

1594
01:31:53,890 --> 01:31:59,330
And, you know, I take pleasure in making music with myself

1595
01:31:59,330 --> 01:32:00,730
and with others and for others.

1596
01:32:01,190 --> 01:32:05,330
So that's an aspect of the mind and the body then.

1597
01:32:06,030 --> 01:32:06,290
Yeah.

1598
01:32:06,410 --> 01:32:13,150
It's a way to communicate thought without the necessary hindrance of language.

1599
01:32:13,390 --> 01:32:17,470
Although, you know, you've listened to some of my music,

1600
01:32:17,630 --> 01:32:20,690
so, I mean, obviously there are words used as well.

1601
01:32:20,690 --> 01:32:23,070
But, you know, it's like painting.

1602
01:32:23,890 --> 01:32:28,930
You don't always have to paint exactly what is to get a thought across.

1603
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:31,730
Well, also, you know, what's interesting about music,

1604
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:36,850
it's one of the suggested mediums over most other art mediums by the gods also,

1605
01:32:37,630 --> 01:32:38,770
if you think about it.

1606
01:32:39,050 --> 01:32:43,490
I've never read in any holy writ that says you should make a painting for me.

1607
01:32:43,490 --> 01:32:48,410
But it does state in many writs about making music

1608
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:51,510
and singing and playing instruments.

1609
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:53,250
Yeah.

1610
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:57,310
Yeah, as a matter of fact, the statuary and the paintings and the stuff,

1611
01:32:57,530 --> 01:33:01,790
that's quite ironic and sarcastic to bring that up, right?

1612
01:33:02,030 --> 01:33:02,990
But it's the truth.

1613
01:33:03,770 --> 01:33:05,490
No, very much so.

1614
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:09,550
Actually, I would say that there are at least a handful of texts

1615
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:15,850
that recommend against those forms of physical art even.

1616
01:33:17,230 --> 01:33:21,410
For very specific purposes that we seem to,

1617
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:24,350
we being the world at large, not you and I,

1618
01:33:25,510 --> 01:33:30,010
but seem to put to the express purpose why they are,

1619
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:32,890
why it's recommended against seems to be considered

1620
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:35,510
some of the highest form of those arts,

1621
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:38,610
which is not surprising, I suppose.

1622
01:33:38,610 --> 01:33:40,790
But it is ironic.

1623
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:44,090
The interesting thing that I've also been discussing

1624
01:33:44,090 --> 01:33:46,250
is the character of the man or the woman,

1625
01:33:46,790 --> 01:33:48,370
because that is very important.

1626
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:52,350
For example, this might be personal and general.

1627
01:33:52,890 --> 01:33:56,090
Many people that have come across, let's say,

1628
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:59,890
and have this desire to learn of what they came across

1629
01:33:59,890 --> 01:34:01,890
being the higher forms of ancient writ,

1630
01:34:02,490 --> 01:34:04,490
which would be the biblical text, for example,

1631
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:08,690
based on their character or personal weakness,

1632
01:34:09,190 --> 01:34:13,030
they get hang-ups about certain things along the way,

1633
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:17,750
and they latch on to the lower aspects of that particular writ, let's say.

1634
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:20,290
And things like we brought up,

1635
01:34:20,490 --> 01:34:22,810
like I would say iconography and statuary

1636
01:34:22,810 --> 01:34:28,830
become overblown out of proportion on their functioning.

1637
01:34:29,850 --> 01:34:32,530
Some people that, for example, I'll just say it more plainly,

1638
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:34,730
some people that start to study what's known as Scripture

1639
01:34:34,730 --> 01:34:37,450
get very upset at iconography

1640
01:34:37,450 --> 01:34:40,070
and almost as if it's something contagious

1641
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:42,270
that they need to run away from or scorn it.

1642
01:34:42,910 --> 01:34:43,510
Or destroy.

1643
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:48,190
Or destroy, where they haven't relaxed into the concept

1644
01:34:48,190 --> 01:34:49,910
of what that really means.

1645
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:51,290
They'll grab a concept.

1646
01:34:52,370 --> 01:34:56,610
And what's interesting is each concept, law, or point

1647
01:34:56,610 --> 01:34:59,750
that's made in Scripture has many facets to it.

1648
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:03,950
And the facets accommodate various levels of quality of character

1649
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:05,070
of who approaches it.

1650
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:09,210
You see, so I'll give a quick example.

1651
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:16,970
There's one of these Vedic places that don't serve any animal at all.

1652
01:35:17,090 --> 01:35:19,870
And I used to enjoy going there because it was an all-you-can-eat buffet

1653
01:35:19,870 --> 01:35:22,590
of some very high-quality vegetarian food.

1654
01:35:23,110 --> 01:35:25,870
And it's attached to a temple, not part of a temple.

1655
01:35:26,410 --> 01:35:28,850
And part of their thing is the monks go around there

1656
01:35:28,850 --> 01:35:32,930
and explain these little wooden statues, you know, what the gods do.

1657
01:35:33,230 --> 01:35:36,410
And being around someone who was studying Scripture,

1658
01:35:36,890 --> 01:35:38,790
kind of flipped out when they saw this.

1659
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:40,630
They said, I can't come in here. There are idols in here.

1660
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:41,370
I've got to go.

1661
01:35:42,230 --> 01:35:45,670
And I'm like, well, okay, well, all right.

1662
01:35:46,310 --> 01:35:48,130
Because their character could not.

1663
01:35:48,210 --> 01:35:50,830
They got the same information that I did, right?

1664
01:35:51,270 --> 01:35:55,910
But their character could not work through the relevancy

1665
01:35:55,910 --> 01:35:58,710
of what the entire message in Scripture is about it.

1666
01:36:00,070 --> 01:36:02,850
In this case, just to finish off a little bit more,

1667
01:36:03,770 --> 01:36:07,430
specifically I went there for the food because it was an excellent value.

1668
01:36:07,650 --> 01:36:10,430
It was very well-prepared, very high-quality, at a very good price.

1669
01:36:11,450 --> 01:36:16,130
So I sat down there, and the little monk, the idiot with the shaved head,

1670
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:20,130
comes around and says, well, basically this god does this

1671
01:36:20,130 --> 01:36:23,490
and is good for that and has done this.

1672
01:36:23,490 --> 01:36:27,350
And I wait for him to finish, and I basically said, well,

1673
01:36:27,470 --> 01:36:30,610
my god made the wood that you made your god out of.

1674
01:36:32,670 --> 01:36:33,930
So big deal.

1675
01:36:35,310 --> 01:36:35,790
Right.

1676
01:36:36,570 --> 01:36:43,030
Do you see how there's humor, there's sarcasm, there's edification,

1677
01:36:44,270 --> 01:36:46,190
we have to keep things relevant.

1678
01:36:47,490 --> 01:36:49,110
I mean, do we have to? No.

1679
01:36:49,110 --> 01:36:52,850
In other words, how are people taking the information

1680
01:36:54,470 --> 01:37:01,910
and seeing its value according to the way they pursue things in life,

1681
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:05,170
but not purely, Harris, you do and interpret it what you want,

1682
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:09,210
but you need to see the whole thing to make a decision if it's for you first.

1683
01:37:09,690 --> 01:37:12,750
That's why, for example, I sarcastically say very often,

1684
01:37:12,790 --> 01:37:15,510
you listen to Greek-speak and start going down some of these paths,

1685
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:16,670
you're not going to have any friends.

1686
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:18,090
Well, why?

1687
01:37:18,690 --> 01:37:20,870
You could still win friends and influence people.

1688
01:37:21,730 --> 01:37:23,610
Dale Carnegie wrote a book about that.

1689
01:37:23,730 --> 01:37:23,910
Why?

1690
01:37:24,950 --> 01:37:27,950
Well, you just can't talk to them about this kind of stuff,

1691
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:29,930
because in order to have friends and influence people,

1692
01:37:30,370 --> 01:37:33,370
you're going to have to accommodate them with whatever crap they're interested in,

1693
01:37:33,450 --> 01:37:35,630
and most of the people are interested in crap, yes.

1694
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:38,530
So can you discern it?

1695
01:37:38,570 --> 01:37:40,750
Do you want to put that kind of energy into it?

1696
01:37:41,450 --> 01:37:43,750
It's like the purpose of coming here and doing the radio

1697
01:37:43,750 --> 01:37:46,430
is not to rehash the crap like everyone else does.

1698
01:37:46,550 --> 01:37:47,690
You know, you ever turn on internet radio

1699
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:49,350
and all you hear is what the mainstream media,

1700
01:37:49,450 --> 01:37:50,690
they just have their own spin on it.

1701
01:37:51,530 --> 01:37:52,570
They just repeat what they read.

1702
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:53,550
It's just bizarre.

1703
01:37:54,830 --> 01:37:58,690
So the thing is here, a couple more.

1704
01:37:58,930 --> 01:38:02,370
I think we might do 12 on this one, but this is the eighth one.

1705
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:08,190
I've been speaking more about the character of the individuals on this planet.

1706
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:11,910
In other words, get most of the stuff out of the way

1707
01:38:11,910 --> 01:38:17,190
and start trying to figure out or give a little bit of information

1708
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:19,950
so people can figure out how to improve their character.

1709
01:38:21,830 --> 01:38:26,570
Character, by the way, comes from charisma,

1710
01:38:26,750 --> 01:38:31,890
or character is a base word in Greek which means grace.

1711
01:38:32,650 --> 01:38:35,970
Like if you read in scripture the word grace, it's actually charis.

1712
01:38:35,970 --> 01:38:40,990
So it's almost as if one's personality or one's character is operating under privilege.

1713
01:38:41,790 --> 01:38:45,070
In other words, you are the way you are and it was given to you to be that way,

1714
01:38:45,150 --> 01:38:46,890
but it doesn't mean you can't improve it.

1715
01:38:47,810 --> 01:38:51,690
Now, by the way, an improvement for some would be death or destruction for another.

1716
01:38:51,950 --> 01:38:53,630
So you have to comprehend that as well.

1717
01:38:54,810 --> 01:38:57,130
Same root as charisma?

1718
01:38:57,750 --> 01:39:00,910
Yes. That's where you get charisma from.

1719
01:39:02,030 --> 01:39:05,550
Charaktidas. Charaktidas is character.

1720
01:39:06,210 --> 01:39:11,790
You see, the prefix is the same, the ha prefix, which is a letter that's not in English.

1721
01:39:12,010 --> 01:39:15,870
They typically do it with ch or c.

1722
01:39:16,450 --> 01:39:20,910
But it's an interesting thing how the word itself actually shows the purpose

1723
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:22,550
of what we're attaching the word to.

1724
01:39:23,890 --> 01:39:27,610
So the thing is, one thing that hasn't been discussed is not, I assure you,

1725
01:39:27,610 --> 01:39:32,590
you don't hear about, forget about internet radio or anywhere,

1726
01:39:32,990 --> 01:39:34,490
is the character of the individual.

1727
01:39:36,030 --> 01:39:42,710
Now, that sounds subjective, but is there a way to objectify good character?

1728
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:45,570
And the answer to that would be yes, there is.

1729
01:39:46,630 --> 01:39:52,670
And there's certain things that could be laid down because the character being animated

1730
01:39:52,670 --> 01:39:56,670
or the mind or the spirit is dependent on the physical body, is it not?

1731
01:39:56,670 --> 01:39:59,430
Because if you remove the physical body, then there's no character.

1732
01:40:00,410 --> 01:40:04,230
So, you know, how can the physical body be improved?

1733
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:09,130
Well, how can it be improved if you think you're a filter bag absorbing things?

1734
01:40:11,150 --> 01:40:13,870
You see, so these things all tie in together.

1735
01:40:13,970 --> 01:40:17,930
I've gotten certain messages like, Greek, you're saying all this stuff, it's great,

1736
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:21,510
but there's something you're holding back, man, there's something in there.

1737
01:40:21,590 --> 01:40:25,930
Yes, if you folks want to know, yes, the Greek is holding back a lot, mostly.

1738
01:40:25,930 --> 01:40:30,250
I'm never going to share more than 10%, never, publicly.

1739
01:40:30,430 --> 01:40:31,450
That's not going to happen.

1740
01:40:31,790 --> 01:40:33,470
Maybe 11% sometimes.

1741
01:40:34,190 --> 01:40:36,630
But everything is being given.

1742
01:40:36,890 --> 01:40:37,990
What is being given?

1743
01:40:38,070 --> 01:40:43,370
Not that I have everything, but if you're dealing with people that have nothing,

1744
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:46,570
if you have a tiny inkling, that's a hell of a lot more.

1745
01:40:47,430 --> 01:40:51,170
So the point is this, is that all of the hints,

1746
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:55,730
all of the things that are being ever discussed in public need to be strung together

1747
01:40:56,430 --> 01:40:58,070
and looked at holistically.

1748
01:40:58,510 --> 01:41:01,110
Wow, okay, that's too much.

1749
01:41:01,230 --> 01:41:01,790
Well, sorry.

1750
01:41:03,390 --> 01:41:08,710
All of it ties together because basically, why are people worrying?

1751
01:41:09,590 --> 01:41:11,330
Because if you're here, you're done.

1752
01:41:12,150 --> 01:41:16,830
According to the gods, if you are born and even if you're thrown into,

1753
01:41:16,830 --> 01:41:21,810
if you're born and with the afterbirth, the mom throws you in a trash bag,

1754
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:25,710
if you took your first breath, your purpose is over.

1755
01:41:26,630 --> 01:41:27,670
You took a place number.

1756
01:41:27,810 --> 01:41:28,810
You're here to take a number.

1757
01:41:29,790 --> 01:41:34,690
A certain amount of spirits have to come from here over a certain amount of time, period.

1758
01:41:35,930 --> 01:41:39,690
Now, in order for that epoch or all those events to take place,

1759
01:41:39,770 --> 01:41:41,710
they're going to be done by nature and by man.

1760
01:41:42,730 --> 01:41:44,130
Things are going to be taking place,

1761
01:41:44,130 --> 01:41:47,530
and you will be guided and given resistance where you shouldn't go

1762
01:41:47,530 --> 01:41:52,290
and a vacuum that will suck you towards a direction where you should go from the other side.

1763
01:41:52,530 --> 01:41:54,230
And that is the predestination aspect.

1764
01:41:54,430 --> 01:41:58,150
But you do still have tremendous free will on the way

1765
01:41:58,150 --> 01:42:02,110
because if you didn't have free will, resistance wouldn't need to be put on one end

1766
01:42:02,110 --> 01:42:05,030
and a vacuum or less resistance in another, you see.

1767
01:42:06,470 --> 01:42:07,810
A car's got free will.

1768
01:42:08,810 --> 01:42:10,610
You want a bet?

1769
01:42:11,130 --> 01:42:15,430
Just get it in gear, put a stick between what's called the accelerator pedal,

1770
01:42:15,570 --> 01:42:16,690
and jump out and watch it.

1771
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:18,910
Interesting take on self-determinism.

1772
01:42:19,830 --> 01:42:21,230
Watch it go.

1773
01:42:22,770 --> 01:42:26,370
You know, on the perspective of seeing, I don't know,

1774
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:30,930
what could be described as the way that everything relates to everything

1775
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:33,070
or the connectivity of everything,

1776
01:42:33,070 --> 01:42:39,130
that seems to be something that is almost, I don't know,

1777
01:42:39,410 --> 01:42:45,350
not an innate ability but an innate wanting or desire

1778
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:53,410
that seems to be discouraged in most of, I don't know, polite society,

1779
01:42:53,790 --> 01:42:55,330
if you want to give it a polite term,

1780
01:42:55,330 --> 01:43:04,410
or completely and totally miscomprehended in the circles

1781
01:43:04,410 --> 01:43:06,650
that do speak about such connectivity.

1782
01:43:07,450 --> 01:43:12,110
And taking that perspective is difficult because of those two things.

1783
01:43:13,130 --> 01:43:14,910
This is speculation, I suppose.

1784
01:43:15,330 --> 01:43:17,590
Well, that would be the resistance aspect of it.

1785
01:43:17,790 --> 01:43:18,270
Right.

1786
01:43:18,270 --> 01:43:18,370
Right.

1787
01:43:18,850 --> 01:43:25,190
But at the same time that it is difficult to possibly think

1788
01:43:25,190 --> 01:43:26,590
in that large of a scale,

1789
01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:34,670
at the same time it feels that that is exactly what the mind wants to do.

1790
01:43:35,390 --> 01:43:39,930
Humans have a tendency to want to see the connections,

1791
01:43:40,410 --> 01:43:41,990
and where they do not see the connections,

1792
01:43:42,170 --> 01:43:43,870
try to make the connections themselves.

1793
01:43:44,890 --> 01:43:47,590
I've heard genius described as that.

1794
01:43:47,930 --> 01:43:50,930
I can't remember where or whether or not it's accurate,

1795
01:43:51,330 --> 01:43:56,010
but that genius is the ability to see the connections that are there

1796
01:43:56,010 --> 01:43:57,350
and little more.

1797
01:43:57,970 --> 01:43:58,890
See the obvious.

1798
01:43:59,610 --> 01:43:59,770
Yeah.

1799
01:44:00,290 --> 01:44:02,350
Now, that can be trained.

1800
01:44:02,650 --> 01:44:08,690
That's a skill, by the way, and it's also a counter-spatial issue.

1801
01:44:09,410 --> 01:44:11,010
Have you ever had a discussion with someone

1802
01:44:11,010 --> 01:44:14,610
and they got what you're saying before you even finished explaining it?

1803
01:44:14,690 --> 01:44:17,230
You just brought the subject matter up

1804
01:44:17,230 --> 01:44:19,890
and they saw what direction you were going and they got it.

1805
01:44:19,950 --> 01:44:21,390
You didn't even have to finish the thought.

1806
01:44:22,050 --> 01:44:25,510
It's like handing someone a set of eyeglasses with a better prescription in them.

1807
01:44:26,450 --> 01:44:26,670
Yeah.

1808
01:44:26,830 --> 01:44:28,590
Okay, and you see the expression, right?

1809
01:44:28,750 --> 01:44:29,830
It's unexplainable.

1810
01:44:30,850 --> 01:44:34,010
Sometimes in private I discuss these are counter-spatial issues,

1811
01:44:34,110 --> 01:44:36,330
meaning they don't work in the way.

1812
01:44:36,930 --> 01:44:41,070
Well, it's basically called you exist in space and through time.

1813
01:44:41,590 --> 01:44:43,390
Counter-space is space times time.

1814
01:44:44,410 --> 01:44:49,950
The ability to observe such a thing would put you at a much higher vantage point.

1815
01:44:50,510 --> 01:44:54,130
Right, and the only way you can get the direction is from a higher vantage point,

1816
01:44:54,190 --> 01:44:59,130
but the irony of it is that everyone is getting direction from a higher vantage point,

1817
01:44:59,330 --> 01:45:01,590
like it or not, because it's external input.

1818
01:45:03,370 --> 01:45:09,430
But there's so little information about that realm where these things come from,

1819
01:45:09,490 --> 01:45:12,790
thought, inspiration, the spiritual side.

1820
01:45:13,450 --> 01:45:16,810
There's so little information even today that people are engaged in.

1821
01:45:16,890 --> 01:45:17,810
The information is there.

1822
01:45:17,930 --> 01:45:18,990
It's just no one wants to touch it.

1823
01:45:19,070 --> 01:45:20,930
When I say no one, I mean hardly anyone.

1824
01:45:21,790 --> 01:45:25,430
And those obviously that do are aware of the spiritual realm

1825
01:45:25,430 --> 01:45:29,830
or that other less tangible, counter-spatial, non-physical.

1826
01:45:29,830 --> 01:45:31,430
They don't need the physical to animate.

1827
01:45:32,610 --> 01:45:35,130
Well, they're not speaking at all.

1828
01:45:35,950 --> 01:45:38,630
That's fascinating, or at least in a way that you can go

1829
01:45:38,630 --> 01:45:41,010
and find it on what's called the Internet yet.

1830
01:45:43,390 --> 01:45:53,410
It doesn't seem that at least if any of the history that has been shared can be trusted at all.

1831
01:45:53,410 --> 01:45:54,030
No.

1832
01:45:54,390 --> 01:46:04,110
It would seem that that aspect of society, like the way that we view, as an example,

1833
01:46:04,230 --> 01:46:07,550
like the separation of the church and the state, that that is a...

1834
01:46:07,550 --> 01:46:08,430
It's an oxymoron.

1835
01:46:08,830 --> 01:46:09,990
Yes, exactly.

1836
01:46:10,550 --> 01:46:11,970
You can't have a state without...

1837
01:46:11,970 --> 01:46:14,810
But the church being the circus, meaning the God aspect,

1838
01:46:14,970 --> 01:46:17,010
no, you can't have a state without a God behind it.

1839
01:46:17,350 --> 01:46:17,610
Right.

1840
01:46:17,610 --> 01:46:25,370
And that way it's much more recognized throughout, at least like I said,

1841
01:46:25,490 --> 01:46:28,610
whether or not history can be believed, what has been shared through the epochs.

1842
01:46:28,710 --> 01:46:34,110
It seems that in the past they had a much better understanding at least

1843
01:46:34,110 --> 01:46:38,850
or more information was available to them on such matters.

1844
01:46:39,610 --> 01:46:43,370
But the thing is if it was so good, why is everyone in the shape that they're in today?

1845
01:46:43,370 --> 01:46:51,510
Oh, I'm not suggesting that it was good or that what was done with that information was good,

1846
01:46:51,790 --> 01:46:54,710
but it just seems to be that...

1847
01:46:54,710 --> 01:47:01,730
How often do you hear of some, quote-unquote, old religion being brought forth again

1848
01:47:01,730 --> 01:47:06,730
like through the various pieces of...

1849
01:47:06,730 --> 01:47:07,290
Oh, yeah.

1850
01:47:08,590 --> 01:47:09,050
It does.

1851
01:47:09,110 --> 01:47:10,270
Thank you for calling in, Seth.

1852
01:47:10,270 --> 01:47:13,170
This is Solo 8, and we'll see you at Solo 9.

1853
01:47:13,630 --> 01:47:14,290
Thank you, everyone.
