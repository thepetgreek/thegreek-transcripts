00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,470
Greetings, and here we go again, perhaps for solo nine on the PaganWorks schedule, what's

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,750
known as April 27th or 4-27-2017.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:13,310
But in lawful timekeeping, if you are aware of such a thing, it appears to be the second

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,810
month and the third week of the second month around the 19th day.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,110
So here we are again.

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:25,870
Hopefully I won't make too much of a fool of myself this week, but this week meaning

7
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,770
if you're probably going to catch it down the stream, you have a little bit of a time

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,930
marker for the archive that we're calling these solo Greek events, this is solo nine,

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:34,370
let's say.

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,790
And if it's going to be solo, it doesn't quite have to be.

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,450
You could use the call-in number, and I have a way to perhaps answer that through a conference

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,610
deal here that AFR provides.

13
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,570
So we shall see if you'd like to call in.

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:57,150
It's 218-339-8525, 218-339-8525.

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:04,170
And if you somehow prefer the Skype convention for its fidelity, what you can do is use the

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,870
email for the Uncommon Radio site, which is www.uncommonradio.com, and the email on that

17
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:17,630
site is also your Skype contact or request if you would like to come on as a Skype participant.

18
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:24,790
And the email there would be uncommonsenseradio1 at gmail.com, and that's a numeric one.

19
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,390
And we shall see.

20
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,270
Yes, we do have the conference manager up, and let's roll somehow.

21
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:37,430
Also, what I do is try to keep certain streams like emails and a ridiculous thing called the

22
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,650
chat, and we will see how � don't know what we'd like to discuss this week.

23
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:48,130
Now, what kind of input we can get from those other streams, but don't know what to discuss

24
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:53,690
even though that's kind of like a figure of speech because ultimately, if you have heard

25
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,190
Greek speak at any point, it's cumulative.

26
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:02,090
Things are brought up that were brought up before but in a cursory way because one way

27
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,889
to poke fun at everything is if you go to the stove and try to get some water, and if

28
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:12,090
you look around, you'll notice it's in flat bottom containers with light going into it

29
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,670
and probably at room temperature.

30
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,930
So as long as you satisfy the absolute minimum requirement, it seems it's wet and I'm thirsty,

31
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:19,690
it's good enough.

32
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:25,050
The quality of that perception, by the way, goes through the rest of society.

33
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,410
So there's much to be discussed, much to be done.

34
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,310
So let's just see what's going on in the chat.

35
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:37,290
We just have a few people showing up and � does it really matter what day it is?

36
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,070
We have a stoner on here, and that's not stoners.

37
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,430
Let's just see.

38
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,910
That's the interesting thing.

39
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:55,270
Last solo eight, which is quite a significant, let's say disclosure because people are easily

40
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,830
impressed.

41
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,870
Yeah, you may not be easily impressed, but there are things that will impress you eventually.

42
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:07,010
I would suggest that the general rule of impressing your typical surface-dwelling earth inhabitant

43
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,970
is a quantitative figure, meaning large numbers.

44
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:18,990
People are generally impressed with large numbers when you get into the super sensible

45
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:19,430
stuff.

46
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,090
Super sensible would be more complicated, let's say, versus sensible or sub-sensible,

47
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,290
which is almost innate.

48
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:34,630
So in this sense, most people have � defined most people anyway � most people have fallen

49
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:41,870
into the bracket of description that they are very impressed with big numbers and multitudes

50
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,390
of things.

51
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,870
Now, contrary to that, not necessarily adherent to large number, there's something called

52
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,450
quality, qualitative.

53
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:54,710
Most people will be impressed by quantity before they're impressed with quality.

54
00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:01,670
One of the points that are brought up here, meaning Greek-speak or uncommon radio or uncommon

55
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:09,410
sense radio, is a pursuit of a certain quality, and you will not find an emphasis on that

56
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,650
where the intent is underscored that it must be of quality pretty much anywhere until you

57
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:20,410
start getting into certain social aspects, like the snobby whatever-whatever, go to fancy

58
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,330
restaurants and expensive bottles of wine or fancy cars.

59
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,970
It doesn't have to be that way.

60
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,130
It just needs to be in accordance with what promotes life.

61
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,970
Yeah, you ever notice how there's almost no discussion on things that promote life?

62
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:40,630
But anyway, the point here is that I've made many suggestions and it's really easy to catch

63
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:46,590
people out there on how they kind of go about whatever they're going about, and they always

64
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,390
prove the point.

65
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,670
So typically, humans are to be avoided unless you need something.

66
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,410
In other words, you've got food, clothing, and shelter.

67
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,730
Treat them well.

68
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,850
They could make good pets, I heard.

69
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,430
I don't happen to have one as such.

70
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,390
This is a sarcastic comment, by the way.

71
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:11,070
Humanity at large, what I call surface-dwelling earth inhabitants, because I've mentioned before

72
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,570
in the past and in the future, we'll get more into it, there are three bloodlines, three

73
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,190
types of humans on the planet right now, which there is no overt discussion on.

74
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,110
Why should there be?

75
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,770
I just explained how there's little quality of any sort.

76
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:31,670
The thing is, what is generally classified as human statistically right now is about one

77
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,530
aspect of what appears to be humanoid.

78
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,990
I'm not talking about the ET alien stuff that you have ridiculous people of all ages and

79
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,150
sizes and whatever discussing.

80
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,170
This is something very different.

81
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,390
Again, like I said, it's not being discussed.

82
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:53,210
There is a level of quality here that can be observed, worked with, pursued, that is

83
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:58,510
just basically either deemed irrelevant, completely ignored, or cannot be seen by most people

84
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,010
on this planet, surface-dwelling earth inhabitants.

85
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,910
That's more accurate.

86
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,990
There's a reason why I've been using that term for years and years and years, surface-dwelling

87
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:13,690
earth inhabitants, yes, because you're visible on the surface, and you're apparently an earth

88
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:14,350
inhabitant.

89
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,250
Now, that's why you have to tie that back in with the three separate, let's say, bloodlines

90
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,470
or types, and again, this is something that we'll be going to in the future.

91
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,570
It's been brought up in a cursory way in the past.

92
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,590
Let's bring it up again.

93
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:31,310
You have the descendants of the first man known as Adam.

94
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,610
This has nothing to do with religion or nothing what you believe in or don't believe in, because

95
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,930
remember, most people are, everybody, close your ears, too moronic to believe in anything

96
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:45,010
that's correct anyway, but you have one which would be considered original human.

97
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:51,870
Then you have another bloodline which is, let's say, known as the gods, by the way.

98
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,070
The mold that they use to make the first human, they're still using that mold to reproduce

99
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,970
others which are always male and come into this existence as an adult.

100
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:08,070
Those males, or men, they appear to be men, are able to copulate or join with the descendants

101
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,410
or the women of this Adam line, and they form a hybrid.

102
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:17,850
Those are your three types, and again, this will probably be gone into more detail in

103
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,290
future projects.

104
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:28,290
Most likely not publicly accessible, sorry folks, because typically still what is deemed

105
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:33,750
to be real, correct, and true about anything, quote-unquote, regarding the gods is still

106
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:40,350
viewed in bad taste, because people have obviously, even though they're dim-witted, have still

107
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:47,450
been able to perceive the abominable ridiculousness put out by the world's religions, and they

108
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,610
don't want anything to do with that.

109
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:53,830
Now when I say people, I mean, again, there's more sensible ones that are just overcome

110
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,310
with the wrought emotion of the stupidity in the world.

111
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,270
So typically bringing up anything that is quote-unquote biblical or scriptural or that

112
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:09,650
even connotes to religious whatever category, I should say, is viewed in bad taste, and

113
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,750
I keep saying this, and there's a reason for it.

114
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:17,490
So we want to do things in good taste, we meaning anyone else that speaks in publicly,

115
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:24,030
try to be impeccable, try to wear at least, if you don't have whatever to put on, put

116
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,650
on your cleanest dirty shirt at least.

117
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:29,970
So you always want to make an effort to put out something good.

118
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,030
Well, okay, let's just say that as a figure of speech.

119
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:42,470
But so far, the aspect of discussing quality is very difficult.

120
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:49,530
You can go down certain categories, and there are many categories that can be discussed

121
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,550
qualitatively.

122
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:56,950
And this is more of the tendency of what you will hear when you encounter stuff from the

123
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:57,850
Greek or Greek-speak.

124
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:03,010
Now, let me just, I've had some conversations this week, and one is like, oh, you don't

125
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,710
really have to knock what everybody else is doing or how bad everything is, just go ahead

126
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,090
and plow forward with some good information.

127
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,950
I'm like, well, yeah, that's good, but you see, there's a level to where you introduce

128
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:19,630
information, and then you can mull it over and keep working it, but you also have to stop

129
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,470
and assess your work, right, or the work being done.

130
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,770
And the simple assessment on that is that most surface-toiling earth inhabitants still

131
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:33,030
do not have an operating system or any form of program that is viable to process good

132
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,610
information.

133
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,610
Okay, now, what does that mean?

134
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,150
Information solely alone is not good enough, because what do you do with it, right?

135
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:47,110
Most people lack the ability to do that only because of the level of pranking that has

136
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,750
been put on them.

137
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,370
There is not a physical aspect to it.

138
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,030
There is a spiritual aspect to it, meaning of the mind, and there is also a conditioning

139
00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:01,030
aspect, which is why I bring up the pranking, because pranking, let's say in common terms,

140
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,650
goes into the level of like the psychotronic, no, I shouldn't say psychotronic, but psychiatry

141
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,510
aspect, like the Pavlovian aspect of things.

142
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,490
I don't like to reference a lot of the quote-unquote institutional stuff, because it's very corrupt

143
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:20,690
and very just not put together well, it's just thrown out in public to serve a function.

144
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:27,290
But in the sense where the conditioning, where you have a situation put on a living being

145
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:34,710
with impulses, and then you follow it with another condition, the being eventually learns

146
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,730
that every time it's in this condition and gets this impulse, then the follow-up will

147
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,770
happen consistently.

148
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:47,090
So what you are seeing and witnessing for within the short life that you have, because

149
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:51,930
the infrastructure of society, culture and tradition has been here much longer than most

150
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,770
people's lives, but what you are witnessing within that short period of time or structure

151
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:06,250
is your interaction with it, or lack of interaction with it, which is the pranking, which are

152
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,650
your institutions and traditions and cultures and all that.

153
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:19,150
Once you establish a form of conditioning, which is what's called, the Greek discusses

154
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:25,210
it as being motivated by penalty, you've already polluted the landscape, meaning the spirit

155
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,590
or the mind, and it's going to be very difficult to break out of that, because the body will

156
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:35,910
drag you in another direction when the mind wants to do something else and vice versa,

157
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:41,170
because the mind and body tend to have different aspects to them as well, in terms of one's

158
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:41,590
behavior.

159
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:48,970
So the thing here to discuss or not discuss are certain things that go beyond one person's

160
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:49,350
life.

161
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,990
You see, that's why many times you hear, you know, this is short-term reality that counts,

162
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:00,990
and yes it does, because it's part of the whatever, you know, it could be part of the

163
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,530
culture, it could be part of the conditioning or whatever.

164
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:11,610
Now, within that little bit of a recitation on some perspective, the other thing to imagine

165
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,630
is the level of objectivity.

166
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,330
Now what do I say imagine it, because objectivity should be perceived.

167
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:26,150
What is being discussed at large, across the board pretty much, this is a broad brush wholesale

168
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:33,330
comment, is of very little significance and mostly untrue or deceptive or just what I

169
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,710
call a dummy load.

170
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:40,170
A dummy load is just taking up your time because you have time to be taken up, right?

171
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:46,330
So what that refers to is your universities, your media, your religions and all this, because

172
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:51,390
you basically are here to take up a place, essentially, and I'm reiterating a little

173
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:57,770
bit of last week's sort of, you're here as a place taker, because the gods are in control,

174
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,650
you're not, and you are fitting into their plan, right?

175
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,770
And they use people.

176
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:07,750
So the thing is, once you show up here, you're born into this world, whether you live for

177
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,090
30 seconds or 30 years or 300 years, you've taken a place and you're done.

178
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:17,270
So that relieves many, at least, this is not a cop-out, by the way, or running away from

179
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:17,890
a reality.

180
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,730
This is the reality that one can objectify and simplify.

181
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,090
It's very, very simple.

182
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:29,710
You know, then of course, there's the concepts of fate and the concepts of free will, yes.

183
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:37,130
But if you look at the level of ridiculousness and just the outward worthlessness of culture,

184
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,890
tradition, science, religion, legal society, all of your stuff that you're engaged with,

185
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,590
meaning surface-towing earth inhabitants, if you look at the level of quality and just

186
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,270
how absurd it is, there is no other explanation why it's that absurd.

187
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:55,730
Yes, of course, the inspiration and the planet and society itself is being guided by unseen

188
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:59,050
forces that tend to be malevolent, of course.

189
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,430
This is, by the way, these kinds of comments don't go well with academia.

190
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:13,950
This is a non-academic type thing because hopefully, if you're listening, you have not

191
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,010
suffered that system.

192
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:22,550
One way to prove how ridiculous, by the way, all of this is, when you single out academia

193
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:28,450
at large, it doesn't matter if it's American, Spanish, Russian, whatever, any part of the

194
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,230
world, it's the same.

195
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,850
It's based on the Greek system.

196
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,630
Have a discussion with an academic.

197
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:38,570
It doesn't matter of what age or professorship, tenure or whatever, and just bring up the

198
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:45,670
concept of instruction and education and bring up in conversation that anyone with more than

199
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,990
a seventh or eighth grade education has probably done irreparable damage to themselves and they

200
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,730
will all agree.

201
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:56,030
So far, everyone that I've ever mentioned this to agrees.

202
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:02,330
Now, what the moron didn't realize is that he's got or she's got double that and you

203
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,990
folks are aspiring to that because, why?

204
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:11,250
Because you've been conditioned to social rank, like in the military, they have rank

205
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:18,890
and typically, a higher ranking official or officer or serviceman typically bears the

206
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:19,750
respect of the others.

207
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,570
The others stop what they're doing to address the presence of the other as a form of respect

208
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,890
or rank or to salute them.

209
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,950
Now, you folks have been conditioned to do that the same with academics, doctors, preachers

210
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,510
and all that.

211
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:39,290
Now, whether they deserve it or not, the rank itself is deserving of respect, but this is

212
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:43,630
an overall commentary of how ridiculous it is right now.

213
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:50,410
Now, what that means in a subtle way, in a very subtle way is that if you look at the

214
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,570
worthlessness and absurdity that most people on this planet or surface-born earth inhabitants

215
00:15:54,570 --> 00:16:00,350
are engaged in, you can say all of them except for a very small few which I don't know who

216
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:05,150
they are, but when you look at how worthless it is, there is no way through a process of

217
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:11,790
evolution or growth, they could have developed a ranking system or a hierarchy or categorically

218
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,610
structuring everything that's in society on their own.

219
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,230
It's come through inspiration.

220
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:24,530
It's been developed spiritually because you cannot say, let's go look at the leaders of

221
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:29,110
a nation or the leaders of industry or the leaders of an aspect of a society, whether

222
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,710
it's scientific, legal or religious.

223
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,890
When you look at who's running that, you're going to laugh.

224
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:39,530
These people are not competent enough to be in that position.

225
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,270
So how did they get there typically?

226
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,210
So there's a force behind all of this.

227
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,490
But again, you must go back to the quality aspect of things.

228
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,170
Why is it quality?

229
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:57,110
Constantly quality because ultimately quality affects life and yes, I'm presuming if you're

230
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,390
listening to this, you're alive.

231
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,609
Low quality degrades the life force, lower quality of life.

232
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:09,510
You see higher quality things, water, air, food, thinking, behavior.

233
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,069
So that's why right now, for example, not right now but for a long time, there have been

234
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:19,130
many schools of thought that have come around in the past few thousand years that are absurd

235
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,450
and they don't really go away.

236
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:30,930
They just kind of plug into the undercurrent of society that have affected people in a

237
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:31,810
very negative way.

238
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:37,370
But it's a testament to the robustness of human life.

239
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:45,350
You can say that there's no way that you can have a species on a planet that put all of

240
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:50,870
their viable fluids that they consume in flat bottom containers exposed to light at room

241
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,230
temperature.

242
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,730
There's no way that any even semi-intelligent creature would allow that to happen but that's

243
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,310
all you see.

244
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:03,810
You wouldn't have the most dim-witted, darkest, most ignorant people leading your educational

245
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,790
institutions.

246
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:12,410
There's no way or vice versa, the least moral people leading your legal society.

247
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,110
I mean there's no way that could be so polarized like that.

248
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:24,030
There is something going on that is not being discussed but you have to go back to the quality

249
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,410
element.

250
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:30,470
An example of that, this has come a couple of times across, is when you hear about the

251
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:36,890
governments being corporations and these patriot movements and commentators and these gurus

252
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:39,370
have been talking about this for a long time, idiots, why?

253
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,610
So what if it's a corporation?

254
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:45,890
You can define it for many ways through culture and tradition and through corporate structure

255
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,390
what a corporation's function is, fine.

256
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,430
What's never being discussed is the state of that corporation.

257
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,150
Is it solvent?

258
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:54,990
Is it insolvent?

259
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:59,590
Has it been bankrupted and put into receivership and it's being run by certain trustees?

260
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,010
Yes.

261
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,190
How much discussion is on that?

262
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:07,710
And these people that profess to know the occult meaning of things or whatever, morons

263
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,710
with a capital R. Why?

264
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,710
Because it's the quality.

265
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,430
Any subject can be broached but what's the quality of that subject?

266
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:22,230
Now the last thing you want to do is disturb people who are solely meant through fate and

267
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:26,430
free will to be place keepers on this planet, meaning they're just a number.

268
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:32,730
You don't want to run into them very often or minimal, you know, you want to kind of

269
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:37,230
insulate from them because they could be, it's kind of like stepping on the tail of

270
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:38,990
a cat or a dog or something.

271
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,910
You don't want to, it depends, but you know others might like, other of these space heaters

272
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,610
I call them, why?

273
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,030
Because they take up space and give off heat.

274
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,430
They can go either way.

275
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,650
They're very unpredictable.

276
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:53,310
That's why it may be, I think it was Nietzsche who said the common man is best ruled with

277
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,350
a heavy hand.

278
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,970
You see, that's why when you start looking and understanding and comprehending what

279
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:05,390
is really going on, you see that the leaders of the people are a certain way because it's

280
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,490
deservingly so, right?

281
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:14,850
Now when you start to look at the cyclical and dynamic aspect of it historically because

282
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,410
history is not only of the past, well, what do you mean, Greek?

283
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,490
That sounds kind of absurd.

284
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:24,090
History can also be of the future, right?

285
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,410
So what does that mean?

286
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,670
Well, let's just say altruistically or with integrity, when you're observing history

287
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:35,270
of the past, it's what already happened accurately, ha, ha, ha, you're not going to get that.

288
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:40,030
But now if you're speaking of history in the future, that means that it's something that

289
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,530
will happen that will not change.

290
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,770
That's why it's considered history of the future.

291
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,790
One of the things that I like to say is when man writes history, he writes about the past.

292
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,750
When the gods write history, they write about the future.

293
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:54,910
And you notice I'm always saying gods because that's how it's always been memorialized.

294
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,930
And why am I always bringing that up?

295
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,010
Well, because maybe to cure a deficiency.

296
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:02,770
What deficiency?

297
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:03,810
Yeah, exactly.

298
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:04,610
What deficiency?

299
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,970
So just to take a little bit of a break there, I've been pontificating for about 21 minutes

300
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,410
or so according to the windup toy known as the clock.

301
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,370
Let's see what kind of comments we have here.

302
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:23,650
Got a few people in chat, anything you folks want to tangle or wrestle with?

303
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:28,370
I'm sure at this point, you guys have figured out how to pour piss out of a boot because

304
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,730
there's instructions on the heel.

305
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,010
So let's just see.

306
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,910
I don't know, not much going on there.

307
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:39,830
Let's see on the emails, by the way, just taking a break and seeing how we could incorporate

308
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:40,690
what's going on.

309
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:47,370
Again, if anyone would like to call in, let's just go to the homepage, if there is a homepage

310
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,470
here that I could access momentarily.

311
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,150
Yes, there is.

312
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:56,830
If you go to the American Freedom Radio homepage, there is on the left, if you don't see it

313
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:01,150
on the left, it's on your other left, it says call in number in red with a border on it.

314
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:05,510
And the call in number will be 218-339-8525.

315
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,850
And you're welcome to call.

316
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:15,070
And for the Skype convention, it would be contact request at UncommonSenseRadio1 at gmail.com.

317
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:20,810
That's numeric one and you're using the email for the Skype contact as well.

318
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,790
Just to throw that in because there's always much to say and also if anyone has considered

319
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:30,130
what's being said here, you're not going to make friends and it's not going to be very

320
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,070
pleasant but the thing is you must seek being pleasant.

321
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:42,390
The irony of surface-dwelling earth inhabitants is they have fallen into the, let's say whether

322
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:47,470
it's by agreement or perception or lack of, that they are quite pleased and quite comfortable

323
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,310
the way they are.

324
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,970
And when they hear things like this, it makes them very unpleased or uncomfortable.

325
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:58,330
Now just think about that for a moment, folks, because that's what will happen because it's

326
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,250
really the opposite.

327
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:06,190
Once you start behaving a behavior of thought, an economy of thought, to see where things

328
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:10,610
come from and why things are that way, you cannot be comfortable with what most people

329
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:10,950
are.

330
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,850
But well, of course, you're still taking up a place and you're still being counted as

331
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,250
a number.

332
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:26,030
But I would suggest that the reality of when the deception becomes so strong and things

333
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:33,910
become so malevolent, meaning they have to be presented as good, that the reality of one's

334
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:38,850
perception or the reality of one's thoughts can no longer be considered real once you

335
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:42,830
establish that things are the way things are.

336
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:49,430
You see, because the simplicity of this tic-tac-toe checkers mentality has nothing to do with

337
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:49,790
chess.

338
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:55,950
There is a strategy and an infrastructure that has been put in place and as a maxim that

339
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:00,890
can be established, perhaps, when something is really malevolent or very malevolent to

340
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:06,010
its core, it is always, almost always, I should say, presented as benevolent.

341
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,850
And that is where people have found their comfort, their ease, and their story.

342
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:20,930
And once you discover this incredible infrastructure that is operating under that guise, there's

343
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,750
no way you can be comfortable anymore.

344
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:24,130
Now what does that mean?

345
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:30,090
Does it mean you have to be in a panic, in a sick way, let's say, or in a way that creates

346
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,410
disease or the way that creates unrest?

347
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,210
No, not at all.

348
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:41,310
The thing is, it is an art form, ultimately, to be able to, I wouldn't say juggle, but

349
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,990
adapt and survive in such a reality.

350
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:49,010
Because ultimately, one thing that's been said through Greek-speak a while before and

351
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:52,310
often is that the Earth is a very, very violent place.

352
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:57,690
If you did not have anyone come into where you were sleeping last night and attempt to

353
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,550
rip an organ out of your body, you are very fortunate.

354
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,970
Now how many people actually think about that?

355
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:04,730
Almost none.

356
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,570
Because it shows you how asleep they are.

357
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,210
Now asleep meaning spiritually, you see.

358
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:17,870
So how can the average space eater, by the way, space eater, most surface-dwelling Earthen

359
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:22,070
Habits are space eaters because they take up space and also they give off heat, presuming

360
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,550
you're alive.

361
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:25,750
So then you have the smart ones and then the ones that are not so smart.

362
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:31,130
And the smart space eater is sort of a pun on the smart phone or the smart fridge or

363
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:31,430
whatever.

364
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:32,690
Do you get it, folks?

365
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:38,930
So how come in the military they have smart bombs but the soldiers are never called smart?

366
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:39,930
You get it?

367
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:40,850
No.

368
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:41,410
Okay.

369
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:42,010
Good.

370
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:51,330
The thing here is they have gotten to the point where they are so comfortable because

371
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,130
food, clothing and shelter is sufficing.

372
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:59,370
When you run out of food and you run out of clothes or you don't have any clothes and

373
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,050
you don't have any shelter, you become very, very agitated.

374
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,530
Yes.

375
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:08,570
And this sounds very base to most people but I assure you that is the main concern whether

376
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:11,730
it's conscious or not of most people on this planet.

377
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,610
And of course, whether it's the richest or the poorest, they need to have that.

378
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:22,410
So this is a very, very interesting time also because it doesn't seem so interesting because

379
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:28,470
people have been so dummy-loaded and apathetic that they don't realize and perceive what's

380
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:28,950
going on.

381
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:38,350
They are calling this time period, even that is of great difficulty because reckoning time

382
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,990
or the recordation of events has been lost.

383
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,010
So let's see.

384
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,850
There's some activity going on in the chat.

385
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,310
Let's see if we can enrich this with everyone.

386
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:54,230
Start from Genesis and decode the King James Bible.

387
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,570
King James Bible is just an introductory thing.

388
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:01,750
It's not scripture really but it's possible.

389
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,690
Why is everyone obsessed with decoding that book?

390
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,310
Who's everyone?

391
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,390
I don't know.

392
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,850
Is there a scriptural lottery or election?

393
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,210
You know anything from the beginning?

394
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:11,470
Okay.

395
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:15,990
That's interesting.

396
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:16,810
This comes up again.

397
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:20,850
It says, I'm not sure if anyone else got this but it seems to me it relates to many interpretations

398
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,390
and there's no right or wrong to it.

399
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,450
Perceptions sculpt reality.

400
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,310
Okay.

401
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,030
Here's interesting.

402
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,950
This is a typical surface earth inhabitant behavior.

403
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,510
Interpretation, there can only be one, not many.

404
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:40,470
There can be many versions but interpretation has to be accurate and correct.

405
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:47,310
So that's like if you have two people saying they have the truth but their stories differ,

406
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:50,210
well the possibilities are very simple.

407
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,150
Either they're both wrong or only one is correct.

408
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,890
They both can't be correct and have different stories.

409
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:58,010
So a typical surface dwelling earth inhabitant would say, that's okay.

410
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:02,610
That's his interpretation and they walk away scratching whatever part of their body because

411
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:05,310
it gives them pleasure and you go on to the next one.

412
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:12,330
So this is not, in other words, that was a perfect example of what's going on on this

413
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:12,670
planet.

414
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,830
But anyway, let's just keep going back on this chat.

415
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:21,290
It could be interesting just to throw things in because I don't plan coming around, I mean

416
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:25,090
I plan, I know that once a week the Greek will show up here and do something, a sonic

417
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:29,710
event but there's no outline or plan at this point for much because most of the introductory

418
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:32,230
stuff that has become cumulative has already happened.

419
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:39,590
So speaking of cumulative, this might be impromptu, there's going to be a short music break

420
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:44,130
here because I need to address something for about a minute and a half so what I'm going

421
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:51,130
to do is just pull up the Uncommon Radio site here just for a moment and I have a short

422
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:51,870
music break.

423
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,290
It is about a minute 25 or so.

424
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,470
So we shall see if this comes through for you guys okay.

425
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,470
One, two, three, four.

426
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:52,190
Okay, Greek is back, all right, thanks for that little bit of a respite.

427
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:57,270
Okay, so let's maybe just go back to the chat here and see what else is bouncing around

428
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:03,670
because these are all solo events but they intend to be solo but not always have to

429
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:03,890
be.

430
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,350
I can't read Greek or Hebrew as another one.

431
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,830
You see, I want to know what is preserved in scripture but the King James Version is

432
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,150
a joke.

433
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,930
That's right, it is.

434
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:13,570
But you got to realize that it's a relic to the ignorant.

435
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,010
Latin is vulgar or vulgate.

436
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:25,910
That's where you get, by the way, vulgar that if Satan had an energy drink, it would

437
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:30,750
be petroleum and if he had a book or a language, it would be Latin and then English of course.

438
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,210
There must be hints in the KJV.

439
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,110
No, not really.

440
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,850
There's a reason that will be discussed.

441
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:42,790
Here's folks, for anyone coming across this by the way, of course, if you're listening

442
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:47,270
for more than a few minutes and you're not totally befuddled, you'll realize that what's

443
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:51,190
being discussed through Greek speaker on common radio or even just being here at AFR

444
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:55,610
is very unusual in contrast to everything else that's being discussed anywhere else.

445
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:56,450
Why?

446
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,170
Think about it.

447
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,450
There's no aspiration to come out and speak publicly.

448
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,490
The only reason is because no one else is saying anything like it, not even close.

449
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,270
Now, of course, some people will say, yes, this person brought up something like that

450
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:12,990
or like this and I'm like, well, now you want to go through sifting through poop to

451
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,170
eat undigested corn?

452
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:21,550
Let's just be, let's prepare a really good meal and serve it for two hours once a week.

453
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:29,210
And with that said, privately, anyone can, or Skype or privately, an email would be private,

454
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:36,590
let's say, instead of putting it publicly on a chat at Uncommon Radio, www.uncommonradio.com

455
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:40,710
to contact the Greek and I would suggest that 90% of the comments are scriptural.

456
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:41,050
Why?

457
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,870
Questions about the Bible, for example, why?

458
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:48,030
Why can't they, why can't people just go pick up a King James and realize that they've

459
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:48,610
got it, right?

460
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,250
Because it's not.

461
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:54,130
Why can't they just go down to the church or the synagogue or the mosque and talk to

462
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,570
the morons, I'm sorry, the people there or someone that's a graduate from the school

463
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,790
of divinity or Bible college?

464
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,290
Yeah, you guessed it.

465
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,570
Because they ain't got nothing.

466
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:04,470
It's a prank.

467
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:10,050
And there's a time period now that's coming around, actually it'll be, this is the end

468
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:15,170
of a seven year period to start another seven period next spring, that things will start

469
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:22,170
to be, let's say, resurgent in people's mind, rediscovered, yeah, of things that tend to

470
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,550
be real, folks.

471
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:28,990
So I just want to bring that up that, yes, we will be found in bad taste to discuss things

472
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,510
like scripture, but there will be a very strong desire.

473
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:38,810
So okay, so basically there's not much, there's still, folks, the people in chat are still

474
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,890
expressing that desire.

475
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:47,010
And by the way, this thing about alien is very interesting, there's, when you say words

476
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:53,690
like the devil or hell or heaven or alien or Jesus, I like to use that word, J-E-S-U-S

477
00:32:53,690 --> 00:33:02,350
or G-O-D or whatever, you will find that 99.999999% of people on the planet, when they get a stimulus

478
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:08,570
that they've gotten from the entertainment industry from that, alright, or some pagan

479
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,770
iconography, right?

480
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:15,690
So when aliens are brought up, you think of little green men, when you think of J-E-S-U-S,

481
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:20,470
you think of a guy nailed to a cross wearing a diaper or a guy with long hair, or you might,

482
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:25,270
you know, when you hear about the devil, of course he's got, he's red, bifurcated tongue,

483
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:30,250
a pitchfork and he's in fire, you know, none of that is true at all, well, not, well, hmm.

484
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,090
Okay, let's just say what's true.

485
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:38,090
What can be accessed and memorialized about that subject, right?

486
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:46,350
Nothing at all at this point that people are engaging in en masse has much or anything

487
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,990
to do with what's been memorialized about it.

488
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,750
Now, what does that mean?

489
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:52,630
Very, very simple.

490
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:58,770
Let's say you were to visit this planet from somewhere else and everyone was asleep, you

491
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,690
were at home, you know, the streets were empty and the libraries were open and all the, you

492
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:08,670
had access to the internet and all this other stuff that people consider the depositories

493
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:13,469
of all their information, and you were able to absorb and download all of it and review

494
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:18,830
it and be conscious of it, and then you went into the respective fields or had respective

495
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:23,530
discussions regarding all the information that's memorialized with the people, you will find

496
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:27,469
that seemingly no one on this planet knows any of it, okay?

497
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:33,090
Now, I'm not, the only thing that matters here is that you turn on the TV and watch

498
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:39,130
Hollywood movies and go to their religious, ridiculous religious rites, and that's what

499
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:43,130
everyone thinks has been memorialized in their society.

500
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,750
Think about that for a moment.

501
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,570
Actually don't think about it, you might get yourself in trouble.

502
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:55,530
So what is happening or what has happened is the influence of the human mind from a

503
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:01,150
secular perspective, meaning on this planet or this earth, has always been done in mass,

504
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:04,870
like in the ancient world it was at the city gates, people were gathered and they were

505
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:08,990
separated left and right, you know, men and women, and discussed that way.

506
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:13,470
That's why there was a little bit of a background discussion about why long hair is unlawful.

507
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:18,390
I'll just reiterate this because they thought the term lawful was sort of strong because

508
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:24,710
they were thinking, of course, of the conditioning they have from legal, because typically if

509
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:30,730
something, in a society of idiots, if someone says, well, that's illegal, you are, of course,

510
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:38,150
you get an impulse that you're going to get some form of punishment, you see, by another

511
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,890
group of morons.

512
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:44,370
But the thing here, lawful is like measuring something, it's a form of measurement, like

513
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,670
it's typically used in geometry and mathematics.

514
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:53,450
Like if an object, a geometric object has three sides, it's lawful to call it a triangle,

515
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:58,230
it's not lawful to call it a square, it's measurable as such by description and by measurement.

516
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:04,310
Now why are laws given, what are called, there is no such thing as natural law, by the way,

517
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:09,550
there is a hierarchy of laws, and when law comes from the gods, it's about how to exist

518
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,810
within the environment that you are existing in, known as the earth.

519
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:20,450
And going back to the long hair, years ago when people were gathered publicly, typically,

520
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:25,190
not always, but typically, most of the time, the men were separated from the women and

521
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:29,310
children and the discussion was given that way, or the information was presented.

522
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:33,990
And typically, this was done by the elders of the society and their agents and people

523
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:38,210
that helped them, and at a distance, if you saw someone with long hair, they went over

524
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:45,950
to the woman's side, and facial hair and short hair went over to the men's side, right?

525
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:52,130
So when, let's say, a man with long hair was facing backwards, he was from the back, let's

526
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:56,590
say, told, go over to the women, turns around, it's pretty scary to see it's a guy, so he

527
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,390
brings shame on himself and shame on the elder.

528
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:05,070
Now, the level of shame that is experienced by humanity at this point, this would seem

529
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:09,430
almost nothing, like, for example, the Greek is ashamed to be called human at this point,

530
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,070
and anyone that's paying attention should be.

531
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:17,770
So what's interesting about this is when you separate yourself from it mentally, you don't

532
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,790
have to do it physically, you just have to insulate yourself.

533
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:26,110
You see, that's why, for example, you're able to have electrical wires that could kill you

534
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:29,130
running through the walls, because they have insulation.

535
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:34,510
It doesn't mean because AC electricity can kill you, you have to pull all the wires out

536
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,670
and not use it.

537
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,030
There's an interesting aspect here.

538
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:42,810
There's a level of maturity that one has to understand that, you know, is it your fault

539
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:43,390
that you're here?

540
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:43,750
No.

541
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,270
Is it a fault to be here?

542
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:45,650
No.

543
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,950
But is everything here pretty much faulty?

544
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:48,510
Yes.

545
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:49,770
So what do you do?

546
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:54,890
I mean, just kind of figure it out as you go or don't, right, which is now you've joined

547
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,310
the rest of the majority of the people.

548
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:59,010
Now, let's go, just go back to chat here.

549
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,950
Let's see what else people want to throw.

550
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,170
Okay, are they marshmallows or bricks?

551
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:03,690
Let's see.

552
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:11,090
Okay, well, I don't know, it's just kind of a little bit of chit-chat here and there.

553
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:13,450
Let's see what's in the email.

554
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:22,630
We got, hmm, we got an email just five minutes ago.

555
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:23,930
Let's just read it.

556
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:24,570
I'll be anonymous.

557
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:25,710
Hi, Greek.

558
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:29,110
As for food, shelter, and clothing, I was thinking about the people in North Korea.

559
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,110
How do you see this?

560
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:33,770
Not so much of the current political situation, but the people living there.

561
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:38,770
We're not different from them, but their situation is sort of a great show.

562
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,930
Oh, don't say it's a great show, but thank you anyway.

563
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:41,870
I know what you mean.

564
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,230
I'm uncomfortable.

565
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,290
Yes, I know.

566
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,770
Now and then, I piss them off.

567
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:48,390
Okay, great.

568
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:49,490
That's fine.

569
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:54,590
Yeah, a show is a deception, by the way, but that's why I called it Sonic Events.

570
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:59,330
North Korea, that's been heavily propagandized, and hey, you know what I might just do, by

571
00:38:59,330 --> 00:38:59,950
the way, folks?

572
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,410
I might just read the news like everybody else does.

573
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,890
What do you think about that?

574
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:08,670
Could you imagine having some Greek speak with the news?

575
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:14,310
You know, you folks, have you ever had the news explained to you, by the way?

576
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,050
No?

577
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:20,490
Probably not, but that would be kind of distasteful to talk about politics, and typically, people

578
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:29,090
of poor character enthrall themselves in politics and try to learn to define what good and poor

579
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:31,990
character is, and you might find that.

580
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:36,830
I'm not saying the people that are in politics are, well, that's a whole other species now,

581
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:41,650
but those that you consider people, whatever, when you look at these, quote-unquote, political

582
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:47,250
commentators, poor character, I mean, but nonetheless, if how can poor character recognize

583
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:47,890
poor character?

584
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:53,670
You need a contrast, but yeah, the North Korean aspect is not what you're told.

585
00:39:53,670 --> 00:40:00,030
I think there's a certain rationale that one can use on this planet, and there are

586
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,290
simple rationales.

587
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:08,230
The real stuff is never going on, or most of the time, I should say, is not going on

588
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,010
where it's noisy.

589
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:12,350
It's always where it's quiet.

590
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:20,910
If you look at where the noise, now, I kind of threatened to read the news, so right now,

591
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,810
there's some noise, by the way, folks, this springtime, and they're trying to plant in

592
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,770
people's minds something about violence.

593
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:32,970
Remember, spring is a time of planting and starting, and by the way, that is the time

594
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:36,030
traditionally when the leaders go to war.

595
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:41,370
You look at most wars are typically enacted in the field, and cessation of hostilities

596
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:44,970
typically in the fall, but they usually start in the spring, so the timing for something

597
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:51,510
like that, what's known as the United States of America going with, I guess, to some kind

598
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:57,810
of conflict in North Korea is correct, but you have to realize there's many aspects.

599
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:02,750
I think if anyone's actually listened to what's been said here before, I've explained the

600
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,710
military and its hierarchy as it is right now, very simple.

601
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:13,510
Imagine nine-year-olds with a trillion in debit card, and it's a debit card, not at

602
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,570
this point, because they already have access to the credit.

603
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:22,170
They were shown how to work with metal and make projectiles and armaments and weave fabrics

604
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,850
and do all this other stuff.

605
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:30,990
Typically the position of the people in power in the military structure are brought in and

606
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:36,010
told basically, this is your position, this is what you get, and anything else you can

607
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,270
steal, just don't get caught.

608
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:43,650
How else would, quote-unquote, proxy, quote-unquote, terrorist armies all through the world get

609
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:50,350
20,000 shoulder-fired missile rockets, 4 million rounds of ammunition, and all this other stuff

610
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:51,110
made in the USA?

611
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:52,430
I mean, how do you get that?

612
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,550
I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.

613
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:58,670
Of course it does make a lot of sense, but no one cares.

614
00:41:59,190 --> 00:41:59,710
That's the thing.

615
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:05,190
North Korea is like, let's just say it this way, it's kind of a repository for all things

616
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,570
secret, because if you hide it there and someone says it's in North Korea, they'll

617
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,090
laugh at you because look at the news.

618
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:17,310
Anyway, it's sort of ridiculous, the entire thing, but I might one day threaten to read

619
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:17,710
the news.

620
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:22,790
That would be an interesting thing and explain it, but what is to be explained is really

621
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,230
the truth of the matter, and it's very simple.

622
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:33,770
Let's just see, how can you insulate or isolate yourself from them when they are all you essentially,

623
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:38,090
you cease to exist instead of categorizing, prejudicing, separating yourself from those

624
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:38,650
on your thinker?

625
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,770
You do that, you seem insane.

626
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:48,430
Okay, I think, no, this is, I think maybe they're on the wrong chat, okay, that's fine.

627
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:58,650
Let's just see here, but thank you for that, E, I'll just say, who sent the email, but

628
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:00,830
there's much to do, much to discuss.

629
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:04,990
I believe that, and I believe meaning it's sometime in the future, but I would state

630
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:12,890
that the level of seriousness, or I should say, why, when I say seriousness, because

631
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:17,770
the depth, the history, and the forming of the subject, and the informing of the subject

632
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:26,690
will be done on many, quote unquote, subjects regarding the body, scripture, nature, and

633
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:27,470
things like that.

634
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:32,530
But when you are speaking publicly, most of it will be found to be in bad taste.

635
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:36,370
Now, I keep saying this for a reason, which I'll explain sometime in the future.

636
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:43,570
When you're speaking in public, at the public at large, you're, in other words, the more

637
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:48,790
people you speak to, the more superficial the content, the fewer, the more specific.

638
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:56,570
Like for example, let's just use the medical analogy, typically, if you're discussing,

639
00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:00,930
let's say, a pandemic, or the general health of the people, it has to be very general.

640
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:06,850
But when you have someone on an examination situation, you can get very specific, because

641
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:11,830
now the person can be discerned by their height and specific condition.

642
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:18,750
So as one addresses a smaller group, the information can be more specific.

643
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:19,790
It's very simple.

644
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:23,610
Otherwise, it begins to sound pedantic, and whatever.

645
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:29,150
That's why it's so ridiculous just to go back and hearken back to the university system,

646
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:36,370
which is not faulting any country's university system, but basically it's the Greek system

647
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:37,590
throughout the entire world.

648
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:43,870
It is so bizarre and ridiculous, because that notion that I just brought up, of speaking

649
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:48,390
at the public at large, is what these idiots are doing in university or higher education,

650
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:51,870
and the people are buying into it, because they want that rank.

651
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:54,210
They want to be addressed with the social rank.

652
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:56,030
So I don't know.

653
00:44:56,210 --> 00:45:02,910
It's kind of an interesting thing on, what is it, sadomasochism, where you enjoy putting

654
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:07,450
pain on others, and also I think the other one is where you actually enjoy pain being

655
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:08,330
put on yourself.

656
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:16,830
It requires that kind of balance in that entire system, and that's easy to prove.

657
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:21,970
We'll get into, I think, in the future, a little bit more on how the education system

658
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:25,710
works and perhaps suggestions on how it can be done in a very short period of time.

659
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:32,070
But in the past Sonic episodes, there was one on the education system, I don't remember

660
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:37,750
which number it was or whatever, it was on the ONG, or it's just short for tele in the

661
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:45,410
Greek, and it gave quite a few points on that, and it's a good foundation for comprehending

662
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:46,950
what's going on on this planet.

663
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:52,650
It is not a social commentary for any national group, because they're idiots wherever you

664
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:53,710
go at this point.

665
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:55,670
And that's a technical term, by the way.

666
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:05,990
Certain terms have been used as pejoratives or slang in a negative way, and the words

667
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:06,670
have been captured.

668
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:11,330
Just like the opposite, a word like nice, which means foolish, stupid, and senseless,

669
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:13,630
has been used in a complimentary form.

670
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:16,830
Have a nice day, you're a nice person, or that wasn't nice.

671
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:22,990
So something that is not very good has turned into something good, and something that is

672
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:27,770
technical and accurate to explain something has been viewed as a put-down or whatever.

673
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:31,050
So again, topsy-turvy, everything's backwards.

674
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:36,390
Now I've been here for almost an hour and kind of looking at the chat, trying to get

675
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:41,150
some input to reiterate this is around the ninth time the Greek is coming around and

676
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:44,130
always bringing up the same points consistently.

677
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:51,890
The reason for that, again, which I've given, is this is a pursuit of quality, not quantity.

678
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:58,630
Of course, like I said earlier, I could threaten to read the news, because you have to realize,

679
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:04,730
folks, when you get something like the news or an education system or a religion or a science,

680
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:08,590
it has to accommodate the mindset, otherwise no one will come.

681
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,390
So it's done backwards.

682
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:18,750
You've heard of like polls and investigation or seeing demographics, sorry, that's the

683
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:25,010
term I was using before, especially I would say 20th century and now, but prior to that

684
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:28,290
it was a little less available to do it on a mass scale like it is now.

685
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:35,250
When education, religion, science, news, things that are put out to mass groups either to

686
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:41,510
subscribe to or to just be broadcast over them, they're carefully examined and they

687
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:47,130
examine them and then they custom tailor a show or a body of work to put out so they

688
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:51,810
know that a great majority, a great majority in this case would be 30% or more or around

689
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:56,950
30% is outstanding success, by the way, for them to grab onto.

690
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:02,330
Now that's why one time and more than one time and often I said, you cannot have proper

691
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:08,530
education on this planet at this time because if it was done on a mass scale, no one would

692
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:12,550
go because it would not be recognized as education at all.

693
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:18,350
Now this is kind of a difficult thing to fathom at a glance, but you need to think about that

694
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:18,810
for a minute.

695
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:23,370
That's how far and deviated these deviants are.

696
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:28,490
A deviant is just you've gone away so far and this is basically the planet at large.

697
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:33,970
Now there is a lot of still, there is a good market, a good healthy market by the way in

698
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:39,310
both media and alternative media, well I should say alternative media to go after the power

699
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:44,070
base, you know, Illuminati, you've got bad leaders, the bankers or whatever, the drug

700
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:47,410
companies and the genetic, you know, all this other stuff.

701
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:53,330
That is a very good market to go after because people like to hear about that kind of stuff.

702
00:48:53,850 --> 00:49:00,290
So that's just a sideline, maybe sarcastic comment about what's going on in alternative

703
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:00,850
media.

704
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:09,470
So this aspect of accommodating the audience is almost the maximum.

705
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:10,930
It has to be done.

706
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:14,670
Now something like Greek speak, is it accommodating anyone?

707
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:15,070
Nope.

708
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:20,930
Maybe because I don't know anyone called anyone, but let's just say it's just being said because

709
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:24,750
maybe, maybe, just maybe it helps balance out the equation.

710
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,290
It doesn't matter even if it doesn't.

711
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:27,130
What's the equation?

712
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:32,390
You got a big pile, you know, one on one side and you got to balance it out with a little

713
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:34,670
bit of something that's not made of that.

714
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:44,230
So anyway, I wouldn't say it's a really sad situation because you have to look at everything

715
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:50,490
that has come and where you're going to go and by the way, it's not sad because why is

716
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:54,450
it that people are allowed to discover the past, but they're not allowed to discover

717
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,050
the future?

718
00:49:55,810 --> 00:50:00,350
That's another part of the conditioning you've been, let's see, what is the dummy load when

719
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:01,430
you talk about the future?

720
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:11,050
The typical dummy load is, oh, you've got time machines and you have psychics and how

721
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:12,830
much of that is ever accurate?

722
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:20,010
There are ways to look at what's called prophecy and things to come that come from a higher

723
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:23,930
vantage point and it is taboo to understand or know them.

724
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:30,450
By the way, folks, just to bring up what's taboo, I recently, again, because the discussion

725
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:39,530
here typically goes back to the biblical text, go do a search on what's called YouTube, that

726
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:40,930
ridiculous thing called YouTube.

727
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:44,430
It doesn't have to be, but it just is.

728
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:51,930
Put in the King James Bible is inaccurate and you're going to get, obviously, videos

729
00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:56,750
that accommodate that query on the proper subject matter and then you're going to get

730
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:02,970
the opposite and that the King James Version is truly the inspiration of God's word and

731
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:04,470
this or that or God.

732
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:13,370
There you're going to see both academic and non-academics, the academics less than the

733
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:18,630
non-academics trying to present a rational presentation on how King James Version of

734
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:23,530
the Bible is not even scripture at all, maybe by association somehow.

735
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:27,390
You get a little bit of the story, but most of the information is lost.

736
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:33,350
Then you go to the other side on the religious side and it's just a circus.

737
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:40,910
If you have detoxed, if you've ever had the misfortune to be brought up in that form of

738
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:45,970
culture, by the way, you know what I mean, like the Bible Belt of America, or you might

739
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:50,990
have had the extreme misfortune to be in the belt buckle of that Bible Belt.

740
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:59,070
You will see the other videos contrasting that and the level of ridiculousness and absurdity

741
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:02,410
cannot be explained, it needs to be experienced.

742
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:07,930
These religious types talking about King James Bible is the true word of God is what they

743
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:10,290
say, which is there's no such thing as God, by the way.

744
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:11,270
It's a plurality.

745
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,710
So this is just a comic show.

746
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:19,130
And by the way, when I say imagine a comedy that you can be killed in, this is how these

747
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:20,030
people operate.

748
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:25,070
They enjoy it because remember, humanity or surface-dwelling earth inhabitants have

749
00:52:25,070 --> 00:52:31,510
legitimized savagery to the point now where it is predictable and unpredictable, both the

750
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:37,430
same. So you have to be aware of the ridiculousness and that they are typically

751
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:37,990
dangerous.

752
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:45,070
So the reason I brought that up is because when you go and do any kind of information,

753
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:51,670
you have to be very aware that there is some good stuff out there if you can sift through

754
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:56,810
it and discern it. But at the same time, based on these protocols that these Internet

755
00:52:56,810 --> 00:53:03,950
platforms have, you have to guard yourself and be even smarter than they think you are

756
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:06,110
to be able to see through it and be efficient.

757
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:10,330
There's not much really going on with the Internet, unfortunately, because it is subject

758
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:13,090
to human input and it is accommodating.

759
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:14,350
Yes, you got it.

760
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:19,250
A planet full of yes, starts with an M, O, R, O and S.

761
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:23,010
Yes, correct. So what do you do?

762
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:29,370
Again, set yourself apart and do some good study, do some good research and perhaps

763
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:32,690
there'll be some sanity through that.

764
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:38,510
And again, folks, remember, it's springtime up here on this part of the world and this

765
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:43,510
is a time where things are quiet and things of dynamics are being put in place to

766
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:44,410
manifest later.

767
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:50,670
So let's just see how that pans out for this year, which is the end of a seven year

768
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:55,550
period, which another seven year period will be starting next spring and another hour

769
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:57,090
will be starting in a few minutes.

770
00:53:57,270 --> 00:53:59,570
So enjoy the break, folks, and we'll see you on the other side.

771
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:07,210
Greetings, everyone, and this is the Greek again, this is the second hour of Solo

772
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:08,230
episode nine.

773
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:13,490
And I just want to thank the two people who just sent in an email because having some

774
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:14,910
direction is always good.

775
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:22,970
And let's see, first initial E, again, read, thanks, a great sonic event.

776
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:26,170
I like that correction, by the way, now that it wasn't incorrect before.

777
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:28,030
And I would like to get into that email.

778
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:29,550
And there's another one by a fellow journalist.

779
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:31,710
A fellow named W, first initial.

780
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:37,590
And before we get into that, I would just like to do a little bit of just to remind

781
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:40,230
everyone that you are listening to American Freedom Radio.

782
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:42,710
And perhaps I believe it is on the home page.

783
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:49,230
There is a patron or Patreon site that they have for some form of message that they

784
00:54:49,230 --> 00:54:52,370
have and also, I believe, for donations and other things.

785
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:56,630
There might have been more specifics to that.

786
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:57,910
I think it has escaped the mind.

787
00:54:57,910 --> 00:55:03,890
But you can find the Patreon American Freedom Radio aspect and do give that a

788
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:04,690
whirl, would you?

789
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:11,710
So and this is also what's called Uncommon Radio, typically known as Greek

790
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:13,870
speak or Uncommon Sense Radio.

791
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:19,210
And you could find and contact the Greek on the Internet platform or the website

792
00:55:19,210 --> 00:55:25,790
known as www.uncommonradio.com if you would like to email there as well.

793
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:30,010
And, of course, be on the lookout for perhaps announcements of other projects.

794
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:35,830
So, again, I just wanted to thank the two people who are giving some direction to

795
00:55:35,830 --> 00:55:42,130
this, because before I kind of preface, when the greater the number of people that

796
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:47,470
you have, let's say, that are being addressed, the less specific the topic is.

797
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:52,030
And I hope that gives a little bit of insight on why you have such a superficial

798
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:56,790
nature, almost to the point of deception, when you look at things like political

799
00:55:56,790 --> 00:56:04,090
speeches, the news, public religious diatribes, you know, sort of things like

800
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:07,770
that, you know, I mean, anything that's given to the public, the reason why wars

801
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:08,610
are started, you know.

802
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:13,010
But as you get more into the specific aspects or smaller groups, then they're

803
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:18,790
classified based on their social rank and what position they have and on need to

804
00:56:18,790 --> 00:56:19,470
know basis.

805
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:25,570
So from that perspective, there's, you know, it's complicated, not complicated, I

806
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:26,010
should say.

807
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:32,970
It would be more than just checkers or tic-tac-toe, which is basically given at

808
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:34,770
the public at large.

809
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:38,730
So I want to go into a little bit of what he said.

810
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:44,270
Well, as for news, is it not important to have a bit, in quotations, of a sense of

811
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:47,810
what is going on, what the trends are, what people are talking or talking about?

812
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:52,890
Or if I don't, I will become an alien or outsider and whatever.

813
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:56,230
And basically being familiar with other people.

814
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:57,010
Yes, absolutely.

815
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:02,410
That is important, because just to harken back to the biblical text, when, you

816
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:05,410
know, people find out, you know, I've had comments like, oh, that King James

817
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:07,550
version is rubbish or that King James version is bad.

818
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:08,350
I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

819
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:09,910
But you don't have to harp on it.

820
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:12,170
I'll harp on it, you know, publicly.

821
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:15,970
But you still need to know it because that's how you engage people in

822
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:17,930
conversation, at least, you know.

823
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:22,430
But the thing is, the more you study how bad it is or how inaccurate it is, you

824
00:57:22,430 --> 00:57:26,450
almost cannot have a conversation regarding the truth of any matter with

825
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:29,790
someone who's just familiar with that document, just the same way with the

826
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:36,530
news. For example, when you bring up what's called news stories, whether

827
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:40,390
they're political, geopolitical and typically political, yes, and some

828
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:43,110
scientific, which is junk, by the way.

829
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:47,170
And the irony of it, again, is that science just means knowledge.

830
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:51,150
And you're actually going to get the opposite when you go there.

831
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:52,350
You're going to get conditioning.

832
00:57:53,090 --> 00:57:58,790
And the public science information that's put out has to be approved by

833
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:00,390
Hollywood at this point.

834
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:01,690
It's backwards.

835
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:06,270
You know, they don't put things in university textbooks unless Hollywood

836
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:10,530
approves. I know that sounds ridiculous, but think about that for a little

837
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,470
and we will revisit that in the future.

838
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:17,270
I know it sounds like a very convoluted statement, but I assure you it is

839
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:21,650
true. And not only Hollywood, but, you know, that type of performance

840
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:24,550
outlet. OK, so.

841
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:30,410
Very important there. And then this email also continues with food, clothes

842
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:33,330
and clothing shelter very much on their mind.

843
00:58:33,370 --> 00:58:34,490
I'm just paraphrasing here.

844
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:36,730
And cleaning products should be outside the house.

845
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:40,490
Why? OK, well, let's just address that real quick.

846
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:43,010
Food, clothing and shelter for obvious reasons.

847
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:47,550
You know, the most obvious one is that humans are not animals or people or

848
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:52,250
space eaters are not animals, because most animals are ready for ready to

849
00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:53,370
go into the environment.

850
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:58,230
They actually come with feathers and scales and fur and they're ready to go.

851
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:00,390
Some animals are ready to go.

852
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:01,590
I mean, really ready to go.

853
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:03,030
They're up and running in a few hours.

854
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:10,330
When men and women are brought into this world as infants, they can

855
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:14,750
easily be exposed and, you know, you can there's no aspect of evolution

856
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:17,370
there. Evolution was to evolve the species.

857
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:19,270
Why are you lacking all those things?

858
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:23,690
But either way, food, clothing and shelter has its importance.

859
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:26,230
And that's been gone over and will be gone over again.

860
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:30,570
Now, very simply regarding cleaning products outside the house, if a very

861
00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:34,250
simple way to sort of illustrate or demonstrate this, if you've ever been to

862
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:39,190
one of these things called a supermarket or a large grocery store, they have

863
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:42,670
various aisles. You know, you go down, let's say the bread aisle or the pastry

864
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:43,730
aisle. It smells like bread.

865
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,350
You know, you go down, let's say other aisles.

866
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:48,310
It tends to have a smell, you know, near the vegetables.

867
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:50,510
Now you go down the cleaning aisle.

868
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:54,350
It's almost as if there's a wafting or a cloud that hits you like a wall of

869
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:55,190
chemical smell.

870
00:59:55,870 --> 00:59:57,290
All right. You ever notice that?

871
00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:02,930
OK, so the same thing when you have chemicals grouped up in the house,

872
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:06,950
chemicals, I should say solutions or things like that that are especially have

873
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:11,610
fragrance or outgas, surfactants and chemicals that are used for cleaning or

874
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:12,770
disinfecting or whatever.

875
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:16,770
It's not going to be as prominent, but it's still there.

876
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:20,710
Just like, for example, if you keep all of these cleaning materials, especially the

877
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:25,970
commercial, the available ones in a closet or a drawer, you'll notice when you

878
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:28,630
open it, you get a wafting or a strong smell of that.

879
01:00:28,690 --> 01:00:30,970
Now, that's constantly outgassing into the environment.

880
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:35,790
Simple solution for that is make a little chemical box, chemical cabinet,

881
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:37,710
chemicals shed outside.

882
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:41,530
And if you are in what's called an apartment situation where you don't have that

883
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:45,530
ability, obviously you want to keep it to those things to an absolute minimum.

884
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:50,330
Keep them near a window or something where you have ventilation.

885
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:52,010
This is no cause for alarm.

886
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:58,410
This is just a very subtle but general comment on the toxicity of, you know, again,

887
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:01,230
because everything has become that way now.

888
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:08,430
So I would suggest that at some point, the most minor things can have a major

889
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:13,790
impact because you're going to be breathing those things day in and day out when

890
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:15,210
you're in the in the space.

891
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:19,550
Now, I wanted to go on to the other email, but just to give a little bit of a

892
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:24,590
demonstration that the part of this email started off with knowing about the news.

893
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:25,790
So I'm going to just do that.

894
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:29,830
I'm going to go to what's this particular news.

895
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:31,190
I have a few of them bookmarked there.

896
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:35,410
They range. I shouldn't I don't I really don't want to promote them because they're

897
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:39,090
moronic. But there's one that has been around for a long time.

898
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:43,530
It's really idiotic because it accommodates people very well.

899
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:48,750
The other one is more of a military one, which hearkens to the cartoon channel at

900
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:59,810
best. There is another one that's a pretty decent because they tend to review, you

901
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:03,550
know, I'm embarrassed to even observe them on my own in private.

902
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:06,670
I mean, I almost if I if I leave it on for too long, I feel like I have to take a

903
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:09,550
shower. But let's just go look at some of these stories here.

904
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:11,390
I'm going to pull up the news.

905
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:19,130
And this one here is the title is 53 percent favor U.S.

906
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:20,730
military attack on North Korea.

907
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:24,290
All right. So you click on that and you get Fox News poll.

908
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:26,250
Fifty three percent favor military action.

909
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:27,910
Stop North Korea nukes program.

910
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:34,730
Now, you notice how this is really convoluted and how it gets twisted very

911
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:40,410
quickly. There's a poll of 53 percent favor military action to stop North Korea

912
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:45,310
nukes program. Now, if you I'm not even going to get into this because this just

913
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:48,410
shows you how just evil and demonic it is.

914
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:55,750
When you imagine a spread, you have a jar like you have jams and peanut butters and

915
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:58,030
things. But this one is a jar says evil and demonic.

916
01:02:58,030 --> 01:03:01,190
And you stick a knife in there and you spread it over a piece of moldy bread.

917
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:05,530
And the moldy bread would be the people and the evil and demonic is the story.

918
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:07,350
And you just have it all combined.

919
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:08,910
Now, why is it like that?

920
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:13,810
Because when you look at 53 percent favor military action to stop North Korea nukes

921
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:20,510
program. Now, if if you put this story out into public, most morons will say 53

922
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:22,750
percent of the people want to go to war with Korea.

923
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:26,410
That's not what it says. It's to stop North Korea nukes program, you see very

924
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:30,010
specific. And also, they don't tell you 53 percent of what?

925
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:38,410
Margin, you know who how many people was it, 10 people, so they it was five and a

926
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:40,730
third or was it 100 people?

927
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:45,510
Do you see that because evil comes in the form of deception, others evil in the

928
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:46,650
form of outright destruction.

929
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:51,670
But this is just the typical evil that people are, which is opposite of good, by

930
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:53,210
the way. Let's go to the next story.

931
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:59,370
My favorite ones are the ones that are the well, not even favorite.

932
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:04,210
Anything has to do with the economy, because no one ever mentions that it's a

933
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:07,550
credit based economy and the history of it and how it really works.

934
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:09,270
And it's not debt, by the way.

935
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:12,270
So anyway, here's an attempt to go through the news.

936
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:13,670
And I just can't. Because why?

937
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:17,250
Because I don't not only do I not feel accommodated by what they're putting out,

938
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:19,490
but it is just repugnant.

939
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:23,130
And if you look up what the word repugnant means, you will understand.

940
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:30,890
And when you understand how the majority of the people eat this up literally with

941
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:35,150
their minds, what kind of a character do you think they have?

942
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:37,410
So, again, is it subjective?

943
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:39,410
I would say most of what I just said is subjective.

944
01:04:39,930 --> 01:04:41,830
But what I said, can it be objectified?

945
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:46,130
Absolutely can be by just the quality of the accuracy of what's being said.

946
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:47,430
So, yes, you can.

947
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:50,190
The news there. Sorry about that.

948
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:51,490
I try to go into it.

949
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:55,550
I can't. It's just yeah, it's just very, very bad.

950
01:04:57,090 --> 01:05:01,110
It's a very bad taste essentially across the board.

951
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:02,670
Yes, it's really piss poor.

952
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:05,790
So with that said, thank you again for the message.

953
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:09,970
And the other one here, let's just see before we go on to something regarding the

954
01:05:09,970 --> 01:05:13,750
other one is we have a young Matthew is how about clothing?

955
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:18,030
You mentioned that you should not buy shoes you can't run in and wear clothing made

956
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:19,050
from only one material.

957
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:21,430
Anything else you would like to say about clothing?

958
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:22,950
Yeah, it should fit. It should be comfortable.

959
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:27,650
The ancient Greeks said fashion should be made irrelevant because the human body

960
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:32,350
doesn't change. Why should the way clothing looks change?

961
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:36,810
Well, I guess that's an aesthetic, you know, and the aspect of it is it's a

962
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:41,550
distraction. You folks, anybody out there old enough to remember the polyester

963
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:46,150
patterned bell bottoms and wide lapel shirts from the 1970s?

964
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:50,230
There's a reason why that was going on is something called the crowd mentality.

965
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:54,250
No one knew. No one thought it looked good, but because they were told it did, it

966
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:59,090
was. And anyway, so let's just see.

967
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:05,570
We'll go to the the other message here that was sent from first

968
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:10,310
initial W. Greek, is there anything you can discuss regarding the ocean, how wave

969
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:14,870
tides behave, water gods, uncharted areas, recently discovered giant underwater

970
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:16,950
waves and or anything else?

971
01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:19,970
We're not being told about this vast liquid covering the earth.

972
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:23,450
Oh, you're not being told much other than it's wet and it covers most of the

973
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:27,830
earth. But here's the interesting part, is that the earth is mostly water.

974
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:33,070
And if you've heard me in the past discuss the

975
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:38,470
just use this as an allegory or something to compare to that, both in terms of

976
01:06:38,470 --> 01:06:43,030
the educational system wrestling with creationism versus evolution, they're both

977
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:47,450
incorrect. In other words, the way that evolution is structured and the information to

978
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:48,970
back it up is incorrect, clearly.

979
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:53,570
And also when there's discussing creation from the Christian perspective, that's

980
01:06:53,570 --> 01:06:58,010
completely incorrect. It doesn't even come out of the text that they they allege to

981
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:02,210
subscribe to. Now, many people might say, well, yes, it does.

982
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:06,490
Well, yes. But could it be that if you take something and twist it out of context, like

983
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:11,430
attorneys do, for example, that it no longer resembles that what it came from when

984
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:16,510
you think about it? So discussing water is something that I did

985
01:07:16,510 --> 01:07:18,070
in private on one.

986
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:21,730
I think it's an Ocelli's members area, but I'm going to be doing that again in greater

987
01:07:22,350 --> 01:07:27,110
greater detail. I might actually just do maybe the next episode regarding water

988
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:30,550
being the 10th and 10 being a number of judgment.

989
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:34,950
And that time has come already, by the way, when you were judged by water as as men and

990
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:37,790
women might be a good time to discuss that.

991
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:41,750
And if I forget, someone could remind me for next week if I'm still around for that.

992
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:46,890
And regarding water, there is virtually no knowledge of water and

993
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:51,810
it's the work of working knowledge other than when they want to specifically do

994
01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:54,710
something and they absolutely positively have to use water.

995
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:57,290
And the.

996
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:03,890
The essence of certain theories, as they're put out there, is being true and correct

997
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:08,830
and we're not being true and correct is also simple to perceive at a certain point,

998
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:11,810
but not that simple that you can't really go and do it.

999
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:14,350
It's more than five feet out of where you live.

1000
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:18,670
You have to go to the oceans and maybe set up a water lab, you know, a place where you

1001
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:19,590
just work with water.

1002
01:08:21,170 --> 01:08:25,410
So but so then you have to appeal to the rational mind when

1003
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:30,290
when you introduce the concept of the planet and there's something called the hollow earth,

1004
01:08:30,290 --> 01:08:34,810
for example. Yes, it's hollow, but it's not hollow per se.

1005
01:08:36,090 --> 01:08:37,510
Why would one say that?

1006
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:40,770
Because this leads into the water discussion very quickly here.

1007
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:47,149
When you look at anything that's in creation, everything that's in creation, even down to

1008
01:08:47,149 --> 01:08:51,350
its most finite element, is operating under a very high level of efficiency.

1009
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:56,430
There is no wasteful, I should say, material.

1010
01:08:56,430 --> 01:09:01,950
Everything is actually doing most of what it should be doing or it just ceases to exist

1011
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:04,890
or it's transferred into doing something else where it's more efficient.

1012
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:11,710
You see, you can see that throughout, for example, there is a severe lack

1013
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:17,290
still because of this cosmic censorship and the conditioning

1014
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:20,310
that mankind has been under to copy nature.

1015
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:24,470
Now, there's some of it, but there's a field, for example, called biomimicry

1016
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:30,470
and just spell it as it sounds, as in mimic and bio biomimicry.

1017
01:09:31,109 --> 01:09:34,189
There's a few organizations that tend to work with that.

1018
01:09:34,290 --> 01:09:36,810
And why aren't they being supported and reported on?

1019
01:09:37,109 --> 01:09:42,229
Because I would say the majority, if not all of the products that they develop using

1020
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:46,270
forms and archetypes that already exist in nature are successful,

1021
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:51,850
because when you are a society that's being guided by malevolent forces,

1022
01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:56,390
you are to be guided into doing the antithesis or the opposite of what should be done

1023
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:58,430
and call it good, by the way.

1024
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:04,090
So when you look at the Earth being not necessarily solid rock,

1025
01:10:04,110 --> 01:10:07,550
which doesn't make any sense that it is or that it's hot in the middle,

1026
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:13,550
because if you have thermal expansion or thermal conductivity with iron molten core,

1027
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:18,830
the oceans would get so hot and there would be no life on the surface in a matter of weeks or days.

1028
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:22,470
So that is all ridiculous tripe.

1029
01:10:24,190 --> 01:10:29,670
When you look at how ancient stories, let's say,

1030
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:32,390
or information has been memorialized regarding the Earth,

1031
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:37,770
we start out with running into the concept of water or waters on and on and on.

1032
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:41,870
And you would say that right now, going back to the email,

1033
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:46,230
the majority of the surface of the Earth or 70 percent thereof is covered with water.

1034
01:10:46,230 --> 01:10:50,390
And if you actually look at the depths of what's been measured,

1035
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:56,370
it gets very deep and actually the great volume of material that can be viewed as water,

1036
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:58,590
but most of it is underground still.

1037
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:02,550
And that would be the cause of earthquakes as well.

1038
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:07,150
As you understand or comprehend through whatever conditioning

1039
01:11:07,150 --> 01:11:10,110
or whatever has been put out as tectonic plate movement,

1040
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:12,350
yes, yeah, there's tension.

1041
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:15,330
Well, they tell you there's tension that builds up and earthquakes happen.

1042
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:17,790
Well, yeah, not really. That's not really the cause.

1043
01:11:18,530 --> 01:11:21,150
That's just like saying the weather is thermodynamic.

1044
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:23,750
It's not the cause. No, not at all.

1045
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:25,730
There is water underneath.

1046
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:30,850
And the integration or disintegration of the water body underneath

1047
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:34,850
or that quality of water under the Earth is what these plates are sitting on.

1048
01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:37,510
It would be like, imagine if you've ever sat on a waterbed.

1049
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:42,930
Imagine just laying out a bunch of ceramic tile, not gluing it to the bed or grouting it,

1050
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:47,770
but just laying flat pieces of stone, let's say that meet edge to edge on a waterbed

1051
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:49,490
and then move it and you will see how it moves.

1052
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:54,890
There is something called a Tularek tide, Tularek meaning the Earth,

1053
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:57,270
or as the crust has a wave to it.

1054
01:11:57,710 --> 01:12:02,350
And if anyone has ever witnessed an earthquake from an airplane,

1055
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:05,870
you will see it almost looks like a wave going through the Earth.

1056
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:09,930
You can see it from a distance with the naked eye if you're high enough,

1057
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:11,290
not too high, but high enough.

1058
01:12:11,850 --> 01:12:18,250
So what we consider or people consider to be solid is actually sitting on water as well.

1059
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:20,530
So you have an aspect to that.

1060
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:27,210
Now, the other part of the email was how, you know, they're just discovering these waves.

1061
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:29,710
Well, these things have been known for a very long time.

1062
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:33,770
As a matter of fact, some of the most desirable maps in ancient times were,

1063
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:37,390
if you remember the old ancient maps of you've seen of, you know,

1064
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:40,350
they draw little sea monsters and sailing ships on them as well.

1065
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:42,490
And they have distorted views of the continent

1066
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:45,970
because they didn't have satellites or aerial photography, let's say.

1067
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:51,430
They were most of the proprietary maps were not ever made public and never will

1068
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:54,270
because they showed certain times of the year

1069
01:12:54,270 --> 01:13:00,950
that when the wind currents would be along a certain route and the ocean current.

1070
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:06,230
So when you had the wind current and the ocean current concurrent moving coinciding

1071
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:12,210
with each other, you're able to really move at a good clip as fast or faster than modern ships do.

1072
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:16,270
But typically, that information has not been made public and will not

1073
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:20,750
because even if it was, it wouldn't matter because you're on the ridiculous Pope's work schedule.

1074
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:26,650
So you'll never understand anything in nature at its core if you are following that,

1075
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:31,830
which makes the entire world, by the way, and also the morons that do fall for all of these things,

1076
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:36,650
as I did myself because I was conditioned, by the way, just like everyone else.

1077
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:43,890
You will never be able, I assure you, if you stick to this synthetic Fiat work schedule,

1078
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:48,570
you will never be able to appreciate the clockwork, the things that are going on in nature.

1079
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:52,010
And fortunately for you, never will be over soon.

1080
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:56,390
So but either way, I'm just saying that as a side note here

1081
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,470
because I have gotten some messages from people

1082
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:03,190
who are observing natural events year in, year out now with great accuracy

1083
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:07,130
that you cannot with the ridiculous Pope's work schedule, which everyone adheres to.

1084
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:11,210
And by the way, those that are adherence to it, and of course, they haven't thought about it.

1085
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:11,810
They don't want to.

1086
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:12,730
They work on impulse.

1087
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:18,630
They will defend it, by the way, you know, just like they defend touching themselves in public.

1088
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:21,210
But anyway, maybe that was a loose lascivious comment.

1089
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:26,270
But the vast liquid here, W, that you mentioned in the email,

1090
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:28,470
as most of it is covering the earth.

1091
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:33,410
But the interesting part of it is it's mostly not visible.

1092
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:34,990
The majority of it.

1093
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:39,930
And just to bounce around a little bit, water gods is something.

1094
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:43,930
Yeah, there are elementals and gods over them.

1095
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:48,290
There's a veritable plethora of gods in population that is not being discussed.

1096
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:53,070
It is the most piss poor subject that mankind has ever engaged into,

1097
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:55,110
at least in the past 2,000 years.

1098
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:59,490
Seemingly very little information or is put out and discussed.

1099
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:02,350
Because see, right now, people are modern, you see.

1100
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:09,230
So by the way, that's like poking fun at typical moron when people say this is a modern age.

1101
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:14,750
If you do any study or research of ancient writs, you'll find that right before a society fell,

1102
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:20,550
whether it's Babylon, Rome, Persia, Greece or whatever, they started describing themselves as modern.

1103
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:22,970
Well, they fell from prominence, I should say.

1104
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:31,490
The other thing here that's being mentioned is, I guess, pretty much uncharted areas.

1105
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:33,450
I've brought this up a few times.

1106
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:39,770
I'm sorry, not I have not, but this has been brought up about islands that have disappeared.

1107
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:42,410
Now, one thing, you can speculate on that.

1108
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:49,990
But one thing, there's a lot of sort of conspiracy theory out there about islands that were and were not.

1109
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:51,650
Yes, that is true.

1110
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:58,070
But on many aspects also, you have to remember that mapmakers back in the day,

1111
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:02,010
when they did everything by hand or manually, when they put out a map,

1112
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:06,870
they would sometimes put in a ghost island or an island that didn't exist.

1113
01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:15,090
So when copies were made of the map, if that ghost island was also copied,

1114
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:19,070
then they knew whose map they copied, you see.

1115
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:24,710
So sometimes little features would be put in by certain mapmakers just as a hallmark.

1116
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:30,050
And those that were just set out to copy the map and put out a cheaper, let's say, copy,

1117
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:34,150
would copy it as well unawares and they would be easily caught.

1118
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:40,570
So that is one example why you have certain ghost islands and maps that exist and don't exist now.

1119
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:43,530
I'm not saying that islands weren't around, that they don't exist,

1120
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:48,070
but that is something that should be also in the back of the mind.

1121
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:52,430
When one is considering all of the rubbish that is going around on the internet.

1122
01:16:53,550 --> 01:16:57,450
So let's take a break from a little bit of this stuff because it's really just like,

1123
01:16:58,070 --> 01:17:02,570
you know, discussing water and waves, I mean, you can hit the public like a wave

1124
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:06,890
when it comes to water discussion, which I'm always like biting the lip here,

1125
01:17:06,950 --> 01:17:10,190
not to discuss water too much because there is going to be quite a bit of it.

1126
01:17:11,730 --> 01:17:16,810
Now, when I start discussing, it'll be more in the line of the ethereal aspect,

1127
01:17:16,810 --> 01:17:21,710
the true chemical aspect of it, and a lot of the workings of Victor Schauberger

1128
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:27,110
and other people similar to him, I assure you will have nothing to do with all

1129
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:31,850
of the other idiotic stuff that you hear about people claiming to discuss water

1130
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:35,610
and you know who they are and what they're discussing and it's dumb.

1131
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:42,330
But they're smart to say dumb stuff in public because they know you have

1132
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:44,090
to accommodate the audience.

1133
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:51,090
So anyway, I just wanted to throw in that little bite or a little whatever.

1134
01:17:51,930 --> 01:18:00,210
So here, let's just see here, Atlantis and Lumeria, yeah, that stuff is very loose.

1135
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:04,250
I would consider that you're never going to find Atlantis because you're standing on it.

1136
01:18:04,290 --> 01:18:06,350
That was the old name of Earth.

1137
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:11,670
Just like, for example, most of everything that is translated or called Earth today

1138
01:18:12,170 --> 01:18:19,250
or Gaia, which is the Greek term or Adits in Chaldean Hebrew, was known as Atlantis prior.

1139
01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:21,690
I would make that a very strong suggestion.

1140
01:18:22,530 --> 01:18:27,090
So let's just see whatever you folks here would like to discuss.

1141
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:31,230
What's interesting here is something brought up about Hebrew.

1142
01:18:31,390 --> 01:18:32,550
Look at hieroglyphs, someone.

1143
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:35,410
Hieroglyphic is interesting.

1144
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:42,070
The Langua Franca of Egypt was not hieroglyphs, by the way.

1145
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:46,590
They had used, that was the temple architecture or the temple language.

1146
01:18:47,070 --> 01:18:50,630
In other words, just like you have calligraphy in English

1147
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:57,330
and regular plain block letters in script or cursive, hieroglyphics back in the day

1148
01:18:57,330 --> 01:19:05,130
in the ancient Egypt was a form of hierarchical work that was done for the temples.

1149
01:19:05,130 --> 01:19:10,410
The people in general and during that time period where hieroglyphs were told to be popular

1150
01:19:10,410 --> 01:19:13,610
still used a cuneiformic type of writing.

1151
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:16,670
So again, that needs to be put into some kind of perspective.

1152
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:22,370
But again, it needs to be simple because you just walk like an Egyptian like the song says.

1153
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:28,970
Someone here, Yann Mathieu, are you familiar with Masaru Emoto's work on water?

1154
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:29,850
Yeah, pretty much.

1155
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:33,830
He did some interesting work, but it's for show.

1156
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:34,990
Again, it's an aesthetic.

1157
01:19:35,190 --> 01:19:40,230
Masaru Emoto is, anyone could look him up, M-A-S-A-R-U Emoto.

1158
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:46,630
He's passed away recently and I've had, I believe, I wouldn't say correspondence directly with him,

1159
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:49,530
but people have worked with him and they quickly went away

1160
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:55,650
because generally I basically said what you're doing is not wrong, but it's not right.

1161
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:59,470
And on the second level, if you're making other people happy

1162
01:19:59,470 --> 01:20:05,050
and you're not hurting anyone at this point with bad information about water, it's okay.

1163
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:07,290
You have quite an aesthetic going on there.

1164
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:11,670
So we'll just leave it as that.

1165
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:18,920
Let me just throw in a little thing here about Masaru Emoto because in conclusion,

1166
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:22,060
see what he had done is they put different intent in water.

1167
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,080
In water they had good intent, formed beautiful crystalline shapes.

1168
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:30,260
In the water that didn't, formed homogenous globs looking kind of shape.

1169
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:33,600
And he did other things with rice and other food products.

1170
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:38,440
But regarding water, when these highly leveled, highly ordered,

1171
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:43,560
aesthetically good looking crystalline forms would take place,

1172
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:50,440
what they failed to tell you is that those forms were more adept to attracting pathogens.

1173
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:54,200
So it flips over.

1174
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:59,280
That's something I'll discuss more in the future and why so, and it has to do with oxygen.

1175
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:01,300
And by the way, you're not oxygen breathers.

1176
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:05,860
It just appears that you are breathing oxygen.

1177
01:21:06,060 --> 01:21:10,140
It is a simple trick and because you're so censored, you will never find out the truth about it.

1178
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:11,880
Never meaning in this mindset.

1179
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:16,280
Your body produces the oxygen through the nitrogen.

1180
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:17,900
You heard me correct.

1181
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:18,900
You're not a filter.

1182
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:23,440
But you might say, well, Greek, if there's no oxygen, we'll suffocate.

1183
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:24,240
Yes, that's true.

1184
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:28,280
But that's why there is such a small percentage of oxygen in there

1185
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:30,480
and it's not a reactive type of oxygen.

1186
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:31,120
I'm sorry.

1187
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:35,260
It is a reactive type of not oxygen, not a nutritive type.

1188
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:40,680
The only nutritive oxygen you can use is the oxygen the body creates from nitrogen.

1189
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,460
And I just wanted to throw this in there also.

1190
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,280
This is like a potpourri of information.

1191
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:54,560
Louis Kervran, K-E-R-V-R-A-N, Kervran, he's talked about biological transmutation

1192
01:21:54,560 --> 01:22:01,780
on how the body of living things make other elements that are considered to be empirical.

1193
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:08,600
And you don't want to get into that field publicly because you will be disgraced by the morons on this planet at this point.

1194
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,420
But even though it can be provable.

1195
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:15,940
So let's just maybe continue here.

1196
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:18,380
Oh, and I do have, here it is.

1197
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:19,240
Thank you.

1198
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:25,600
Just to recap, AFR Patreon pledges of $10 or more will be rewarded with an audio CD

1199
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:30,380
containing the original 18 two-hour sonic episodes of Ocelli and the Greek.

1200
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:30,960
There you go.

1201
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,160
And there you have that.

1202
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,900
So thank you for putting that in there.

1203
01:22:38,520 --> 01:22:40,540
That was a detail that I forgot about earlier.

1204
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:48,460
So if you fellows and ladies would like to indulge in Ocelli and the Greek original episodes, there you go.

1205
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:50,400
You will get them on CD.

1206
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:54,640
And I think there are only 25 or so copies of it.

1207
01:22:54,760 --> 01:22:55,780
So they are pretty limited.

1208
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:59,440
The ancient secret of the flower of a life is another thing.

1209
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:00,860
That is completely misunderstood.

1210
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:05,760
That is, the flower of life is not really the flower of life.

1211
01:23:05,900 --> 01:23:09,560
It's a watered-down mystic dummy load at this point.

1212
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,100
Real simple, folks.

1213
01:23:12,700 --> 01:23:17,680
Unfortunately, this is kind of being sarcastic, but breakfast cereal is made of fruits, nuts, and flakes.

1214
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:24,520
And unfortunately, certain subjects that could have been made more viable and edifying

1215
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:29,780
have been dominated by breakfast cereal types, like Walter Russell, for example.

1216
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:31,360
It's some pretty okay work.

1217
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:33,520
He pretty much was trying.

1218
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:38,700
The people that surround him are breakfast cereals, same with Tesla at this point

1219
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:42,740
and Victor Schauberger and a lot of the ethereal research.

1220
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:43,940
It's unfortunate.

1221
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:50,660
So when you sort of want to bring up certain topics, if you ever hear the Greek bringing up, let's say,

1222
01:23:50,740 --> 01:23:53,240
these are not endorsements, but areas to look into,

1223
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:58,620
please, please, please do not fall into the mentality or man-tality or woman-tality

1224
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:02,940
of the morons that are promoting this stuff through various websites and YouTubes.

1225
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:09,840
Because most of the people that are bringing up this information,

1226
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:15,960
even suggesting it regarding Tesla, Walter Russell, Victor Schauberger, and others,

1227
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:24,620
Wilhelm Reich, stay away from the character and look at the information objectively.

1228
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:25,940
That's what I would say.

1229
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:28,520
The character of those bringing it up is highly in question.

1230
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:29,600
Very simple.

1231
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:32,200
This is to be sarcastic.

1232
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:33,420
Again, let's put them down.

1233
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:35,900
If you run into any of these morons, ask them what day it is

1234
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:38,380
and watch, they're going to tell you what's on the Pope's work schedule.

1235
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:40,640
And flat earthers or whatever.

1236
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:46,460
We're talking about – what I'm talking about here is the Gustave Le Bon mentality

1237
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:55,060
that unfortunately is very well illustrated on Internet sort of venues.

1238
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:57,180
You can pick any subject or whatever.

1239
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:01,640
The Googles and the YouTubes and I guess those are the major ones

1240
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:07,720
understand how the people flock together and they comprehend quite well

1241
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:14,240
the Gustave Le Bon mentality of the crowd, the morons that form these crowds.

1242
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:20,480
By the way, what do they call them, the analogs or the algorithms

1243
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:25,900
that Google and YouTube uses are loosely based on that.

1244
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:28,700
That's why, for example, if you go to YouTube or something and say,

1245
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:32,820
we recommend this for you because they are looking around.

1246
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:37,280
They understand the formula of the human mind at this point

1247
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:43,940
and they're not necessarily categorizing it in a way that you would think

1248
01:25:43,940 --> 01:25:45,800
even though it seems convenient to you.

1249
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:49,180
That's why they categorize it because it's convenient to the moron.

1250
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:55,420
By the way, I had gotten some comments in the past and again recently.

1251
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,340
Why are you calling everyone a moron or an idiot?

1252
01:25:57,340 --> 01:26:00,240
You'd be better if you were just more pleasant.

1253
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:03,340
I said, well, I find that pleasant so I'm being subjective

1254
01:26:03,340 --> 01:26:05,100
but at the same time I'm being objective.

1255
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:08,020
So it's getting two birds with one stone.

1256
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:12,100
The reason why I find it pleasant is because it's true.

1257
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:17,720
The second thing is you don't want people to quote-unquote follow you

1258
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:21,020
or say they like what you're saying but don't know anything about it.

1259
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:28,460
The thing is, at this point, if you assess humanity at the way that it is right now,

1260
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:32,800
do they deserve something that is founded and objective?

1261
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:38,000
I don't like using the word the truth because that has been just trashed as a term.

1262
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:41,640
About any subject, yes, but they don't listen.

1263
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:43,600
They hear things.

1264
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:48,080
I've actually had the misfortune of seeing maybe one or two negative comments

1265
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:52,040
that have ever been put on us, and obviously the person doesn't know how to listen.

1266
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:56,060
They hear things like the, or wah, wah, wah, or this or that,

1267
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:58,320
like the Charlie Brown school teacher.

1268
01:26:58,820 --> 01:27:03,960
But that is normal for your typical surface-dwelling earth inhabitants.

1269
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:08,720
How about engineering and structuring the episodes or the sonic events

1270
01:27:09,540 --> 01:27:14,640
and being said in a way where the people don't like how you're saying it

1271
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:17,380
but the information is irresistible?

1272
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:18,600
How about that?

1273
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:23,100
Because the last thing you want is for the people liking the messenger

1274
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:26,980
because the messenger doesn't want to be doing what he's doing.

1275
01:27:27,620 --> 01:27:28,720
You ever think about that?

1276
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:34,780
Maybe there is a spiritual or moral responsibility to be speaking sometimes

1277
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:40,220
other than, oh, let's just go interview some people because we get a lot of YouTube hits,

1278
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:41,820
which we might monetize.

1279
01:27:42,020 --> 01:27:46,420
And this is the mentality that you will find on what's called the Internet.

1280
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:48,600
Yep, that's right.

1281
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:50,600
So you're not going to get that.

1282
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:55,240
I find that what's been going on with humanity for the past few thousand years

1283
01:27:55,240 --> 01:28:00,580
in very bad taste, and now it has become technologically viable in mass production

1284
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:04,080
and sent down a wire through the air, it's still in bad taste.

1285
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:08,800
So all of it is done in bad taste at this point.

1286
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,460
I say all of it, meaning the great majority of the venues

1287
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:15,300
and the way things are structured because it has to be

1288
01:28:15,300 --> 01:28:18,240
because it's accommodating those that you guessed it.

1289
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:21,660
So let's see what else we could mull around here

1290
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:26,540
just because we have about another less than half an hour or so left,

1291
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:28,360
and we can continue.

1292
01:28:28,620 --> 01:28:33,220
Now the continuation of any sonic episode, by the way,

1293
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:36,100
has to be considered that it's cumulative.

1294
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:41,240
And I would say if you go back and look at the earliest things

1295
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:45,180
that were done with Ocelli, those were all sort of cumulative

1296
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:48,540
and other discussions based on that later as well.

1297
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:54,560
Now essentially what you will see is a repeat, almost a redundancy,

1298
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:59,100
in a holographic sense that every time there is an episode as such,

1299
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:01,440
there are certain things that are constantly being repeated.

1300
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:03,400
One of them is keeping time.

1301
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:08,280
Now, of course, I've always run into the, you know, you guessed it mentality

1302
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:11,320
where I say, you know, how can you believe in such a thing,

1303
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:12,460
a time if there is no time?

1304
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:15,440
Well, right away, that's your space heater, not a smart space heater,

1305
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:17,340
just your ordinary space heater.

1306
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:21,300
Now just to define for those that are slightly beyond that,

1307
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:26,440
I would suggest that time, by definition, is simply the recordation of events.

1308
01:29:27,560 --> 01:29:31,820
Now a typical surface-dwelling earth inhabitant, the 7.5 billion,

1309
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:38,060
that has nothing to do with them at all because they are here to take up a place

1310
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:43,340
and do what they're told based on culture, tradition, and others by social rank.

1311
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:44,260
Yes, very simple.

1312
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:45,680
Is it a slave society?

1313
01:29:45,820 --> 01:29:47,140
No, it's not a slave society.

1314
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:48,440
It's a credit-based society.

1315
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:54,000
So why is it important to be able to record events?

1316
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,780
Well, because you understand how nature works.

1317
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:58,980
And, again, that has nothing to do with most people.

1318
01:29:59,740 --> 01:30:00,000
Why?

1319
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:06,260
Because most people are not complaining to their engineering and industrial elite

1320
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:10,900
about designing indoor air-conditioning, heating, and cooling, let's say,

1321
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:15,520
that gives you a rarefied rise in cold and a descending heat like it does in nature.

1322
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:16,300
Do they?

1323
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:23,260
Most people do not complain about walking into the shops

1324
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:28,140
and seeing liquids like milk and juice and water in flat-bottom containers.

1325
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:28,800
Do they?

1326
01:30:30,020 --> 01:30:30,420
No.

1327
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,720
You're not going to get much out of that.

1328
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:37,620
Now, you don't have to really say that all people are like that, but most people.

1329
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:41,540
In other words, if you were visiting this planet

1330
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:49,740
and were to convey what is going on to this planet to a benevolent race with a starship,

1331
01:30:49,740 --> 01:30:54,080
the captain would make the utmost correct decision to say,

1332
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:58,240
let's put all of our weapons on the surface of this planet to get rid of these idiots

1333
01:30:58,240 --> 01:30:59,840
and put them out of their misery.

1334
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:04,660
Do you understand the import of what is going on?

1335
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:05,120
No.

1336
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:08,880
That's why most of you are still falsely hopeful.

1337
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:09,980
Of what?

1338
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:14,480
Do you think the gods are going to let you, meaning humanity on this planet,

1339
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:18,800
continue even another 50 years with flat-bottom containers for liquids?

1340
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:21,480
I know that sounds trivial.

1341
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:22,220
That's an example.

1342
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:26,240
Or do you want to go down really 1,000 different subjects

1343
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:32,040
on how absurd and repugnant they are to anything that's even resembling good?

1344
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:33,580
Do you think you're going to be going on?

1345
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:34,480
No, you're not.

1346
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:38,840
But the thing is, even during when these changes start to happen,

1347
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:42,240
when you're whittled down to 10% of who you are on this planet,

1348
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:44,700
or less, a little less than that perhaps,

1349
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:48,400
and the ones that are left, by the way, are not going to be some special group.

1350
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:52,060
They're going to be a typical moronic representative sample,

1351
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:56,220
just to keep some of the hereditary going.

1352
01:31:56,740 --> 01:31:58,940
But even when you're whittled down to that point,

1353
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:01,060
you still will not be knowing what's going on,

1354
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:02,920
just like you don't know what's going on right now.

1355
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:06,480
But you will know that something has changed, obviously,

1356
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:08,700
because 90% of the people on the planet are not here.

1357
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:12,400
So this is an interesting time.

1358
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:14,890
And by the way, speaking of that, just to throw that in, like what a shocker,

1359
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:20,000
what you're seeing is in the springtime you're going to be going into

1360
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,940
the precursor of the formation of a Middle East Union.

1361
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,980
And when this union comes, by the way,

1362
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:30,440
and that's why you still hear every day something going on in the Middle East,

1363
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:35,280
however you want to call it, a central mass of the Earth.

1364
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:40,120
And, of course, you don't know what's going on because you don't know the future.

1365
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:41,880
Now, when you say you don't know the future,

1366
01:32:42,220 --> 01:32:44,100
oh, you have to be psychic or have a time machine.

1367
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:45,660
No, it's nothing to do with that.

1368
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:46,920
You just have to learn to read.

1369
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:51,260
I think I mentioned earlier about doing a search on what's called

1370
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:52,740
the King James Bible is inaccurate,

1371
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:56,720
and you'll see some videos by certain religious types telling you that it is accurate.

1372
01:32:56,900 --> 01:33:00,120
And you really want to have a laugh and vomit at the same time?

1373
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:06,180
At least with the Greek you need popcorn and headache medicine or aspirin.

1374
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:08,860
With the other stuff you need a barf bag.

1375
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:13,820
So either way, but what you will see in the next seven years,

1376
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,460
and the reason I'm bringing this up,

1377
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,720
and I'm going to get back to the chat if there's a couple of things there,

1378
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:24,400
what you will see, this seven-year period that is going to be starting in the springtime

1379
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:27,860
is pretty much it for what you call free speech

1380
01:33:27,860 --> 01:33:31,000
or examining the world and speaking objectively.

1381
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:34,280
Because by the mid-2020s,

1382
01:33:34,660 --> 01:33:38,080
the entire world is going to be so engrossed in this quote-unquote promise

1383
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:43,120
and delivery of a perfect society that nothing else will be tolerated.

1384
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:49,040
And I've given specifics and will give more specifics on how that will pan out,

1385
01:33:49,220 --> 01:33:50,860
but no one is paying attention.

1386
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,640
And you know what? No one really cares.

1387
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:58,380
But the thing is if there is a moral sense to say things that are proper,

1388
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:02,660
you should say them even though the world is in such piss-poor shape.

1389
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,160
Okay, let's see some of the comments here.

1390
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:10,140
I mean I'm almost at this point don't want to because it's typical chat stuff,

1391
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:11,940
but there are some viable things there.

1392
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:12,800
Let's see.

1393
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:15,160
William Reich's orgone energy has been used to make organate.

1394
01:34:15,240 --> 01:34:16,020
No, it hasn't.

1395
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,240
Your thoughts on why organate is a joke.

1396
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:23,080
Yeah, it is because William Reich's thing was basically an open-ended capacitor.

1397
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:25,640
It absorbed on one side and reflected on the other.

1398
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:26,740
Organate doesn't do that.

1399
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:28,600
That's breakfast cereal stuff.

1400
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:29,760
Played with it.

1401
01:34:29,820 --> 01:34:30,320
It doesn't work.

1402
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:30,780
It's a joke.

1403
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:32,800
Well, because you have to have organate.

1404
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:34,100
Organate has to be popular.

1405
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:35,680
Look at the people that like it.

1406
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:37,760
I mean enough said.

1407
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:39,160
It's very simple.

1408
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,280
That's why I keep saying learn to discern character.

1409
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:45,700
Learn to judge, not condemn, but judge.

1410
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:48,960
When you judge, you walk away or go forward.

1411
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:51,060
Judgment is very important.

1412
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:54,900
Condemnation is not because even if you wanted to condemn,

1413
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:56,320
there's nothing you can do about it.

1414
01:34:56,380 --> 01:35:00,660
You're completely under adversarial conditions and completely unlawful conditions,

1415
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:04,060
and you shouldn't because the gods are going to do it much better than you could anyway.

1416
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,500
I could feel the energy from a quartz crystal,

1417
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:09,520
and I could feel energy from a chunk of organate.

1418
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:10,060
Well, sure.

1419
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:12,220
Yeah, you could feel a lot of things,

1420
01:35:13,740 --> 01:35:17,340
but technically you're not going to technically access much with it.

1421
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:18,900
Let's see.

1422
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:21,760
Let's just see.

1423
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:26,380
I think someone's really hitting the bong a little too much here,

1424
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:27,040
but that's okay.

1425
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:31,780
So let's just continue with certain thoughts.

1426
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:38,020
One of the things I brought up is every Greek-speak type thing is cumulative upon another,

1427
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:43,880
but there is always a recurring repeat, let's say, of certain topics,

1428
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:45,880
and one of them is the coming Middle East Union.

1429
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:49,660
And no one is really discussing this publicly, I should say,

1430
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:56,880
with any kind of accuracy or whatever

1431
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:59,480
because everything has to be now in the next two weeks or so.

1432
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:06,120
So I would suggest that if you want some new ideas,

1433
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:09,300
you better go to a very old book or books,

1434
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:13,240
and not necessarily that all of them were of high quality back then,

1435
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:16,740
but you will have to learn to discern quality with anything anyway, don't you?

1436
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:22,840
But when you're going to be looking at certain things,

1437
01:36:23,020 --> 01:36:28,820
whether they're social, cultural, in one's life, or even from an engineering perspective,

1438
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:31,020
there's something called common sense, which is uncommon,

1439
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:36,220
but let's just say good sense because you don't want to do what most people do, I should say.

1440
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:37,300
I mean you could do what you like.

1441
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:42,440
An example on that would be I once went into a store looking for a particular product

1442
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:45,040
and wasn't sure of it, what to get,

1443
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:47,220
and the store attendant or the clerk said,

1444
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:49,800
get this one, this is the one everyone buys.

1445
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:52,120
And I'm like, oh, that's the one I don't want.

1446
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,440
And she says, why?

1447
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:54,140
Everyone buys it.

1448
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:56,220
I said, well, don't you deal with the public every day?

1449
01:36:56,360 --> 01:36:57,440
Don't you see who they are?

1450
01:36:57,440 --> 01:36:58,700
I mean it can't be good.

1451
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:01,940
And she just kind of walked away like, this guy's nuts.

1452
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:02,900
I'm like, thank you.

1453
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:04,860
I'll figure it out myself.

1454
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:07,420
I'll look at the ingredients and try to discern.

1455
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:12,180
So the thing is there's a certain amount of efficiency and economy of movement you'll get

1456
01:37:12,180 --> 01:37:15,700
when you go with the crowd, which you have to discern whether it's for you or not.

1457
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:20,340
But when you start looking at things that are going on,

1458
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:24,980
you're going to have to look at the rationale and the basis of it,

1459
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:28,440
whether it's engineering, social, or yourself or anything.

1460
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:36,420
One similar basis that you will find is in matters that are cyclical or spiral even,

1461
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:41,380
they tend to go around and pass the same place more than once

1462
01:37:41,380 --> 01:37:42,960
or at least once when they're circular.

1463
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:48,480
For example, a racetrack, and I give this metaphor with society all the time,

1464
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:51,840
when you look at a racetrack, where's the starting line?

1465
01:37:53,200 --> 01:37:54,280
Get a visual on that.

1466
01:37:54,280 --> 01:37:55,400
Where's the finishing line?

1467
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:57,080
You get it?

1468
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:58,380
It's the same thing.

1469
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:03,700
If you look at the piss poor crap that they discuss regarding where human society started,

1470
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:04,980
well, you guess where it started.

1471
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:10,260
Whether it's, and I say piss poor crap meaning the education system,

1472
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:14,020
they even admit it, and most of the ancient writs admit it.

1473
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:17,760
Now, of course, you've got the breakfast cereal types that are running around

1474
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:21,180
postulating whatever they want to do, but look, they can just sit there.

1475
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:23,260
Remember, the majority of the people are in that category.

1476
01:38:24,220 --> 01:38:25,540
So what goes around comes around.

1477
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:27,520
Where it starts is where it's going to end.

1478
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:33,580
But the specifics stop there when you look at the natural characteristic of something cyclical.

1479
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:38,260
To get more specifics on anything, you're going to have to go to whatever,

1480
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:42,380
either something has been memorialized that is validatable

1481
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:44,300
or something from a higher vantage point.

1482
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:47,640
This has always been the case.

1483
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:52,860
So the interesting part here, and this is just a private thought I'll share with everyone,

1484
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,180
it's like when the Greek comes around every week, let's say,

1485
01:38:56,740 --> 01:38:59,980
we're probably going to do about three more to keep it around 12 on this one also.

1486
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:02,360
By the way, this is number nine.

1487
01:39:04,060 --> 01:39:07,120
It's like I'm wondering, why do this?

1488
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:09,580
Who are you addressing?

1489
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:11,020
What are you going to say?

1490
01:39:11,820 --> 01:39:16,100
The reason why is because in the previous Sonic episodes,

1491
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:20,460
there was an effort to go through certain categories and other times that I've spoken.

1492
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:27,340
I should say it's almost not worth doing public speaking on this.

1493
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:31,860
But if you don't do public speaking, well, it's like casting out the information.

1494
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:35,780
Well, then you can't say that you spoke publicly, you see,

1495
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:39,880
at least to free oneself from a moral aspect.

1496
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:44,720
Later on if people say, well, you knew this and didn't say anything, well, I did publicly,

1497
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:48,420
and it's archived here or wherever, and you can say that.

1498
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:53,100
So hopefully it's doing good, but ultimately it's for selfish reasons.

1499
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:58,340
It's like, well, you can have private conversations or whatever,

1500
01:39:58,420 --> 01:40:00,620
but many people say, Greek, you've got to write a book.

1501
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:01,840
I'm like, no, I'm never going to do that.

1502
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:03,900
Why would I write a book about another book?

1503
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:09,300
And also wanting to write a book is you're presuming that people know how to read.

1504
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:12,560
So that's out of the question.

1505
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:16,860
But the thing is doing a public broadcast, broadcasting needs to put out.

1506
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,860
It could be in any other sense other than written.

1507
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:20,260
And here's the thing, folks.

1508
01:40:20,340 --> 01:40:23,680
The best way to do a book is through audio because typically years ago

1509
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:26,820
and has a positive effect on the mind is when things were read,

1510
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:27,820
they were never read silently.

1511
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:28,800
They were read out loud.

1512
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:34,100
This is why you never get any architectural details

1513
01:40:34,100 --> 01:40:35,960
or descriptions of ancient libraries

1514
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:38,920
because they are completely opposite of what libraries are today

1515
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:41,740
and the temples and things like that.

1516
01:40:42,340 --> 01:40:46,780
And also you are under what's called the – this is the Christian era.

1517
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:48,820
I need to say no more.

1518
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:55,760
So no matter what you hear or as impending doom, by the way,

1519
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:59,280
from any other religion, it is still considered the Christian era,

1520
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:00,920
and maybe that's why you're doomed.

1521
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:07,220
But either way, you can move forward and start thinking with what has been said

1522
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:09,480
and maybe use it as a basis.

1523
01:41:09,660 --> 01:41:11,660
But here's the other thing, a private thought.

1524
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:16,600
People I've worked with before, I've always said this is not going to go far.

1525
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:20,320
This Greek-speak stuff, whatever project we do, it is not time now.

1526
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:23,460
And it may never really be to be in a big way,

1527
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:27,240
and I never have discerned it to be that or desire it to be that

1528
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:32,420
because I'm able to objectify the quality of the mindset of those on the planet right now,

1529
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:34,940
and it is not very good, and it will not be good.

1530
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:38,180
But it doesn't mean that you're not – it's not going to change.

1531
01:41:38,380 --> 01:41:43,080
So you get a different mindset for a while so when these things happen,

1532
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:45,920
you have no excuse later because you can never say,

1533
01:41:46,300 --> 01:41:49,540
well, we were just dummied up all the time and we were always lied to.

1534
01:41:49,540 --> 01:41:53,400
So you're going to get a chance coming here.

1535
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:57,100
This is in the next seven years where the preparation is starting this spring where it's going to begin

1536
01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:01,700
where you will start to inquire about things that you have never dreamed of inquiring about

1537
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:04,180
and acknowledging as well.

1538
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:10,380
Why? Because when they come to administer the kill shots to the inhabitants on this planet,

1539
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:14,320
the last thing they want to do is have people say, we didn't know.

1540
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:17,600
So it will not be lawful.

1541
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:22,820
So in order for the kill shots to be lawful, you have to know why they're doing it,

1542
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:25,500
and that's going to be really the interesting part to watch.

1543
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:32,120
That's what gives you the less than seven-year window of opportunity to speak at this point,

1544
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:36,780
and time is sort of coming around here soon.

1545
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:42,080
So those are just some private thoughts that I'm just sharing with people here that are listening

1546
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:46,160
because the question again is why come around every week to say what?

1547
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:51,980
You see, there's much that can be said, much that can be done, but it makes it very, very difficult,

1548
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:54,880
very disheartening when you go out into the world, and guess what?

1549
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:58,380
You see liquid still in a flat-bottom container.

1550
01:42:58,800 --> 01:42:59,620
Not very good.

1551
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:06,040
So either way, the mindset is what it is, and insulate yourself from it.

1552
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:09,860
So again, we're coming down to the end of the two hours.

1553
01:43:09,860 --> 01:43:15,620
Typically when you run out of things to say on Internet radio or anything else,

1554
01:43:15,680 --> 01:43:18,280
you start bringing up how little time you have left.

1555
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:22,560
It's almost an indirect way to say, like, okay, maybe you want to finish up a little early,

1556
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:26,400
but not necessarily, so let's just see what else is here.

1557
01:43:26,460 --> 01:43:27,000
Not much.

1558
01:43:27,220 --> 01:43:32,460
The chat is whittled down to almost no one, no more e-mails, and I have nothing else really to say.

1559
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:38,880
I have not much on the thought other than perhaps indirectly promising discussing water for two hours next week.

1560
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:44,460
I'll tell you, folks, what's interesting about doing public speaking,

1561
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:49,500
especially getting the opportunity to do it on something like this where it's live.

1562
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:53,560
I don't know if anyone can really tune in and hear it, but let's say it's supposed to be,

1563
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:56,400
and many pick it up on the archives.

1564
01:43:56,400 --> 01:44:01,660
When you go out into the world and you see how people are behaving and what they're interested in,

1565
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:06,700
and it is on a level that is almost, I would say, just downright repugnant,

1566
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:11,960
whether it's their science, their legal system, their religion, or whatever.

1567
01:44:12,360 --> 01:44:17,420
You look at it and you are like, why are they deliberately picking the wrong thing

1568
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:23,960
or what is hurtful and harmful to them, and why are they legitimizing it?

1569
01:44:24,580 --> 01:44:24,980
Why?

1570
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,800
This is the objective point of view.

1571
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:31,360
Now, the subjective point of view, when you bring this up, they always say,

1572
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:32,720
oh, well, that's our system.

1573
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:34,020
You're attacking our system.

1574
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:35,840
This is the way it's always been doing.

1575
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:38,420
This is the way it's always been done.

1576
01:44:38,580 --> 01:44:39,260
You can't attack.

1577
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:40,140
This is the way we do it.

1578
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:41,520
If you don't like it, leave or whatever.

1579
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:43,940
This is the defense that you get.

1580
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:48,100
So when you come around every week or the Greek comes around, let's say, to do this,

1581
01:44:48,100 --> 01:44:50,440
it's like you kind of rehash what to discuss,

1582
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:57,860
but we cannot not think about just the sheer just ridiculousness that's in the world.

1583
01:44:57,980 --> 01:45:01,480
And, by the way, this ridiculousness that I'm discussing is also represented

1584
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:07,280
in alternative media on every form, whether it's in print or audio.

1585
01:45:07,420 --> 01:45:11,660
It's represented as well, not necessarily by what is being said,

1586
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:13,960
but by what is not being said.

1587
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:15,760
Sometimes that speaks even louder.

1588
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:20,480
And it's quite a chore, and it does wear out on you.

1589
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:26,840
So eventually, again, this is a private thought, if you feel worn out or whatever,

1590
01:45:26,860 --> 01:45:33,060
you need to refresh, find good food, good clothing, good shelter, a spouse,

1591
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:39,860
and things that make you feel good and to revive yourself for the next day

1592
01:45:39,860 --> 01:45:44,960
because you know the next day it's going to be pretty much the same out there.

1593
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:48,320
You keep to yourself, and you try to do what's best.

1594
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:54,460
And that's really the most difficult thing is to pay attention,

1595
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:58,720
is to discover what people are engaging in.

1596
01:45:58,780 --> 01:46:02,880
And almost every aspect of their existence is as if they have deliberately chosen

1597
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:05,820
and gone out of their way to do things that are not right.

1598
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:08,960
Again, can you say it's absolutely wrong?

1599
01:46:09,020 --> 01:46:12,520
No, because in order for it to be passable, it has to appear good.

1600
01:46:12,520 --> 01:46:15,580
But it's definitely not right, none of it.

1601
01:46:16,640 --> 01:46:20,660
So it can wear you out, but it shouldn't because, you know,

1602
01:46:21,660 --> 01:46:24,060
even though you didn't ask to be in this existence,

1603
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,760
does it mean you can run out of questions

1604
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:30,940
and ask to find what is the best way to navigate this ridiculousness?

1605
01:46:31,940 --> 01:46:37,220
And, again, there's supposed to be alternative thinking, alternative media,

1606
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:40,580
alternative science, alternative medicine, whatever, whatever,

1607
01:46:40,580 --> 01:46:42,920
and it's not serving anyone that well.

1608
01:46:43,020 --> 01:46:45,920
They think it does, but it's just a fashion.

1609
01:46:46,760 --> 01:46:53,020
It's not any better than the polka dot polyester bell-bottom wide lapels,

1610
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:55,580
and this is actually viewed very well.

1611
01:46:55,860 --> 01:46:58,700
You know, right now if you look at all of the alternative stuff,

1612
01:46:58,820 --> 01:47:00,000
it's not helping anyone.

1613
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:03,880
What happens to all these movements other than the bowel movements?

1614
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:06,500
They get flushed and just everything else.

1615
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:11,780
So there's not much going on simply because it's still coming from the same stock

1616
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:17,320
of low-quality existence that has been bred into people

1617
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:20,400
from the cultures and traditions that they have,

1618
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,900
and it's either fictional or just downright malevolent portrayed as benevolent.

1619
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:27,060
So what is one to do?

1620
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,400
So actually do nothing.

1621
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:33,980
So this is how one can proceed or not proceed.

1622
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:39,180
Guard yourself, insulate yourself, and perhaps by next week,

1623
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:42,220
let's say if you still come around, that will be solo 10,

1624
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:46,920
it will be about water, and we will get into maybe making the best

1625
01:47:46,920 --> 01:47:49,700
out of what you've got with that as well.

1626
01:47:50,360 --> 01:47:52,460
So thank you, folks, and we'll see you next week.
