1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,560
Oh, I got a love that keeps me waiting.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:12,300
Oh, I got a love that keeps me waiting.

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,740
I'm a lonely boy.

4
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:41,990
Hey, could I come again please?

5
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,330
Yeah, the ladies want to fight.

6
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:54,230
You're listening to New Zealand's number one rated alternative talk radio.

7
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,190
It's the Vinnie Eastwood Show.

8
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,350
Just because we're being exterminated doesn't mean we can't make it fun.

9
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,770
Otherwise, what's the point of being killed?

10
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:12,690
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to yet another exciting episode of the Vinnie Eastwood Show,

11
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,510
broadcasting live on American Freedom Radio.

12
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,110
For your listening discomfort, it's the lighter side of genocide.

13
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,790
Just because we're being exterminated doesn't mean we can't make it fun.

14
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,930
Otherwise, what's the point of being killed?

15
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:34,310
Now, I have a guest turning up in about 15 to 20 minutes, and I'm going to talk about this whole concept.

16
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:41,690
I had this interview with Kevin Annett that I've just published up and spread all over Facebook today,

17
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,650
which has been responded with a legion of hate, as expected.

18
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:55,410
Number one, if you talk bad about any kind of religion,

19
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:00,230
see, even right now, a whole bunch of people who are deeply religious,

20
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,610
who believe in the Lord and Jesus and so on and so forth,

21
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,930
getting their backs arched up a bit.

22
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:16,510
Because any criticism of the concept of a faith-based religion is abhorrent, right?

23
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,190
I'm just thinking about this.

24
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:24,510
I've got so many friends who are deep believers in things that I don't really believe in,

25
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:30,370
and yet we get along so well because we're not dicks to each other.

26
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,730
I mean, maybe that's the real difference, isn't it?

27
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,050
The difference between somebody who's religious and somebody who's a zealot.

28
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,110
I mean, hell, let's go one step further.

29
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,430
What if it's a cult?

30
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,880
What if you've been part of a cult, right?

31
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,620
What's a cult?

32
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,920
You've got a hierarchical structure.

33
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,300
Organize religion.

34
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,140
You've got a preordained doctrine that everybody has to adhere to.

35
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,820
Organize religion.

36
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:09,820
You've got a central leader kind of thing that runs the whole organization.

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,700
Organize religion.

38
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,160
All right, so there you go.

39
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,800
That's how you know you're part of a cult.

40
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,640
Sorry to lay that on you,

41
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,520
but religion isn't the only cult that people are a part of.

42
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,020
There are cults of all kinds of followings.

43
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,160
Fan club cults, cults of personality.

44
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,660
There's TV show cults, you know, like the Star Wars cult.

45
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,400
Just think about that for a minute.

46
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,880
How many films have what they call a cult following?

47
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,720
All right, what does a cultist do?

48
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,340
I mean, let's think about this.

49
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,720
What if you introduce yourself not as a Star Wars fan, but as a Star Wars cultist?

50
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,860
Hello, I'm a Star Wars cultist.

51
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,180
Really, bro?

52
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,620
It kind of seems really creepy all of a sudden.

53
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,280
You're just using a different word, one that's not patently acceptable.

54
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:13,860
Oh, I know, because I've kind of gotten over the fact that I don't have to lie to myself.

55
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,600
I don't have to lie to myself anymore.

56
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,560
I'm a cultist, Star Wars cultist.

57
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,760
I love it.

58
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,680
I can't get enough of it.

59
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,120
All right?

60
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:29,900
Give me a Jabba the Hutt and a Han Solo any day over a Pizza Hut and a handle of beer.

61
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,420
All right?

62
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,520
That's what I'm talking about.

63
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:40,640
Obsession, veneration for a person, object, some kind of thing.

64
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,960
Do you love it?

65
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,860
Do you viciously defend it?

66
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,200
Have you got butterflies in your stomach whenever people talk bad about it?

67
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,940
You don't know why.

68
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,420
You have no clue.

69
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,520
Why would somebody feel bad about it?

70
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,000
You know?

71
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:07,780
I've just been looking around lately and I've been having these conversations about religion

72
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,100
and that kind of thing.

73
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,080
It's those red meat issues.

74
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,200
I'm not doing it because I'm trying to get a rise out of people and I'm trying to suck a hit off them

75
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,000
or any crap like that.

76
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,900
I'm just genuinely interested in the topic right about now.

77
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,340
Christmas is coming up.

78
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,200
It is the season to believe in things.

79
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,280
Stuff from the Bible.

80
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:41,140
It's clearly marked in there in the Bible that on Jesus' birthday, the 25th of December,

81
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,700
that you must celebrate it by having an enormous tree draped with lights and expensive decorations

82
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:56,540
and stuff like that with a large meal around everybody and have a whole bunch of products

83
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,020
that are made and manufactured in China for everybody that hasn't earned them.

84
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,380
Just give it to them because it's the season for giving.

85
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,100
Leviticus fucking chapter 3 or some shit.

86
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,840
It's right in there, man.

87
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,940
The celebration at Christmas.

88
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,440
You see?

89
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,560
Nobody even follows their religions anymore.

90
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,700
That's what I'm starting to find out that's different as well.

91
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,200
If you're an idiot,

92
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:32,580
saying that you believe in a certain thing doesn't make you not an idiot.

93
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,120
That's the interesting thing that I've been thinking about lately.

94
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:45,240
A lot of people use their belief structures as an excuse to not listen and to not be reasonable.

95
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,920
This isn't all people that have a belief structure, mind you.

96
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,660
Just some.

97
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,120
Maybe because you need to have that.

98
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:06,800
I understand that specifically there is a reason why I believe in a higher power and a God and everything like that.

99
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,160
It's because I know that I can derive power from it.

100
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,260
How do I know that?

101
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,440
Because I've done it myself and hit an awakening?

102
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,200
No.

103
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,800
Statistics.

104
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:24,860
Have a look at the survival rates of people that are in POW camps.

105
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,000
Let's take Vietnam for instance.

106
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:27,940
Alright.

107
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,660
Let's have a look at all the atheists in the POW camps.

108
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,760
How many of them survived?

109
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,100
Very few.

110
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,760
Let's have a look at the really, really deep Christian believers in the Vietnam POW camps.

111
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,880
How many survived?

112
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,520
A hell of a lot of them.

113
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:49,160
See, that alone is a reason to believe in something.

114
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,800
Even if it's not there.

115
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,680
Even if you don't have a defined belief of what it is.

116
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,700
Just believe.

117
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,180
That belief alone is something that will give you hope.

118
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:11,080
Because when you're in despair, a situation where you have no hope whatsoever, your body starts to shut down.

119
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,740
It doesn't try to survive.

120
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,280
It can't see tomorrow.

121
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:25,840
So, if I bag religion, it's not because I'm bagging the belief and the power that it gives you.

122
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,680
I'm not blagging morality.

123
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,559
I'm not blagging history.

124
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,840
I'm not blagging anything.

125
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,520
Apart from those who misuse it.

126
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:42,520
Psychopaths in particular, who develop little cults.

127
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:43,580
Alright?

128
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,220
I had this joke this morning.

129
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,820
You know, I've never seen an atheist blow shit up or kill people in the name of atheism.

130
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,360
But that's probably because they don't shout,

131
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,540
FOR NOTHING!

132
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,420
Before blowing themselves up.

133
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,880
You know, you just imagine that.

134
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,340
That would be quite classic, wouldn't it?

135
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,000
You know?

136
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,100
Get a little cartoon or a sketch or something.

137
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,260
Atheist terrorist.

138
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,480
FOR NOTHING!

139
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,190
It's all dust in the wind.

140
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,270
You know?

141
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:27,750
He only gets like half a dozen virgins in the afterlife because he doesn't believe that you need 72.

142
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,290
I'm sorry.

143
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,050
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,290
Here's another thing.

145
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,050
I apologize if I'm making fun of anybody's belief structure.

146
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,250
I don't mean to do that.

147
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:44,890
I make fun of everything, just in general.

148
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,210
Belief structure is just part of the gig.

149
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,450
You know?

150
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,510
Let's say you're taking it seriously.

151
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,630
Let's say you're an atheist or a Christian or a Muslim or some denomination of cultists.

152
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:07,650
And you get offended by the very concept that I don't like false belief.

153
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,670
That I don't like blind belief.

154
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,970
That I don't like things that aren't fact-based.

155
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,730
I don't like things that don't have a reason to be there.

156
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,330
Now, that means that a lot of you shouldn't be offended.

157
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,330
Because there is a reason why you believe what you believe.

158
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,370
There are some facts that substantiate it.

159
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,110
Okay?

160
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,230
So I'm not talking about you.

161
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,250
Am I?

162
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,110
Talking about those people who are idiotic.

163
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:42,950
Zealotry.

164
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,270
The fucking zealotry.

165
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,530
My God.

166
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,790
All caps, comments all over YouTube.

167
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,990
YOU MUST CONVERT.

168
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,030
OTHERWISE YOUR INTERNAL SOUL WILL NEVER BE SAVED.

169
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,910
YOU MUST ACCEPT JESUS INTO YOUR HEART.

170
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,950
OH GOD, I JUST LOVE JESUS SO MUCH.

171
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,290
You don't even know anything about the guy.

172
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:17,450
I mean, he was a barefoot, unemployed, homeless, healing, travelling, hippie, Palestinian Jew.

173
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,570
I mean, you can't get any more messed up than that.

174
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,470
Alright?

175
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,790
So if anybody is like that, and you want to deify them or anything,

176
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,270
why the hell do you have a reason to be angry with anyone if that's your deity?

177
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:34,330
Yeah?

178
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,710
Am I wrong?

179
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:43,770
The only person you should be upset with is somebody who's evil.

180
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,110
Somebody who actually tries to corrupt the innocent.

181
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:51,610
Yeah?

182
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,490
Think about that for a second.

183
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,250
Who's your enemy?

184
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,350
I wonder this myself.

185
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,250
Who's my enemy?

186
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:08,570
And I'm starting to realise that my enemies are all psychopaths.

187
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,470
Every single person that I can count off of my head,

188
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:15,950
people that have screwed me over, who are really horrific,

189
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,790
who are sexual predators and things of this nature.

190
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,950
All of them that I've had any personal contact with,

191
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,390
who I've since developed feuds with, are freaking psychos.

192
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:31,590
Alright?

193
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,310
Some of them feign religion.

194
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,770
Some of them say that they're free men on the land.

195
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,210
Some of them say that they're great talk radio show hosts and patriots.

196
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,130
Dude.

197
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:45,550
Dude.

198
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:50,810
Exposing psychopaths is actually kind of one of the most important things to do

199
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,290
in any institution.

200
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:53,910
Alright?

201
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,070
Again, have a look back at it.

202
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,150
Is your institution controlled by a psychopath?

203
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,490
Is it hierarchical with one guy at the top?

204
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,130
Psychopathic controlled.

205
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,390
Every time.

206
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:06,910
You know?

207
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:11,090
It's like impossible for someone who's not a complete psycho

208
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,390
to get to the top of a giant organization.

209
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:17,990
Right?

210
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,810
Unless they built it themselves

211
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,850
and are currently running it themselves

212
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,610
and there's nothing to really be at the top of

213
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,310
because it's just them.

214
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,330
Right?

215
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,390
See, there's a difference, isn't there?

216
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:37,690
Maybe it's just the desire to be surrounded

217
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,190
on all times by fawning sycophantic scum.

218
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,730
I don't believe that I need that.

219
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,170
You know?

220
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:46,770
People who go,

221
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,250
Oh, Vinnie, you're so great.

222
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:48,950
I love it.

223
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,430
I mean, you know, it's nice.

224
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,730
Thank you very much.

225
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,350
I'm not ungrateful.

226
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,220
Just as long as people are willing to pull me up on things.

227
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:01,860
You know?

228
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,620
If I'm wrong, show me the evidence.

229
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,040
Right?

230
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,820
Like I was talking about Kevin Annett before,

231
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,220
and a lot of the reason why people don't like him

232
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,440
is because in 2013,

233
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,700
he launched a common law court case

234
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,660
and arrest warrants of the Queen, the Pope,

235
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,360
and a number of other high-level Vatican

236
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,580
and government officials.

237
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,100
Now, that's a common law jurisdiction thing,

238
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,340
so that means you've got an arrest warrant

239
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,200
for the Queen.

240
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,860
It's an actual legit one.

241
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,440
You could grab the Queen and drag her away,

242
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,820
and you wouldn't technically be breaking the law.

243
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,820
But who's going to do that?

244
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,060
So what happened was,

245
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,620
nothing happened,

246
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,940
apart from a whole bunch of people in the Vatican

247
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,900
resigning all of a sudden for some reason.

248
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,540
And what people have done is they've construed that

249
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,340
as instead of him trying,

250
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,600
you know, just trying, giving it a go,

251
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,080
and it's just not working,

252
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,160
they construed that as,

253
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:03,980
he's a fraud.

254
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:05,780
Right?

255
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,140
I don't understand that.

256
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,880
Also, I've heard a lot of other accusations,

257
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,400
like he's a womanizer,

258
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,320
and he's traveling all around the world,

259
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,440
living the life of Riley and stuff.

260
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,440
I haven't seen anything to substantiate it.

261
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,220
It's like,

262
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,860
every time somebody throws out an accusation,

263
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,280
I don't care who it is

264
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,100
that's throwing out the accusation.

265
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,720
I don't trust accusations alone.

266
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,180
I need to see something to substantiate it.

267
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,520
I need to see,

268
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:42,000
because if you're going to pigeonhole somebody,

269
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
you know, just go,

270
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,380
all right,

271
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,600
I really don't like this guy anymore,

272
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,660
he's off my radar for good,

273
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,280
it's going to take a bit of evidence

274
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,160
before I determine whether or not

275
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,400
somebody's actually a fraudulent bad person.

276
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,460
And accusations simply aren't enough.

277
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:02,980
You know,

278
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,620
they're not enough.

279
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,820
And that's how you know when you're dealing with a shill,

280
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,280
or somebody who's just crazy,

281
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,680
or somebody who's just wrong,

282
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,780
is they keep playing the name-calling game,

283
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,220
they keep going and going and going,

284
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,000
saying all this stuff,

285
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,440
making all these accusations,

286
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,280
and did they provide a single screenshot?

287
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:21,920
No.

288
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,280
Did they provide any video evidence,

289
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,200
or anything that could actually be constituted

290
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,040
as some kind of case that they're making?

291
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,220
No?

292
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,980
Then they're talking out of their ass.

293
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,240
Right?

294
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,260
I'm sorry,

295
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,060
whoever you are,

296
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,160
that's like spreading BS about anybody.

297
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,140
This is a very generalized concept

298
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,840
that I'm talking about here now.

299
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,720
People just make stuff up all the time.

300
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,940
And you know what the funniest thing is?

301
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,480
So many people believe it every time.

302
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:02,880
You know,

303
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,119
don't check up on it.

304
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,260
Oh, that guy's a scumbag all of a sudden.

305
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:06,920
I knew it.

306
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,980
I knew it all along.

307
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:08,900
Really?

308
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,880
Somebody came out and criticized them openly?

309
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,339
Somebody who you think is trustworthy

310
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,140
and their words is enough?

311
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:17,839
You know?

312
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,880
Even people I know to be trustworthy,

313
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,720
I don't trust just their word alone.

314
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:24,599
Okay?

315
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,560
When it comes to throwing somebody under the bus.

316
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,560
All right?

317
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,460
I will throw people under the bus

318
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,640
if they're a scumbag.

319
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,080
You know?

320
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,220
If they're a parasite on human life,

321
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,960
if they betray people left, right, and center,

322
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,860
24, 7, 3, 6, 5,

323
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,180
for their entire existence,

324
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,700
if that's what they do to people.

325
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,020
Yeah, they're going to be thrown under the bus.

326
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,880
Sorry, bro.

327
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,800
This is your stop.

328
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,380
I'm like that.

329
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,900
As soon as I know,

330
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,180
like know,

331
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,660
that somebody's a psycho scumbag

332
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,400
who's a manipulator and a liar,

333
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,980
I know for a fact that I cannot trust them

334
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,500
and never want to associate with them ever again.

335
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,120
You know?

336
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,660
And what's interesting is that

337
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,000
those people that you block off like that

338
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,260
and say you parted on bad terms or anything like that

339
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,400
or they started getting real uppity at you,

340
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,420
they never come back to you and apologize

341
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:27,980
and say,

342
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,860
Oh, I'm sorry I acted like a dick, bro, man.

343
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,880
I was just really...

344
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,480
See, psychos can't apologize at all.

345
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,600
Now, our guest, Brian Kelly,

346
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,640
appears to be ready.

347
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,000
So I'll just get that contact info to the studio there.

348
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,320
But I really am quite incensed

349
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,140
when I see people get manipulated

350
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,000
by accusations and things

351
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,830
that are completely unfounded

352
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,500
and people believing them

353
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,420
without asking for any evidence.

354
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,520
That's all I'm asking for.

355
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,840
If you want to pigeonhole me or anybody,

356
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,860
just ask to see a little bit of evidence

357
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,440
before you believe whoever's opinion.

358
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,460
This person says that about that person

359
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,880
and I believe them because such and such

360
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,980
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

361
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,200
Yeah, but that's all personality assumption, bro.

362
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,800
Have you got anything solid?

363
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,240
Something that isn't just shifting sand

364
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,040
of opinion and logical fallacy name calling?

365
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,700
You don't, do you?

366
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,460
Just shush then.

367
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,100
Okay?

368
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:50,660
Shh.

369
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,240
I don't care that you got five fake YouTube accounts.

370
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,140
I will block them all.

371
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,560
Okay?

372
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,820
They will get blocked.

373
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,240
Just like that.

374
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,140
And I will never have to hear from you again

375
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,980
after each and every one of your subsequent

376
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,760
fake accounts has been blocked.

377
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,160
Now, I'm a bit sick at the moment.

378
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,760
I'm holding down a gargantuan,

379
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,760
like an oil drum sized ball of flames.

380
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,240
That's quite a horrific thing to say

381
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,220
on talk radio, isn't it?

382
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,420
No response from the studio,

383
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,340
so I'm going to see if I can bring in

384
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,540
Brian Kelly here myself.

385
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,840
No, that's not working.

386
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,160
Okay.

387
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,180
Sorry about this, ladies and gentlemen.

388
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,580
I have to produce on here,

389
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,040
and I'm feeling sick and tired,

390
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,040
and I need a holiday, bro.

391
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,040
At the end of this week,

392
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,340
it's going to be holiday time.

393
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,560
But my very special guest joining me right now

394
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,380
is Brian Kelly from Brian Kelly's newsroom.

395
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,280
Welcome to the show.

396
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,160
Brother Benny Eastwood,

397
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,600
it is good to be here,

398
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,980
and it's been a long time, man.

399
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,440
How are you doing?

400
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,340
It has been a long time,

401
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,180
and I'm doing sickly,

402
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,060
but I'm about to go on holiday

403
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,780
after a few more shows to round out the week

404
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,580
before Thanksgiving,

405
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,440
and I'm looking forward to recuperating from...

406
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,720
I should have just said,

407
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,260
I'm good.

408
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,810
That would have been the shorter version,

409
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:25,510
but I'm with you.

410
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,350
I like details,

411
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,550
so it's good to hear that you're doing all right.

412
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,290
Oh, damn, that was funny.

413
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,310
Oh, God.

414
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:34,750
That cracked me up.

415
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:35,030
I do.

416
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:35,710
I do.

417
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:38,190
So anyway,

418
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,310
what have you been up to, Brian?

419
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,430
Oh, man, I'm good.

420
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,910
What's been waiting in the wings?

421
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,490
I don't follow the news at all.

422
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,850
Do you follow the news at all?

423
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,550
No, I went through a phase

424
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,190
when I was doing my blog.

425
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:57,270
If you've gone to my blog recently,

426
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,590
you'll notice I haven't made a blog post

427
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,870
in probably about six months,

428
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:01,090
and that's as a result

429
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,170
of not following the news really at all.

430
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:04,510
So I've transitioned

431
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,570
to doing more boots-on-the-ground kind of projects,

432
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,230
which I'm here in Bali doing now,

433
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,850
but every once in a while,

434
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,630
something will come my way.

435
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,950
For example,

436
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,470
some of the Syria stuff

437
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,430
has illuminated lately

438
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,730
because I've got a friend over there

439
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,770
that's on the ground in Syria right now,

440
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,310
and obviously,

441
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,170
if something pops up

442
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,390
that's as important to share

443
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,250
as what's happening in that country,

444
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,550
then I pay attention.

445
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,050
But for the most part,

446
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:32,750
no, man, I'm not listening to the radio shows.

447
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,490
No offense to you.

448
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,550
I know you've got an awesome show.

449
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,870
I'm not reading blogs,

450
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,350
and I'm staying out of newsrooms and chats

451
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,230
because I feel like

452
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:43,110
if I need to know it,

453
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,130
somebody will shoot me a link,

454
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,610
and then I'll dig a little.

455
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,230
Brian, if I may,

456
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,590
you just described

457
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:51,590
my exact protocol for life.

458
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,690
I'm out of the game a bit,

459
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,230
but I'm very much in the game

460
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,790
in another level.

461
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,490
Well, you just described

462
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,890
my exact protocol for life.

463
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:58,270
Yeah, man.

464
00:22:59,150 --> 00:22:59,910
It's a good blueprint.

465
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,770
It works.

466
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,250
I mean, dude, dude, dude,

467
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:02,690
dig this.

468
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,270
I figured it out,

469
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,990
and there's a reason why we do it.

470
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:06,990
Okay, number one,

471
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,470
news doesn't fucking matter.

472
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,770
Once you come to that realization

473
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,270
that it actually doesn't fucking matter

474
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,130
staying up to date

475
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,030
with shit that's happening

476
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,130
10,000 miles away

477
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,430
that doesn't actually involve you

478
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,530
in any way, shape, or form.

479
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:17,870
You know?

480
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,410
That's the honest way to put it,

481
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:22,970
for sure.

482
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,630
Like, oh, I fucking figured it out.

483
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,390
Well, you know, man,

484
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:28,710
I mean,

485
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,750
when I first went down the rabbit hole,

486
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,730
it was like I couldn't get enough news.

487
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,170
It was like I needed to know

488
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,090
what the fuck was going on

489
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,870
because my entire world view

490
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,090
was challenged in so many ways,

491
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,650
and then I think I got to the point

492
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,690
where I was in paralysis,

493
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:43,630
news paralysis,

494
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,850
and the only way

495
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:49,070
to let go of those symptoms

496
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,210
was to just back away

497
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,330
from the whole thing,

498
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:52,570
and I gotta tell you,

499
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,690
it's working

500
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,750
in a lot of ways.

501
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,090
So you're doing exactly

502
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:00,130
what I recommend my listeners do,

503
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,310
is turn off the Vinny Eastwood show

504
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,390
and start going and doing your own thing,

505
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,850
your own activism or whatever.

506
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,170
In fact, you've got to really

507
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:08,050
turn off everything.

508
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,670
It's like in life,

509
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,170
energy gets given

510
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,770
to what you put your attention to.

511
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,050
Now, if you're putting your attention

512
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:15,930
to someone else

513
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,030
as opposed to yourself

514
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,910
and your family,

515
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,710
your world,

516
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,890
and your contribution to it,

517
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,170
I think you've missed

518
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,450
a priority or two.

519
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,330
You know, I know a lot of people

520
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,070
that spend 18 hours a day

521
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,130
staring at their monitor screen.

522
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,050
I was one of them

523
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:34,850
for a long time,

524
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,110
and on one hand,

525
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,450
you have information

526
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,590
being empowering,

527
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:40,590
because I believe

528
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,210
when we empower ourselves

529
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,170
with what's going on,

530
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,290
all it simply does

531
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,310
is it allows us

532
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,070
for freedom

533
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,650
of a much wider scope

534
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,390
of options

535
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,890
of how to conduct ourselves

536
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,910
and what's available

537
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,110
within the limitless space

538
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,450
of possibility at all times,

539
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,770
but you get to that point

540
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:58,790
where all of a sudden

541
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,310
that becomes overload,

542
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,550
and it's just not,

543
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,430
it doesn't serve a purpose

544
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,170
after a while,

545
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,150
and, you know,

546
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,330
shutting the computer

547
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,190
and actually going

548
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,970
and, you know,

549
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,990
doing something,

550
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,830
you know,

551
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,750
seems to be the only

552
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,550
natural progression

553
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,290
out of that mode

554
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:18,130
of constant, you know,

555
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,090
overload of information.

556
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,070
You just get to the point

557
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,530
where it's like,

558
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,330
fuck, man,

559
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,010
enough is enough

560
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,110
sooner or later.

561
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:25,930
So, yeah, it's fun

562
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:26,530
to be actually

563
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:27,990
creating something.

564
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,330
You know,

565
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,170
I've got some cool stuff

566
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:29,690
going on,

567
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,370
and every once in a while

568
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:33,130
I'll pop in

569
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,290
and pop out

570
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:34,990
as needed,

571
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,450
but it's important

572
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,230
that people like you

573
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:37,950
keep doing the work

574
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:38,830
and putting out information

575
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:39,650
because there are

576
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,750
lots of people

577
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,330
around the world

578
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,270
that are still new

579
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,230
to a lot of what's

580
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:43,930
really going on

581
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,170
and need that shake

582
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,510
in order to be able

583
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,970
to snap out

584
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,030
of the mind control,

585
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:51,790
cultural,

586
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:52,950
social conditioning

587
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,390
matrix that they're in,

588
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,690
and for that purpose,

589
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,490
to that end,

590
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:57,970
it is highly valuable.

591
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,070
Well, the whole concept

592
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:00,990
of good management

593
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,210
is to make yourself

594
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:02,870
redundant,

595
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,690
all right?

596
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,570
So if the concept

597
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:06,110
of the show

598
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,370
is to wake people up,

599
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,510
no,

600
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,930
it's not to wake people up,

601
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:10,170
okay?

602
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:10,710
The people who are

603
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,390
listening to the show

604
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,290
probably have already

605
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,050
quote, unquote,

606
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:13,790
woken up.

607
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:14,910
The idea of listening

608
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,490
to the show

609
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,530
is you'll listen to it

610
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,430
enough that you'll want

611
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,190
to get out of bed

612
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,170
and you'll want to go

613
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:20,890
to work against

614
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:21,690
the new world order.

615
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:22,830
That's what I'm talking about.

616
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,350
That's real productivity.

617
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,390
I mean,

618
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,530
there's some people

619
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,890
who literally cannot

620
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,630
do that, though.

621
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:29,510
They're still,

622
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:30,770
they're trapped,

623
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:31,550
okay?

624
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:32,910
It's like you can

625
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,650
work your life

626
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,890
and you find your place

627
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:36,470
in your workforce

628
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,850
and after a while,

629
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:38,550
you realize that you

630
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:38,990
haven't played,

631
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,030
you found your place

632
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,510
in the world

633
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:42,410
and you're trapped

634
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,310
where you are.

635
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,470
You're trapped in your

636
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,550
house that has a mortgage.

637
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,570
You're trapped in your

638
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,210
job that has set hours.

639
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:48,810
You're trapped

640
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,590
in a mindset.

641
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,150
You're trapped

642
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,910
in your family's

643
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,490
environment.

644
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:54,750
You're trapped

645
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,450
in perhaps a

646
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,690
that isn't conducive

647
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,270
to truthing

648
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,910
and activism,

649
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:01,510
et cetera.

650
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,290
Maybe everybody

651
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,130
thinks you're nuts

652
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,010
in your house.

653
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,330
Maybe everybody tells you

654
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,250
you ought to calm down.

655
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,030
You ought to just,

656
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:08,450
you know,

657
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,230
do your job

658
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:09,830
and shut up

659
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,670
and drink the Kool-Aid

660
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:11,950
like the rest of us.

661
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,410
You know,

662
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,190
before,

663
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,970
when I was doing blogging

664
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:17,930
and doing radio shows

665
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:18,810
two times a week,

666
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:19,990
that was,

667
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,290
what you just shared,

668
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,370
was my main theme

669
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,250
and message.

670
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,030
If I were to say

671
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,430
that I had to,

672
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,470
on an ongoing basis,

673
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,500
which is that

674
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,410
the fastest way

675
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,170
to change the world

676
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,330
is for people to

677
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,930
follow their passion,

678
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,150
to break free

679
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,550
of that system

680
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:39,350
that keeps people

681
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,350
slave-laboring

682
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,090
and doing some

683
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:41,870
nine-to-five job

684
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,370
that they couldn't

685
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:42,970
fucking stand

686
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,330
and throwing themselves

687
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,110
into the deep end

688
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,590
and realizing that

689
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,350
they are capable

690
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,090
to break free

691
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,770
from that system.

692
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:51,050
I mean,

693
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,110
I quit my job

694
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,450
in February of 2013.

695
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,510
I had $8,000

696
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,150
to my name

697
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:56,410
and I had $8,000

698
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,450
and I had no fucking idea.

699
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,150
Excuse my language.

700
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,130
I can swear here, right?

701
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,430
Yeah, you fucking can.

702
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,010
I had no fucking idea

703
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,270
how I was going to survive,

704
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,330
but something told me

705
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:05,230
this isn't it.

706
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,390
It's not working.

707
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,270
There's no joy.

708
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,210
There's no passion.

709
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,310
There's no creativity.

710
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,870
I fucking hate it.

711
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,510
So,

712
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,230
it's worth it to me

713
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,030
to throw myself

714
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:14,650
into the wind

715
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,590
and just see what happens.

716
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,210
And the fact of the matter was

717
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:17,550
is that

718
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,890
that was the biggest,

719
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,830
crucial turning point

720
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,910
that led to,

721
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,630
I haven't punched

722
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,610
a time card since

723
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,390
and here we are

724
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,390
in November of 2015

725
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,150
and guess what?

726
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,290
I haven't died of starvation.

727
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,410
I haven't spent any days

728
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:30,950
in the street

729
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,290
without a roof over my head

730
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,250
and the universe

731
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:33,770
has paved

732
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:34,510
very creative

733
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,150
and very unpredictable ways

734
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:36,910
for me to be able

735
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:37,890
to navigate the terrain

736
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,190
without having to worry

737
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,420
about how to survive.

738
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:41,850
And I think that

739
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,010
at the crux

740
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:43,730
of people staying

741
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,390
within those,

742
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,890
that system,

743
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,830
that controlling,

744
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,470
kind of mind controlling system

745
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:48,830
is that

746
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,770
I don't know how

747
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,770
I'm going to survive

748
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:51,890
if I step outside

749
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,790
of this sense of security,

750
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,370
this sense of being

751
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,670
able to ensure

752
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,890
that I keep food

753
00:28:58,890 --> 00:28:59,290
on the table

754
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,430
and the roof over my head

755
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,310
and that,

756
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,050
breaking free

757
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,030
from that illusion

758
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,270
of self limitation

759
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,870
is the key

760
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,870
to be able to transcend

761
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:08,830
that process

762
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:09,530
on every level

763
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:10,090
and it works.

764
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,070
I know a lot of people

765
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:11,930
that have done it also

766
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,530
and it's scary as shit

767
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:14,930
but for some,

768
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:15,530
somehow,

769
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,590
everybody figures out

770
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,350
a way to make it work

771
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,510
because we all have

772
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:19,550
some sort

773
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,730
of higher calling

774
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:21,490
where not,

775
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,830
didn't come into this world

776
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,310
to sit in a fucking cubicle,

777
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,990
to die under fucking lamps

778
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,310
that are,

779
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:27,750
are frying our brains

780
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,170
and to punch fucking numbers

781
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,050
into a fucking computer

782
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:30,470
all day.

783
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,590
Now that's an extreme example

784
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,170
but I know people

785
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:32,910
that fucking do that

786
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,650
and it's not,

787
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,830
it's not the way to live

788
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,850
and the faster people

789
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,010
unplug from that,

790
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:41,510
that harvesting type scenario,

791
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,410
the less energy,

792
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:44,950
the gas all of a sudden

793
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,010
in the tank of these

794
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,250
global commercial based

795
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,830
system that we live in

796
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:52,310
worldwide,

797
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:53,990
that just all of a sudden

798
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,030
comes crashing down,

799
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:55,770
collapsing down

800
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:55,970
so the faster

801
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,430
they don't want free thinkers,

802
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,870
they don't want people

803
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:59,810
that are following their heart

804
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:00,570
and following their passion

805
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:01,430
because that means

806
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,130
less cogs in the wheel

807
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,150
of the system

808
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,330
that keeps people in control

809
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,730
so it is a vicious cycle,

810
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,450
vicious system

811
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:09,230
but highly empowering

812
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,190
to break free from

813
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,390
and sometimes it takes

814
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,670
those that are still

815
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,430
stuck there to hear

816
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,150
stories like mine

817
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:17,330
to realize that it is

818
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,150
very much possible

819
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,230
and can be an exciting

820
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,710
and scary as shit process.

821
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:24,150
Well yeah,

822
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,090
and again,

823
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:25,950
this seems to be

824
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:26,710
a recurring theme

825
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:27,750
on the show already.

826
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,910
Everything you've said

827
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,870
basically happened

828
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,790
to me as well.

829
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:31,830
You know,

830
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,530
like for example,

831
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,550
you had 8 grand

832
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,890
and you quit your job

833
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:35,510
in 2013.

834
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,010
I had $11,900

835
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,290
worth of shopping vouchers

836
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,790
and 5 grand cash

837
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,710
in 2007

838
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,330
when I quit my job

839
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,550
but same thing,

840
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,110
I've always had

841
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,050
a roof over my head,

842
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,670
I've always had

843
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,710
a meal in my belly,

844
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:47,450
I've always had

845
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,330
just enough money

846
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,830
to pay the bills

847
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,950
whenever I need them

848
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,070
and it's kind of like

849
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,250
if you're sitting there

850
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:55,730
and you're sitting

851
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:55,930
and you're sitting

852
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,550
and you've got

853
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,870
20 different screens

854
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:59,790
in front of you,

855
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,790
you don't know

856
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,230
what any of them

857
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:03,670
are saying

858
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,430
because they're all

859
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,530
talking at once.

860
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,870
When you turn

861
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,170
all of them off

862
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:10,330
but one

863
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,990
because you know

864
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,590
that you can't focus,

865
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,310
you can't do anything

866
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,010
but by distract

867
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:19,770
and block out

868
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,410
everything that

869
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:20,950
doesn't matter

870
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,030
and you don't do it

871
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,050
because you necessarily

872
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:24,830
want to,

873
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:25,850
you do it

874
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:25,950
because you

875
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:27,510
there's something

876
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,170
that tells you

877
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,390
that you have to do it,

878
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,490
you don't have a choice

879
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,530
because you're going

880
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,390
to drive yourself insane

881
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:36,150
or kill yourself

882
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,230
or kill somebody else,

883
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:38,930
probably the boss

884
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,410
and it's not going

885
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,310
to work out very well

886
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:41,990
for everybody.

887
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:44,650
Yeah,

888
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:45,950
nobody wins

889
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,630
in that scenario.

890
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:49,390
So yeah,

891
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,070
I don't advocate

892
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,830
killing your boss,

893
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:51,290
however,

894
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:52,630
there's been a few

895
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,350
that I've wanted to

896
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:54,770
but yeah,

897
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:55,430
the sooner

898
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:55,890
your extra cash

899
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:57,730
all of a sudden

900
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:58,910
the world opens up,

901
00:31:58,950 --> 00:31:59,230
you know,

902
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,570
synchronicity becomes

903
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,050
much more prevalent,

904
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,230
meeting the right people

905
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,150
and being in the right

906
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,510
situations and scenarios

907
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,570
at the right time

908
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,450
that seems very divinely

909
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,350
in some level

910
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:12,490
inspired,

911
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:13,950
it becomes,

912
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:15,570
it's just a much more

913
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,690
pleasant way of living

914
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:19,550
on every level

915
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,390
and that doesn't mean

916
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,390
it's not hard.

917
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:21,650
I mean,

918
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,510
there's been times

919
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,610
where I had no clue

920
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,570
and I know that you

921
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:25,870
know,

922
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,590
where that next money

923
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,370
was going to come from

924
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,190
to ensure that rent

925
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:30,890
was paid or whatever

926
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,490
that you were able

927
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,110
to get groceries

928
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,090
but somehow

929
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,890
at the 11 and a half hour

930
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,510
something pops up

931
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,190
and then all of a sudden

932
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:39,650
you know

933
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,350
and the more that time

934
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,710
that happens,

935
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,090
I think the more faith

936
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:44,890
you have in that process

937
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:47,410
that we're being taken care of

938
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,050
and then all of a sudden

939
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:48,610
you realize,

940
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,050
okay,

941
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,250
next time this happens

942
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:50,910
I promise myself

943
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,050
I'm not going to stress out about it

944
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:52,990
and then sure enough you do

945
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,390
but the more consistency

946
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:54,810
you have

947
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,490
and the more comfortable

948
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,510
you get with the process

949
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,650
of just allowing the universe

950
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,790
to unfold before you,

951
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:01,190
the more you realize

952
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,030
that there's a whole lot

953
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:02,830
more going on

954
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:03,910
than what we can see,

955
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,490
taste,

956
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,310
smell,

957
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:05,910
hear,

958
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,390
touch.

959
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:06,950
Am I missing

960
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,830
any other senses?

961
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,750
Above an extra sensory perception

962
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,970
but when you're working

963
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:15,670
you've got a schedule

964
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,030
you know

965
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,590
and you tell yourself

966
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,910
what the plan for the day is

967
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,930
every freaking day

968
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,770
but when you work for yourself

969
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:24,150
the plan tells you

970
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,250
what to do.

971
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,430
It's like it actually comes out of the

972
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,550
it just comes out of the ether

973
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,090
kind of thing

974
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,370
just magically appears

975
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,210
like literally.

976
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:32,870
There was this one time

977
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,270
I got up in the morning

978
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,250
and it was bill day

979
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:36,790
and I was like,

980
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:37,130
okay,

981
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,150
I got the water bill,

982
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,050
the internet bill

983
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:39,770
and the rent.

984
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,370
That's 500 bucks.

985
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,970
I don't have 500 bucks.

986
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,570
So I go to my PayPal

987
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,790
and there's 500 bucks in there.

988
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:50,790
You know,

989
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,370
boom!

990
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,650
That's the exact scenario

991
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:56,870
I'm talking about.

992
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:57,730
You know,

993
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,470
some magical donation

994
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,390
that came from somewhere

995
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:00,930
or some,

996
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,210
you know,

997
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:03,890
some tax return check

998
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,030
that you got lost in the mail

999
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,090
three years before.

1000
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:07,550
I mean,

1001
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,929
you really never know

1002
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:10,250
where it's going to come from

1003
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,250
but it just somehow seems to

1004
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:12,949
and I think that

1005
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:13,489
you know,

1006
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:14,429
it is.

1007
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:16,150
It's this false sense of security

1008
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:16,710
that,

1009
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:18,710
you know,

1010
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,610
Matrix-style-esque jobs

1011
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,929
we feel provide for us

1012
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,070
that keeps us in those positions.

1013
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:24,350
I mean,

1014
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:25,190
I've talked to people,

1015
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:26,030
you know,

1016
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:26,810
it's the same

1017
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:27,370
no matter,

1018
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,130
all the way up this

1019
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,210
perceived level of control

1020
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,750
that dictates the way

1021
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,610
that the world works,

1022
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:34,590
you know,

1023
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,670
and all the way up

1024
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:36,550
in the upper echelons

1025
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,810
of the elite

1026
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:38,949
and the Illuminati.

1027
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:39,770
I've heard the stories.

1028
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,449
First-hand accounts

1029
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:43,230
that they don't know

1030
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,310
what they would do

1031
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,250
if they exited ranks

1032
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,530
and went another way

1033
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,330
because their

1034
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,270
livelihood

1035
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:53,830
requires them to stay

1036
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,449
within the system

1037
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:55,929
that they have

1038
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:56,930
around themselves.

1039
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:57,830
It's not easy

1040
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:58,750
at any level.

1041
00:34:59,210 --> 00:34:59,650
But that doesn't,

1042
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,790
just because something isn't easy

1043
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,030
doesn't mean it's not possible.

1044
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,190
You know,

1045
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:04,750
but it does,

1046
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,230
you know,

1047
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,310
it takes a leap of faith.

1048
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:08,670
Shit,

1049
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,050
if we can't do leaps of faith,

1050
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:10,410
man,

1051
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:11,990
then we've got

1052
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,530
a long rocky road

1053
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,210
ahead of us.

1054
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:15,350
I feel like we're at

1055
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,530
perhaps this turning point

1056
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:19,250
in where we are

1057
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,450
in the process

1058
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,290
of human evolution

1059
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,950
that it doesn't really matter,

1060
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:24,590
you know,

1061
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,450
this might be a very optimistic way

1062
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,110
of looking at it,

1063
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:27,830
but it doesn't really matter

1064
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,710
what anybody does

1065
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,590
because this whole thing

1066
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,490
is unfolding

1067
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,490
in this perfect way

1068
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,710
and so you can either

1069
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:37,990
resist what's happening

1070
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,910
or you can let go

1071
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:39,630
of the side of the river

1072
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,610
and just go slow

1073
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,510
and things have a tendency

1074
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,050
of just getting

1075
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,030
a whole hell of a lot easier.

1076
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,430
So,

1077
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,550
that's my little bit on that

1078
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,090
and,

1079
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:48,810
you know,

1080
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:49,930
for anybody that's out there

1081
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:50,930
that's sitting on the fence

1082
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:51,830
and trying to figure out

1083
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:52,970
what the fuck to do

1084
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:53,910
and how the hell to do it,

1085
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,070
don't worry about how to do it,

1086
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,390
just do it,

1087
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:56,750
you know?

1088
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:57,770
That's the,

1089
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:58,190
forgetting,

1090
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,330
letting go of the how

1091
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,510
and trying to put together a plan,

1092
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:00,790
I mean,

1093
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,610
let all that shit go

1094
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,130
because how,

1095
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,010
if I were to try to make a mind map

1096
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,010
of how I was going to do it

1097
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,170
back in February 2013,

1098
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,130
how I'm doing it

1099
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,330
and how I thought I was going to do it now,

1100
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,590
back then,

1101
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:10,810
have,

1102
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:11,290
look,

1103
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,610
absolutely nothing like each other

1104
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,090
whatsoever

1105
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,670
and because it is

1106
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,750
it goes to the point

1107
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,250
that you made

1108
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:16,790
that the universe

1109
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,450
somehow has it all under control.

1110
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,030
So,

1111
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:19,950
you either have faith

1112
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:20,930
in that process

1113
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,230
or you don't,

1114
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:22,590
you know?

1115
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,350
And I'm not here

1116
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,090
to try to tell anybody

1117
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:25,050
how to live their lives

1118
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:25,330
but,

1119
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:25,910
you know,

1120
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:27,430
my story,

1121
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:28,050
your story,

1122
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:28,930
some of these other stories

1123
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:29,690
are great examples

1124
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,070
that,

1125
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,190
really,

1126
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:32,410
the only thing to fear

1127
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,090
is,

1128
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:35,950
fear itself,

1129
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,090
for lack of a better

1130
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,470
non-creative way

1131
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:39,990
of saying it.

1132
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:40,750
Yeah.

1133
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:41,350
Well,

1134
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,430
everybody in life

1135
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,590
is worried about money.

1136
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:44,790
You know,

1137
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,730
I'm worried about money,

1138
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:46,750
you're worried about money,

1139
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,250
even people that got jobs

1140
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:49,390
have to worry about money

1141
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:50,810
but also,

1142
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:51,710
the problem is

1143
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,410
if you have a job

1144
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,170
you also have to worry

1145
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:53,670
about the fact

1146
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,110
that you're starting

1147
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:54,850
to hate yourself,

1148
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:55,430
you know?

1149
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,110
And,

1150
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:58,790
in life,

1151
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,230
some people,

1152
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:00,670
you know,

1153
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,470
choose to work,

1154
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,350
some people choose

1155
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:05,530
to work for themselves

1156
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,150
and some people

1157
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,310
just sit on the fence,

1158
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:09,410
you know?

1159
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:10,550
Yeah.

1160
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:11,290
And,

1161
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:12,870
I'm just trying to burn

1162
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:13,450
the fence down.

1163
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,910
It's time to,

1164
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,230
yeah,

1165
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,450
it's time to get a bulldozer

1166
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,470
and just knock this

1167
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,490
damn fence over.

1168
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:22,290
We'll do it

1169
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,690
fucking Gaza style, bro.

1170
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,130
I want to burn it,

1171
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:27,470
really,

1172
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,170
I want to burn it

1173
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,030
and I want to do it

1174
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,650
in like a really

1175
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,810
sacrificial kind of way

1176
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:31,830
that's almost dark,

1177
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:32,390
you know?

1178
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:32,950
I don't know if that

1179
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,230
makes me weird or crazy.

1180
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,790
All I want to do

1181
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,950
is dance around

1182
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:38,730
the burning fence

1183
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:39,390
after everybody

1184
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,410
suddenly had to choose

1185
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:40,850
what they do

1186
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:41,350
with their life

1187
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,570
and not allow other people

1188
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,310
to fucking tell them

1189
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:43,970
what they have to do

1190
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,210
with their life,

1191
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:45,630
you know?

1192
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:46,150
And,

1193
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:46,810
it'll be like

1194
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:47,950
dancing around it

1195
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,250
naked,

1196
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,270
jiggling in the air

1197
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,510
and like chicken

1198
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,210
smeared in goat's blood.

1199
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,370
It'll be fucking fantastic.

1200
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,690
We're going to mutilate it

1201
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,610
like with a spoon.

1202
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,410
Just really kind of

1203
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,150
have fun with it, man.

1204
00:37:59,290 --> 00:37:59,990
That's what I would

1205
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:00,410
vote for.

1206
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:00,830
Yeah,

1207
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:02,210
it'll be like a,

1208
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,310
it'll be like the

1209
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:04,990
Doors concerts

1210
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:05,470
or something.

1211
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:08,150
I'm thinking

1212
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:08,710
pay-per-view,

1213
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:09,830
we make loads of money

1214
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:10,550
and we send the money

1215
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:11,110
from Africa

1216
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,350
to feed starving children.

1217
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:12,690
I mean,

1218
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:13,290
it's really,

1219
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,330
at the end of the day,

1220
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:15,650
it's for a good cause.

1221
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,330
No, no, no, no.

1222
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,170
I've got a better idea

1223
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:18,650
of what to do

1224
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,070
with the money.

1225
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,150
You hire African mercenaries

1226
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,030
to kill all the people

1227
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,790
that are giving

1228
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:25,150
bad drugs

1229
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,010
and stuff like that

1230
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:26,810
to all the Africans

1231
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:27,750
that's causing AIDS.

1232
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:29,670
If you have that petition,

1233
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:30,270
I would love

1234
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:30,870
to sign that

1235
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,510
on behalf of myself

1236
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,170
and all of humanity.

1237
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,350
That reminds me,

1238
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:36,090
I remember there was

1239
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,650
an ex-CIA assassin,

1240
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:38,670
Chip Tatum,

1241
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:39,350
and he's come out

1242
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,370
about some of

1243
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:41,010
the operations

1244
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:41,830
that he did

1245
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:42,530
back in the day

1246
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:43,710
working for this

1247
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,210
hit squad

1248
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,870
under the US government

1249
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,830
sort of privatised.

1250
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,970
And he says

1251
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:49,670
that he has

1252
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,270
a hit list

1253
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,030
that he wants

1254
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,190
a list of

1255
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,210
really freaking

1256
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,390
bad people

1257
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,410
that just need

1258
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,310
to be taken out

1259
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,730
because they won't

1260
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,050
go any other way.

1261
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,090
And he was

1262
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,290
asking for donations

1263
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:04,910
and started

1264
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,010
a Kickstarter plan.

1265
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,940
Now that

1266
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,420
taking

1267
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:12,520
too much

1268
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,120
crowdfunding

1269
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,180
to a whole other level,

1270
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:14,620
man, I...

1271
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,980
Put it on Pledge Me, bro!

1272
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,720
You know,

1273
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,900
I guarantee you

1274
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,480
that fund

1275
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,440
did not end up

1276
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,300
an empty bucket.

1277
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,540
Somebody put some money

1278
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,240
into that cause,

1279
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,740
I know it.

1280
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,440
Only got $20

1281
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,820
in my pocket.

1282
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,320
You know,

1283
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,520
$20 in a

1284
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,060
third world country

1285
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,060
can go a very long way,

1286
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,220
man.

1287
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:32,660
That's at least

1288
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,380
one takeout.

1289
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:33,760
You know,

1290
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,460
you can find somebody

1291
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,000
desperate enough

1292
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,060
to take out one guy

1293
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,360
on $20.

1294
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:36,920
That's at least

1295
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,120
one clip of 9mm.

1296
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:39,340
Yeah,

1297
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,600
throw in a few

1298
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,340
corn dogs,

1299
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:42,920
you're good to go, man.

1300
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,340
You're talking

1301
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,240
making serious,

1302
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:44,600
serious,

1303
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,640
very creative business.

1304
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,340
I like the way

1305
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,100
your mind thinks, man.

1306
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,640
I appreciate that about you.

1307
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,780
I like it too.

1308
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,000
Now,

1309
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:54,680
everybody talks

1310
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,460
about this as well,

1311
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,440
and I don't like

1312
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,380
the idea of violence

1313
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:57,920
or killing

1314
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,720
or anything.

1315
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,040
You know,

1316
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,180
I'm just joking about,

1317
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:00,480
you know,

1318
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,120
sending mercenaries

1319
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:02,640
over there

1320
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,400
to just kill them

1321
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,020
and torture them

1322
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,860
and ruthlessly butcher

1323
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,440
their families

1324
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,300
and things like that

1325
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:06,980
and redistribute

1326
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,600
the wealth, OK?

1327
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,760
It's just a joke, bro, OK?

1328
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:09,600
And in fact,

1329
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,600
that's another thing.

1330
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,540
I figured out

1331
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,840
that my show,

1332
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,800
if I say anything

1333
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,600
that's controversial

1334
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,480
or really horrific

1335
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,520
or something like that

1336
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,240
and people want to, like,

1337
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,300
charge me with inciting

1338
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,460
terrorism or whatever,

1339
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,400
I've got this great

1340
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,120
little caveat

1341
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,500
that I can just

1342
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,400
bust out.

1343
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,080
It was a joke!

1344
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,720
Yeah, man.

1345
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,680
It's about the sound bite.

1346
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,400
You're good to go.

1347
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,300
That's written in ink.

1348
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,000
It's on the internet.

1349
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,860
It never goes away.

1350
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,480
And, you know,

1351
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,100
that's your out.

1352
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,560
It's called

1353
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,020
The Lack of a Smoking Gun.

1354
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,540
And, um,

1355
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,200
it works.

1356
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:38,740
You know?

1357
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,660
Maybe I could have that

1358
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:40,980
as something

1359
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,120
on the opening of the show

1360
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,140
like pre-recorded

1361
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:43,760
or something.

1362
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,220
The Vinny Eastwood Show.

1363
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,680
If anything on this show

1364
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,380
offends you

1365
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,740
or makes you want

1366
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,380
to kill Vinny,

1367
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,220
just remember,

1368
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,440
it was a joke!

1369
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,220
And just remember,

1370
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,120
if that doesn't work,

1371
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,660
the way to always

1372
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,260
get out of everything,

1373
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,780
you see it in all the movies,

1374
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,980
you just claim insanity.

1375
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,500
And Vinny,

1376
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,320
if you did that,

1377
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,340
I would believe you

1378
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,420
because, dude,

1379
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,320
you're borderline insane

1380
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:04,900
and that's what I like

1381
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,440
about you, man.

1382
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,180
Well,

1383
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,080
a lot of people

1384
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,940
call me insane

1385
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,100
and I take it

1386
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,740
as a compliment

1387
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:12,140
because, uh,

1388
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:12,920
in a world

1389
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:13,880
this fucked up,

1390
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,300
if somebody were to say

1391
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,420
that I had a real handle

1392
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,060
on things,

1393
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,020
I'd feel insulted.

1394
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,000
Sanity is

1395
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,400
very overrated, man.

1396
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:24,840
insanity is

1397
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,460
the new cool

1398
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,060
and, uh,

1399
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,740
it really means, um,

1400
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,940
really letting things go

1401
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:30,400
and just saying

1402
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:30,840
fuck it.

1403
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,240
And I know

1404
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:32,660
a lot of people

1405
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,240
that are doing that

1406
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:33,820
very well

1407
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,060
and, um,

1408
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,020
it is the way to go.

1409
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,380
I mean,

1410
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,220
on my business card,

1411
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,560
my tagline is just

1412
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,060
say fuck it

1413
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:39,700
and it works.

1414
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,560
It's not really,

1415
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,420
but I think

1416
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:41,940
I might make that

1417
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,160
known.

1418
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,040
At least part of

1419
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:44,800
my email signature.

1420
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:46,780
Fuckit.com,

1421
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:47,700
um,

1422
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:48,940
you know,

1423
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:49,900
is it an animal,

1424
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,420
mineral,

1425
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,080
or vegetable?

1426
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,040
Can I eat it?

1427
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:52,420
Can I,

1428
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,380
can I,

1429
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:54,840
can I,

1430
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:55,820
can I live in it?

1431
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,500
Can I fuck it?

1432
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,200
Dude,

1433
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:58,480
you just gotta,

1434
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,460
you gotta put everything

1435
00:41:59,460 --> 00:41:59,800
in like,

1436
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,940
can I fuck it filter?

1437
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:01,840
And that makes

1438
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,060
everything really fun,

1439
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:03,520
you know?

1440
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:05,240
wow,

1441
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:05,760
I'm thinking of

1442
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,660
a great business idea.

1443
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:07,600
Yeah,

1444
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,080
yeah,

1445
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,260
yeah,

1446
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,200
fuck it glasses.

1447
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:10,280
You know?

1448
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:11,800
There'll be,

1449
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:12,960
there'll like be a,

1450
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:13,360
a, um,

1451
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,300
an app that you can

1452
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,600
put into Google glasses

1453
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,340
that will just,

1454
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:16,660
um,

1455
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:16,920
you know,

1456
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,700
it'll highlight

1457
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,300
in green

1458
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:18,880
the things that

1459
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,520
you can fuck.

1460
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,100
You know?

1461
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:23,800
Like,

1462
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,200
Jacuzzi air filter system

1463
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,280
or something like that

1464
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,140
lights up in green

1465
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:27,360
and you're like,

1466
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:27,580
really?

1467
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,460
I can fuck that?

1468
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:28,980
Absolutely.

1469
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:29,540
You know,

1470
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,020
it's just

1471
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,200
triple,

1472
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,580
triple-hybrided

1473
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,780
cock-fucking-massager

1474
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,300
right there,

1475
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,340
Never have I ever

1476
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,560
thought that I could,

1477
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,060
you know,

1478
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,240
I could fuck this,

1479
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,540
whatever the,

1480
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,440
what you want to call it,

1481
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:42,920
this widget.

1482
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:43,380
Um,

1483
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,060
you know,

1484
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,000
it really just opens up

1485
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,140
a whole bunch of possibilities.

1486
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,560
The can I fuck it widget

1487
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,920
by briankelly.com.

1488
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:52,880
Oh my,

1489
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,100
my mother,

1490
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,500
my mother's gonna be so proud.

1491
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,740
I can't wait to send her

1492
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,520
the link to this video.

1493
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,380
You make your mama bosom

1494
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,580
swell with pride.

1495
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,280
So what else is going on

1496
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:07,620
with you, man?

1497
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,120
Well,

1498
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:09,480
you know,

1499
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,120
I've just been thinking

1500
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,280
about the Christmas season

1501
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,440
and all the shops

1502
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,340
are starting to put up

1503
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,700
their Christmas decorations

1504
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,380
and apparently they started

1505
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,340
doing it a month ago

1506
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,140
like on television,

1507
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:18,420
like,

1508
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:19,540
so I've heard,

1509
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:19,680
you know,

1510
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,840
watch fucking television,

1511
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,660
but yeah,

1512
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,820
apparently there's been

1513
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:23,880
Christmas advertisements

1514
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,200
going throughout the whole

1515
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,200
month of November

1516
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:26,940
and October

1517
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,160
and it's just like

1518
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:29,420
Christmas season starts

1519
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,480
earlier every year

1520
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,440
because everybody

1521
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:31,940
just goes,

1522
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:32,360
Hey,

1523
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:33,900
you know what makes

1524
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:34,820
people want to part

1525
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,740
with their cash?

1526
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,040
Guilt tripping them

1527
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:37,860
about not buying

1528
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,480
their loved ones

1529
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,020
a present.

1530
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:39,700
Boom!

1531
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,280
Cha-ching!

1532
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,260
It's giving me like,

1533
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:42,960
like,

1534
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,040
where's the Christmas

1535
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:44,660
decorations?

1536
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:46,560
They've got probably

1537
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,920
margins for manufacture.

1538
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,540
Oh my God, man.

1539
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:54,760
Black Friday.

1540
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:55,300
Yeah.

1541
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,140
I haven't,

1542
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:57,880
I don't know.

1543
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:58,240
I don't,

1544
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,140
I'm not sure how

1545
00:43:59,140 --> 00:43:59,960
any of that stuff

1546
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:00,780
we're advertising.

1547
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:01,180
I mean,

1548
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:01,860
all that stuff

1549
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,320
is just so,

1550
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:02,960
so far outside

1551
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,100
of my reality anymore

1552
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,700
that I find it hard

1553
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,780
to believe that anybody

1554
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,540
is still going out

1555
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,640
and dropping thousands

1556
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,100
of dollars

1557
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:11,880
leading up to Christmas.

1558
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:12,740
I don't know.

1559
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,620
It's just a concept

1560
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,700
that doesn't make sense

1561
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,320
to me anymore.

1562
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:15,620
I mean,

1563
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,200
don't get me wrong.

1564
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:16,880
I go home,

1565
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:17,660
I celebrate Christmas,

1566
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:18,760
I buy my family

1567
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,020
a few,

1568
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:19,580
a few,

1569
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,600
a few cool things.

1570
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:21,560
Um,

1571
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:22,420
but the,

1572
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,060
it's funny because

1573
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:23,580
somebody asked me

1574
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,080
the other day,

1575
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,160
here in Bali,

1576
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:25,520
because it's where

1577
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,100
I'm living now.

1578
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:26,560
Oh,

1579
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,360
you're going over there?

1580
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:27,560
Oh,

1581
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,200
you're Christian?

1582
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,380
They just assume

1583
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:29,780
that everybody

1584
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,700
that celebrates Christmas

1585
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,300
is Christian.

1586
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:32,880
I'm like,

1587
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,020
no,

1588
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:33,980
even atheists,

1589
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:34,280
I think,

1590
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:34,900
in the United States

1591
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,680
celebrate Christmas

1592
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,660
and that's how

1593
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,480
well ingrained

1594
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,040
the Christmas

1595
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,400
condition shopping

1596
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:42,840
um,

1597
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,000
program

1598
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:44,980
is

1599
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,940
within people that

1600
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:46,700
they don't even have to

1601
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,500
believe in

1602
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,460
what Christmas

1603
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,220
is supposed to represent.

1604
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,260
They still go out

1605
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:51,060
and buy shitloads

1606
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:51,600
of stuff

1607
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,640
that they don't need

1608
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,020
for Christmas.

1609
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:53,160
See,

1610
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:53,400
me,

1611
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,100
I celebrate Ramadan

1612
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:55,920
um,

1613
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,280
by drinking and smoking more

1614
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,000
because the Muslims can't.

1615
00:44:59,020 --> 00:44:59,120
Ha,

1616
00:44:59,320 --> 00:44:59,520
ha,

1617
00:44:59,740 --> 00:44:59,840

00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:45,580
ha,

1651
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:45,820
ha,

1652
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:46,440
ha,

1653
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,220

1654
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:47,340

ha,

1659
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:56,580
ha,

1660
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:57,160
ha,

1661
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:57,260
ha,

1662
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,160
ha,

1663
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,040
ha,

1664
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:15,860
ha,

1665
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:16,560
ha,

1666
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,120
ha,

1667
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:18,080
ha,

1668
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,140
ha,

1669
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,040
ha,

1670
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:26,800
ha,

1671
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:27,180
ha,

1672
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,400
ha,

1673
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,160
ha,

1674
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:49,720
ha,

1675
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:50,900
ha,

1676
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:51,640
ha,

1677
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,300
ha,

1678
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:56,960
ha,

1679
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,220
Because I'm a sensitive and empathetic person,

1680
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,260
I actually give a fuck when they tell me

1681
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,180
about this kind of shit.

1682
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,980
So I take on some of their baggage

1683
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,680
in order to lighten the load for them.

1684
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,020
Lighten the load, I do.

1685
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,720
But however, I get stuck with the baggage.

1686
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,940
And after a period of time,

1687
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,220
I got so much other people's baggage on me

1688
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:18,620
that I literally start to have meltdowns.

1689
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,940
Like on a daily basis kind of thing.

1690
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,080
I get really angry for no reason.

1691
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,040
I start yelling and screaming at the computer.

1692
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,880
In fact, I yell and scream at the computer

1693
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,040
quite a lot.

1694
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:28,940
Fucking piece of shit.

1695
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,120
LAUGHS

1696
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,800
You and me both, bro.

1697
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,620
You and me both, man.

1698
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1699
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:44,500
It's when we live in a world that is fueled

1700
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:49,740
by massive amounts of just sickness

1701
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:50,760
on so many levels.

1702
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:53,140
I mean, it's so, it's, you get,

1703
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,240
it's very easy to fall within that viewpoint

1704
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,640
of holy shit, the world is going to hell

1705
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,540
in a handbasket and everything is just fucked

1706
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,840
and it doesn't matter what we're going to do.

1707
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,420
I mean, I know a lot of those people

1708
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,400
that they think that humanity is heading

1709
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,180
toward its final point,

1710
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:10,840
where we're not going to be around much longer.

1711
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,060
And, you know, shit is fucked.

1712
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,940
This shit is really fucked up on a lot of levels.

1713
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,280
I mean, I know you've seen the thick of it

1714
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,520
with some of the people that you brought

1715
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,620
on your show over the years.

1716
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,400
Oh, we seem to have lost Brian.

1717
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,260
Yeah, he's gone.

1718
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,080
Bugger.

1719
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,740
All right, that's very unfortunate.

1720
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,000
Anyway, yeah, well, something you were saying

1721
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,680
before was kind of interesting to me.

1722
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,440
Like when you get up on Monday morning,

1723
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,340
you know, you're not stressed

1724
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,600
because you don't have any schedule to keep

1725
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,660
or anything like that.

1726
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,080
And that's not too similar to me.

1727
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,280
I mean, like I've got a schedule to keep,

1728
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,840
for example, on Mondays I do nothing.

1729
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,660
All right, you know, I hated Mondays for so long

1730
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,680
that I officially, you know, decided

1731
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,420
that I'd do four days a week of talk radio

1732
00:49:58,420 --> 00:49:59,680
so I wouldn't have to work on Mondays.

1733
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,740
But in the United States sense of the word,

1734
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,200
it means I don't have to work on Saturdays

1735
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,540
because we're a day ahead of you on this timeline.

1736
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,160
But something with Brian was talking to me

1737
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,900
about time management, right?

1738
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,780
And I remember I interviewed this guy

1739
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,560
who's like expert on, what would you call them?

1740
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:24,560
Entrepreneurs.

1741
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,780
And he says that they've got a system

1742
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,640
called organic time.

1743
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,000
All right, now really think about this.

1744
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:31,740
If you didn't have a watch,

1745
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,280
you didn't have a clock or anything like that

1746
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,720
and you're just sitting there,

1747
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,240
you're working away on something

1748
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,400
for a period of time and you go,

1749
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,780
I really don't feel like doing this anymore.

1750
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:44,560
I'm gonna take a break from it

1751
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,720
and you go off and you do something else.

1752
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,020
Organic time, you just operate by your feelings.

1753
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,580
You do what you feel you wanna

1754
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,720
and you take breaks when you need to.

1755
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,640
It's not like having a set schedule.

1756
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,240
You gotta be at work by 8 a.m.

1757
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:07,160
I'm usually up and working by 8 a.m. anyway.

1758
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,000
But that's by choice.

1759
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,180
It's not because I've got a schedule.

1760
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,660
Just get up and start working.

1761
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,640
There's nothing else to do around here.

1762
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,640
What am I gonna do?

1763
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,320
Sit on my deck chair, watch the sunrise?

1764
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,600
That's boring as hell.

1765
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,020
I'll just stick a camera there

1766
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:26,060
and then use it as a slow creeping shot in the video later.

1767
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,240
Better idea.

1768
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:31,880
But yeah, you'd be surprised

1769
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,040
how much more productive you can be

1770
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,420
when you're not on somebody else's time card.

1771
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,900
When you make your own time.

1772
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:40,940
And you'll find this as well,

1773
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,100
is that you can make time.

1774
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,380
You can actually manufacture time

1775
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,280
out of thin air just like that.

1776
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:50,640
Quite interesting.

1777
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,860
It might sound a bit confusing at first,

1778
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,160
but here's how...

1779
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,180
The person you are trying to reach

1780
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,000
is not accepting calls at this time.

1781
00:51:59,140 --> 00:51:59,560
Can we hang up now?

1782
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:00,720
Please try your call again later.

1783
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,120
Yeah, there we go.

1784
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,100
Shoot, what did I do?

1785
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,200
Totally missed my place.

1786
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:08,240
Man, that was distracting.

1787
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,840
Haven't had any coffee for the entire hour as well.

1788
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,840
Brain's starting to freeze up.

1789
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,740
Yeah, I'm saying the word uh and um

1790
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:19,460
too much.

1791
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,040
When you have coffee,

1792
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,240
ladies and gentlemen,

1793
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,980
very important for talk radio show hosts.

1794
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,500
Gives you increase in cognitive function

1795
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,100
and provided it's not GMO

1796
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,620
or sprayed with nasty chemicals and stuff,

1797
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:37,500
it can actually not be that bad for you.

1798
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,060
I heard that people who drink a bit of coffee

1799
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,180
live longer.

1800
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,840
And I can understand that.

1801
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,000
Because if I didn't have coffee,

1802
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,800
I wouldn't want to live that long.

1803
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,740
That cracked me up.

1804
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,300
I do, I do.

1805
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,780
But anyway, yeah.

1806
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,400
You know, I don't want to sound too pushy here,

1807
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,840
but quit your job.

1808
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:12,940
Okay.

1809
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,680
Because it's dragging you down,

1810
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,300
you know,

1811
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,220
unless, of course,

1812
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,760
you actually have one of those very rare instances

1813
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,660
where you're working with cool people,

1814
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:25,360
you're doing cool stuff,

1815
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,780
and it's really fulfilling.

1816
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,440
You know, it actually makes you happy

1817
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,920
and you get home at the end of the day

1818
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:31,660
and you feel great.

1819
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,420
And you can actually raise your kids.

1820
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:37,100
You got more than enough money to get by

1821
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,320
and you contribute to society as well.

1822
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,880
And in your spare time,

1823
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,060
you're not just working and relaxing.

1824
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:47,340
You're actually doing something else on your own time.

1825
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,640
Dude, that's like one of the perfect things.

1826
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,200
I actually wish I could do that.

1827
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,620
You know, it'd be cool to have a nice, fun,

1828
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,200
cool job with a whole bunch of mates

1829
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,380
and get paid a hell of a lot

1830
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,500
to do some really awesome stuff

1831
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,060
that's very interesting and fulfilling.

1832
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,320
As well as at the end of the day,

1833
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,140
be able to go home and do a whole bunch of activism.

1834
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,820
But unfortunately, there's not enough time.

1835
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,420
So I made it, you know.

1836
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:23,380
Just go, okay, let's have a look at the things in my life

1837
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:24,660
that are soaking up my time

1838
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,520
and let's eliminate them one by one

1839
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,000
in order to free up time for the things that I want to do.

1840
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,120
Just that simple.

1841
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:33,280
Now, American Freedom Radio is having a marathon

1842
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,260
at the end of this week, I believe on Saturday.

1843
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,900
So make sure to check that one out.

1844
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:44,600
There's Jordan Maxwell, Carol Rosin, Dean Clifford,

1845
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,000
and some dude from Iraq,

1846
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,480
something Ford or whatever about WMDs.

1847
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,160
It's on Sunday, sorry, Sunday.

1848
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,760
So yeah, tune into that, ladies and gentlemen,

1849
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,860
and throw a few bucks American Freedom Radio's way.

1850
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,340
And while you're at it,

1851
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:00,940
throw me something for Christmas as well.

1852
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,520
You know, because what am I going to do?

1853
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,580
You know, big, big the universe for presents.

1854
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,020
We'll see you after the break, ladies and gentlemen.

1855
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:08,880
Don't you go anywhere.

1856
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,760
Welcome to the world's meeting place.

1857
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,400

Freedom.

1860
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,800
Oh, yes.

1861
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,660
I like very much radio.

1862
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,220

00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:52,360
and none have the nutritional value of the hemp plant?

1889
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,360
apart from a few honorable advertisers

1890
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,600
that we would give ad space to even if they couldn't pay us.

1891
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,780
In this quest to deliver quality radio

1892
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,520
with very few annoying ads,

1893
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,600
we are now asking the listeners like you

1894
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,280
to open up and become partners

1895
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,700
with American Freedom Radio.

1896
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,840
We all know the economy is controlled

1897
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,620
and a new system called the peer-to-peer economy

1898
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,220
is now within our grasp.

1899
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,680
That means if you'd like this network

1900
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,600
with its incredible hosts and credible information

1901
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:19,360
to be nothing but the content you want to hear,

1902
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:22,600
then you must realize that you cannot be a part of it

1903
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,800
if you're just sitting on the sidelines watching.

1904
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,320
Go to AmericanFreedomRadio.com

1905
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,080
and pledge your support today.

1906
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,080
Donate according to your means.

1907
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,380
Some can only afford $1 a month

1908
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:35,800
while others can afford $100 a month.

1909
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:38,100
Regardless of the size of your contribution,

1910
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:40,680
it all adds up to keeping the network owners

1911
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,320
and the radio hosts housed and fed

1912
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,580
at the end of every month.

1913
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,440
Thank you.

1914
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,020
We are living in a new era.

1915
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,680
Partnerships are more important than profit

1916
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,020
and gratitude is more respected than greed.

1917
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:58,160
As the millennial generation evolves the corporate landscape,

1918
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:00,060
our company aims to maximize

1919
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,540

1920
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:05,580
and push the limits of what's possible by 2020.

1921
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,320

1922

and is geared to assist the efforts of different nations

1926
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,960
to change the landscape,

1927
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,260
various pain-related healthcare costs,

1928
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:21,880
epilepsy and autism,

1929
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,520
rising mental disorders,

1930
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:25,580
and even soldier suicides.

1931
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,780

with true independence.

1942
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,860
The freedom to broadcast the truth is not free at all.

1943
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,460
So what is American Freedom Radio worth to you?

1944
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,620
The empowering information with fun,

1945
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,740
honest and pure integrity behind it

1946
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,200
provides an example to follow.

1947
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:08,140
Friendships to flourish with the moral altruism

1948
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,260

1961
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,720
Vaccine, psychotropic drugs

1962
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,000
and artillery batteries not included.

1963
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:16,810
Welcome back to our number two

1964
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:18,610
of the Vinnie Eastwood Show.

1965
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:21,230
Broadcasting via pirate radio signal

1966
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:24,070
from the private prisons run by General Zod.

1967
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:26,370
Located in the freshly terraformed

1968
01:00:26,370 --> 01:00:29,050
Krypton colony of Auckland, New Zealand.

1969
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:31,450
Humanity's last and best hope

1970
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:34,330
in the fight against taking ourselves too seriously.

1971
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:37,470
Here's your host, Vinnie Eastwood.

1972
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:44,160
Welcome back to our number two

1973
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,880
of the fastest two hours in talk radio.

1974
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,780
It's the Vinnie Eastwood Show

1975
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:52,600
broadcasting live on American Freedom Radio.

1976
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:55,840
Now, if the studio is willing,

1977
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:58,080
I'd really like to open the call lines up

1978
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,680
and allow the listeners to ring in.

1979
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:04,200
I'll let you know when those lines are open.

1980
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:08,480
The number is 218-339-8525.

1981
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:12,580
That's 218-339-8525.

1982
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:15,400
If you're in New Zealand like me,

1983
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,480
you need to call like a plus one

1984
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,280
or a plus zero or something.

1985
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,300
It's definitely a plus one on top of that puppy

1986
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,880
for that international calling.

1987
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,220
And sometimes it doesn't actually even cost

1988
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,320
that much to call the states.

1989
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,900
I used to sell like toll calls for a living

1990
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:31,280
and stuff like that, you know.

1991
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:34,000
It should be remarkably cheap.

1992
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:35,720
Sometimes it can even be cheaper

1993
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,380
than calling other places in New Zealand,

1994
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,680
depending on the time of the day.

1995
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,420
But yeah, anyway,

1996
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:50,300
I want to also kind of thank Brian Kelly

1997
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:53,060
for coming on and being a good dude.

1998
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,080
However, moving on,

1999
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:59,900
we were talking in the first hour

2000
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:03,680
about religion.

2001
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,900
And the caller lines are now open.

2002
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,160
So if you'd like to call in

2003
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,420
and express your thoughts on that

2004
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:11,440
or anything else,

2005
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,880
you want to ask me anything.

2006
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:14,880
Don't feel uncomfortable.

2007
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,420
Seriously, I'm Vinnie.

2008
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:19,440
I'm comfortable with everything.

2009
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:23,240
You can just come straight on up

2010
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,740
and ask me anything you want.

2011
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:28,520
So long as it's not abusive

2012
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:32,800
or defamatory or something within reason.

2013
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,160
So the caller lines are now open.

2014
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:40,820
The number is 218-339-8525.

2015
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:45,560
That's 218-339-8525.

2016
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,020
That's the number to ring in there.

2017
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,360
Please call in now.

2018
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,500
If you're listening, please call.

2019
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,080
Because I've run out of ideas.

2020
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,400
I'm coming to the end of my tether.

2021
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,520
I'm freaking exhausted.

2022
01:02:59,280 --> 01:02:59,900
And in the meantime,

2023
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:00,700
it's just going to be like

2024
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,480
a one-man therapy session.

2025
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:04,120
I'm just going to freaking unload on you.

2026
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,140
In the last hour,

2027
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:06,320
I talked about all the baggage

2028
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,980
that was being draped on me

2029
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:09,580
by all the people that I've got on

2030
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:11,340
as guests and all the trolls

2031
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,360
and everything that come out

2032
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,300
after the videos

2033
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,840
and just fucking with them all the time.

2034
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,160
It's like, oh my God.

2035
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,620
Sometimes it's just too much, bro.

2036
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:21,720
Honestly.

2037
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:23,640
And it's not just like

2038
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,380
it's too much all of a sudden.

2039
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,540
It creeps up on you.

2040
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:29,260
And I think I...

2041
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,740
I only really get about two weeks warning.

2042
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:36,700
I can only handle about

2043
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,440
a fortnight worth of shows

2044
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,580
when I don't want to.

2045
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:42,400
That's the only reason

2046
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,700
why I'm here right now

2047
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,440
is because of my obligation

2048
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:47,060
to the network.

2049
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,200
Network didn't ask me.

2050
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,600
I can take any day off I want.

2051
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,520
But I feel obliged to be here.

2052
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:54,480
And the fact that I really

2053
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:55,640
don't feel like it

2054
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,280
is kind of inconsequential.

2055
01:03:58,420 --> 01:03:58,940
I mean, really,

2056
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:00,740
there's a broader scheme at play here.

2057
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:05,820
However, I'm not going to risk burnout over it,

2058
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:07,840
which is why I'm going to be

2059
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:09,900
going on holiday soon.

2060
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,320
Holiday for me is doing nothing.

2061
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,580
Other people who work when...

2062
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:18,760
I mean, their job sucks

2063
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,320
or whatever and life is hard,

2064
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:22,100
et cetera, et cetera.

2065
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:26,300
However, when you're an activist,

2066
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:28,160
taking a holiday is simply not working.

2067
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,180
I just have to stay at home,

2068
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,840
maybe do some stuff around the house,

2069
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:39,020
maybe catch up on some stuff.

2070
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,460
It's not terribly exciting.

2071
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:47,320
I would like to go away somewhere,

2072
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,660
somewhere I haven't been.

2073
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,300
And I found out that

2074
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,680
because of my drug dealing conviction

2075
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:57,660
when I was a teenager,

2076
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,640
I have to disclose that to the US government

2077
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,720
if I ever want to come there.

2078
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,320
And in fact, I have to disclose it to everywhere.

2079
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,880
Because although New Zealand has a law

2080
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,180
called the Clean Slate Scheme,

2081
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:11,740
which says after seven years,

2082
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,460
all your records are kept secret

2083
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:16,100
and nobody can even ask them for you.

2084
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:18,340
Unfortunately, New Zealand legislation

2085
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,640
doesn't apply in other countries.

2086
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:21,920
That's the little caveat

2087
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,000
that they've got on that.

2088
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,860
And they don't advertise that widely

2089
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,820
as they should, I think.

2090
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:28,020
Clean Slate Scheme,

2091
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:30,040
it only helps you

2092
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,120
if you're in New Zealand,

2093
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,900
which means you can't really leave the country.

2094
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,560
Not with a conviction like mine.

2095
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,560
I only had like fricking 13 grams on me.

2096
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:47,300
That was it.

2097
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:50,900
And I got 300 hours community service.

2098
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:51,940
I was lucky I didn't go to jail

2099
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:53,060
for up to eight years.

2100
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,520
You know, they treat it more seriously

2101
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,560
than manslaughter, bro.

2102
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:01,090
They really do.

2103
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:05,030
There was a dude up in front of me

2104
01:06:05,690 --> 01:06:08,090
who was like growing five plants

2105
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:14,580
and sexual assault, resisting arrest.

2106
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:19,540
And this is like his umpteenth time in court.

2107
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,400
Gets 150 hours community service.

2108
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:25,900
I go up pleading guilty.

2109
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,180
13 grams of cannabis.

2110
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:30,840
First time I've ever been in trouble

2111
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,320
with a law at all.

2112
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:35,980
And 300 hours community service.

2113
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:37,960
Just like that.

2114
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:39,200
It's unbelievable.

2115
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:42,180
Almost as unbelievable as the guy

2116
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:43,520
who was before the guy in front of me.

2117
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:47,500
It was like some recovering heroin addict

2118
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:51,080
who was in there, quite literally,

2119
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:56,340
because he stole a jar of raspberry jam.

2120
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:57,900
All right.

2121
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,660
And BP took him to court.

2122
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,000
You know, pay a lawyer to prosecute him

2123
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:04,380
and everything.

2124
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,520
And then the court ordered reparations

2125
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,900
of like $4.16 to replace the jar of jam.

2126
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:17,640
Oh, man.

2127
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:19,940
Those are harsh times.

2128
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:22,020
You know, I almost have a panic attack

2129
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:24,460
when I start thinking about bank,

2130
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,540
how hard it was

2131
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:28,180
and how young I was, how naive.

2132
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:31,440
My God, I was a very different creature back then.

2133
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,560
It was just 10 years ago.

2134
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:33,940
Bugger me.

2135
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:37,060
The years do fly when you're exposed

2136
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:38,360
in scumbaggery, I must say.

2137
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,460
And I think I figured out the reason why

2138
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,120
time seems to pass quicker

2139
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,360
when you mostly focus on scumbaggery.

2140
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,540
It's because there's so much of it

2141
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:54,160
that you get lost in like this kind of k-hole.

2142
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,060
The scumbaggery k-hole.

2143
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,840
And just a heads up,

2144
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:03,080
we've got a caller in there.

2145
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:07,880
The Greek wants to join in via Skype.

2146
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:11,080
So if you want to connect them up,

2147
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:13,300
AFR, that'd be lovely.

2148
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,760
Or Greek, if you want to message AFR

2149
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,020
and get them to bring you in,

2150
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:18,340
that will work as well.

2151
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:22,399
And kind of maybe talk on religion for a bit.

2152
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,140
Hmm, the Greek talking about religion.

2153
01:08:25,939 --> 01:08:27,180
Fuck me, that could be dangerous.

2154
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,920
Man, I've really got to turn down

2155
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,060
the gain on my mic somewhat, don't I?

2156
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:39,939
It's like so loud and I'm like laughing all the time

2157
01:08:39,939 --> 01:08:41,960
and it's just like going crazy.

2158
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:43,240
It's terrible, isn't it?

2159
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,260
So sorry about that, ladies and gentlemen.

2160
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,200
Is this better?

2161
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,540
I hope it is.

2162
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:50,479
Because if not, I'm screwed.

2163
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:55,760
But yeah, I wanted to kind of relate

2164
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:59,060
the reason why I make jokes about everything.

2165
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:01,020
All right?

2166
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,180
You want to know the real honest truth

2167
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,399
why I make jokes about everything?

2168
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:09,560
Because I'll go crazy if I don't.

2169
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:13,069
Real crazy.

2170
01:09:14,750 --> 01:09:17,250
You know, it's as simple as I can explain it.

2171
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:23,109
The terrible, terrible thing

2172
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:26,490
about being a comedian

2173
01:09:27,149 --> 01:09:28,770
is that you're smart enough

2174
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:31,609
to realize how bad things are.

2175
01:09:32,609 --> 01:09:35,410
And your only coping mechanism is to laugh at them.

2176
01:09:35,649 --> 01:09:36,569
You can't change them.

2177
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:39,270
You can explain them to people

2178
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:41,170
and help them see it for what it is.

2179
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:44,410
Seeing something for what it is

2180
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:46,490
is actually pretty powerful.

2181
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:50,170
You know, I mean, here's another thing.

2182
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:51,890
A lot of truthers who don't contribute

2183
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:53,370
to the truth movement don't make videos

2184
01:09:53,370 --> 01:09:56,830
or do radio shows or do activism of any kind.

2185
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:58,890
They're really hard on themselves

2186
01:09:58,890 --> 01:09:59,650
and they shouldn't be.

2187
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:00,850
You know?

2188
01:10:01,690 --> 01:10:05,310
It's a big, big machine, this world.

2189
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:08,750
And if you don't have the kind of, you know,

2190
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:13,610
narcissistic flair like people like me have

2191
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:16,470
to get on talk radio and just

2192
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:20,550
riff it for hours on end just because you can,

2193
01:10:20,990 --> 01:10:22,550
don't feel bad about yourself

2194
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:24,710
that you're not contributing in that way.

2195
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:26,770
That's your own way to contribute somewhere.

2196
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:28,370
You know, it might just be

2197
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:30,690
raising your kids right, you know?

2198
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:34,090
Maybe your kids will do something really big

2199
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:36,430
in the future that will change the world.

2200
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:39,630
Just raising your kids right is good enough.

2201
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:41,670
So I told somebody at a party this one time.

2202
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:45,370
Now, we've been joined by the Greek.

2203
01:10:45,370 --> 01:10:46,810
He's the only Greek I know.

2204
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,660
Hey, I've heard that before.

2205
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:54,470
Hey, and we don't,

2206
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:57,020
and New Zealanders don't use the word mate.

2207
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:57,840
We use the word.

2208
01:10:57,840 --> 01:10:58,180
No, it's Kiwi.

2209
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:00,320
We use the word bro.

2210
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,320
Oh, that's right, bro.

2211
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,920
And like Hawaii, it's bra.

2212
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:05,980
I forgot about that.

2213
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:08,000
That's also in South Africa.

2214
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,800
Yeah, mate, I'll just have to go down to the shop

2215
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:12,980
to get some cigarettes bra.

2216
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:14,680
Yeah, it's the bra.

2217
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:16,640
So what has gotten into you?

2218
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,120
Why do you want to discuss about religion?

2219
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,180
Or what about religion?

2220
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:22,400
What do you mean, right?

2221
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:23,560
Yeah, let's go.

2222
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:26,720
Maybe I'm maybe I'm masochistic, you know,

2223
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:29,480
and I need a whole bunch of fucking crazy,

2224
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:31,660
religious, zealot, crazy,

2225
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:34,000
fucking stupid people coming at me

2226
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,280
and attacking me for talking some sense.

2227
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:37,300
All right.

2228
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:37,680
All right.

2229
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:40,120
Religion just means something you do regularly.

2230
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,480
Like I do that religiously, right?

2231
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,440
We do this or that.

2232
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:45,500
Like I brush my teeth or tie my shoelaces.

2233
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,140
And do talk radio, right?

2234
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:48,960
Or something like that.

2235
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,760
Religiously, it's just that's all it means.

2236
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:53,420
And I think what people have turned in a second.

2237
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:54,000
Wait a second.

2238
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,580
Does that mean you can masturbate religiously?

2239
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:57,900
Yeah.

2240
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:59,100
If you're a master.

2241
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:00,700
Or a priest.

2242
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,420
Sorry, you were saying?

2243
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:10,830
Have we lost you?

2244
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:12,690
Just for a moment.

2245
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:14,230
That wasn't very religious.

2246
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:15,670
OK.

2247
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:16,930
All right.

2248
01:12:17,210 --> 01:12:21,690
Well, I usually go around saying things

2249
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:24,030
like there's not a religion on the planet

2250
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:25,590
that does or knows anything

2251
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:28,630
that's in the texts that they allegedly subscribe to.

2252
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:33,150
And I'll challenge anyone to bring up anything in any religion.

2253
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:35,330
And I will show you that what they're saying

2254
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:37,990
will not be found in context

2255
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:41,430
in any of the texts that they allegedly subscribe to.

2256
01:12:42,170 --> 01:12:42,510
Period.

2257
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:45,130
That is a fact on this planet.

2258
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:48,670
So I think we're lost our minds

2259
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:51,190
because it's not really based on anything.

2260
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:52,830
Neither is the money.

2261
01:12:52,970 --> 01:12:53,710
Neither is medicine.

2262
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:54,530
Neither is anything.

2263
01:12:54,890 --> 01:12:56,310
So in that case.

2264
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:59,470
Anything that has a major hierarchical structure

2265
01:12:59,470 --> 01:13:01,710
and one big central leader or central figure

2266
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:02,790
that you're not allowed to question

2267
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:04,870
or bring to court on child pedophile charges.

2268
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:06,310
It's a cult.

2269
01:13:07,330 --> 01:13:08,290
Or pedophile.

2270
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:11,790
A pedophile is someone who likes shoes.

2271
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:12,610
But anyway.

2272
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:13,710
No, no, actually.

2273
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:15,870
Actually, there's also a pedophile

2274
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:18,310
or somebody who really likes bicycles.

2275
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:19,630
Right.

2276
01:13:19,930 --> 01:13:21,270
Or a velophile.

2277
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:22,730
That would be anyway.

2278
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:25,250
And there's also a PDF file,

2279
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:26,450
but that's for a Word document.

2280
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:29,350
Yeah, for those that are wordy.

2281
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:36,510
But OK, you know, the secular historians,

2282
01:13:36,890 --> 01:13:38,310
which are self-professed,

2283
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:40,830
self-professed atheists, typically professors,

2284
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:43,610
they'll tell you this is the Christian era.

2285
01:13:44,150 --> 01:13:46,910
So it is really when you when people say Christianity,

2286
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:49,170
you know, that is the predominant one.

2287
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:52,170
And in the news lately, it's been the Islamic one.

2288
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:57,170
So I don't know which way you want to go.

2289
01:13:57,570 --> 01:13:59,950
Well, I was also thinking the other day

2290
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:01,930
about persecution.

2291
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:04,390
You know, persecution of anybody for anything

2292
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:06,570
is not really a good thing

2293
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:07,690
if they're not harming anybody.

2294
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:11,690
But the some Christians get persecuted

2295
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:13,250
and they freaking deserve it.

2296
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:15,950
You know, just like if you some.

2297
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:19,730
What were those people who like hang out outside

2298
01:14:19,730 --> 01:14:22,310
the America's most hated family?

2299
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:24,670
They hang outside the graves of veterans

2300
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:26,990
holding big signs that said God hates fags,

2301
01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:29,890
you know, and they get what they got.

2302
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:31,650
Which God?

2303
01:14:31,850 --> 01:14:33,450
Because the fags have their own God as well.

2304
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:35,770
So you're going to have to work that one out.

2305
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:38,670
But anyway, it's the fag God, you know,

2306
01:14:38,710 --> 01:14:41,850
and they have a they have a little

2307
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:44,990
bathhouse on the top of Mount Olympus.

2308
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:46,650
There you go.

2309
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:51,430
Where the mountain goes on.

2310
01:14:51,930 --> 01:14:52,650
Yeah, yeah.

2311
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:54,790
Those Greeks, they would do the guys

2312
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:55,730
would all do each other

2313
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:57,030
and then go home and beat their wives.

2314
01:14:57,170 --> 01:14:58,410
Yeah, those ancient Greeks.

2315
01:14:58,550 --> 01:14:58,730
Yeah.

2316
01:14:59,250 --> 01:15:01,650
But anyway, that was the festival,

2317
01:15:01,790 --> 01:15:03,350
I guess that's coming up that everyone

2318
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:06,230
in the darkest day of the darkest part of the month.

2319
01:15:06,390 --> 01:15:07,830
You know, it's coming up here for everyone.

2320
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:09,670
They got their own version of it.

2321
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:12,350
But yeah, God is an oxymoron

2322
01:15:12,350 --> 01:15:13,050
because there's many.

2323
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:17,090
It's kind of like saying ant or well, no.

2324
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:19,530
You know how we use language in a certain way

2325
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:20,190
that's accepted.

2326
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:21,730
You know, we could say it's an army.

2327
01:15:22,370 --> 01:15:23,190
You know, we don't mean.

2328
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:26,430
Well, it's just one person in the army.

2329
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:28,450
We know when we say army, it's a multitude.

2330
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:32,090
And people have forgotten that when they say God,

2331
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:33,310
it's a multitude of gods.

2332
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:35,790
And that's in all of the ancient texts.

2333
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:37,190
And of course, who cares about

2334
01:15:37,190 --> 01:15:38,270
what the ancient texts say?

2335
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:40,010
Because those people were ignorant and savage.

2336
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:40,910
Of course, you know,

2337
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:43,890
you know, we don't have to read any of that stuff.

2338
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:46,110
We have computers now.

2339
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:47,830
We don't know anything.

2340
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:49,470
Well, we have we have into.

2341
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:50,810
I mean, we have religion now.

2342
01:15:50,910 --> 01:15:52,150
We don't need to read what these things

2343
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:53,150
are supposedly based on.

2344
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:57,230
But yeah, that's that's one of the interesting parts.

2345
01:15:57,810 --> 01:16:00,850
It's part of the I call cosmic censorship.

2346
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:05,590
The planet has been cosmically censored by forces.

2347
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:08,070
I'm not talking about the archons and the reptilians

2348
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:10,750
and all the crap you hear on the Internet going on,

2349
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:12,550
because if you listen to all that

2350
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:13,590
and see what it's based on,

2351
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:14,710
it's based on nothing again.

2352
01:16:14,710 --> 01:16:17,870
But there if you look at what's been memorialized

2353
01:16:17,870 --> 01:16:18,930
for thousands of years,

2354
01:16:19,090 --> 01:16:21,010
there is a cosmic censorship put in,

2355
01:16:21,130 --> 01:16:24,510
put on mankind to stuff up his ears and his eyes

2356
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:25,670
so he can't perceive.

2357
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:27,490
Isn't that interesting?

2358
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:29,670
Well, I don't know.

2359
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:31,710
Sounds like the mainstream media's job to me.

2360
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:33,810
Along with other things.

2361
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:34,090
Yeah.

2362
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:36,690
And the cons, let's go back to the persecution.

2363
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:38,830
You know, all that persecution,

2364
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:42,510
a lot of those people that do the persecuting

2365
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:44,610
just want to persecute for any damn reason.

2366
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:46,530
It's just the way they are.

2367
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:51,820
I was also thinking the other day,

2368
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:54,140
and this is actually the thought that I originally had,

2369
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:55,460
but I forgot to express it,

2370
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:58,160
is that my heart actually goes out to people

2371
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,540
who are persecuted for their beliefs.

2372
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:05,780
You know, I really do feel that probably

2373
01:17:06,940 --> 01:17:10,760
some of the widest persecuted groups at the moment

2374
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,200
are Muslims and Christians.

2375
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,060
And that's interesting

2376
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:15,580
because they're persecuting each other.

2377
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,060
But hold on.

2378
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:17,500
But hold on.

2379
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,160
If all you're going on is belief,

2380
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:20,520
maybe you should be persecuted

2381
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,240
because you're really stupid.

2382
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:22,920
Sorry.

2383
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:27,040
You need to actually pursue something that's substantive.

2384
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,820
What has happened is that people have,

2385
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,020
what's been put on them,

2386
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,820
because it's easy.

2387
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:35,060
It's kind of like, you know,

2388
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,820
eating out of a can or microwaving food.

2389
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,480
Who wants to cook an hour and a half dinner anymore, right?

2390
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:43,280
So what they do is they've convinced everyone,

2391
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:46,360
oh, you have a right to believe in what you want to,

2392
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:46,940
and that's it.

2393
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,160
As long as you show up to work tomorrow,

2394
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:48,860
and pay your taxes,

2395
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:50,180
and go to war when we tell you to.

2396
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:53,160
Well, you say that maybe they should reprioritize

2397
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:55,100
and try to live a life of substance.

2398
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,160
But do you think that having a belief

2399
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,660
instead of knowing what it is,

2400
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,620
do you think that that in and of itself

2401
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:04,560
can deprive somebody of having a life of substance?

2402
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:06,260
Oh, absolutely.

2403
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,840
Because your life of substance is governed by law,

2404
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:11,960
meaning not traffic law or tax law or whatever,

2405
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,120
or cannabis laws,

2406
01:18:13,660 --> 01:18:16,160
but law is what you eat, what you wear,

2407
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:18,600
how you keep time, how you raise a family,

2408
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,740
how you plant your crops,

2409
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:20,780
how you deal with your neighbor,

2410
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:21,760
how you get into a contract.

2411
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:22,620
You see what I mean?

2412
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:23,700
Law is like, what is your,

2413
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:25,860
what they call ethics and morality,

2414
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,380
and also your functional,

2415
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:29,620
how you function in the world, right?

2416
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:31,520
That comes from your deity, from your God.

2417
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:35,200
Well, I pray to my God all the time.

2418
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,660
No, no, it's nothing to do with prayer.

2419
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:38,120
That's, now prayer is when you,

2420
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:39,420
it's like in the military,

2421
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:42,040
you have the communications officer, right?

2422
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:44,500
That's the guy who communicates.

2423
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:45,720
That's communication.

2424
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,100
That's a technology as well.

2425
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:48,920
Prayer is a, you know, it's interesting.

2426
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:52,220
You ever seen the Christian meme?

2427
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,040
They show you putting your hands closed, right?

2428
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,140
You know, when they pray.

2429
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,360
That comes from Hinduism.

2430
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,920
Biblically, it's your hands are spread out

2431
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:08,720
and palms faced.

2432
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:14,150
Palms faced to something else.

2433
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:16,530
Greg, you're cutting out a little bit today there, bro.

2434
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:17,750
You're still back on this?

2435
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:18,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2436
01:19:18,450 --> 01:19:19,630
Palms faced at what?

2437
01:19:20,590 --> 01:19:22,710
Hands spread out, palms faced up.

2438
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,490
That's the method of communication

2439
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:28,970
for the biblical deity.

2440
01:19:29,730 --> 01:19:31,510
Now, the Christian deity is,

2441
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:32,330
here's the thing.

2442
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:37,690
The Christian deity is not biblical, zero percent.

2443
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:40,190
I've been looking at this for over a decade.

2444
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:42,190
And I haven't found anything

2445
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:44,610
that Christians do that's in the Bible.

2446
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:45,670
Now, hold on a second.

2447
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:48,230
That might sound very general and irrational.

2448
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,530
But if I try to maintain some rationality,

2449
01:19:50,750 --> 01:19:52,570
if they did one out of a thousand

2450
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:56,010
or 0.01% of what they did was biblical,

2451
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:58,550
I'd have to grant them that, right?

2452
01:19:58,910 --> 01:19:59,810
To be rational.

2453
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:01,930
But I haven't found anything

2454
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:03,790
that Christians believe in, say, or do

2455
01:20:03,790 --> 01:20:05,050
that's in the biblical text.

2456
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:08,190
Now, that's fascinating to me

2457
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:10,390
how far off and opposite the mark they are.

2458
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,070
Maybe it's because the biblical text

2459
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:15,170
was, you know, cobbled together

2460
01:20:15,170 --> 01:20:16,610
a couple of hundred years ago

2461
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:17,410
in the New Testament,

2462
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:19,610
and it doesn't actually apply to today,

2463
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:21,110
you know, with all our technologies

2464
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:23,230
and our cultural changes and stuff like that.

2465
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:24,790
Believing the earth is round and shit.

2466
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:29,750
Well, there's actually several places

2467
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:31,230
in the Bible that tell you the earth is round.

2468
01:20:32,770 --> 01:20:34,870
So, well, when I say and shit,

2469
01:20:34,970 --> 01:20:37,370
I also mean like just a broad brush caveat

2470
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:38,950
of a whole bunch of superstitions

2471
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:40,710
that we're sort of left go of,

2472
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:41,630
even if they didn't believe

2473
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:42,670
in the flat earth at the time,

2474
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:44,150
as they didn't even believe

2475
01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:45,570
that there was a flat earth

2476
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:46,690
in the time of the Greeks.

2477
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:48,790
You will never find a flat earth

2478
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:51,110
memorialized in any literature in history.

2479
01:20:51,790 --> 01:20:52,390
Yeah, exactly.

2480
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:54,230
That is because people don't read

2481
01:20:54,230 --> 01:20:55,170
and they make stuff up.

2482
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:55,910
What is it called?

2483
01:20:56,730 --> 01:20:57,530
Telephone or something?

2484
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:59,030
When someone tells a story to someone

2485
01:20:59,030 --> 01:21:00,970
and when it's five times removed,

2486
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:01,570
it's changed.

2487
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:05,190
No, that's all that Chinese whispers

2488
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:05,810
in high school.

2489
01:21:05,850 --> 01:21:06,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2490
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:07,050
That's right.

2491
01:21:07,310 --> 01:21:08,050
Chinese whispers.

2492
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:09,590
Yeah, it's better than Chinese handcuffs.

2493
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:18,110
But here's the interesting part

2494
01:21:18,110 --> 01:21:21,130
about any deific communication.

2495
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:24,790
There's something called paganism,

2496
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:26,170
you know, which is basically

2497
01:21:26,650 --> 01:21:28,510
the people were peasants

2498
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:29,610
and the feudal lord

2499
01:21:29,610 --> 01:21:31,070
wanted them to do their job.

2500
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:33,870
And when it was discovered

2501
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:35,550
that understanding what the gods

2502
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:36,250
wanted to communicate

2503
01:21:36,250 --> 01:21:37,350
required a lot of study,

2504
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:39,310
you just made up a couple of simple stories

2505
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:40,410
so they could go back to work.

2506
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:41,770
That's all your religions

2507
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:42,750
on the world right now,

2508
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:45,110
whether it's Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism,

2509
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:47,350
Christianity, Islam.

2510
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:48,390
They're all like that.

2511
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:49,410
They're just little tales.

2512
01:21:50,010 --> 01:21:51,010
None of them have anything to do

2513
01:21:51,010 --> 01:21:51,790
with what's in the text.

2514
01:21:52,510 --> 01:21:54,310
Now, what I mean by the paganism part,

2515
01:21:54,370 --> 01:21:55,470
you know, what do they do in New Zealand?

2516
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:56,070
When you go to court,

2517
01:21:56,130 --> 01:21:56,950
they have you swear on a Bible,

2518
01:21:57,070 --> 01:21:57,770
put your hand on the Bible,

2519
01:21:57,910 --> 01:21:58,770
say the truth, all truth.

2520
01:21:59,110 --> 01:21:59,630
All right.

2521
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:01,410
In New Zealand,

2522
01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:03,290
they just turn off the recording devices

2523
01:22:03,290 --> 01:22:04,270
so you can't prosecute

2524
01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:05,190
the judge for being corrupt.

2525
01:22:05,810 --> 01:22:06,290
Oh, OK.

2526
01:22:06,290 --> 01:22:08,170
Well, they've turned it

2527
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:09,330
into a rabbit's foot, right?

2528
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:10,930
Like the Bible is some holy relic.

2529
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:11,850
It's just a communication.

2530
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:13,050
I have a whole bunch of them here.

2531
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:14,070
I use them as doorstops.

2532
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:16,510
They're just communications.

2533
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:17,890
What if you have it on a thumb drive?

2534
01:22:17,950 --> 01:22:18,950
Can you swear on the thumb drive?

2535
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:19,830
You see what's going on here?

2536
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:21,230
It's a little rabbit's foot talisman.

2537
01:22:22,030 --> 01:22:23,010
Humanity has been reduced

2538
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:24,830
to this little tiny slave class.

2539
01:22:25,050 --> 01:22:27,030
And the priests that were

2540
01:22:27,030 --> 01:22:28,410
and the scholars that were familiar

2541
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:29,370
with these texts

2542
01:22:29,370 --> 01:22:31,070
in any part of the world

2543
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:32,610
realized the proprietary

2544
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:33,510
of the information

2545
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:36,090
and looked at how people behaved.

2546
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:37,510
And said, these people

2547
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:38,630
behave like savages.

2548
01:22:38,710 --> 01:22:39,490
We're not going to sit there

2549
01:22:39,490 --> 01:22:39,990
and talk to them

2550
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:41,430
about this proprietary information.

2551
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:42,510
Now, what they did there

2552
01:22:42,510 --> 01:22:44,190
was a bad judgment call,

2553
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:45,210
because now the people,

2554
01:22:45,310 --> 01:22:46,570
how are they going to elevate themselves

2555
01:22:46,570 --> 01:22:47,890
and understand law and physics

2556
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:49,430
and science and all that stuff, right?

2557
01:22:49,630 --> 01:22:51,310
Because it's a very high level of science

2558
01:22:51,310 --> 01:22:52,790
in these ancient texts as well.

2559
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:56,890
So anyway, yeah,

2560
01:22:56,990 --> 01:22:58,310
I've spent the past 10 years,

2561
01:22:58,370 --> 01:22:59,130
almost full time,

2562
01:22:59,170 --> 01:23:01,130
looking at all of the texts

2563
01:23:01,130 --> 01:23:01,930
throughout the planet.

2564
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:04,590
And it's hard to make these statements

2565
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:05,370
that I'm making.

2566
01:23:05,370 --> 01:23:06,410
I really never wanted

2567
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:07,290
to say them in public,

2568
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:09,750
that all of the religions are debased.

2569
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:11,030
But unfortunately, they are.

2570
01:23:11,150 --> 01:23:12,490
And it is a good thing to say,

2571
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:15,010
because someday here coming,

2572
01:23:15,170 --> 01:23:16,150
people are going to start

2573
01:23:16,150 --> 01:23:17,130
trying to figure out

2574
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:18,470
why things aren't working out.

2575
01:23:18,510 --> 01:23:19,550
And they might actually go back

2576
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:20,610
and look at the materials

2577
01:23:20,610 --> 01:23:23,170
that they're supposed to be based on,

2578
01:23:23,190 --> 01:23:24,210
whether it's laws.

2579
01:23:25,050 --> 01:23:26,710
That's why I think once in chat,

2580
01:23:26,830 --> 01:23:27,890
Vinny, I was looking for

2581
01:23:27,890 --> 01:23:29,750
the New Zealand cannabis laws.

2582
01:23:30,030 --> 01:23:31,610
And because they're all typically,

2583
01:23:31,730 --> 01:23:33,750
they have a little thing.

2584
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:36,110
The Misuse of Drugs Act in 1978

2585
01:23:36,110 --> 01:23:37,210
or 1976.

2586
01:23:37,730 --> 01:23:38,110
That's right.

2587
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:39,010
I haven't gone through

2588
01:23:39,010 --> 01:23:39,830
it completely yet,

2589
01:23:39,930 --> 01:23:41,410
but most of it is trying to find

2590
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:43,150
where maybe there's another code

2591
01:23:43,150 --> 01:23:45,070
that says it's been repealed.

2592
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:46,790
And because they hide that away

2593
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:48,230
in the U.S. is Title 21,

2594
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:50,110
I believe, and possession

2595
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:51,210
has been repealed.

2596
01:23:51,230 --> 01:23:52,550
It's just intent to distribute

2597
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:54,090
and manufacture that people are.

2598
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:55,090
I don't know how you can

2599
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:58,250
manufacture cannabis, but anyway.

2600
01:23:59,430 --> 01:24:01,930
With a Budman processing machine

2601
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:03,310
that churns, you know,

2602
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:05,190
Bud goes in, joins come out.

2603
01:24:06,510 --> 01:24:07,730
Yeah, counterfeiting money,

2604
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:08,570
I guess you need the right

2605
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:09,370
ink and the right paper.

2606
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:10,330
Is that how it would be like

2607
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:11,770
the the cannabis carousel?

2608
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:15,450
OK, yeah, like that could work

2609
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:16,630
or conveyor belt.

2610
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:19,710
So with the religious part,

2611
01:24:20,210 --> 01:24:21,310
your law comes from it.

2612
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:22,550
Now, here's the interesting part.

2613
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:26,370
It's a completely lawless society,

2614
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:27,710
completely at this point.

2615
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:28,970
Now, it doesn't mean there's no order

2616
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:30,390
when what's what the mainstream

2617
01:24:30,390 --> 01:24:31,610
puts in people's mind is

2618
01:24:31,610 --> 01:24:32,490
if you don't have any law,

2619
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:33,130
there is no order.

2620
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:34,370
You can have a lot of law

2621
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:35,390
and not have any order.

2622
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:36,330
I mean, a lot of order

2623
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:37,350
and not have any law.

2624
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,170
Right, it's just like what is it?

2625
01:24:40,230 --> 01:24:40,910
What's a cold one?

2626
01:24:40,970 --> 01:24:42,450
The strong rule, the weak.

2627
01:24:42,890 --> 01:24:43,390
You know what I mean?

2628
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:44,910
America?

2629
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:47,290
Possibly.

2630
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:50,390
Which one, though, north or south?

2631
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:53,890
Is it north or south?

2632
01:24:54,310 --> 01:24:55,550
You know, either way,

2633
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:57,210
it doesn't matter.

2634
01:24:58,810 --> 01:25:00,210
You know, it's still lawless,

2635
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:01,950
but New Zealand is the same.

2636
01:25:02,070 --> 01:25:03,390
So the entire Western world

2637
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:04,750
and Eastern world is lawless

2638
01:25:04,750 --> 01:25:05,330
at this point.

2639
01:25:05,830 --> 01:25:06,450
You know, let's just throw

2640
01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:07,230
in a little trivia.

2641
01:25:08,130 --> 01:25:09,010
Biblical trivia.

2642
01:25:09,570 --> 01:25:10,530
I know because no one,

2643
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:12,050
I'm one of the five people

2644
01:25:12,050 --> 01:25:13,070
on the planet who's read it,

2645
01:25:13,170 --> 01:25:13,810
believe it or not.

2646
01:25:15,930 --> 01:25:16,890
You have this thing

2647
01:25:16,890 --> 01:25:17,810
called Christmas, right?

2648
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:19,210
Coming up.

2649
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:22,230
Now is the time

2650
01:25:22,230 --> 01:25:24,230
for biblical TV trivia

2651
01:25:24,230 --> 01:25:26,010
with your host, The Greek.

2652
01:25:26,470 --> 01:25:27,890
So there are these big mega churches

2653
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:29,670
over here and well,

2654
01:25:29,670 --> 01:25:31,310
do they have mega churches

2655
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:33,430
in Las Vegas?

2656
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:34,530
We have what's called

2657
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:35,310
Destiny Church,

2658
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:36,530
where Bishop Brian Tamaki

2659
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:37,730
named himself Bishop

2660
01:25:37,730 --> 01:25:38,950
and then gets a whole shitload

2661
01:25:38,950 --> 01:25:39,750
of millions of dollars

2662
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:40,990
and buys like several houses

2663
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:42,430
and then like swanky suburbs

2664
01:25:42,430 --> 01:25:43,750
in Auckland and tells everybody

2665
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:44,470
he's a pauper.

2666
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:47,070
Yeah, OK, yeah, that's

2667
01:25:47,070 --> 01:25:47,910
exactly what I'm talking about.

2668
01:25:48,010 --> 01:25:49,310
OK, so they have these

2669
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:50,150
big sites here

2670
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:52,150
on the Internet and they say,

2671
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:53,190
well, no one really knows

2672
01:25:53,190 --> 01:25:55,170
when this J-E-S-U-S

2673
01:25:55,170 --> 01:25:56,050
character was born.

2674
01:25:56,530 --> 01:25:57,850
So we're just going to go with it

2675
01:25:57,850 --> 01:25:59,330
and it's not pagan.

2676
01:25:59,330 --> 01:26:00,930
I'm like, wait a second.

2677
01:26:02,770 --> 01:26:04,970
Well, you know how timekeeping

2678
01:26:04,970 --> 01:26:06,730
changes from society to society

2679
01:26:06,730 --> 01:26:08,050
and giving a name or

2680
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:10,850
let's say an existing time period

2681
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:11,890
way of keeping time

2682
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:13,310
doesn't carry over, right?

2683
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:14,350
Like there was no January

2684
01:26:14,350 --> 01:26:16,170
through December 2000 years ago

2685
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:17,570
or Monday through Friday.

2686
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:19,310
These are recent timekeeping

2687
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:21,190
inventions.

2688
01:26:21,450 --> 01:26:22,450
So the way you keep time

2689
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:23,310
is astronomically

2690
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:25,650
because astronomical occurrences

2691
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:27,070
are extremely accurate.

2692
01:26:27,310 --> 01:26:29,150
And regardless of what timekeeping

2693
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:31,170
function you use,

2694
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:32,330
you know, the stars,

2695
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:33,610
the moon and the sun don't lie.

2696
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:34,290
Exactly.

2697
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:35,730
And that way, everything

2698
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:37,590
you do in your life

2699
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:38,650
has an astronomical

2700
01:26:38,650 --> 01:26:39,630
chance of occurring.

2701
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:42,730
Yeah, or sub-astronomical

2702
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:43,950
in this case, being on Earth.

2703
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:46,210
But what's interesting,

2704
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:47,070
if you want to know,

2705
01:26:47,170 --> 01:26:47,990
it's very specific.

2706
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:49,630
The Christ was a biblical Christ.

2707
01:26:49,770 --> 01:26:51,150
Don't confuse this with Jesus,

2708
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:52,130
by the way, because there's

2709
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:53,170
like 10 Jesuses.

2710
01:26:53,230 --> 01:26:53,970
There's one that says,

2711
01:26:54,050 --> 01:26:55,430
if you don't believe in me,

2712
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:56,130
you're going to hell.

2713
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:57,650
There's another one that says

2714
01:26:57,650 --> 01:26:58,510
that you could do

2715
01:26:58,510 --> 01:26:59,310
whatever you want.

2716
01:26:59,570 --> 01:27:00,350
You know, there's another one

2717
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:01,650
that says you do this.

2718
01:27:01,770 --> 01:27:02,250
You do it.

2719
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:03,430
I mean, it's just too confusing.

2720
01:27:03,530 --> 01:27:04,390
They may have a black one,

2721
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:05,410
Asian one.

2722
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:06,230
So, yeah.

2723
01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:07,170
And also the letter J

2724
01:27:07,170 --> 01:27:08,410
was invented in 1500.

2725
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:09,590
So unless you're into

2726
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:10,970
medieval history, forget it.

2727
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:12,390
But what's interesting.

2728
01:27:12,450 --> 01:27:12,970
You hear that, Jesus?

2729
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:15,510
Your name wasn't even existing.

2730
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:18,150
And I've actually met

2731
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:19,970
a couple of Jesuses in the past.

2732
01:27:20,370 --> 01:27:21,390
Out here, there's a really

2733
01:27:21,390 --> 01:27:22,730
good fish taco shop.

2734
01:27:22,810 --> 01:27:25,390
And he has J-E-S-U-S

2735
01:27:25,390 --> 01:27:26,190
on his name tag.

2736
01:27:26,230 --> 01:27:27,170
And I said, are you Jesus?

2737
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:28,210
He says, yes, I am.

2738
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:30,570
I'm like, wow, I can actually say

2739
01:27:30,570 --> 01:27:32,890
Jesus served me three fish tacos.

2740
01:27:33,490 --> 01:27:35,010
It's like, bro, has he got enough

2741
01:27:35,010 --> 01:27:36,310
fish to feed the whole party?

2742
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:37,690
Yes, he fucking does.

2743
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:38,870
Yeah, he does.

2744
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:41,690
OK, so now now here's the point

2745
01:27:41,690 --> 01:27:43,090
in the biblical text.

2746
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:43,970
I don't have to give you where

2747
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:44,670
it says they were.

2748
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:46,030
I saw a great sign in the sky.

2749
01:27:46,050 --> 01:27:47,290
It was a virgin giving birth.

2750
01:27:47,410 --> 01:27:49,090
She was cloaked with the sun,

2751
01:27:49,150 --> 01:27:49,890
the moon at her feet.

2752
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:51,250
And she had 12 stars at her head.

2753
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:52,410
Holy crap.

2754
01:27:52,410 --> 01:27:54,690
That's the constellation Virgo Draco.

2755
01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:55,970
Part of the Draco is at

2756
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:57,010
the top of the constellation.

2757
01:27:57,390 --> 01:27:58,870
We know it's at sundown

2758
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:01,230
because the sun is in the middle

2759
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:01,750
of constellation.

2760
01:28:02,110 --> 01:28:03,630
And we know it's it's the

2761
01:28:04,590 --> 01:28:05,790
it's the middle of the month

2762
01:28:05,790 --> 01:28:06,950
because it's a crescent moon

2763
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:07,850
because the sun and the moon

2764
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:08,250
in the West.

2765
01:28:08,350 --> 01:28:09,710
OK, so what you do is you go

2766
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:11,050
to an astronomical observatory

2767
01:28:11,050 --> 01:28:11,670
and you say, hey, look,

2768
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:12,870
I've got this constellation,

2769
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:14,110
the moon, the sun and this here.

2770
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:14,990
When does this happen?

2771
01:28:15,970 --> 01:28:16,770
And they'll tell you, oh, yeah,

2772
01:28:16,770 --> 01:28:17,950
this happens like this

2773
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:19,970
astronomical observation

2774
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:21,930
happens maybe three times

2775
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:23,250
every 20 years or so.

2776
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:23,850
All right.

2777
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:25,170
Well, well, if you look in the

2778
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:26,410
when the Christ was supposedly

2779
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:27,750
born, King Herod died

2780
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:28,790
two and a half years later.

2781
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:31,510
And Caesar cast a census

2782
01:28:31,510 --> 01:28:32,310
on his empire.

2783
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:34,110
So we know secular records show

2784
01:28:34,110 --> 01:28:36,230
between 2 AD and 8 BC.

2785
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:37,230
So you just go to the

2786
01:28:37,230 --> 01:28:38,490
astronomical computer and you say,

2787
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:39,770
when did this event happen

2788
01:28:40,470 --> 01:28:42,210
between 2 AD and 8 BC?

2789
01:28:42,570 --> 01:28:44,710
And you get a pinpoint day of

2790
01:28:45,510 --> 01:28:48,170
3 BC, the day of 11,

2791
01:28:48,290 --> 01:28:49,150
the month of September.

2792
01:28:49,970 --> 01:28:50,650
There you go.

2793
01:28:52,090 --> 01:28:53,470
So that's when he was born,

2794
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:54,810
according to the Gregorian calendar.

2795
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:56,850
Now, does the 11th day of September

2796
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:57,890
has that?

2797
01:28:58,470 --> 01:29:00,370
Yeah, I was going to say that.

2798
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:01,030
Yeah.

2799
01:29:02,110 --> 01:29:03,310
September 11th, like somebody

2800
01:29:03,310 --> 01:29:05,150
did a star chart and then says,

2801
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:06,730
OK, well, this is what they said

2802
01:29:06,730 --> 01:29:07,630
the stars look like

2803
01:29:07,630 --> 01:29:08,950
on the night of Jesus's birth.

2804
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:10,650
What date did that happen?

2805
01:29:10,970 --> 01:29:12,250
Well, it had to be September 11th.

2806
01:29:13,210 --> 01:29:15,010
Yeah, well, that's and this is

2807
01:29:15,010 --> 01:29:16,690
what I'm saying is not my opinion.

2808
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:17,530
It's not for debate.

2809
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:18,970
Anyone can can do that.

2810
01:29:19,130 --> 01:29:20,170
Anyone could look this up

2811
01:29:20,170 --> 01:29:21,890
because when I first

2812
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:22,470
started doing this,

2813
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:23,710
I had to go to a planetarium.

2814
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:25,390
Is that the word?

2815
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:26,570
This is about 10 years ago,

2816
01:29:26,630 --> 01:29:27,550
maybe 12 years ago.

2817
01:29:28,010 --> 01:29:28,990
The the computing power,

2818
01:29:29,210 --> 01:29:30,090
what you know, if you wanted

2819
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:31,090
to was just wasn't

2820
01:29:31,090 --> 01:29:32,010
available to get that.

2821
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:34,070
So the university wanted

2822
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:35,290
500 bucks to do it.

2823
01:29:35,330 --> 01:29:36,510
But I went to the planetarium.

2824
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:37,390
We know they do the light

2825
01:29:37,390 --> 01:29:38,930
show at the end, you know, at night.

2826
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:40,490
And all the guys are they got

2827
01:29:40,490 --> 01:29:41,650
nothing to do during the day.

2828
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:42,210
They're just, you know,

2829
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:43,150
smoking pot, you know,

2830
01:29:43,190 --> 01:29:44,090
whatever. And you go in there

2831
01:29:44,090 --> 01:29:45,310
and they'll just you'll show you

2832
01:29:45,310 --> 01:29:46,870
the I think you've confused

2833
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:48,670
the planetarium for the sanitarium.

2834
01:29:48,830 --> 01:29:49,470
But there you go.

2835
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:51,810
OK, so, yeah, it was

2836
01:29:51,810 --> 01:29:52,410
very interesting.

2837
01:29:52,410 --> 01:29:54,090
So this these things go on and on.

2838
01:29:54,190 --> 01:29:55,150
Also, they show you this

2839
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:56,210
little nativity scene

2840
01:29:56,210 --> 01:29:57,150
with three wise men.

2841
01:29:57,270 --> 01:29:57,830
And we don't know

2842
01:29:57,830 --> 01:29:58,970
how many white or whatever.

2843
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:00,450
That's not true.

2844
01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:01,170
That didn't happen

2845
01:30:01,170 --> 01:30:02,550
because in the biblical text,

2846
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:03,650
it says that these men

2847
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:04,630
from the east came

2848
01:30:04,630 --> 01:30:06,870
when he was in his father's workshop.

2849
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:08,330
So he was about two and a half

2850
01:30:08,330 --> 01:30:09,250
or three years old.

2851
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:10,850
Now, what this is,

2852
01:30:10,930 --> 01:30:11,610
I'm not saying that

2853
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:13,010
the biblical story is true

2854
01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:13,970
or anyone should believe it

2855
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:14,310
or anything.

2856
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:17,270
I'm just showing the stark contrast

2857
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:18,750
between what people believe

2858
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:20,470
and what is in the text

2859
01:30:20,470 --> 01:30:22,810
that they say they subscribe to.

2860
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:23,130
Right.

2861
01:30:26,030 --> 01:30:26,810
Let's just say

2862
01:30:26,810 --> 01:30:29,530
this for a conjecture.

2863
01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:31,550
Let's say the text is true,

2864
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:33,250
but nobody's read it

2865
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:34,130
or understood it.

2866
01:30:34,570 --> 01:30:35,970
Does a tree make a sound

2867
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:36,990
if it falls

2868
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:38,270
and no one's there to hear it?

2869
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:40,150
And if a man speaks

2870
01:30:40,150 --> 01:30:41,230
his mind in a forest

2871
01:30:41,230 --> 01:30:42,350
and no woman hears him,

2872
01:30:42,510 --> 01:30:43,470
is he still wrong?

2873
01:30:45,310 --> 01:30:46,150
Why does it matter?

2874
01:30:47,170 --> 01:30:48,290
Isn't he the king of the castle?

2875
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:51,670
I don't think so.

2876
01:30:52,090 --> 01:30:53,610
It's because she says so.

2877
01:30:54,150 --> 01:30:55,090
I mean, look,

2878
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:56,630
yeah, the wife is the boss.

2879
01:30:56,930 --> 01:30:57,230
All right.

2880
01:30:57,330 --> 01:30:58,450
She she, you know,

2881
01:30:59,070 --> 01:30:59,550
she runs.

2882
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:00,890
Yeah, I just live here.

2883
01:31:01,070 --> 01:31:01,650
Oh, no.

2884
01:31:01,710 --> 01:31:02,870
Well, here I'm the boss.

2885
01:31:02,870 --> 01:31:03,490
And I know that

2886
01:31:03,490 --> 01:31:04,850
because she tells me I am.

2887
01:31:05,570 --> 01:31:07,130
Anyway, never mind.

2888
01:31:07,790 --> 01:31:08,650
Yeah, but you can't trust

2889
01:31:08,650 --> 01:31:09,530
what women say, bro.

2890
01:31:11,070 --> 01:31:11,510
Yeah.

2891
01:31:12,030 --> 01:31:13,390
OK, here's another one.

2892
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:14,030
You know, in the

2893
01:31:15,070 --> 01:31:16,730
in the Islamic community,

2894
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:18,170
they think they're so righteous

2895
01:31:18,170 --> 01:31:19,310
because they are the women's

2896
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:21,310
are women's are covered

2897
01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:23,410
in hijabs and burqas

2898
01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:24,070
and all that stuff.

2899
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:24,370
Right.

2900
01:31:24,850 --> 01:31:25,630
It's it's so

2901
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:27,610
it's so righteous.

2902
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:30,410
Hey, and speaking of which,

2903
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:32,690
sorry, amazing video today

2904
01:31:32,690 --> 01:31:34,210
of this Muslim couple.

2905
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:35,910
And they had two seats

2906
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:37,430
and the street was flooded.

2907
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:40,390
And the guy was standing

2908
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:41,030
in the water

2909
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:43,850
and he would take one seat

2910
01:31:44,410 --> 01:31:45,830
and then put it in front

2911
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:46,710
of his wife.

2912
01:31:46,730 --> 01:31:48,090
And she'd step from one seat

2913
01:31:48,090 --> 01:31:49,290
to the other and grab it.

2914
01:31:49,610 --> 01:31:51,690
And he made sure that she didn't

2915
01:31:51,690 --> 01:31:53,130
like step in the floodwaters.

2916
01:31:53,830 --> 01:31:55,150
I thought it was very sweet.

2917
01:31:56,250 --> 01:31:56,410
Yes.

2918
01:31:57,030 --> 01:31:58,430
But it's again,

2919
01:31:58,570 --> 01:31:59,450
if you read their text,

2920
01:31:59,550 --> 01:32:00,930
well, in ancient time,

2921
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:01,750
let's just say it this way.

2922
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:02,670
In ancient times,

2923
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:03,130
you know, you know

2924
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:04,050
what a uniform is.

2925
01:32:04,110 --> 01:32:05,710
You could see what someone's

2926
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:07,170
profession is from a distance.

2927
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:07,510
Right.

2928
01:32:08,350 --> 01:32:09,550
And in the ancient world,

2929
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:10,890
up until recently,

2930
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:12,070
actually, in that part

2931
01:32:12,070 --> 01:32:12,570
of the world,

2932
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:13,330
if you saw a woman

2933
01:32:13,330 --> 01:32:14,630
that was covered the way

2934
01:32:15,050 --> 01:32:16,790
women are supposedly covered today

2935
01:32:17,310 --> 01:32:18,390
in that part of the world,

2936
01:32:18,530 --> 01:32:19,470
that was the uniform

2937
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:21,150
of the world's oldest profession.

2938
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:25,200
Prostitution.

2939
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:26,140
Yeah.

2940
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:28,380
So these people have lost their minds.

2941
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,380
It goes across the board.

2942
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:31,180
All religions.

2943
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:32,300
They're just insane.

2944
01:32:33,300 --> 01:32:35,120
Well, here's here's the good part.

2945
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:37,000
And you know what you just said

2946
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,400
makes a whole shitload

2947
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:39,360
of sense right now.

2948
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:42,540
Well, let me let me just

2949
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:43,560
there's there's a family

2950
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,420
actually moved in

2951
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:45,480
not too far from here.

2952
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,600
And the husband has

2953
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:47,280
the wife covered.

2954
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:48,440
And I'm suspecting it's

2955
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:49,240
a wife or a sister.

2956
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:51,520
And he has she's holding a baby

2957
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:52,520
as she's walking around.

2958
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:53,540
And I want to go up to him

2959
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:54,380
and point to her and said,

2960
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:55,280
how much for an hour

2961
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:55,940
with that woman?

2962
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:56,460
You know, I mean,

2963
01:32:56,460 --> 01:32:57,300
she's wearing the uniform.

2964
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,320
But anyway, this is yeah.

2965
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:01,980
And they think it's a form

2966
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:02,760
of being righteous.

2967
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,220
It's just this is who was it?

2968
01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:07,140
Wolfgang Goethe,

2969
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:08,800
he said that you need

2970
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,360
not visit an insane asylum

2971
01:33:10,360 --> 01:33:12,480
to meet disordered spirits

2972
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:13,460
because the Earth is

2973
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:14,380
the insane asylum

2974
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:16,160
of the youth of the universe.

2975
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:18,940
Sounds about right.

2976
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:20,740
There's madness everywhere you look.

2977
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:23,340
I mean, nobody can can be on Facebook

2978
01:33:23,340 --> 01:33:25,040
or YouTube comment sections

2979
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:26,860
for more than five minutes

2980
01:33:26,860 --> 01:33:28,060
before knowing that

2981
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:29,480
that is a self-evident truth.

2982
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:31,470
Yeah, I want to throw this in important.

2983
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:32,960
Remember how we talked

2984
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:33,960
about being lawful?

2985
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:34,540
What's lawful?

2986
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:35,460
It comes from your deity.

2987
01:33:36,040 --> 01:33:36,880
Well, it's very simple.

2988
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:38,640
If you don't have a deity,

2989
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:39,940
then it's real simple.

2990
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:41,480
Do you obey the laws of the state?

2991
01:33:41,780 --> 01:33:42,260
Well, yes.

2992
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,700
OK, then the state is your God

2993
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:45,040
and April 1st is your holiday.

2994
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:46,140
Do you have April 1st?

2995
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:47,220
Is April Fool's Day

2996
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:48,040
down there, by the way?

2997
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,180
Yeah, but we call it April John Key,

2998
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:52,060
the prime minister day.

2999
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:53,120
Oh, OK.

3000
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:53,920
Well, same thing.

3001
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,620
So here's the interesting part.

3002
01:33:57,300 --> 01:33:58,420
You know what legal claims

3003
01:33:58,420 --> 01:33:59,580
are or lawful claims?

3004
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:00,900
And someone makes a claim

3005
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:02,880
and it stands until

3006
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,060
someone else rebuts it

3007
01:34:04,060 --> 01:34:07,680
or counters it accordingly.

3008
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:08,660
So if it's written,

3009
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:10,240
you should write it down.

3010
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:10,760
You know, if you're going

3011
01:34:10,760 --> 01:34:11,840
to rebut someone's claim.

3012
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:13,100
What's interesting about

3013
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:14,080
the biblical text

3014
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,220
is just some claims in there

3015
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:18,400
that this particular group

3016
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:19,900
created everything

3017
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:22,240
and they sit at the highest position.

3018
01:34:22,820 --> 01:34:23,920
And as far as I could tell,

3019
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:25,740
it's never been rebutted.

3020
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,580
And so that requires

3021
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:29,980
if you have a lawful mind,

3022
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:33,080
some investigation.

3023
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:35,280
Now, what I mean by that is,

3024
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:36,760
you know, like someone

3025
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:37,560
could go to their house

3026
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:39,360
and have a white piece of paper

3027
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,260
nailed to the door and says,

3028
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:40,880
yeah, greetings.

3029
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:41,640
This house will be

3030
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:42,960
foreclosed on in 30 days.

3031
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:43,700
Well, if they don't

3032
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:44,420
have a lawful mind,

3033
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,860
they just take it off the door

3034
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:46,780
and throw it in the garbage.

3035
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:48,020
Right.

3036
01:34:48,620 --> 01:34:49,640
And they wait 30 days

3037
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:50,500
to see what happens.

3038
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:52,480
Or if someone has a lawful mind,

3039
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:53,120
looks at the notice,

3040
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:53,680
says, oh, is there

3041
01:34:53,680 --> 01:34:54,980
contact information here?

3042
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:56,780
Who's who's who's the authority?

3043
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:58,420
I need to work this out

3044
01:34:58,420 --> 01:34:59,580
before it gets out of hand.

3045
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:01,520
See, most people see these things,

3046
01:35:01,620 --> 01:35:02,460
these claims,

3047
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:03,240
and they've been trained

3048
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:06,460
socially to disregard them.

3049
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:09,520
It reminds me of this time

3050
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:10,940
that my wife accidentally

3051
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:12,340
put margarine on my toast

3052
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:13,580
and I asked her to scrape it off.

3053
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:14,660
That toast was never

3054
01:35:14,660 --> 01:35:15,380
rebutted either.

3055
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,040
No, you can't margarine.

3056
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,020
Oh, no, no, no.

3057
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:19,740
You don't want margarine.

3058
01:35:19,820 --> 01:35:20,560
That's alien.

3059
01:35:23,290 --> 01:35:24,270
Margarine is alien.

3060
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:25,850
You put margarine in the body.

3061
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:26,650
The body says, well,

3062
01:35:26,650 --> 01:35:27,830
I don't know what to do with this.

3063
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:30,510
That never happened.

3064
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:31,550
It was a fictional story

3065
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:32,530
like the Bible.

3066
01:35:35,450 --> 01:35:36,770
Well, it's not actually.

3067
01:35:36,990 --> 01:35:37,810
Here's another thing.

3068
01:35:38,410 --> 01:35:40,990
Is the Bible actually 100 percent true?

3069
01:35:41,050 --> 01:35:42,390
Because it's been so many

3070
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:43,870
thousands of years of whatever

3071
01:35:43,870 --> 01:35:45,870
to let's say

3072
01:35:46,910 --> 01:35:48,150
if you've got a legal case,

3073
01:35:48,210 --> 01:35:48,770
there's a thing called

3074
01:35:48,770 --> 01:35:50,330
a statute of limitations, right?

3075
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:51,910
After so many years,

3076
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:53,390
you know, you can't prosecute someone.

3077
01:35:53,910 --> 01:35:56,310
And there's things called cold cases,

3078
01:35:56,490 --> 01:35:58,290
things that are like so old that,

3079
01:35:58,330 --> 01:36:00,110
you know, nobody solved them at the time.

3080
01:36:00,190 --> 01:36:02,350
And nowadays it's just no fucking way.

3081
01:36:03,190 --> 01:36:05,450
Maybe that's what the Bible is.

3082
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:08,450
It's a giant cold case

3083
01:36:08,450 --> 01:36:11,070
that people are investigating

3084
01:36:11,070 --> 01:36:12,590
and still haven't managed

3085
01:36:12,590 --> 01:36:13,570
to come to the bottom of.

3086
01:36:14,030 --> 01:36:15,090
Well, here's the thing.

3087
01:36:15,130 --> 01:36:15,910
If it's a legitimate

3088
01:36:15,910 --> 01:36:18,030
communication from a deity,

3089
01:36:19,010 --> 01:36:20,150
they don't it doesn't seem like

3090
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:21,670
why would they act in futility?

3091
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:23,390
Right. It's it's operating.

3092
01:36:23,530 --> 01:36:24,210
But also, you got to remember,

3093
01:36:24,210 --> 01:36:26,130
they have an IQ of two million or so,

3094
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:27,570
let's say.

3095
01:36:28,370 --> 01:36:29,570
But here's the thing.

3096
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:31,630
You've ever heard of Aesop's fables,

3097
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:33,510
the Fox and the Grapes?

3098
01:36:35,970 --> 01:36:36,230
No.

3099
01:36:37,090 --> 01:36:39,810
OK, so Aesop was one of these Greeks,

3100
01:36:39,950 --> 01:36:40,530
you know, right?

3101
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:43,010
And the story of the Fox and the Grapes

3102
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:44,330
was a fox is walking along a path.

3103
01:36:44,370 --> 01:36:44,950
He's really hungry.

3104
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:46,230
He sees these beautifully ripe grapes.

3105
01:36:46,230 --> 01:36:47,270
He says, Oh, I'd like to have some.

3106
01:36:47,350 --> 01:36:47,990
So he jumps up

3107
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:49,270
and he's trying to reach them

3108
01:36:49,270 --> 01:36:50,710
and he's spending a good part

3109
01:36:50,710 --> 01:36:51,250
of the afternoon.

3110
01:36:51,350 --> 01:36:52,370
He can't reach into the grapes.

3111
01:36:52,570 --> 01:36:54,250
And after, you know, he says, OK,

3112
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:54,890
I'm going to give up.

3113
01:36:54,930 --> 01:36:55,690
You know what? Those grapes

3114
01:36:55,690 --> 01:36:56,530
are sour anyway.

3115
01:37:00,030 --> 01:37:01,790
Right. So the biblical text

3116
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:03,490
is like this, like, for example,

3117
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:04,570
I've studied it quite a bit

3118
01:37:04,570 --> 01:37:06,190
in its languages of preservation

3119
01:37:06,190 --> 01:37:07,410
because it's never been translated,

3120
01:37:07,630 --> 01:37:08,530
by the way, into English.

3121
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:10,650
King, all the versions you get

3122
01:37:10,650 --> 01:37:11,470
are not translations.

3123
01:37:12,250 --> 01:37:13,430
There's forty eight hundred

3124
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:14,990
critical errors in the first

3125
01:37:14,990 --> 01:37:15,890
ten thousand words.

3126
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:16,730
So anyway,

3127
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:20,490
it's just a communication.

3128
01:37:22,690 --> 01:37:24,770
I never recommend that anyone

3129
01:37:24,770 --> 01:37:26,890
go and read the biblical text

3130
01:37:26,890 --> 01:37:27,550
or study it.

3131
01:37:27,570 --> 01:37:27,790
Why?

3132
01:37:29,370 --> 01:37:30,310
Why? Because you're not

3133
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:31,070
going to understand anything

3134
01:37:31,070 --> 01:37:31,630
in it anyway.

3135
01:37:31,730 --> 01:37:32,630
So why waste your time?

3136
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:34,470
Yeah, that's actually the conclusion

3137
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:38,010
I came to just before

3138
01:37:38,010 --> 01:37:38,850
finishing Genesis.

3139
01:37:40,190 --> 01:37:41,090
No, no, you're not going to.

3140
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:42,370
Well, it's first of all,

3141
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:43,270
the level it's written

3142
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:44,950
on a hundredth grade level

3143
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:46,610
and your quote unquote

3144
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:48,070
smartest professors are operating

3145
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:49,490
on a fifth grade level right now.

3146
01:37:50,210 --> 01:37:51,170
So you're not going to

3147
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:52,310
there's no way you're going to do

3148
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:53,950
what there is is a level of code

3149
01:37:53,950 --> 01:37:55,630
in there that has to be deciphered.

3150
01:37:55,730 --> 01:37:56,350
It's backwards.

3151
01:37:57,350 --> 01:37:59,110
But here's the thing that's irrelevant.

3152
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:00,210
All the ancient texts

3153
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:01,050
are very similar.

3154
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:03,590
But what's good about it

3155
01:38:03,590 --> 01:38:04,750
is that you're coming apart

3156
01:38:05,210 --> 01:38:06,710
into a part of human history

3157
01:38:06,710 --> 01:38:08,790
where people you've heard before

3158
01:38:08,790 --> 01:38:10,230
are going to realize

3159
01:38:10,230 --> 01:38:11,670
that they've got to go back to basics.

3160
01:38:11,870 --> 01:38:12,350
Like you've heard,

3161
01:38:12,590 --> 01:38:13,910
I think AFR used to run a

3162
01:38:13,910 --> 01:38:15,610
David Icke a voiceover

3163
01:38:15,610 --> 01:38:16,610
where he said, look, we've got

3164
01:38:16,610 --> 01:38:17,930
more lawyers than ever

3165
01:38:17,930 --> 01:38:19,150
and more people in prison,

3166
01:38:19,370 --> 01:38:21,030
more college, more people are ignorant,

3167
01:38:21,250 --> 01:38:23,030
more doctors, more people are sick.

3168
01:38:23,390 --> 01:38:24,550
You familiar with that?

3169
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:26,490
You know, the more banks,

3170
01:38:26,570 --> 01:38:27,510
the more poor we are.

3171
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:29,270
Doctors destroy health.

3172
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:30,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3173
01:38:31,230 --> 01:38:33,510
Well, lawyers destroy the law.

3174
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:35,230
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3175
01:38:35,230 --> 01:38:35,710
I have it.

3176
01:38:35,710 --> 01:38:36,870
I have it on here

3177
01:38:39,870 --> 01:38:41,510
somewhere on my computer.

3178
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:45,210
But yeah, here it is.

3179
01:38:45,370 --> 01:38:46,870
But boom, I found it.

3180
01:38:46,930 --> 01:38:48,430
It's by Chris Hedges, actually.

3181
01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:50,150
And Ike was just quoting it.

3182
01:38:50,710 --> 01:38:51,810
We now live in a nation

3183
01:38:51,810 --> 01:38:53,510
where doctors destroy health.

3184
01:38:53,890 --> 01:38:55,350
Lawyers destroy justice.

3185
01:38:55,850 --> 01:38:57,410
Universities destroy knowledge.

3186
01:38:57,890 --> 01:38:59,170
Governments destroy freedom.

3187
01:38:59,650 --> 01:39:01,210
The press destroys information.

3188
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:03,210
Religion destroys morals.

3189
01:39:03,490 --> 01:39:05,350
And our banks destroy the economy.

3190
01:39:05,930 --> 01:39:06,430
Very good.

3191
01:39:06,690 --> 01:39:07,970
OK, now, how much of that

3192
01:39:07,970 --> 01:39:10,870
can a society, a planetary society take?

3193
01:39:11,730 --> 01:39:12,890
Before it where they

3194
01:39:12,890 --> 01:39:15,230
all they have to do is stop and say,

3195
01:39:16,810 --> 01:39:18,810
what are these things based on?

3196
01:39:19,510 --> 01:39:20,290
So they're going to call

3197
01:39:20,290 --> 01:39:21,370
the lawyers on their laws.

3198
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:21,910
They're going to call

3199
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:23,250
the religious people on there

3200
01:39:23,670 --> 01:39:25,110
where they get their information.

3201
01:39:25,210 --> 01:39:26,150
They're going to call the doctors

3202
01:39:26,150 --> 01:39:27,590
on their studies that you see.

3203
01:39:28,010 --> 01:39:29,310
This time has not come yet.

3204
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:30,930
And when that time comes,

3205
01:39:30,950 --> 01:39:32,130
there's going to be some sanity.

3206
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:34,930
Is that what you've been waiting for, bro?

3207
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:36,230
Because you've got like

3208
01:39:36,230 --> 01:39:37,570
whole bunches of information

3209
01:39:37,570 --> 01:39:38,950
that you've refused to share.

3210
01:39:39,070 --> 01:39:39,930
You know, you've started

3211
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:41,210
to bring it up and then decided

3212
01:39:41,210 --> 01:39:41,950
not to share it.

3213
01:39:42,190 --> 01:39:42,930
Is that what you're

3214
01:39:42,930 --> 01:39:44,010
actually waiting for?

3215
01:39:44,450 --> 01:39:46,110
The general realization

3216
01:39:46,110 --> 01:39:47,170
by the planet that

3217
01:39:47,170 --> 01:39:48,490
every single institution

3218
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:50,090
that they have some kind of faith in

3219
01:39:50,090 --> 01:39:51,050
is a fraud.

3220
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:53,270
And then people will be able

3221
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:54,390
to receive what you what you

3222
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:55,610
what you can tell them.

3223
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:56,790
Man, I couldn't have

3224
01:39:56,790 --> 01:39:57,930
said it better myself.

3225
01:40:00,030 --> 01:40:00,730
Thank you, Vinny.

3226
01:40:01,570 --> 01:40:02,930
Are you asking or telling?

3227
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:05,870
Well, I guess I just

3228
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:06,950
answered my own question.

3229
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:10,570
There's a time for everything.

3230
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:11,490
It's just like remember.

3231
01:40:11,490 --> 01:40:12,690
Have you ever heard of?

3232
01:40:13,390 --> 01:40:14,050
What is it?

3233
01:40:14,110 --> 01:40:15,830
The guy who back in the 19

3234
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:17,670
early 1900s, who used to catalog

3235
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:19,470
all the anomalous paranormal events

3236
01:40:20,090 --> 01:40:21,570
starts with an F, I think.

3237
01:40:21,690 --> 01:40:22,010
What's his?

3238
01:40:22,110 --> 01:40:24,290
No, he was like the first.

3239
01:40:27,010 --> 01:40:28,690
Anyway, you know, they asked him,

3240
01:40:29,110 --> 01:40:30,970
you know, if if all these

3241
01:40:30,970 --> 01:40:32,250
everything has been

3242
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:33,910
there's nothing new under the sun.

3243
01:40:33,930 --> 01:40:35,610
Why? Why did the steam engine

3244
01:40:35,610 --> 01:40:36,990
only come out 100 years ago?

3245
01:40:37,030 --> 01:40:37,810
He says, because it was

3246
01:40:37,810 --> 01:40:38,830
steam engine time.

3247
01:40:39,990 --> 01:40:40,990
You see, Hero's engine

3248
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:42,570
200 B.C.

3249
01:40:42,670 --> 01:40:43,690
The Greeks had a turbine,

3250
01:40:43,870 --> 01:40:44,730
a steam turbine, which is

3251
01:40:44,730 --> 01:40:45,610
far more advanced than

3252
01:40:45,610 --> 01:40:46,590
the regular steam engine.

3253
01:40:47,190 --> 01:40:48,630
200 B.C., but it wasn't

3254
01:40:48,630 --> 01:40:49,590
steam engine time.

3255
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:51,110
They had to wait for Fulton.

3256
01:40:51,990 --> 01:40:53,030
You see, so right now

3257
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:53,930
it's not time for that.

3258
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:54,750
You've got to know the right

3259
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:55,770
time as well, right?

3260
01:40:56,910 --> 01:40:58,130
Well, the elite have a

3261
01:40:58,490 --> 01:40:59,430
sense of timing.

3262
01:41:00,830 --> 01:41:02,650
And I think, what was it?

3263
01:41:02,730 --> 01:41:03,370
Astro theology.

3264
01:41:04,010 --> 01:41:05,170
You don't believe in astro

3265
01:41:05,170 --> 01:41:06,850
theology or any of this stuff?

3266
01:41:07,370 --> 01:41:08,110
Oh, no, well, that's just

3267
01:41:08,110 --> 01:41:09,830
all that stuff is the fox

3268
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:10,270
and the grape.

3269
01:41:10,290 --> 01:41:11,050
So they don't understand

3270
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:11,610
what they're reading.

3271
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:12,710
So they'll make stuff up.

3272
01:41:14,270 --> 01:41:15,350
It sounds good.

3273
01:41:15,430 --> 01:41:17,970
What do you believe, though?

3274
01:41:18,090 --> 01:41:19,370
I mean, here's the thing.

3275
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:21,190
You don't you don't actually

3276
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:22,910
have any beliefs.

3277
01:41:23,070 --> 01:41:24,150
You've got what you know

3278
01:41:24,150 --> 01:41:25,970
and what you're curious about.

3279
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:27,450
Yeah, because they used to

3280
01:41:27,450 --> 01:41:29,090
hang around farmers and miners.

3281
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:31,390
If you're on a mine or a farm

3282
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:33,310
and you start talking beliefs,

3283
01:41:33,310 --> 01:41:34,650
you'll get kicked off that place

3284
01:41:34,650 --> 01:41:35,950
because they have to function

3285
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:36,970
on things that work.

3286
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:41,260
Well, maybe that's

3287
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:42,920
an interesting way of

3288
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:45,660
looking at how the world is

3289
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:47,500
misfiring, misfunctioning,

3290
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,520
because let me let me

3291
01:41:50,520 --> 01:41:51,420
just hear me out here.

3292
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:55,080
Maybe people are so stupid

3293
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:57,160
that they don't realize

3294
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:58,000
that they're stupid.

3295
01:41:58,500 --> 01:41:59,460
OK, I heard an interesting

3296
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:01,380
statistic that tells you

3297
01:42:01,380 --> 01:42:02,420
everything you need to know

3298
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:03,080
about America.

3299
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:04,840
This was a Lewis Black

3300
01:42:04,840 --> 01:42:06,360
comedian said this.

3301
01:42:06,660 --> 01:42:07,760
It was a recent study

3302
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:09,480
in the United States

3303
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:11,680
determined that four percent

3304
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:12,940
of Americans believe

3305
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:13,640
that they're below

3306
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:14,960
average intelligence.

3307
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,420
And it's always not the one

3308
01:42:19,420 --> 01:42:20,020
being interviewed.

3309
01:42:20,220 --> 01:42:21,700
It's the next guy like the T-shirt.

3310
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:23,060
You know, I'm with stupid.

3311
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:24,220
Remember that with the finger

3312
01:42:24,220 --> 01:42:25,080
pointing over, you know,

3313
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:25,740
in the 70s?

3314
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:27,840
Well, anyway, exactly.

3315
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:29,680
Stupid people are like

3316
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:30,420
insane people.

3317
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:31,720
They don't know they're stupid.

3318
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:32,980
Insane people don't know

3319
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:34,020
that they're insane.

3320
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:36,620
OK, intelligent people question

3321
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:37,420
am I stupid?

3322
01:42:38,140 --> 01:42:39,440
But a stupid person does not.

3323
01:42:40,420 --> 01:42:42,800
A sane person questions

3324
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:44,060
am I going crazy?

3325
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:46,320
But a crazy person does not.

3326
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:48,680
Well, look, I think

3327
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:50,520
there's a level of stupidity

3328
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:52,300
around with everyone.

3329
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:53,300
It's just that some people

3330
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:54,780
are less stupid than others.

3331
01:42:55,320 --> 01:42:56,860
And there's a level of insanity

3332
01:42:56,860 --> 01:42:58,040
going around with everyone.

3333
01:42:58,140 --> 01:42:58,900
And some people are just

3334
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:00,500
less insane than others.

3335
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:01,880
You know what it's like?

3336
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:04,380
It's like when I was in Woodshop

3337
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:05,640
and we had to plane,

3338
01:43:06,380 --> 01:43:08,280
you know, these little shafts

3339
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:10,060
of bloody wood off this thing

3340
01:43:10,060 --> 01:43:11,020
in order to smooth it down

3341
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:12,040
to the shape that we want.

3342
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:13,820
You know, get this one off

3343
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:14,720
and that one off

3344
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:15,480
and this one off

3345
01:43:15,480 --> 01:43:16,280
and this one off.

3346
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:17,540
And before you know it,

3347
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:18,660
you've actually got something

3348
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:20,280
that you can be proud of.

3349
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:22,380
Something that's got craftsmanship.

3350
01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:23,580
But it takes a hell of a lot

3351
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:24,600
and you have to discard

3352
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:27,960
most of what you had to start with.

3353
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:29,380
Well, speaking of craftsmanship,

3354
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,120
if I was less stupid myself,

3355
01:43:31,220 --> 01:43:32,180
personally, I wouldn't be

3356
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:33,540
calling in speaking to you now.

3357
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:34,800
I'd be putting the finishing touches

3358
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:35,840
on my flying saucer

3359
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:37,100
and getting off the stinking rock.

3360
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:39,020
But anyway, did I just say that on air?

3361
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:43,700
OK, so anyway, you see how it goes?

3362
01:43:46,070 --> 01:43:47,550
Everything's just kind of nuts anyway.

3363
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:51,350
And maybe, maybe that's part of the reason

3364
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:52,450
why so many truthists

3365
01:43:52,450 --> 01:43:53,570
think that they're going crazy.

3366
01:43:53,630 --> 01:43:54,890
It's because everything else

3367
01:43:54,890 --> 01:43:56,810
is fucking nuts, right?

3368
01:43:57,190 --> 01:43:59,410
And everything's so stupid.

3369
01:43:59,550 --> 01:44:00,210
Have you ever noticed

3370
01:44:00,210 --> 01:44:01,490
that people who are incredibly,

3371
01:44:01,790 --> 01:44:04,170
just ridiculously stupid

3372
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:06,110
make you feel crazy?

3373
01:44:08,510 --> 01:44:09,690
Well, it's not, you know,

3374
01:44:09,730 --> 01:44:11,490
here's just on a tangent here,

3375
01:44:11,530 --> 01:44:12,850
which is along the same path.

3376
01:44:13,170 --> 01:44:14,410
There's a lot of talk

3377
01:44:14,410 --> 01:44:16,370
about misinformation, disinformation,

3378
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:18,870
lack of information, ignorance, stupidity.

3379
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:20,430
I haven't found that

3380
01:44:20,430 --> 01:44:21,970
to be the main problem.

3381
01:44:22,070 --> 01:44:23,090
The main problem is

3382
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:25,250
when you confront someone

3383
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:26,490
with a piece of information

3384
01:44:26,490 --> 01:44:28,670
that is newly imparted to them, OK,

3385
01:44:28,770 --> 01:44:30,450
new to their psyche and consciousness,

3386
01:44:30,730 --> 01:44:32,710
put cognitive dissonance aside.

3387
01:44:32,870 --> 01:44:34,570
We're talking about rational thought here,

3388
01:44:34,670 --> 01:44:35,590
OK, and critical thought.

3389
01:44:36,150 --> 01:44:37,710
Very often you'll get, you know,

3390
01:44:37,710 --> 01:44:39,590
I haven't heard of that before.

3391
01:44:40,370 --> 01:44:41,190
And you know what?

3392
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:43,090
I don't want to know about that.

3393
01:44:43,190 --> 01:44:44,010
And I don't care.

3394
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:48,600
Wow. OK, so that's not ignorance anymore.

3395
01:44:48,780 --> 01:44:52,180
That is a response of

3396
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:54,040
stubbornness, rebelliousness,

3397
01:44:54,140 --> 01:44:55,500
let's say apathy.

3398
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:57,440
You get where I'm going with it?

3399
01:44:57,940 --> 01:44:58,920
No, it's fear.

3400
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:01,320
They're afraid to admit that they're wrong

3401
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:02,660
because they've been taught

3402
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:03,820
throughout their entire life

3403
01:45:03,820 --> 01:45:05,460
that being wrong is a bad thing

3404
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:07,040
as opposed to an experience

3405
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:07,820
you can learn from.

3406
01:45:07,820 --> 01:45:08,620
Well, hold on.

3407
01:45:08,700 --> 01:45:10,080
I didn't say something right or wrong.

3408
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:11,660
This is a new bit of information

3409
01:45:11,660 --> 01:45:12,900
that they could have never gone

3410
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:14,260
either left or right on it.

3411
01:45:14,340 --> 01:45:16,380
This is a totally new bit of information.

3412
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:18,700
It doesn't conflict

3413
01:45:18,700 --> 01:45:20,020
with their belief structure at all?

3414
01:45:20,080 --> 01:45:21,160
It's just a random factoid?

3415
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:22,480
Yeah, yeah.

3416
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:23,880
Like let's say chemtrails, you know,

3417
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:25,180
sometimes I'll be in a parking lot

3418
01:45:25,180 --> 01:45:26,060
and I'll see a rational,

3419
01:45:27,340 --> 01:45:28,480
seemingly rational individual.

3420
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:29,720
And I'll say, well,

3421
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:31,300
you know, it's interesting.

3422
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:32,600
Those are not chemtrails, you know.

3423
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:33,080
I said, oh, really?

3424
01:45:33,120 --> 01:45:34,080
I've never noticed that, you know.

3425
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:35,340
I said, you know, they're steam, right?

3426
01:45:35,380 --> 01:45:36,120
I said, no, they're not steam.

3427
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:37,680
I'll explain why they're not steam.

3428
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:39,640
Yeah, I'm not into that.

3429
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:40,500
I don't want to know about it.

3430
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:42,660
I'm like, dude, you're breathing it.

3431
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:43,220
What do you mean you don't

3432
01:45:43,220 --> 01:45:44,180
want to know about it?

3433
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:46,900
Well, it's the psyche.

3434
01:45:47,020 --> 01:45:47,540
There's no, yeah.

3435
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:48,360
No, no, no.

3436
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:50,200
Because those people are operating

3437
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:51,300
under a belief structure.

3438
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:53,820
The belief structure is I'm not a lab rat

3439
01:45:53,820 --> 01:45:55,960
in a giant open-air fucking

3440
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:58,420
breathe tank experiment, OK?

3441
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:00,200
Hold on.

3442
01:46:00,420 --> 01:46:01,820
Yeah, but it's not about belief.

3443
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:03,420
There's just like, go to a Christian,

3444
01:46:03,540 --> 01:46:04,700
open the Bible and show them

3445
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:05,940
something in there.

3446
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:06,840
The first thing they tell you,

3447
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:08,200
that's not my Bible,

3448
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:10,060
so it can't be the same thing in there.

3449
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:13,220
Or, you know, I have three books in the car.

3450
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:14,200
I have the Book of Mormon,

3451
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:16,160
the Koran, and the Bible.

3452
01:46:16,340 --> 01:46:17,400
So if you ever get into these

3453
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:18,460
conversations in public

3454
01:46:18,460 --> 01:46:19,180
and they want to argue,

3455
01:46:19,180 --> 01:46:20,260
I said, I happen to have a copy

3456
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:21,220
in the car right here.

3457
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:24,760
And I once had a parking attendant

3458
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:27,560
who was a Muslim, self-professed.

3459
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:29,620
And he was telling me about this

3460
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:30,360
and that, this and that.

3461
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:31,600
I said, where'd you hear that?

3462
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:33,260
And he said, well, at the mosque

3463
01:46:33,260 --> 01:46:33,800
with the imam.

3464
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:35,120
I said, that's not in the Koran.

3465
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:35,940
He says, yes, it is.

3466
01:46:35,940 --> 01:46:38,280
I happen to have a copy right here.

3467
01:46:38,380 --> 01:46:39,080
Let me show you.

3468
01:46:39,820 --> 01:46:40,980
You see, it's just, yeah.

3469
01:46:41,100 --> 01:46:41,880
So the belief,

3470
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:43,200
what does belief have to do with it?

3471
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:47,320
Well, I think what you do

3472
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:51,300
is eventually you lose curiosity

3473
01:46:51,300 --> 01:46:52,860
and you don't want to know.

3474
01:46:53,300 --> 01:46:53,500
All right.

3475
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:55,300
It's not like you can't know.

3476
01:46:55,460 --> 01:46:56,360
It's that you don't want to.

3477
01:46:56,780 --> 01:46:57,040
All right.

3478
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:58,480
You lose curiosity.

3479
01:46:58,780 --> 01:47:00,280
You can lose curiosity

3480
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,720
by a number of different mechanisms.

3481
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:05,760
Curiosity, for example,

3482
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:06,620
getting punished.

3483
01:47:07,040 --> 01:47:07,780
You know, if you're curious

3484
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:09,140
about something and you go

3485
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:10,320
do that at work or whatever

3486
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:11,400
and you fuck something up

3487
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:12,880
and the boss punishes you

3488
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:14,660
or even maybe that could start

3489
01:47:14,660 --> 01:47:18,140
to manifest during your younger years

3490
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:20,440
and your parents punish you

3491
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:21,960
for questioning certain things

3492
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:22,520
or whatever.

3493
01:47:23,240 --> 01:47:26,020
And basically through a series

3494
01:47:26,020 --> 01:47:28,160
of trauma-based mind control incidents

3495
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:29,800
called modern life,

3496
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:32,220
you can lose your curiosity

3497
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:33,460
quite easily.

3498
01:47:33,740 --> 01:47:35,260
And most people have already.

3499
01:47:36,020 --> 01:47:37,080
You know what?

3500
01:47:37,180 --> 01:47:37,840
What's interesting?

3501
01:47:37,940 --> 01:47:38,780
I'll throw this in there.

3502
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:41,560
I've seen that in ancient life as well

3503
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:43,100
through what's been memorialized.

3504
01:47:45,610 --> 01:47:46,770
You know, the ancients

3505
01:47:46,770 --> 01:47:47,650
were like this as well.

3506
01:47:48,250 --> 01:47:50,750
When an old idea gets old enough

3507
01:47:50,750 --> 01:47:52,670
that it becomes forgotten,

3508
01:47:53,350 --> 01:47:54,370
when it returns,

3509
01:47:54,830 --> 01:47:56,090
people think that it's new.

3510
01:47:56,570 --> 01:47:56,830
Yeah.

3511
01:47:58,030 --> 01:47:58,930
That's why if you want

3512
01:47:58,930 --> 01:47:59,990
a really new idea,

3513
01:48:00,170 --> 01:48:01,410
read a really old book.

3514
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:05,280
When the hell was the last time

3515
01:48:05,280 --> 01:48:06,320
somebody actually came up

3516
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,120
with a new idea?

3517
01:48:08,440 --> 01:48:09,420
I don't know.

3518
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:10,940
We'd have to redefine the word new

3519
01:48:10,940 --> 01:48:12,360
if nothing is new.

3520
01:48:13,940 --> 01:48:16,000
Well, there's nothing new under the sun.

3521
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:17,400
It's all just a repetition

3522
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:18,840
and stuff like that.

3523
01:48:19,240 --> 01:48:20,060
God damn it.

3524
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:21,920
There's an experiment going on here.

3525
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:23,020
That's what I'm starting to really

3526
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:23,940
think about that.

3527
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,100
Like there's actually a point

3528
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:27,120
like a computer game,

3529
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:28,860
a hologram or something like that.

3530
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:30,820
There's actually an objective here.

3531
01:48:31,180 --> 01:48:33,380
Now, the human race hasn't fulfilled

3532
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:36,800
whatever the fuck that objective is yet.

3533
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:38,220
And until we do,

3534
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:39,500
we're going to keep repeating

3535
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:40,640
the same fucking cycles.

3536
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:41,540
No, you're not.

3537
01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:42,500
Hold on. It has.

3538
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:44,680
It has because it's just

3539
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:45,920
like baking a cake.

3540
01:48:46,140 --> 01:48:46,920
It needs a cure.

3541
01:48:47,380 --> 01:48:48,360
There's a curing period.

3542
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:49,940
Just like, you know,

3543
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:51,140
a cake is what, 45 minutes

3544
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:51,960
at a certain temperature

3545
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:53,740
or certain epoxies,

3546
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:55,400
you know, hold for 30 minutes

3547
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:57,120
or there's a curing period.

3548
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:58,680
In other words, until it's set,

3549
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:01,560
you know, and that period ended already.

3550
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:04,220
And that's what's so freaking exciting.

3551
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:06,160
But the problem is that time

3552
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:07,860
isn't reckoned with the Gregorian

3553
01:49:07,860 --> 01:49:09,180
Pope's work schedule.

3554
01:49:10,180 --> 01:49:11,620
So anyway, you know how they say

3555
01:49:11,620 --> 01:49:12,880
it's 2015 or whatever,

3556
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:14,340
whatever happened all the other

3557
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:15,380
years before that.

3558
01:49:15,580 --> 01:49:16,740
What the hell's going on?

3559
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:18,920
And if today is what they call

3560
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:20,200
whatever this day of the week,

3561
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:21,540
last year was another day of the week.

3562
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:22,680
So what day of the week is it?

3563
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:24,720
You know, the biggest problem

3564
01:49:24,720 --> 01:49:26,940
that I see is that everyone

3565
01:49:26,940 --> 01:49:28,000
is not a problem.

3566
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:29,600
And I don't really see it as a problem.

3567
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:31,160
I'll retract that statement

3568
01:49:31,660 --> 01:49:33,700
is that everyone is operating

3569
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:35,060
under the Pope's work schedule.

3570
01:49:35,060 --> 01:49:36,900
And even something maybe as trivial

3571
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:39,300
and as minimal and as insignificant

3572
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:41,020
as keeping time has been lost.

3573
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:44,400
It's a very heavy slave

3574
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:47,080
outline that's been put on mankind,

3575
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:48,480
which is the Pope's work schedule.

3576
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:50,800
That's why when I hear people

3577
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:51,900
bad mouthing the Vatican,

3578
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:53,560
all I have to do is ask him

3579
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:54,240
what day it is.

3580
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:55,480
And if they say anything between

3581
01:49:55,480 --> 01:49:56,560
January or December,

3582
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:57,540
Monday through Friday,

3583
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,140
they're admitting with their own mouth

3584
01:50:00,140 --> 01:50:01,280
that they're the Pope's subject.

3585
01:50:01,460 --> 01:50:02,220
So they're, you know,

3586
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:03,060
they're pretty twisted.

3587
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:05,140
But, you know, not that

3588
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:07,100
not that bad mouthing

3589
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:08,000
the Vatican is twisted.

3590
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:09,340
But I'm just saying that, you know,

3591
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:10,240
people don't have their

3592
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:11,580
their house in order.

3593
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:13,220
You got to get it in order first

3594
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:14,680
before you go about

3595
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:16,140
and do things like that.

3596
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:17,560
That's why I sort of

3597
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:19,220
kind of stay retracted.

3598
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:21,120
But but anyway, I'm open to

3599
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:22,620
all suggestions and considerations

3600
01:50:22,620 --> 01:50:23,920
if there's anything you'd ever

3601
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:24,900
want to hear discussed.

3602
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:27,400
So I'll just put that out there.

3603
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:29,640
Yeah, I don't know.

3604
01:50:29,680 --> 01:50:30,460
I was just thinking about

3605
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:32,120
like the purpose of life itself.

3606
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:33,440
You know, for me, it's

3607
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:34,660
for me, it's quite easy to find

3608
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:36,340
my purpose in life, you know.

3609
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:37,360
But I'm talking about

3610
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:38,800
life in the aggregate.

3611
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:41,260
I'm talking about all the organisms

3612
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:42,780
and everything.

3613
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:46,640
It's working together in some way

3614
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:47,840
in a symbiotic fashion

3615
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:51,620
and behaving independent of each other.

3616
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:54,100
But is there actually an overall purpose?

3617
01:50:54,200 --> 01:50:55,800
Like there's a reason why this

3618
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:57,640
why this fish died today

3619
01:50:57,640 --> 01:50:58,800
of radiation poisoning

3620
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:01,240
and a reason why that squirrel died yesterday

3621
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:04,660
after getting run over by a kid

3622
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:07,100
that stole his mom's jeep

3623
01:51:07,100 --> 01:51:08,460
and filled it up with,

3624
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:10,040
you know, really high octane

3625
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:11,620
petrol and drag raced his mates

3626
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:12,860
on a skateboard that had

3627
01:51:12,860 --> 01:51:14,420
rocket boosters attached to it.

3628
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:15,740
And the poor squirrel got run over.

3629
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:16,720
You know what?

3630
01:51:16,820 --> 01:51:17,900
Well, there's a purpose.

3631
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:19,440
It's an overlying kind of

3632
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:20,880
like real strange sort of

3633
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:21,840
interconnected web.

3634
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:23,060
And here it is.

3635
01:51:23,540 --> 01:51:24,520
It's very simple.

3636
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:26,740
People are humanities

3637
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:27,920
is too egocentric.

3638
01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:28,760
You know, like the world

3639
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:30,380
world revolves around me.

3640
01:51:30,380 --> 01:51:31,520
It's all about us, right?

3641
01:51:31,580 --> 01:51:32,220
We'll get over it.

3642
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:32,740
It's not.

3643
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:34,060
There is a cosmic

3644
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:35,340
there's a multitude of

3645
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:37,160
cosmic things going on right now.

3646
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:38,420
And there's an element

3647
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:39,880
or an entity called death.

3648
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,900
As you so give us the examples on.

3649
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:45,000
And when this element

3650
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:46,340
this thing called death

3651
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:47,620
or in other circles,

3652
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:48,680
it might be called entropy,

3653
01:51:48,940 --> 01:51:50,320
which is degradation, rot,

3654
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:53,060
you know, decay, entropy, right?

3655
01:51:53,160 --> 01:51:54,240
Like an energetic system

3656
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:55,540
suffer entropy when they

3657
01:51:55,540 --> 01:51:56,840
lose their power.

3658
01:51:57,200 --> 01:52:00,160
OK, this entropic destruction

3659
01:52:00,160 --> 01:52:01,580
or something called death.

3660
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:04,280
This is a time for it's

3661
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:06,460
it's peaking and death

3662
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:07,720
will be put to death.

3663
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:09,260
It actually already has in some

3664
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:12,540
point at some point, not here.

3665
01:52:12,720 --> 01:52:14,140
And when it reaches here,

3666
01:52:14,180 --> 01:52:14,880
meaning the earth,

3667
01:52:14,980 --> 01:52:16,140
there will be no more death.

3668
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:17,720
And that will really

3669
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:18,780
change the consciousness.

3670
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,000
And what I mean by that

3671
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,200
is imagine being born

3672
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:23,040
and not going through puberty

3673
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,680
till you're about 35 or 40.

3674
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,420
Or, you know, if there's

3675
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:27,520
a funeral for someone

3676
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:28,700
at 100 years old,

3677
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:29,760
it'll be a child's funeral.

3678
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:33,240
So this is kind of pretty amazing.

3679
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:34,800
And yes, there is a meaning of life

3680
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:36,100
and it's not about us right now,

3681
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:36,900
even though it is.

3682
01:52:38,760 --> 01:52:40,780
So that sounds about right.

3683
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:42,920
It's when death is

3684
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:44,100
very difficult to see.

3685
01:52:44,420 --> 01:52:45,760
Here's another analogy of it.

3686
01:52:45,780 --> 01:52:46,720
Have you ever heard of anyone

3687
01:52:46,720 --> 01:52:48,380
being brought up or raised

3688
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:50,060
or born in a war zone?

3689
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:51,820
You know, if you ever discussed

3690
01:52:51,820 --> 01:52:54,360
anything with old European people,

3691
01:52:54,420 --> 01:52:55,760
I was born during the war

3692
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:57,040
and childhood was terrible.

3693
01:52:57,180 --> 01:52:58,220
We had to eat shoes

3694
01:52:58,220 --> 01:52:59,700
and couldn't find any food

3695
01:52:59,700 --> 01:53:00,120
and all that.

3696
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:02,860
This is a period of over 6,000 years

3697
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:04,620
where mankind has been in a war zone.

3698
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:06,320
Don't take it personally.

3699
01:53:07,900 --> 01:53:08,680
Yeah, the meaning of life

3700
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:09,420
is quite simple.

3701
01:53:09,560 --> 01:53:10,580
It's just that it's so simple

3702
01:53:10,580 --> 01:53:11,600
that it can't be described

3703
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:12,980
because we're mid-range thinkers.

3704
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:15,160
We cannot comprehend the complex

3705
01:53:15,160 --> 01:53:17,440
and we cannot comprehend the simple.

3706
01:53:17,980 --> 01:53:19,440
And explaining the meaning of life

3707
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:20,960
in a mid-range way is very difficult.

3708
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:23,000
But I just use the contrast

3709
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,540
that when there is no more death,

3710
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,140
you will see more meaning

3711
01:53:26,140 --> 01:53:27,640
in what just happened.

3712
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:30,740
The entire human epoch.

3713
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:32,900
Well, that's because at the point

3714
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:34,560
where you no longer fear death,

3715
01:53:34,620 --> 01:53:36,000
you're not struggling in the survival

3716
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:37,340
because when you're struggling

3717
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:38,080
for survival,

3718
01:53:38,260 --> 01:53:39,380
you're in a lower brain

3719
01:53:39,380 --> 01:53:40,500
fight or flight mode

3720
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:41,300
and you can't access

3721
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:42,400
higher fucking consciousness.

3722
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:44,400
So imagine how many people

3723
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:46,300
would be able to access

3724
01:53:46,300 --> 01:53:47,180
higher consciousness

3725
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:48,660
if they had no fear of death.

3726
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:51,300
Yeah, but look, okay.

3727
01:53:51,660 --> 01:53:53,060
Fear of death, I don't like that.

3728
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:54,900
Look, I'll just throw in this.

3729
01:53:55,420 --> 01:53:56,600
It's not whether I like it or not.

3730
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:58,960
The ancient Greeks used to say

3731
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:00,340
that those who are afraid of dying

3732
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:01,960
or have fear don't know how to live.

3733
01:54:02,420 --> 01:54:04,160
So maybe focusing on how to live better

3734
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:05,540
and then the fear part goes away.

3735
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:09,620
Yeah, well, like I said before,

3736
01:54:09,820 --> 01:54:11,600
it makes sense because to me,

3737
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:13,020
the only things that make sense

3738
01:54:13,020 --> 01:54:15,260
have some kind of cosmic irony to them.

3739
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:17,460
Oh yeah, there's a sense of humor.

3740
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:18,020
There's irony.

3741
01:54:18,540 --> 01:54:19,260
There's everything.

3742
01:54:19,640 --> 01:54:24,160
Everything is something and nothing, right?

3743
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:26,160
That's cosmic irony.

3744
01:54:26,600 --> 01:54:27,400
Like, for example,

3745
01:54:27,540 --> 01:54:29,380
somebody could be a great lover

3746
01:54:29,380 --> 01:54:30,720
and a complete bastard.

3747
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:33,960
All right.

3748
01:54:34,080 --> 01:54:35,000
Well, anyway, the Greek.

3749
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:35,880
Thank you very much.

3750
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:37,120
It was great.

3751
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:38,420
And ladies and gentlemen,

3752
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:40,720
remember on Sunday to check out

3753
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:42,280
the American Freedom Radio Marathon,

3754
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:45,520
we need to raise some cash for the studio.

3755
01:54:45,660 --> 01:54:48,020
So please check that out, promote it,

3756
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:50,220
share it out on social media,

3757
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:52,300
email your congressman

3758
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:53,240
and stuff like that.

3759
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:54,300
Tell them to shut us down

3760
01:54:54,300 --> 01:54:55,520
because if they do shut us down,

3761
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:56,820
it'll give us a hell of a lot more attention.

3762
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:59,520
Please, you know, just go ape shit.

3763
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:00,100
All right.

3764
01:55:00,820 --> 01:55:02,120
Support American Freedom Radio,

3765
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:03,880
support the Vinnie Eastwood Show,

3766
01:55:04,060 --> 01:55:05,700
and we will see you again sometime,

3767
01:55:06,160 --> 01:55:06,540
assuredly.

3768
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:07,740
Thank you very much for listening.

3769
01:55:30,140 --> 01:55:32,660
News and information you can trust.

3770
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:35,720
This is American Freedom Radio.

3771
01:55:35,980 --> 01:55:39,420
Freedom, freedom, American Freedom Radio.

3772
01:55:39,940 --> 01:55:40,740
Radio.

3773
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:44,440
American Freedom Radio.

3774
01:55:45,780 --> 01:55:48,380
Nutritious food is real body armor.

3775
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:50,400
It builds muscle, burns fat,

3776
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:53,080
improves digestion and feeds the entire body

3777
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:54,540
the nutrients it needs.

3778
01:55:54,540 --> 01:55:56,360
Did you know the U.S. government banned

3779
01:55:56,360 --> 01:55:58,560
the hemp plant from growing in the United States

3780
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:00,720
and classified it as a Schedule 1 drug

3781
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:02,720
to hide it behind the marijuana plant?

3782
01:56:02,860 --> 01:56:04,660
People have been confused about this plant

3783
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:06,080
for over 80 years,

3784
01:56:06,140 --> 01:56:08,300
and many still don't know what hemp is.

3785
01:56:08,460 --> 01:56:10,740
So now you know hemp is not marijuana

3786
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:12,700
and marijuana is not hemp.

3787
01:56:12,780 --> 01:56:15,080
They are different varieties of the same species.

3788
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:17,240
HempUSA.org wants the world

3789
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:18,700
to know these basic facts

3790
01:56:18,700 --> 01:56:20,140
and to help people understand

3791
01:56:20,140 --> 01:56:21,340
that hemp protein powder

3792
01:56:21,340 --> 01:56:22,820
is the best kept health secret

3793
01:56:22,820 --> 01:56:24,220
you need to know about.

3794
01:56:24,220 --> 01:56:26,060
Remember, hemp protein powder

3795
01:56:26,060 --> 01:56:28,000
contains 53% protein,

3796
01:56:28,240 --> 01:56:29,160
is gluten-free,

3797
01:56:29,420 --> 01:56:30,500
anti-inflammatory,

3798
01:56:30,680 --> 01:56:31,400
non-GMO,

3799
01:56:31,660 --> 01:56:33,080

What kind of person are you?

3806
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:49,200
How do you see yourself?

3807
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:51,040
Are you the kind of person

3808
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:53,460
that lets everyone else do all the work,

3809
01:56:53,460 --> 01:56:55,260
just hoping that you'll be able

3810
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:56,620
to get some of the crumbs

3811
01:56:56,620 --> 01:56:57,900
that fall from the table?

3812
01:56:58,180 --> 01:56:59,560
Or are you the kind of person

3813
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:00,940
that rolls up their sleeves

3814
01:57:00,940 --> 01:57:02,460
and does the dirty jobs

3815
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:04,060
that no one else wants to do?

3816
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,100
Are you hoping that all the activists

3817
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:08,380
giving their blood, sweat and tears

3818
01:57:08,380 --> 01:57:09,500
to serve humanity

3819
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:10,580
are going to solve

3820
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:11,780
all the world's problems?

3821
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:13,500
Or are you just wondering,

3822
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:15,060
is there something simple

3823
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:16,320
I can do to contribute?

epilepsy and autism,

rising mental disorders,

constructive dialogue with true independence.

3867

The freedom to broadcast the truth

3868
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:56,300
is not free at all.

3869
01:58:56,600 --> 01:58:58,900
So what is American Freedom Radio worth to you?

3870
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:01,060
