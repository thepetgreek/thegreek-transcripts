1
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:42,840
Unity is what we need with peace and love and harmony.

2
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:57,200
Unity is strength and assure success all for one and one for all.

3
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,560
Unity means solidarity.

4
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:11,140
United we stand, divided we fall.

5
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,660
Unity, please don't desert me.

6
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,180
You're the sweetest honey from the honey bee.

7
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:30,440
Unity, please don't desert me.

8
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,040
We need your sweetness like the core of the honey bee.

9
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,680
So please hear my plea.

10
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,520
Please don't desert me.

11
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,580
Another exciting edition.

12
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,380
Yes, I know you've all been waiting a very long time.

13
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,240
Since yesterday.

14
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,640
If you heard another episode of the Vinnie Eastwood Show live.

15
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,000
And all of those of you listening in on the archives,

16
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,080
think of maybe that one point or two, you know,

17
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,640
saying that you want to call in.

18
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,500
Let's say, for example, you listen to an archive show and you're like,

19
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,720
oh, man, I would have loved to have called in for that.

20
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,880
Well, seriously, hold that thought.

21
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,580
Whatever it was at the time that you wanted to say,

22
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,760
call up later about it, you know, send us a message.

23
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,060
We can get you up on air.

24
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,880
It'll be all good.

25
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,780
Because you understand how the platform of the show works, right?

26
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,160
It's about giving all those other people a voice.

27
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,860
You know, there's other people who don't have radio shows

28
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,580
and YouTube channels like I do.

29
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,220
You know, I may be able to put stuff together,

30
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,320
but ultimately I ain't got the info.

31
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:51,840
I don't have the content to fill that airtime with.

32
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,760
Conveniently, though, there's many activists and whistleblowers

33
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:03,080
all over the world who routinely donate extraordinarily large amounts

34
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:09,440
of their time to expose something that I've come to identify as scumbaggery.

35
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:17,720
Now, we were talking earlier with my mate Steve Moyer.

36
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,200
I think he's in Canada at the moment.

37
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,880
He lived in New Zealand a few years.

38
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,020
And he wants to put it in the dictionary.

39
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,440
You know, there's the UrbanDictionary.com.

40
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:35,060
You know, just put it on in there, add scumbaggery to the global language.

41
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,480
It'll be great.

42
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,120
Definitions, on the other hand, these are the ones that Steve's come up with.

43
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,720
One who steals from others' even close friends,

44
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,720
who rats out others' even close friends for small personal gain.

45
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,700
One who cheats, bribes, lies, and steals for personal gain.

46
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:00,740
One who offers other prizes to risk their own lives in the process

47
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,580
by eating a Cheetos bag.

48
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,760
One who threatens others with hired thugs

49
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,460
because he isn't man enough to do it himself.

50
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:18,240
I suppose, you know, those are things that do encompass

51
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:22,660
a lot of the general characteristics of somebody who engages in scumbaggery.

52
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,040
There are many dimensions to scumbaggery.

53
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,660
Like, for instance, the betraying other people,

54
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,040
which has been touched upon here.

55
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,400
Loyalty is something that kind of precludes you from being called a scumbag.

56
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,980
If you've got loyalty towards the human race and good stuff and what have you.

57
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,020
I mean, I don't know.

58
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,300
Maybe it's kind of puritanical.

59
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,360
I'm not 100% sure what the definition should be.

60
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,340
I just created the word.

61
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,500
I don't know what the meaning is.

62
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,780
But it's pretty straightforward.

63
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,500
Somebody who engages in and acts like a scumbag, hence scumbaggery.

64
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,320
Scumbags are defined as low, disgusting individuals

65
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,940
who have no loyalty, no faith, no honor.

66
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,260
Literally only live to be a burden on mankind

67
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,940
through their various mechanical means, financial,

68
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,340
and manipulation through the media in general.

69
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,940
In fact, there's just been a new bit of legislation passed speaking of scumbaggery.

70
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,860
The Honorable Simon Power,

71
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,360
who, after a few short years in Parliament,

72
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,580
wound up getting the top job at Westpac Bank,

73
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,680
which incidentally does all the government's banking.

74
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,500
In Australia, that would be illegal.

75
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,500
He's got it under his head,

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,280
probably whispered in his ear by World Bank

77
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,580
or other intelligence agency-oriented organizations

78
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,140
and associated dignitaries.

79
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,880
But they're going to try and, well,

80
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,740
shall we say regulate social media?

81
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,020
Now, I think that the whole point of social media

82
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,440
is that it is unregulated.

83
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,100
People can say what they want and whatever.

84
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,960
If you want to be on mainstream media,

85
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,100
you have an awful lot of rules that you have to comply by, okay?

86
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,480
That's why they choose not to say a whole lot of stuff

87
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,010
because they don't know 100% whether or not it's true.

88
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,810
They could just add the tagline, allegedly.

89
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,190
But, of course, you don't want people to be enlightened

90
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,790
that there are deeper things afoot, really.

91
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,410
One chopper crash is one chopper crash.

92
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:51,730
It's random.

93
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,850
One chopper crashing with virtually all of SEAL Team 6 in it

94
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,770
after killing Osama bin Laden.

95
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,870
Well, about a month or some amount of time

96
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,910
after killing Osama bin Laden, allegedly,

97
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,440
against standard operating procedure,

98
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,560
loading too many troops onto a chopper.

99
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,960
Isn't that strange, you know?

100
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,680
But the media didn't report little details like that.

101
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,620
No, because that would make you think,

102
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,580
hmm, did they really kill bin Laden?

103
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,840
Is this boogeyman really dead?

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,460
It doesn't even matter because we've got another boogeyman.

105
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,540
We had that Qaddafi.

106
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,640
Oh, wait, now he's dead.

107
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,100
Who's the next boogeyman?

108
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,140
Oh, Syria.

109
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,660
They're having a civil war in Syria, aren't they?

110
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,980
Oh, yeah, that's what the UN general,

111
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,140
what's her name,

112
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,800
chief of some description of random,

113
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,220
obscure UN declaration name

114
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,100
of some faceless person you never probably ever elect,

115
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,480
that person says,

116
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,200
oh, Syria's in the middle of a civil war

117
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,440
and we have to intervene.

118
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,140
Well, hasn't their argument always been

119
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,960
we have to intervene?

120
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,700
Have they ever changed their tune?

121
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,770
This is what scumbaggery is about.

122
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,970
Somebody who consistently lies to you

123
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,610
and does the direct opposite.

124
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,650
And if they lie to you

125
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,610
and do something really good for you,

126
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,350
like, for example,

127
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,370
no, no, I'm not getting you a birthday present

128
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,230
and then you turn up with something really awesome.

129
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,830
That's not scumbaggery.

130
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,150
If you lie to somebody and say,

131
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:37,309
oh, there's huge amounts of Iraqi forces

132
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,330
mounting on your border,

133
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,250
Saudi Arabia,

134
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:46,510
and we want to put bases all through your country

135
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,550
to protect you.

136
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,390
And they'll be permanent bases, of course,

137
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,450
so that we can station US troops in Saudi Arabia

138
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,450
at all times.

139
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,650
Oh.

140
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,710
Well, can you show us the satellite photographs

141
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:04,730
to prove that those tanks from Iraq

142
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,090
are actually massing on our border?

143
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,350
Well, you're going to have to trust us.

144
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,950
That's scumbaggery.

145
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:19,160
It's not something that grinds on you in a good way.

146
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,620
In the deep in the middle of the night

147
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,300
clubbing sense of the word, grinding.

148
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,480
It doesn't feel that nice.

149
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,500
It's not terribly fantastic in any way, shape or form.

150
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,280
It hurts.

151
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,000
You lose money over it.

152
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,640
You have bad experiences because of it.

153
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,080
And ultimately, sometimes people really do get killed

154
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,830
because of this general rule of thumb

155
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,050
called scumbaggery,

156
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:57,410
which I believe quite possibly

157
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,190
would encompass virtually every single politician.

158
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,530
Perhaps a few exceptions,

159
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,470
but ultimately the signs will still be there

160
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,910
through the events that pass forward.

161
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,710
I think that's another thing that people really need to understand

162
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,370
about politics in general.

163
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,930
It's freaking boring.

164
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,270
These people are droning on about this, that and the other

165
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,370
way to enslave you and take away your rights.

166
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,750
It just gets dull after a while.

167
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,230
Yes, I get it.

168
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,230
You're repeating to me and consistently taking away my rights.

169
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,010
I know, I'm a slave.

170
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,350
I get it.

171
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,710
You don't need to harp on about it.

172
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,590
This is the kind of scumbaggery

173
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,790
that really, really goes on the whole time.

174
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,870
That's how you define parties.

175
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,170
Look at what they said, then look at what they did.

176
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,850
If they match up, then you can trust them again.

177
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,690
If they don't match up, and in some parties' cases,

178
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,930
not one single thing that they said they'd do,

179
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,950
they actually did.

180
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,420
Those kind of parties, those kind of politicians.

181
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,320
Track record is the surefire way

182
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,500
to see whether or not somebody is worth

183
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,360
placing even a modicum of trust in.

184
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,060
Because the absence of scumbaggery

185
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:29,320
is very rare in the political class

186
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,180
or the high-level business world,

187
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,620
finance and the media,

188
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,500
you'll often see a lot of backstabbing

189
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,120
and general scumbaggery that will go on

190
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,660
inside organizations at those very top levels.

191
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,300
They're not up front with each other.

192
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,460
They're not honest.

193
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,540
They're always thinking about themselves

194
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,280
and how they can get to the top,

195
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,060
as opposed to an activist,

196
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,820
which is on the other end of this polar extreme scale,

197
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,600
who doesn't think quite so much about themselves.

198
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,020
They're more thinking about what the ramifications are

199
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,920
for everybody else.

200
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,760
They say if nobody else is going to make

201
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,940
a huge song and a dance about it, then I have to

202
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,480
because I was the one who just realized

203
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,600
what was going on.

204
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,400
That's what makes it happen.

205
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,520
You have to realize that it's your job.

206
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,820
If you come up with an idea,

207
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,180
it's not your job to go tell somebody else

208
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,600
who's already big and what have you.

209
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,440
Don't go and tell them the idea.

210
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,000
What you do is you put your heart into it.

211
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:37,760
Develop it.

212
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,300
Don't just think about it.

213
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,940
If you want to do something great,

214
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,560
don't just put your mind to it.

215
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,940
Put your heart into it.

216
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,380
Really, really put some effort in

217
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,760
and help to develop that idea.

218
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,640
It doesn't matter whether you have an idea

219
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,400
for a radio show or a song or a video

220
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,520
or anything that you can do on a computer these days,

221
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,640
a picture, a video game.

222
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,260
There are so many ways of now manipulating

223
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,840
the human mind that the media

224
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,480
and massive entertainment companies are using,

225
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,860
like the 3D glasses, for example.

226
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,660
Mate, that stuff is mesmerizing.

227
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,680
It's like as if you'd never watched TV

228
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,520
and suddenly gotten sucked in like a zombie again.

229
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,820
Unbelievable amounts of manipulative power

230
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,620
can be in there.

231
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,900
Now, manipulation in itself is kind of inanimate.

232
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,880
It doesn't imply, per se,

233
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,720
not to a very strict definition

234
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,020
of a bad intention.

235
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,980
For example, someone could manipulate a pencil

236
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,220
to write a great screenplay.

237
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,740
I could manipulate you into thinking

238
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,600
that you're strong, powerful, intelligent,

239
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,400
and that you can get the job done

240
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,920
and make your community a better place.

241
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,100
That's manipulation on a good note.

242
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,520
On the bad note, and as we all should be realizing right now,

243
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,540
unless, of course, you're still utterly naive,

244
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,620
that the world is not run by nice people.

245
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,520
They have nice people that are masqueraded

246
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,120
around all the place,

247
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,400
but they're not the ones really running the show.

248
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,580
They're not the ones who get camera time, okay?

249
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,160
The people who really, really

250
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,860
have inordinate amounts of influence

251
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,600
don't really like having their names all over the tabloids.

252
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,540
Not generally.

253
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,980
The wealthiest of the wealthiest of the wealthy,

254
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,520
nobody ever heard of them.

255
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,260
That's what we talk about when we talk about

256
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,580
the hidden hand in politics,

257
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,780
and that's why all these political parties

258
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,340
always do the exact same thing.

259
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,780
If not worse than the last guy.

260
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,120
You nearly see any improvement

261
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,760
because that is how the structure is rigged.

262
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,440
Only scumbags rise to the top.

263
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,620
Have you ever seen a pond

264
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,220
and it hasn't been cleaned for a long time?

265
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,000
Where does the scum well up?

266
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,220
It wells up at the top of the water on the surface.

267
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,640
That is the reason why these people make it to the top.

268
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,180
It's because that's where they're naturally suited.

269
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,680
That's the natural mode of progression.

270
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,240
You understand your own needs and desires,

271
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,500
and that's about it.

272
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,320
As long as you don't give a crap about anybody else, really,

273
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,880
you make a great politician

274
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,680
because you just do precisely what your advisors

275
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,320
tell you to do.

276
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,390
Who appoints all these people?

277
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,610
Who decides the appointment?

278
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,950
It's not like the president himself

279
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,770
knows intricately each and every single one of these guys

280
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,950
in his background cabinet and what they're all about.

281
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,130
Maybe they've been working together

282
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,350
for a number of years or so,

283
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,830
but hey, what are their other connections?

284
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,370
Do you ever wonder about the other people

285
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,550
in the background?

286
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:22,890
Is that something that has ever glossed your mind?

287
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,430
What are they showing you on the TV?

288
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,190
What are they showing you on the news?

289
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,810
Does this make sense?

290
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:35,710
Why did he change his whole direction right then?

291
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,750
Right then we start talking about

292
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,790
international finance and the Federal Reserve.

293
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:46,250
Okay, I find that as a patriot filmmaker

294
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,790
or whatever you want to call yourself,

295
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:53,550
I think the labels are unnecessary entirely,

296
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,430
but everybody just loves them, don't they?

297
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,530
You know, I'm a business account manager.

298
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,750
As long as you've got several names

299
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,630
about what you are as your status or whatever,

300
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,470
that's very nice, isn't it?

301
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,089
So why don't you just call yourself

302
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:14,970
an admiral filmmaker or a presidential filmmaker?

303
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,790
This is something that you can

304
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,430
just have some fun with, I reckon.

305
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,970
Anyway, point is, if you want to go out

306
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,650
and if you want to have these politicians

307
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,589
ask questions that you want to see asked,

308
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,550
you have to do it.

309
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,530
It's unfortunate, but that's the reality.

310
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,390
If you see it and you want to see it done,

311
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,450
you can think you can do it better,

312
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,770
then by all means, go and do it,

313
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,710
and you'll feel really good about it too,

314
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,190
especially if you capture it on camera.

315
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,790
You listen to the Vinnie Eastwood Show,

316
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,270
we'll be right back.

317
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,570
402-237-2525.

318
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:52,550
Please call in.

319
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,390
Back in a moment.

320
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,750
Now you and your family and friends

321
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,830
can enjoy the cleanest, most delicious

322
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,910
and healthy drinking water anytime,

323
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,110
even while traveling, camping,

324
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,950
at sporting events or in emergency situations.

325
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,870
The Berkey Light removes bacteria, cysts,

326
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,770
parasites and harmful chemicals

327
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,190
to below detectable levels.

328
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,290
It also reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals

329
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,410
like lead and mercury,

330
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,310
while leaving in the beneficial

331
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,830
and nutritional minerals your body needs.

332
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,630
Berkey Light is so powerful,

333
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,730
it can even purify raw, untreated water

334
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,310
from remote lakes and streams.

335
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,670
And the optional PF2 filters even remove fluoride.

336
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,010
The Berkey Light LED,

337
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,090
with its rechargeable lighting system,

338
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,530
can be used as a night light or camp light.

339
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,890
To view or purchase your Berkey water system

340
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,210
and replacement filters,

341
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,050
please visit American Freedom Radio's website

342
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,310
at AmericanFreedomRadio.com

343
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,570
and click the Berkey banner.

344
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,810
Once again, that's AmericanFreedomRadio.com

345
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,290
and click the Berkey water banner.

346
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,410
Not yet available in Iowa.

347
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,490
Do you realize every day

348
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:03,750
we are being put under constant stress

349
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,070
from wireless radiation?

350
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,610
What's worse is that you don't even know

351
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,290
that it's happening.

352
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,550
It puts as much stress on our body

353
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,170
as if we had a constant viral infection,

354
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,610
draining our energy and samping our strength

355
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,190
or just making us irritable and fatigued.

356
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,010
These wireless fields are being emitted

357
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,270
from computers, microwaves, mobile phones,

358
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,310
power lines and any electrical appliance.

359
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,870
Now there is a solution.

360
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,390
A group of research engineers in New Zealand

361
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,950
have come up with an active shielding device

362
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,410
that shields you from wireless radiation

363
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,670
at a cellular level.

364
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,390
Blue Shield comes in three models,

365
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,870
a household, portable and USB

366
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,590
that plugs into any computer.

367
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,090
The great thing about Blue Shield

368
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,230
is it is very affordable and guaranteed to last.

369
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,930
A one-off purchase will see you being protected

370
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,290
for years to come.

375
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,430
Following a radiological or nuclear event,

376
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:08,610
radioactive iodine may be released into the air

377
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,890
and then be breathed into the lungs.

378
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,510
Radioactive iodine may also contaminate

379
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,810
the local food supply and get into the body

380
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,410
through food or through drink.

381
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,650
When radioactive materials get into the body

382
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,310
through breathing, eating or drinking,

383
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,010
the thyroid gland quickly absorbs the chemical.

384
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:26,630
Radioactive iodine absorbed by the thyroid

385
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:28,310
can then injure the gland.

386
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,770
But you can protect yourself with used potassium iodide

387
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,070
which acts to block radioactive iodine

388
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,250
from being taken into the thyroid gland

389
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,830
and can help protect this gland from injury.

00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:11,390
Welcome back, oh yeah, I like that song, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, oh yeah, welcome back to the Vanilla

433
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:18,170
Eastwood show, taking it easy when you're a day ahead of the United States and it's

434
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:24,450
Friday, that would mean it's Saturday for me, yes, you guessed it, broadcasting live

435
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:29,230
from the future from the fabulously fluoridated capital of Auckland, New Zealand, the island

436
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:38,190
chained nation sitting pretty in the sunny slave South Pacific, and we often have lots

437
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:46,810
of international guests on the show, and I don't know, I like the idea of listening

438
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:51,050
to people who have different accents from all over the world and stuff like that, I

439
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:56,430
love accents, they're just fabulous to listen to, and I think that's true of everybody,

440
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:01,330
you know, somebody comes in with a nice accent of some description, it's like, oh wow, I

441
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:07,670
can listen to that, it's about right, isn't it, so you bring on people from the Uber kingdom,

442
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:17,450
from Ireland, Scotland, even some Dutch and some German people, you know, this is what's

443
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:22,470
very interesting about bringing on so many international guests, is that it's the same

444
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:31,930
story over and over again, it just sounds different, because the same crap that's going

445
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:41,270
down every day in your home country is going down to lesser or greater degrees, but it's

446
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:52,230
still going on, and you can see the very obvious similarities everywhere else too, that's why

447
00:24:52,230 --> 00:25:00,310
they call it a new world order, because there ain't no place you can escape to, unless of

448
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:07,270
course you can manage to manifest some description of rocket ship, and get the F out of this

449
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:16,250
galaxy, which I don't think is a possibility, ergo, you've got to take back what should

450
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:25,270
be rightfully yours, okay, the system has gotten so bad that, well, it's basically,

451
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:31,310
you play in card games against somebody who can cheat, and if you call them a cheater,

452
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:42,300
he shoots you at the card table, that's how politics, isn't it, president can lie, in

453
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:48,600
fact, can they tell the truth, that's a better question, they can knowingly misrepresent

454
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,500
their policies, people still vote for them, and it just doesn't make any sense, I'm going

455
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,000
to see if the Greek can actually help me out with that, the Greek, welcome to the show mate,

456
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:04,040
hey Vinny, long time no speak, good to hear you're still on and doing well, oh yeah,

457
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:10,080
I want to tell you something man, there have been like a flood of donations that came through

458
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:17,220
after I announced last week I was getting kicked out of my house, nearly $1400 has been

459
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:22,600
donated in about a week and a bit, because I'm being kicked out, the target's like $2000,

460
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:30,260
but we're not too far off now, got about another 6-7 days in it, but I've got to confess something

461
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:38,160
man, I actually cried, it was so overwhelming, the huge amount of support that I was getting,

462
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:47,560
it just threw me for a lope. Well excellent man, that's great, and if I were to send you

463
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:59,220
anything it would be anonymous so you'd know, I just want to chime in and just say hello

464
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:04,940
and I'll tell you just personally some thoughts, it seems like this planet doesn't even feel like

465
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,300
we're on a planet, it feels like we're on an island, it feels like wherever you look all

466
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:13,240
over the world, whatever is being said, especially in the mainstream media, it seems like they're

467
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,640
all saying the same thing, it seems like the whole planet's been reduced to a little village

468
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:24,860
and it's bizarre to me, what happened to the diversity? Yeah, it's, I don't know,

469
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,640
the diversity is you get welcomed off a plane by a little person and he goes,

470
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,760
welcome to fantasy island, that's what we're living on now,

471
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:40,420
total fantasy island with a little midget guide. Right, yeah, because I kind of was curious about

472
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:45,780
New Zealand and we're watching it and just change New Zealand to US or EU or anywhere else,

473
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:52,020
it's the same stuff. Well this is great because our cultures are now interchangeable,

474
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:58,080
New Zealander can go straight to America and easily integrate the language and all of that,

475
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,060
vice versa, Americans can come to New Zealand, start hanging out with New Zealanders. Because

476
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:06,320
there's no language barrier and our cultures have been assimilated into more or less the

477
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:15,740
same homogenous stew of moronity, if that's even a word. McDonald's, Levi's, Walmart,

478
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:22,020
you mean like that? Yeah, with the statin drugs and the burgers and all. Yeah,

479
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:28,520
yeah, it's interesting, isn't it? In fact, they were proposing that in London, I think,

480
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,560
that they were going to give out statin drugs with the McDonald's, you know,

481
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,600
in a little thing like a salt shaker, there's a couple of pills in there. Really? Yeah. Yeah,

482
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,800
well, if you could count me out. Well, that's not the worst stuff I've heard,

483
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,260
the worst is the Belgian government, which is where the head of the EU is, of course,

484
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,720
they want to, instead of burying people, because it's bad for the environment,

485
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:59,540
dissolve them down and flush them into the sewer system. I don't think they'll be flushing them,

486
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:04,940
I think they might end up as protein supplements at McDonald's again. Yep,

487
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,640
soylent greeners, people. Yeah, you know, like, I've been reading some comments,

488
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,400
you know, on George Orwell, and he was seemingly part of the inside group,

489
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:23,460
and his writings of 1984 were actually, let's say, directed to be a disclosure, right? Yeah,

490
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:29,800
pretty much. It's like, this is, people, look, this is how you're gonna live unless you do

491
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:37,080
something, and naturally, people, thinking it's fiction, don't do anything, and it winds up.

492
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:42,480
The soylent green may not be that far off, huh? No, soylent green's already here,

493
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:50,640
there is, the Chinese are now breaking down and drying up and turning into a powder,

494
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,460
fetuses, and putting them into health supplements, so they just give you, like,

495
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:00,940
a capsule of ground-up dead baby fetus, and they've been, they're selling all over the world,

496
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:05,320
so there's a lot of women out there who are taking collagen capsules, and they don't realize

497
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:11,720
that they're eating dead Chinese babies. Same with McDonald's and what have you. Allegedly,

498
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:16,700
and this was, there was this video online, I can't 100% verify it, it shocked me,

499
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:23,860
but it wouldn't surprise me, of this Uber synagogue of Satan guy, some description of

500
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:32,300
Jewish satanic cult, that's very highly connected, allegedly, and they kidnap and sacrifice children,

501
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:41,460
and because they own all the meat grinding works and things like that for the big agribusiness

502
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:47,340
and what have you, they just toss the remains in with the cows, and now everybody, when they're

503
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:52,640
having their hamburger or their sausage at McDonald's, their own children's what they get.

504
00:30:52,640 --> 00:31:02,640
So, Soylent Green's already here, in the very least, in a minor capacity, there's also some use of fetal

505
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,520
cells and things of that nature that go into flavorings for soft drinks, allegedly.

506
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:20,800
Well, I think it's part of this kind of sick plot to corrupt human DNA, there's even now baby fetus,

507
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:29,700
they use their kidneys or their livers, if they're aborted, to grow viruses on for the vaccines,

508
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,360
and so they take little chunks of that, so you're getting minuscule amounts of human DNA

509
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,400
injected directly into your bloodstream, so I'm not sure exactly what that causes,

510
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:47,140
but it certainly can't be good, let alone the formaldehyde and the thimerosal, which is 50%

511
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,160
mercury, that you also got dead baby fetal cells in there as well.

512
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:56,140
You know, I think it might be also part of their occult black magic practice, you know,

513
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:02,580
that's why the sheepskin diploma, right, has to be from an animal, right, where the blood is shed,

514
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,300
it's all ritual, that's why you have the spelling must be correct, the spell, get it?

515
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:13,960
So, yeah, so I think these things are actually part of an occult ritual, like

516
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,740
the cliché of the voodoo, you know, the chicken's blood, you know,

517
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,580
the voodoo stuff that everyone's kind of sort of familiar with, they're not really familiar with

518
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:29,980
how out of hand it's gone, you know, I mean, I wasn't really quite familiar with half of the

519
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,940
things you mentioned there, so. Well, you know, I think the person who

520
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:38,260
thinks that they know everything obviously knows nothing, and the person who believes that they

521
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:43,300
probably know nothing probably knows enough. Well, you know, I like to say I don't know

522
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:50,260
anything, but I can share with you what I found out. Yeah, and that's why I love the word allegedly.

523
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:59,880
You can tag it onto anything, it's brilliant, because you don't have to know exactly down to

524
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:07,080
a minutiae detail, like if you ask any physicist or anything, had they measured the sun's rotation

525
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:14,980
around the earth with a calculated tool and measuring device or what have you with opposite

526
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:20,240
double blind test to see whether or not the sun actually goes around the earth or the earth goes

527
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,740
around the sun, had they actually done that experiment to find out by themselves, none of them

528
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:30,300
would have, okay, it's just science just tells you this, okay, and you believe it because it seems

529
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,780
reasonable at the time, allegedly some other people used devices to figure this stuff out,

530
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:39,400
okay, it's knowledge, somebody comes out to you with new evidence on the other hand,

531
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:45,860
you can't stick to your original thing if your evidence has suddenly become defunct, oh,

532
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:51,380
they've actually never told us about that, tell me more, that should be the response,

533
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,940
as opposed to you're a kook, you're crazy, get the hell out of my office.

534
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:02,560
Yeah, well, all these measurements also are based on our perceptions and our senses, and our senses

535
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:08,820
can be subjective or deceived or, you know, inaccurate at the moment, so why say, you know,

536
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:15,320
when you're just really using your senses, right? Yeah, and you know, everybody says, you know,

537
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:20,940
you know? Well, hey, you know, like you mentioned earlier, you know, about previous shows,

538
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,420
I went back to the, I think it was Gorilla Media, forgive me if it's incorrect, but you have two

539
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:30,179
sites, and at one point we brought up the discussion of the earth not going around the sun, and you

540
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:37,360
promptly prompted, you posted a video, I believe it's a doctor something or other out of India,

541
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,159
was showing that we're just actually being trailing, we're trailing behind the sun,

542
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:45,840
because everything's moving. What did you think of that, and what prompted you to post that?

543
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,480
Well, I just thought it was interesting stuff, and if it's interesting to me, it'll probably

544
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,100
be interesting to other people. Well, okay, great, you know, I was just wondering if we

545
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:01,560
have a convert or not, that you need to be converted, but you know, the current models

546
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:06,220
they're showing us are absolutely false, the planetary models, and it gives you a little

547
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,040
bit more understanding of the things around you, too, you know, when you kind of, you know,

548
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,440
all the small stuff, all the big stuff is made up of small stuff, and everything is behaving the

549
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:21,900
same way, you know? Yeah, it's like the levels of micro-bioactivity or something like that.

550
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:28,860
There's this guy, I believe it was like 1910, 1914 or something, he created this microscope

551
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:35,420
using granite crystal, and he was able to get something like 50 to 60,000 times,

552
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:42,660
up to 180,000 times, allegedly, magnification. Oh, right, well, I mean, it might have been

553
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:48,660
life, right? Yeah, right, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right, and I think standard scopes today

554
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:55,720
don't even approach that, yeah. 10,000, 10,000 times, and what he discovered is when he looked

555
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:01,620
inside a cell, he found out that that cell was made up of other cells, and then he looked inside

556
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:07,140
those other cells, and you find that those cells were made up of other cells, and he kept going,

557
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:14,100
you know, he was just keeping going down the magnification, and he said, basically, life is

558
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:21,040
life upon life upon life without end into infinity, both upwards and downwards, okay?

559
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:28,320
There are infinitesimally small to the infinite species of life, you know, levels of it,

560
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,520
and why wouldn't that be upwards as well? Because I kind of thought of, like,

561
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,820
everybody talks about God, right, and I thought that God was like this

562
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:47,920
macro-organism, like a cell is a micro-organism. A macro-organism is much, much larger, much bigger

563
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:54,560
that's comprised of all the current, say, life on the earth. That's what God is, and we're all

564
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,920
connected to each other because we're actually just this one giant organism with all this diversity

565
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,260
of life amongst it, just like when you look into the cells and find other ones.

566
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,820
I always thought that was the answer.

567
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:15,120
Yeah, you can actually do that experiment very simply by standing between two mirrors. You see

568
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:22,280
how it goes to infinity? That's my point with the solar system, you know, there's nothing orbiting

569
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:27,740
anything that I've noticed. You're either behind it, in front of it, or beside it, and everything

570
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:32,860
is dynamic and moving. So that energy level that you just spoke of, it's like a fractal. I think

571
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:37,860
the Mandelbrot fractals, you know, if you take a head of broccoli and you pull off a floret,

572
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,460
it looks like a head of broccoli, and if you take a tweezer and take off one of those little

573
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,260
tiny little buds, look at it under a magnifying glass, it looks like the whole head of broccoli,

574
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:50,560
and so on, and so on, and so forth. And then when you get down to the cellular level,

575
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,300
it no longer looks like a head of broccoli, but like you mentioned, those cells again repeat.

576
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,280
So where does it end?

577
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:03,800
It doesn't. Ultimately it doesn't. We're at one level of consciousness out of the

578
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:11,000
infinite amount of levels of consciousness as far as I'm concerned. We could wind up a bacteria

579
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,940
someday, or we could wind up a planet someday of a level of consciousness, and then you'd just

580
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,140
be one of the planets amongst all the others. Who knows?

581
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,060
Well, let me just propose this thought. Could we possibly just be a thought

582
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:32,380
emanation from the Creator? Because all evidence shows that everything is energy.

583
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,080
Well, I would never rule anything out, because that would mean I know more than God.

584
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:44,000
You listen to the Vinny Eastwood show. My guest caller is the Greek, and if he's willing,

585
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,340
we can probably stand on to the other side of this and continue this conversation.

586
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:58,900
You can join the conversation to 402-237-2525. That's 402-237-2525. We'll be right back.

587
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:03,440
What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality,

588
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,360
feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns,

589
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:12,020
blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall? There's something that is changing

590
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:16,100
thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them. It's called Heart and Body

591
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:19,600
Extract. Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract,

592
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,460

unclog the arteries. It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics. So the body is an

597
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,720
amazing thing. It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.

The First Amendment and the Bill of Rights limits the government's power by ensuring

602
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,760
our rights gradually slip away. It's time to take a stand and let the government know

603

The percolite removes bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.

621
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,760

while leaving in the beneficial and nutritional minerals your body needs.

623
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:32,680
Percolite is so powerful it can even purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and streams,

624
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:39,000
and the optional PF2 filters even remove fluoride. The percolite LED with its rechargeable lighting

625
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,820
system can be used as a nightlight or a camp light. To view or purchase your percolite water

634
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:35,680
So

635
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,380
there must be some kind of way out of here

636
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:48,960
I said

637
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,730
I said a joker to the thief

638
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,420
There's too much confusion

639
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:59,720
I can't get no relief

640
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:04,660
Business man there will drink my wine

641
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,570
Clown man dig my earth

642
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,220
None will level on the mind

643
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:16,660
Nobody up in his place

644
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:32,360
Oh yeah, welcome back to the Vinnie Eastwood Show. Talking about scumbaggery

645
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:43,500
of varying degrees with my very special guest, the Greek. Now, you talk about existence and

646
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:51,500
you say you're here just to take notes. Does that mean that you're a student? And if so,

647
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:57,520
who's the teacher? Well, the student, I usually say, teaches the teacher.

648
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:07,180
It's called a feedback loop, isn't it? Apparently, yeah. The reason I say I'm taking notes as an

649
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:12,640
observer is I'm trying to be impeccable about being objective about things, you see.

650
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:22,600
How could you be impeccably objective? Well, discernment, asking questions and knowing the

651
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:33,780
history of things. Okay, okay. That's just one way. You know, it's kind of like going to the gym,

652
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:40,040
Vinnie. You know, it's like a muscle. And the more you use it, the stronger it gets. I don't know if

653
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:45,180
that's another way of describing it. And if you stop using it, it starts to get all floppy and

654
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:50,640
flabby and all over the place and causes you nothing but trouble. Yeah, it could, right?

655
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:58,700
Straight up. Well, you're talking about a fitness of the mind. Perhaps, yeah.

656
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:04,320
You know, there's an interesting concept there because a lot of people worry about their weight.

657
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,260
But how many people worry about how freaking stupid they are?

658
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,220
Well, I'm glad you said that and I didn't have to.

659
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,880
Well, that's something I like to do for people, just to say what they can't.

660
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,820
Because I always say, when in doubt, blame Vinnie.

661
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:30,500
So could it be that it's just laziness? You know, slothfulness, you think? Do you think it's

662
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:35,880
encouraged? I think it's encouraged. Oh, I'm not sure if it's encouraged per se, but it's

663
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:41,520
certainly facilitated. Look at the amount of offers you have every day of getting yourself fat.

664
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:47,660
Look at how many offers you have every day of keeping yourself fit. Not a lot in the fit

665
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:53,100
department, is there? You know, you go to a supermarket and you go through the impulse item

666
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,060
section. How many of those items are promoting healthy life and healthy living,

667
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:01,120
free of chemicals and poisons and sugars and sweets?

668
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:07,320
Yeah, you know, I've been looking very much at what they call the American obesity problem.

669
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:12,100
And then I looked at the actual intake, the quality of the intake of their food.

670
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,780
And they're obese, not only because they're eating too much, but

671
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:22,440
the mechanism that the food is so devoid of nutrition, they're actually malnourished.

672
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,520
That's why they're obese. For example, have you ever seen photographs of the,

673
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:32,160
I'm sure you have, of places in Africa and famine, and you see the children on the dirt

674
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:38,380
floor with their distended stomachs, right? There's a similar case where there's a balance

675
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:45,720
of toxicity and malnourishment that has led to the obesity. And you couple that with the paradox

676
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:50,940
how the more chemicals and the more devoid of nutrition the food is in the supermarket,

677
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,060
the cheaper it is. So you have more incentive of buying the cheaper,

678
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:01,620
more toxic, devoid of nutrition food. There's so many layers of incentive.

679
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:06,260
Like the first incentive that you see is the primary colors. You know, you'll see the

680
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:10,820
advertisements are always in a red, yellow or blue. These are the primary colors. These are

681
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:17,340
the things that get your attention. And, you know, have a look at all the major fast food chains.

682
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:22,800
Have they got red? What about KFC? What about Pizza Hut? What about McDonald's? What about

683
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:30,620
Burger King? There's a myriad of them. Have they got blue? You know, again, you've got Burger King,

684
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:38,920
you've got Pepsi. The list goes on. So maybe objectively, if people had an objective

685
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,600
approach to the food, they wouldn't recognize it as something, let's say, edible. So they

686
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:48,140
have to stimulate them, you think, with conviction of color and advertising?

687
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:55,040
When people diet, they have a couple of real strange reactions. Firstly,

688
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:01,820
they start to get a lot healthier. They have regular bowel movements. Their skin clears up

689
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:07,900
and they're able to breathe or walk again. And life just seems to be a lot more comfortable.

690
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:13,220
And then you take them back and you go give them some of this crap food and their body rejects it

691
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:18,180
and it makes them start feeling sick. Your body will adapt to whatever conditions or whatever

692
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:23,280
stuff that you're giving it and respond accordingly. If you want to live a life that's incredibly

693
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:31,180
depressing, hard to live through, tiring and exhausting, then you have a diet of absolute

694
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:37,780
crapola for you, which will also put you in grumpy moods and later on give you really bad,

695
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:42,080
debilitating diseases. You know, talk about quality of life and the type of drugs and

696
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:46,400
everything like that that they'll give with you. And don't tell you to cut out the crap diet. No,

697
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:50,780
don't do that because that'll just get rid of all your symptoms so we can't treat you for them

698
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:57,040
with expensive drugs. All right. You know, there's the good old one to see going on

699
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:02,080
with everything. And there's a good movie called Training Day with Denzel Washington.

700
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:09,360
I don't know if you've seen this movie, Greg, but he says this stuff is chest, not checkers.

701
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:16,600
And it's a very, very apt description of how drug companies, fast food companies and

702
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:21,120
all these other various, but which are all owned by a very small clique of people in the world

703
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:29,000
anyway, conspire on every single subset of level of your life experience, whether you're watching TV,

704
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:33,360
driving down the road, you're going to see their products, you're going to have them advertised

705
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:36,220
for them, you're going to be awash in them, they're going to tell you that they're cheap,

706
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:40,060
they're going to tell you that they're tasty, and they'll repeat it to you over and over and

707
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:45,440
over again. So it's virtually inevitable that you will have something. And only very few people I've

708
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:52,260
ever met either haven't tried it or have done it and just basically never will and stay healthy.

709
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,380
Interesting. That's an interesting analogy with chest because maybe there's a message in that,

710
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:04,040
right? You know, look at the player, the pieces in the chessboard versus the checkers, right?

711
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:09,840
The queen gets to go anywhere she wants, but taking the king, right, you see? So very interesting.

712
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,480
Yeah, well, queen can go anywhere she wants, except the city of London.

713
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,360
That's right. I think she has to walk behind the mayor, right?

714
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Lord Mayor. The Lord Mayor, of course.

715
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:29,440
Does DC have a Lord Mayor as well? Because I know Auckland now has one. We had like a

716
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:36,160
city of about 1.4 million people or something, and it was actually governed by seven different

717
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,120
city councils just for their particular areas, and they force amalgamated them all into one

718
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:47,040
against everybody's wishes, stole $28 billion worth of public assets. And now we have a Lord Mayor

719
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:54,180
who gets to handpick his unelected cabinet, and every single policy that they've been shunting out

720
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:59,040
ever since they got put into power had Agenda 21 written all over it.

721
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:06,080
Of course. Well, it goes back to the old thing. Why does the sun never set on the British Empire?

722
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:11,110
Because they've got land all around the world.

723
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:14,510
Well, because God doesn't trust the British in the dark, right?

724
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:21,030
Well, yeah. There was a great joke by a New Zealand comedian, Billy T. James,

725
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:27,550
a Maori comedian, and he's like, bro, us Maoris are going to go to the sun. What do you mean

726
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:30,810
you're talking about the sun? You'll get burned up. And he's like, no, no, bro, we're going to go

727
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:36,570
at night. That's right. Actually, there's a little bit of truth to that because the front of it is

728
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:46,610
black. Yeah, yeah. Allegedly. Yeah, allegedly. I haven't been there myself yet. Yeah, I was

729
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:55,350
thinking about taking my summer vacation on the sun, you know. I could get tanned in like

730
00:52:55,350 --> 00:53:00,950
two microseconds. Well, here's the thing, you know, the sun's heat doesn't really materialize

731
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:06,390
until about 150 miles up. And, you know, NASA tried to take a little vacation near the sun

732
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:12,130
with their two SOHO stereo probes, and they admit on their website that they could never get any

733
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:19,910
position other than 180 degrees from the sun. But, you know, you know who's another interesting

734
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:26,490
character? Just a total segway to read up on his political notions was Winston Churchill. You know,

735
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:33,790
of course, he was part of the main crew there, you know, but he's, yeah, oh yeah, they all are.

736
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:41,450
They all are on some level, aren't they? I mean, well, there's no reason to even name call or point

737
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:50,460
out any names on who's a Freemason, because, you know, they all are. You don't even need to

738
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:57,740
blanketly point out to it anymore. Yeah, yeah, you see, well, years ago, the mastership was

739
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:02,400
retained in these types of societies. What I mean about mastership, when you wanted to become

740
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:08,520
a certain skilled tradesman or even a professional of intellectual right, like a doctor or a lawyer,

741
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:14,500
not an attorney, but a lawyer or a researcher, you learned from a master, not university. You

742
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:21,140
went to these mastership schools, and now they've all been just converted to the scumbaggery that we

743
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:26,380
all, you of course, talk about and we all sort of hear about, but don't do anything about it.

744
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:30,680
You know, about, you know, money. It's all about money. There's no more true mastership.

745
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:36,440
So, personally, I wouldn't hesitate to go into one of these groups if they actually did what

746
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:42,680
they were supposed to, but when you do some research, they're actually worshipping Satan

747
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:51,200
as the lord of the planet, and this, that, and the other, so. Yeah, and there's a whole lot of real

748
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:57,980
secretive stuff that goes on, and, you know, if you're doing something good, whatever, you don't

749
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:04,680
do it in the darkness, shut away in total secrecy. You do it out in the light, in public, so that

750
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:09,380
people can see you do it, or at least that's what I reckon, I mean, because that's what I do.

751
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:14,960
I'm trying to do something good, and I've exposed myself warts and all. I don't care,

752
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:21,140
you know. This is the way it's got to be. If you're not willing to go out on a limb,

753
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:28,740
how do you ever expect to accomplish anything? Nobody accomplishes things without taking any

754
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:35,800
risk, without devoting any time. That's how you do it. We'll be right back after the break.

755
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,620
Greg, you can hold on if you want. 402-237-2525.

Most Americans know the significance of July 4th, 1776. However, few know the importance of

766
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:57,160
September 17th, 1787, the day the Constitution was written and adopted by our Founders.

767
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:03,560

787
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:53,840
have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels,

788
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:58,580
and had a sense of well-being overall? There's something that is changing thousands of people's

789

lives, and you could be one of them. It's called Heart and Body Extract. Sharon Harris, co-creator

790
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:08,000
of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.

791
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:12,500
What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary

792
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:17,900
vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.

793
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:22,440
And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol,

794
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:28,180
clean and unclog the arteries. It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics. So

795
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:33,120
the body is an amazing thing. It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.

Trying to take not being serious very seriously indeed. It's the most ironic kind of stuff. Hey,

801
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:43,460
if you want to call in, 402-237-2525. I want to know what people are getting up to

802
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:50,200
on their Friday nights or on their Saturdays or whatever because when you have a five-day-a-week

803
01:01:50,200 --> 01:02:00,840
job and it's utter slavery and it sucks various expletives that you can't say on FCC-regulated

804
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:09,460
radio, what do you do with your time off? Do you kick back and listen to some radio archives

805
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:19,680
or watch a few documentaries? Do you go out partying and think, oh mate, spending an entire

806
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:31,700
week taking crap from scumbags is really not good for my G. I need to head out. I need to balance

807
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:36,980
that, she-eyed Muslim. That's what a lot of people are really up to, isn't it?

808
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:47,880
Trying to make sure that right now I am okay. And it's almost a struggle to make sure that

809
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:55,940
happens. Why is it such hard work to just be okay? Well, for a lot of people, maybe it's not.

810
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:02,120
They got it down. And maybe I'm just talking about other people who just,

811
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:08,980
I don't know, don't quite get it. They don't quite get that because they don't sit around

812
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:16,360
and learn things, like instead of watching a couple of soap operas in a row,

813
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:20,260
you could watch a documentary that will radically inform you

814
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:27,900
about something you previously knew nothing about. Which time is more valuable?

815
01:03:29,140 --> 01:03:32,880
Something that enlightens you or something that only vaguely entertains you?

816
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:38,360
Something that only slowly draws you in, only to watch you in another episode,

817
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:43,340
always leaving on a cliffhanger at the end of every single one, every single ad break.

818
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:48,120
It's as if you've become Sylvester Stallone, you've done so much cliffhanging.

819
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:55,500
It's inextricable. The degree of manipulation that people have to be subjected to through

820
01:03:55,500 --> 01:04:00,740
television has got a lot of people up in arms. Seriously, there was something like

821
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:06,320
ridiculous amounts, something like 40, 50, I don't know, however many million people

822
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:14,680
cancelled their cable in the US a year or two back. That was pretty ruthless, man. The

823
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:23,000
cable companies had no idea. All of a sudden, everybody's, nah, I'm sick of having 500 channels

824
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:31,680
of stuff that's going to brainwash me with vain entertainment and prevent me from spending any

825
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:36,740
time with my family or getting anything done around the house. I'm living in freaking squalor

826
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:42,760
watching the television. I could have vacuumed yesterday, but instead I watched two hours of

827
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:53,210
Roots. How can people put up with this kind of nonsense? There's some healthy families out there.

828
01:04:56,170 --> 01:05:03,430
Really? People have such a problem actually having a healthy family unit. In fact,

829
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:08,870
there was a statistic that was released not too long ago, maybe like five, 10 years ago,

830
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:16,450
saying that the bulk, the majority of American families are now dysfunctional.

831
01:05:17,910 --> 01:05:23,030
And I think television really represents that. Maybe one incredibly well-functioning family

832
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:27,970
has been featured on TV endlessly all over the place. Simpsons, dysfunctional family. Family

833
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:34,430
Guide, dysfunctional family. Titus from Christopher Titus, dysfunctional family. Everything.

834
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:41,990
Everything's about a family that can't function properly. So what kind of examples do people have

835
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:47,350
to go to? You go watch like Super Nanny or something of that description, how they teach

836
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:57,910
people how to raise better kids and whatnot. You see how bad things have gotten in America.

837
01:05:59,370 --> 01:06:05,570
The same thing, of course, as is happening right here at home in New Zealand and

838
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:16,550
everywhere else. The whole mass of certain incentives that have been given to people

839
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:25,050
to instead of being diligent with their families and their homes and their own state of being

840
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:33,070
and accomplishing some form of growth personally, financially, they instead

841
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:40,310
choose to say, I'm too tired. I'm going to watch four hours of television.

842
01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:44,110
Imagine what you could do with that four hours that you get back.

843
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:51,640
I could accomplish quite a bit. I could make a video. I could compose a song.

844
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:59,640
I could do two episodes of the Vinnie Eastwood Show back to back. I could write an article.

845
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:10,780
I could collaborate with an activist. I could go out to a protest and film some stuff and ambush

846
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:19,760
some various scumbags. There are all these things that you can do with the time that you would have

847
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:28,480
often instead spent watching television. And I've noticed this to a greater degree of late because

848
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,760
I'm watching a lot less television and noticing that I'm getting a lot more done.

849
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:43,340
And it's not even that hard. It's very simple. Yep. I'm now catching just the morning news

850
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:49,560
pretty much. That's about it for me at this point. All the rest is done online.

851
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:58,720
And just to monitor the enemy communique. It's not entirely dissimilar from the start of that

852
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:03,360
movie Shooter with Mark Wahlberg, incidentally directed by the same guy who directed Training

853
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:08,620
Day, going down to his computer in the morning and say, okay, let's see what lies they're telling

854
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:15,979
the world today. Words to that effect. That is a healthy way to look at news. I believe Mark,

855
01:08:15,979 --> 01:08:24,680
oh no, it was Thomas Jefferson who said, a man who reads nothing is more informed than a man

856
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:31,140
who only reads newspapers. I hold that to be a very self-evident truth. You have conversations

857
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:37,800
with some of these people and they're just insane. I'm not being mean about it or anything.

858
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:42,660
They're just insane. Endlessly repeating something that they've heard or seen in a newspaper,

859
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:48,300
in some cases, word for word. It's been repeated to them that much. They have actually got it

860
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:54,520
memorized and they don't know anything about it. Whatever the case that they might be arguing

861
01:08:54,520 --> 01:09:00,740
about, whether it be privatization or whatever, they have no idea. All they can do is repeat

862
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:11,859
the exact same thing over and over and over and over and over and over again. It's beyond a joke.

863
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:20,500
These are the kind of people that vote in massively damaging governments

864
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:33,740
because they have no quality of analysis, no common sense, no questioning capability to speak of,

865
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:41,740
and absolutely no concern for their fellow man. They only have concern for themselves.

866
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:49,240
They've devoted themselves to something that's a lie for so long that has become part of their

867
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:53,160
own identity, the man who tells a lie so often enough that he actually begins to believe it

868
01:09:53,160 --> 01:10:01,900
himself, like Donnie Brasco. That's what these people are, Republican Donnie Brascos.

869
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:10,240
Absolute BS all the time. You see it spouted all over the media. You wonder how to counter it.

870
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:17,760
You don't have the huge mechanisms that mainstream media, news, studios do,

871
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:22,620
endless computers with hardline internet and all your stuff paid for, your fuel, your car,

872
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:29,140
your nice suits, your beautiful microphones and gargantuan cameras, your elderly cameramen who

873
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:36,740
won't say too much and you can order them around. They got it made. When you have to do it yourself,

874
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:43,400
that's when it gets really fun because you realize, oh my goodness, just with a home

875
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:50,740
computer and a camera, I can make news that is of better quality, better quality of information,

876
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:54,240
maybe not quite as much production, but you don't really need that.

877
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:02,020
It is form over substance for a lot of people and I take the substance over the form.

878
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,900
You don't judge people by what they look like, you judge them by what they say,

879
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:12,900
by what they do. But of course, some people say judge not lest ye be judged. I don't know.

880
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:22,680
I think everybody can be judged on their merits and their faults. Doesn't that sound reasonable?

881
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:29,800
I think it does. After all, being naive and trusting absolutely every politician with a

882
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:39,020
bad scope backdoor agenda is incredibly foolish and will lead you into very dark territory indeedy.

883
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:47,270
You have a criminal class running the political system, the media game.

884
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:55,530
They love doing so and they ain't going to let it go without a fight. And then of course,

885
01:11:55,570 --> 01:11:59,610
you've got the people who oppose them, the people who do research. It was a very small

886
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:07,950
amount of people, extremely powerful. One of the most powerful groups in the world,

887
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:16,050
I'd probably say, would now be the conspiracy theorist growing inside everybody, like in the

888
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:23,350
movie Alien. It'll suddenly burst out of your chest at some point. And just suddenly everybody

889
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:29,310
will go, oh, oh, it's a truther. It's coming. We should have quarantined them and jettisoned them

890
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:36,930
into the dark void long ago. And that's what'll happen once you start telling the truth to people.

891
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:42,450
And if you're up front about it, you will offend both sides of every argument. That includes

892
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:49,430
family, friends. Your life will change dramatically. Not always for the better,

893
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:57,690
mind you. Knowing the truth is an incredible burden and you really get tested as a person.

894
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:03,630
Your perseverance, your strength, your abilities, everything that you are as a human being gets

895
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:10,910
tested when you go through discovering that 9-11 was an inside job, that the politicians are all

896
01:13:10,910 --> 01:13:18,230
controlled, that the corporations, the politicians, and the varying other degrees of machinations of

897
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:25,990
scumbaggery in the military industrial complex sense have conspired and are conspiring to exterminate

898
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:35,610
you and all forms of freedom forever. And they have enough resources to do it.

899
01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:47,850
That is a very scary, very burdensome thought. And you do lose your way sometimes when you get

900
01:13:47,850 --> 01:13:54,810
that information into your head. That's why so many people react so violently to it. That's why

901
01:13:54,810 --> 01:14:00,910
you get criticized and called a conspiracy theorist and various other, every name under the

902
01:14:00,910 --> 01:14:10,170
sun, don't you? You're crazy. You've been smoking too much weed. You've been injecting MDMA caps

903
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:19,090
into your eyeballs. Whatever. I've heard them all. All they've got is name calling.

904
01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:26,430
All I got is the truth. Which do you think is more powerful? Which do you think has staying

905
01:14:26,430 --> 01:14:31,610
power? And which do you think is actually going to win out in the end? It's pretty obvious.

906
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:38,850
The truth always comes out sooner or later. And the modern media sense of the word is usually

907
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:47,630
much later, but that's the power of it. You can quash it if you want to, if you really want to,

908
01:14:47,630 --> 01:14:53,410
but not if everybody's saying it. That's the problem they've got going on their hands right now.

909
01:14:54,570 --> 01:15:02,250
Too many people are talking about the truth now. More people are waking up. More people are

910
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:08,610
figuring it out. And so every time that they pass a bit of legislation that violates your rights and

911
01:15:08,610 --> 01:15:18,090
laws, within seconds, minutes, you have a myriad of different truth talkers and seekers in that

912
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:27,410
country or township or area of research screaming blue bloody murder all over the airwaves.

913
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:38,090
They don't like that very much. So that's why you keep doing it. We got this tiger by the tail.

914
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:43,810
We might as well just take him off. He's going to try and eat us anyway. Let's make his life

915
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:49,350
as miserable and annoying and frustrating as humanly possible. Because after all,

916
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:54,550
they have much worse planned and they're going to do it all incrementally.

917
01:15:54,870 --> 01:16:00,630
So if you act like every single bit of legislation is the total takeover domination of fascism,

918
01:16:01,070 --> 01:16:05,850
that's right. That's exactly what it is. Every bit of legislation that you accept

919
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:12,190
is you accepting fascism into your country. The fascist states of America. Have you ever seen

920
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:18,610
the Congress opposite sides of the Speaker of the House? What's up on that wall there?

921
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:26,770
It's a fash. You know what a fash is? It's a double headed axe that's wrapped with sticks.

922
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:34,170
It was the symbol of fascism in Nazi Germany. And it's on both sides of the Speaker of the

923
01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:42,250
House and Congress. What does that tell you? It's the united fascist states of America.

924
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:49,390
The U.S.S.A. because it's all socialism anyway, which were created by the same freaking people.

925
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:57,440
You don't have any choices. None that are widely advertised with huge million dollar budgets.

926
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:05,440
Those aren't your choices. Those people are scumbags. Have a look for the grassroots

927
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:14,380
supported people. Ron Paul, for example, huge grassroots support versus, say,

928
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:24,140
the eye of Newt Gingrich, whatever his name is. No grassroots support whatsoever.

929
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:31,640
But he'll wind up getting financed by a huge major corporate banks as all these

930
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:40,280
Republican scumbags or Democrat scumbags always are so that they can advertise their BS to you

931
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:44,320
endlessly so that you'll vote for them because of the power of repetition.

932
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:51,640
You're listening to the Vinny Eastwood show 402 237 2525 is the number to ring.

933
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:54,260
And we'll be right back after the break.

934
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:04,780
Now, you and your family and friends can enjoy the cleanest, most delicious and healthy drinking

935
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:10,840
water any time, even while traveling, camping at sporting events or in emergency situations.

936
01:18:11,260 --> 01:18:17,020
The Berkeley removes bacteria, parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.

937
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:22,600
It also produces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the

938
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:28,840
beneficial and nutritional minerals your body needs. Berkeley is so powerful it can even purify

939
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:34,560
raw, untreated water from remote lakes and streams. And the optional PF2 filters even

940
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:39,900
remove fluoride. The Berkeley LED with its rechargeable lighting system can be used as

941
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:45,040
a nightlight or a camp light to view or purchase your Berkeley water system and replacement filters.

942
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:50,840
Please visit American Freedom Radio's website at American Freedom Radio dot com and click the

943
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:56,080
Berkeley banner. Once again, that's American Freedom Radio dot com and click the Berkeley water banner.

Not yet available in Iowa. Do you realize every day we are being put under constant stress from

945
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:09,220
wireless radiation? What's worse is that you don't even know that it's happening. It puts as much

946
01:19:09,220 --> 01:19:14,980
stress on our body as if we had a constant viral infection, draining our energy and sapping our

947
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:20,100
strength or just making us irritable and fatigued. These wireless fields are being emitted from

948
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:27,220
computers, microwaves, mobile phones, power lines and any electrical appliance. Now there is a

949
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:32,280
solution. A group of research engineers in New Zealand have come up with an active shielding

950
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:37,780
device that shields you from wireless radiation at a cellular level. Blue Shield comes in three

951
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:43,640
models, a household, portable and USB that plugs into any computer. The great thing about Blue

952
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:49,260
Shield is it is very affordable and guaranteed to last. A one-off purchase will see you being

953
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:54,820
protected for years to come. Visit American Freedom Radio dot com and click on the Blue Shield

01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:08,120
Following a radiological or nuclear event, radioactive iodine may be released into the

956
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:14,480
air and then be breathed into the lungs. Radioactive iodine may also contaminate the local food supply

957
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:19,220
and get into the body through food or through drink. When radioactive materials get into the

958
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:23,820
body through breathing, eating or drinking, the thyroid gland quickly absorbs the chemical.

959
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:29,580
Radioactive iodine absorbed by the thyroid can then injure the gland. But you can protect yourself

960
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:35,180
with used potassium iodide, which acts to block radioactive iodine from being taken into the

961
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:40,780
thyroid gland and can help protect this gland from injury. To take advantage of very special rates,

you'll go friggin nuts. I have a caller in from New Zealand named Dean. Dean, welcome to the program.

983
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:07,130
Thanks Vinnie, how are you doing? Not doing too well, I'm thinking about that. You know what,

984
01:23:07,210 --> 01:23:11,570
I'm just gonna do what everybody else says and take it as a rhetorical question. I'm good.

985
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:17,670
I always hate that question actually because the answer is automatically programmed into us as

986
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:23,190
fine thank you and you're essentially lying to people most of the time. Yeah, I remember

987
01:23:23,190 --> 01:23:27,090
somebody asked me, Vinnie how are you? And I go, well do you want the long version or do you want

988
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:33,970
the short version? She goes, I want the short version. I say, I'm good. Exactly. What would you

989
01:23:33,970 --> 01:23:41,590
like to talk about today? I've been writing a couple of blog posts recently and I've been going

990
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:47,530
through a bit of a journey of discovery and it's a journey that a lot of people have gone under

991
01:23:48,370 --> 01:23:54,990
themselves over the last 2,000 years. But as I'm coming up with things, I'm publishing it and

992
01:23:55,890 --> 01:24:03,010
I've identified really some of the keys of why we're in the position we're in at the moment as

993
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:08,890
far as society and economy and the way that we can actually get our lives back and our freedom back

994
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:16,570
and our links back to nature. And it's really, really simple. Yeah, I thought it was quite

995
01:24:16,570 --> 01:24:23,630
simple too, just expose scumbaggery and everything will follow. Basically, yeah. Well they've only

996
01:24:23,630 --> 01:24:30,470
got one weapon against us and all we really need to do is stop using that weapon and then there's

997
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:36,390
no power. Yep, yep. I mean seriously, if your enemy's using an energy weapon, what do you do,

998
01:24:36,450 --> 01:24:41,810
is you just cut his power supply. Boom. No matter how much resources he spends on it,

999
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:46,370
you've got nothing. And at the moment, I think it's sort of the power over our minds that is

1000
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:52,190
the greatest weapon that they have, where people just on a random brain spasm will go and assault

1001
01:24:52,190 --> 01:25:04,070
a 9-11 truther. Yeah and how even just words can provoke this surge of fear within us which

1002
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:12,670
we instinctively try and avoid and that's really what it is, the strings are pulled

1003
01:25:13,230 --> 01:25:20,010
and we don't really have the sense to stop that. Do you feel like a couple of my big programmed

1004
01:25:20,010 --> 01:25:24,990
responses like they do in mind control programs like MK Ultra and stuff like that, just to a

1005
01:25:24,990 --> 01:25:33,010
lesser degree? Oh absolutely, we start when we're born. We generally start it formally when we're

1006
01:25:33,010 --> 01:25:42,750
about five years old. Yeah, for the education system. Exactly, it's training us to seek

1007
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:53,070
careers and we're all told the dream is to have house and cars and children and that's

1008
01:25:53,070 --> 01:26:00,390
what everybody is supposed to aspire to. Yeah, I suppose it would be because the problem I find

1009
01:26:01,070 --> 01:26:05,130
really with society is that their priorities are all out of whack.

1010
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:14,430
Like having home security, that kind of thing right here, right now is their only priority

1011
01:26:14,430 --> 01:26:19,050
because they've just distracted them from doing anything else, whereas improving themselves,

1012
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:23,110
ensuring your country doesn't collapse into tyranny, making sure that you're kept healthy

1013
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:27,250
so you don't get sick for the rest of your freaking natural life, that doesn't enter

1014
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:36,850
into the equation. The only thing that people see as the way that they can

1015
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:43,670
protect themselves is by getting a job, earning money to buy a house,

1016
01:26:44,310 --> 01:26:51,250
to set up a home for the family. So that they can drive past protesters and tell them to get a job?

1017
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:58,990
Yes. That's one of the great benefits of having a job, is you can tell protesters to get one.

1018
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:11,230
So it's one of the perks. I think that should be included in media pay packets or something of

1019
01:27:11,230 --> 01:27:15,510
that nature. One of the perks is they could tell protesters to go and get a job and call people

1020
01:27:15,510 --> 01:27:25,210
filthy hippies. Indeed, just sitting on top of a smug little room, poking your tongue out at people

1021
01:27:25,210 --> 01:27:36,010
saying no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, the koru club. We're talking about the mechanisms that enslave

1022
01:27:36,010 --> 01:27:41,270
us and as far as I'm concerned, it basically comes down to just common law and the issuance

1023
01:27:41,270 --> 01:27:45,310
of currency. That's basically the two ways that you're primarily physically enslaved.

1024
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:52,930
One determines your economic output, which determines your level of survival, and the

1025
01:27:52,930 --> 01:27:57,570
other dictates whether or not you're allowed to freely go around in a slave society or be

1026
01:27:57,570 --> 01:28:05,010
incarcerated in a slave society. That's exactly the topic of my post that I started writing at

1027
01:28:05,010 --> 01:28:11,010
two o'clock this morning. Can I summarize or read some of that out? Go for your life.

1028
01:28:13,270 --> 01:28:20,310
Well, it was 2 a.m. and I was laying in bed trying to sleep, and I've been writing in a journal

1029
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:27,850
only for the last few days, and I thought that sleep is something that's essential,

1030
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:34,630
and I was thinking about that for a wee while, and then I started putting a few notes down and

1031
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:43,650
I thought that you only really get to have sleep if you've paid money for the privilege of a place

1032
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:54,640
to sleep, and I was thinking, where can you actually sleep that's free? I remembered I was

1033
01:28:54,640 --> 01:29:01,560
in another city in another country not too long ago, and I actually had no place to sleep there,

1034
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:08,660
and I learned a valuable lesson. I actually started to feel trapped, and I kept on having

1035
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:14,140
to walk down the footpath and walk around the block because I actually had nowhere to sit,

1036
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:22,560
and I'd figured out that all the chairs were for rent. There was restaurants or even bus stops or

1037
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:29,060
shopfronts and so forth, but nothing was actually free to really use,

1038
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:37,240
but mostly for a place to sleep. You're not allowed to sleep in a public place

1039
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:47,320
or on somebody else's property. So, I think there is some truth to that.

1040
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:50,080
Where the heck do you sleep if you ain't got the money to pay for your bed?

1041
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:58,280
That's right. Well, you can take a tent. You can take a tent somewhere, but where would you take

1042
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:02,240
that? And how would you pay for the tent if you can't pay for your place to sleep?

1043
01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:09,890
Indeed. Well, you may already have one or it's something that you could build.

1044
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:21,450
Going back to my, I've got a bit of a flow here with my blog. With the tent thing, you can't go

1045
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:27,070
onto a business property with your tent, and you can't go onto a residential property with your

1046
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:33,610
tent, because both of those properties have been bought by somebody else, and they are the ones

1047
01:30:33,610 --> 01:30:39,980
that have the right to sleep on that property. Okay.

1048
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:47,020
But the main body which enforces this entire payment system is the government itself,

1049
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:53,540
since they are the ultimate owners of every inch of land that you could possibly sleep on top of.

1050
01:30:56,640 --> 01:31:02,620
Well, that's why they have corporate policy officers to trespass people, isn't it?

1051
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:11,960
Indeed. And there's many different types of that as well, from identifying if you've paid the right

1052
01:31:11,960 --> 01:31:17,980
amount of taxation, I suppose, which then they have the right to remove you from locations,

1053
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:21,420
or if you haven't paid the right amount of rent, they can remove you. There's different

1054
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:25,400
forces which can all do the same thing for a different reason.

1055
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:35,340
Yeah. But the only way to avoid the payment of money is actually by asking the owner of that

1056
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:41,820
land for a free favour to stay there. And in most cases, that's unlikely,

1057
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:46,860
since, again, they've paid so much money themselves to be able to sleep there.

1058
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:51,480
Or you can break the law by trespassing, but you risk a penalty.

1059
01:31:53,890 --> 01:31:59,590
The question that I have is, what gave them the right in the first place to own the land?

1060
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:10,870
And the answer that I came up with was that they stole it aggressively from nature and simply

1061
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:16,790
decided that it now belonged to them. And they brutally murdered anyone who challenged their

1062
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:23,010
claim to ownership. Then they created rules for the people. And if you wish to lease parts of

1063
01:32:23,010 --> 01:32:28,050
that land from them, you need to follow those rules or you will be prosecuted, penalised, imprisoned.

1064
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:32,990
This is how you make a landlord become a tenant.

1065
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:44,110
Yes. What's the point here then?

1066
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:53,890
Well, I actually started to think then about what are the other things that are essential to life

1067
01:32:53,890 --> 01:33:03,870
and what actually keeps our physical bodies moving. And the main things are air and sleep,

1068
01:33:05,510 --> 01:33:12,370
water, food and shelter. In my blog, I put another part about broadband internet access

1069
01:33:12,370 --> 01:33:18,430
as another thing that's essential today. And looking at the way society is currently today,

1070
01:33:18,490 --> 01:33:27,810
if we look around, the internet is... Actually, my question after that is, what of those things

1071
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:36,090
is actually a right and which one is a privilege to have? And I'd written or thought that the

1072
01:33:36,090 --> 01:33:40,690
internet is a privilege. It's something that we choose to purchase if we want to use it.

1073
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:48,790
Shelter is also a privilege at present. It's something that we must purchase if we want to

1074
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:57,490
use it. Food presently is a privilege also. It's something that you must purchase from a store if

1075
01:33:57,490 --> 01:34:04,250
they allow you to purchase it. Water in cities is also a privilege. It's something that you have

1076
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:09,690
to purchase if you want to use it. If you fail to pay that, the supply will cease.

1077
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:14,910
Sleep, of course, we've gone over that. That's definitely a privilege. You're only

1078
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:18,190
legally allowed to sleep on land that you've paid money for.

1079
01:34:18,890 --> 01:34:23,570
And not to mention with the amount of hours that people are working for crap pay these days

1080
01:34:23,570 --> 01:34:27,890
because they outsourced everything for free trade agreements, they aren't getting much sleep at all

1081
01:34:27,890 --> 01:34:34,430
anyway. So you're really just sitting on there thinking about why you're not sleeping and what

1082
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:40,430
it is that you have to do the next day. I'm lying awake wondering why I can't sleep.

1083
01:34:41,150 --> 01:34:53,870
Yeah. Air is the last one. And that's the final thing which is borderline at the moment because

1084
01:34:53,870 --> 01:35:00,070
it's kind of a right and a privilege right now. It's in the process.

1085
01:35:00,870 --> 01:35:04,830
Well, we're going to be carbon taxed for polluting the air. So I think it's well on its way.

1086
01:35:05,710 --> 01:35:10,470
Exactly. They're measuring the amount of carbon dioxide we are using. Well,

1087
01:35:10,630 --> 01:35:15,030
we are expelling, we are breathing out. Do they even measure it? Like I haven't

1088
01:35:15,030 --> 01:35:19,610
seen no council guy go up to my tailpipe and go, oh, I think I'll give you this much

1089
01:35:19,610 --> 01:35:22,910
carbon tax this year. That's a pretty naughty tailpipe there.

1090
01:35:24,190 --> 01:35:29,290
It's like, thank you, Mr. Green-wrapped, jack-booted thug with a swastika made of leaves.

1091
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:38,490
Yeah. What is the formula? Do they look at the size of the machine and punch some numbers into

1092
01:35:38,490 --> 01:35:43,710
a calculator and say, okay, this is our estimate? I reckon they just operate like the Federal

1093
01:35:43,710 --> 01:35:53,620
Reserve and make it up based upon a group of scumbags who work for international organizations

1094
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:58,200
who have an interest in making sure that the prices are as such or whatever that they recommend.

1095
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:02,660
You know, I'll short this option and then I'll crash the economy.

1096
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:08,520
There's a huge amount of money for me and a huge amount of power and control too. Fabulous.

1097
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:14,980
The thing is, how did we let this happen? How did we give all of this power to somebody else?

1098
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:23,200
We've been a species for, and this is an open topic really, for 10,000 years, 50,000 years,

1099
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:27,840
100,000, depends on where you want to draw that line of where we started.

1100
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:37,700
But it's only in the last thousand or so years that we've been giving away our rights to these

1101
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:43,540
privileges that we've been getting for free all of this time. I don't know. I mean, I don't think

1102
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:49,120
anything's really free. Like, before people became slaves to Egypt, they were out in the middle of

1103
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:55,800
land with their families and they had to work all day to keep fed, sheltered, and with water and

1104
01:36:55,800 --> 01:37:02,700
whatnot. Anyway, we're just subtracting one form of substituted slavery for another and that's what

1105
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:10,900
history through for humanity has really seemed to be like for me. It's just these different forms

1106
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:18,100
of slavery. It's like a corkscrew that weaves to one side and then comes back again and distorts and

1107
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:22,020
gradually goes all the way through and then plucks out your freedom.

1108
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:32,500
In certain circles, but not in all. And all of those, all of the circles that make it that way

1109
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:37,720
are always led by one person at the top that's seeking the power and the control.

1110
01:37:38,860 --> 01:37:42,220
And if you look at smaller communities, native

1111
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:50,640
villages and so forth that are not underneath the umbrella of one of these main leaders,

1112
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:59,640
their systems are completely different and it's that lack of greed or seeking of ultimate power

1113
01:38:00,380 --> 01:38:05,960
that means that everybody can coexist. And that happens today still. There are some

1114
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:07,700
parts of the world that it's done.

1115
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:18,060
Well, I think that when we really want to get down to it, if you want to be free and if you

1116
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:24,120
want to maintain that freedom, all those essentials of life should be something that's relatively easy

1117
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:29,100
to get a hold of, right? It's now actually becoming quite difficult to find a place to live,

1118
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:35,980
to have clean food, clean water, and be able to heat your property. I mean, thank you very much,

1119
01:38:35,980 --> 01:38:42,940
Dean, for your call there. And we'll have to let you go. We've got Chris Greenwave of

1120
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:48,400
Greenwave Radio coming on in the last segment today. You're listening to The Vinnie Eastwood

What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality,

1123
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:07,180
feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns,

1124
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:11,840
blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall? There's something that is changing

1125
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:16,500
thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them. It's called Heart and Body Extract.

1126

Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of

1127
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:25,780
Heart and Body Extract. What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving

1128
01:39:25,780 --> 01:39:30,620
the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients,

1129
01:39:30,620 --> 01:39:35,640
so the body will heal itself. And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure,

1130
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:40,960
balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries. It can also work on balancing the

1131
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:45,680
circulation for diabetics, so the body is an amazing thing. It simply needs some help,

1132
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:51,020

The First Amendment in the Bill of Rights limits the government's power by ensuring freedom of

1135
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:08,980
speech and preserves the rights of the people. Every day that passes, our rights gradually

1136
01:40:08,980 --> 01:40:14,000
slip away. It's time to take a stand and let the government know that we are tired of losing our

1137

rights. LibertyStickers.com will allow you to express your rights and allow millions of people

1166
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:32,060
I was putting my pack along the dusty. Welcome back to the show that's been everywhere, man.

1167
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:37,280
It's the Vinnie Eastwood Show, broadcasting live from New Zealand, live from the future. It's all

1168
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:42,340
ready tomorrow. And for those of you on the other side of the dateline, don't worry about it. I'm

1169
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:48,060
sure you'll catch up eventually. I have a very special guest for you. It's Chris from Greenwave

1170
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:55,340
Radio on AmericanFreedomRadio.com. And he's a fabulous new young full-time show host, and he is

1171
01:43:55,340 --> 01:44:00,800
kicking it and kicking it hard. Chris, welcome to the program. Vinnie, how are you doing? Thanks

1172
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:06,100
for having me on. Well, tell us a little bit about yourself and what actually got you into

1173
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:10,180
the radio. And we have a caller on the line as well, so we can take them when you wish.

1174
01:44:10,760 --> 01:44:15,400
All right. Well, sounds good. Well, I'm looking at this T-shirt you sent me. You sent me a link

1175
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:20,080
to this. It says, I love scumbaggery. And you said that you love exposing it. Well,

1176
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:25,520
I guess you can call me somebody that likes to expose scumbaggery as well.

1177
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:30,380
You know, it's abundantly clear that we've got fraud and corruption at the

1178
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:35,520
very top levels of the federal government and the banking system.

1179
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:42,820
I was in the banking game myself for over 10 years. In fact, I worked as a broker at Merrill Lynch

1180
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:52,100
during the height of the crisis in 2008. And I was so absolutely disgusted by what I saw,

1181
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:58,640
I packed my bags, Vinnie, and I quit on the spot. And I started a YouTube channel

1182
01:44:59,140 --> 01:45:05,600
and really with the intention of helping to educate others to exactly what's been going

1183
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:08,960
on in this country here in the United States of America and really around the world.

1184
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:17,900
And here I am today. Yeah, absolutely. We have a caller on the line here. Caller,

1185
01:45:17,900 --> 01:45:27,120
area code 561. State your name and business. Caller number 561, area code.

1186
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:31,180
Just calling in from somewhere. You don't want to speak, do you?

1187
01:45:32,440 --> 01:45:35,100
No. Yeah, I don't hear anyone there, Vinnie.

1188
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:39,280
Oh, well, it must be the phantom caller of some description.

1189
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:47,840
So let me ask you, what do you think of this indefinite detention bill that passed today?

1190
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:52,220
What do you make of that? Well, I don't know about indefinite

1191
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:56,560
detention, but I'm definitely going to pay some attention to it. You know what I'm saying?

1192
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:01,960
There's some very, very nasty things that are happening with people's rights all day,

1193
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:06,440
every day. And this basically turns the United States into a declared

1194
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:13,480
war zone. And conveniently with the whole trialed enemy combatant in quotation marks

1195
01:46:13,480 --> 01:46:19,900
a scheme of just being able to grab anybody anywhere, anytime and hold them for all time.

1196
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:25,540
It's been working quite well under Obama, don't you think? So this is just natural progression.

1197
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:30,960
Yeah, it really is, you know, terrorism just against the regular people. I mean,

1198
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:35,720
nobody at the top goes to jail, Vinnie, but they can they can send us to prison.

1199
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:40,600
They can just call you a terrorist. Call Vinnie Eastwood a terrorist. They can call me a terrorist

1200
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:46,140
and put us to jail just kind of like, you know, over at Guantanamo Bay. That other institution,

1201
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:51,340
that fine institution that President Obama said he'd get rid of, that's still open to this day.

1202
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:58,340
So the tyranny continues, that's for sure. Yeah. Well, there's no upper limit to tyranny.

1203
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:03,500
And there's no end to it as well. It's a perennial problem. Every generation has their

1204
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:08,140
own tyranny that they need to deal with, you know, whether it's just your tyrannical father

1205
01:47:08,140 --> 01:47:13,880
trying to stop you from becoming a radio show host or whatever, or whether it's massive,

1206
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:22,280
big daddy, messianic leader telling you what you can and can't do all day long with his long leg

1207
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:27,240
and mackdaddiness. Those are the types of tyrannies you really got to be watching out for

1208
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:31,820
because it's a scalable model, you see. You can have tyranny in the home, you can have tyranny

1209
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:35,320
on the playground, you can have tyranny in an organization, tyranny in a company,

1210
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:40,120
tyranny in a country, tyranny in a globe. And that's what we're heading for. For the first time

1211
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:48,100
ever, a total, complete world tyranny, the first that has ever been concocted that is actually

1212
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:54,600
nearing completion. That's the scariest thing about it all, is that there's nowhere to run,

1213
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:58,660
nowhere to hide. You don't really have much of a choice in the matter once you know what's going on.

1214
01:47:58,940 --> 01:48:02,240
And it gives you that impetus. I'm sure when you're in Merrill Lynch,

1215
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:06,840
as soon as you knew what was going on, you got some motivation.

1216
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:13,920
Absolutely, absolutely. And that's the truth. And there's millions of people around the world

1217
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:20,180
that feel the same way I do, coming from all walks of life. And that's what the Warren Buffetts of

1218
01:48:20,180 --> 01:48:25,480
the world, these financial terrorists, just don't get, is that you've got an entire generation of

1219
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:31,020
non-believers. You've got an entire generation of highly educated people like me, like myself.

1220
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:35,380
Take myself as an example. I went to private school. I was in the game. I was in the real

1221
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:43,580
world. Worked for these big international banks. And now I'm gone. And now I'm working full time to

1222
01:48:43,580 --> 01:48:50,520
expose truth and to educate people to the fraud and corruption. And Vinny, we want justice.

1223
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:55,760
A lot of what we do, and I think a lot that's been overlooked with the OWS movement,

1224
01:48:55,760 --> 01:49:01,540
which by the way, they're quelling and removing those people from the streets because it's not

1225
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:06,500
like we have those constitutional rights anymore. What people are missing is this is about justice.

1226
01:49:07,060 --> 01:49:12,680
I want to see these people go to jail. And millions more of us and millions alike of us,

1227
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:16,160
they want to see the same thing. So until- Well, they want to see worse.

1228
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:22,840
Hung in public square, buried in an unmarked shallow grave so the coyotes can get them.

1229
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:30,220
Some people are calling for that. Yeah. Death by coyote. That would be the new

1230
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:38,120
form of- I can see the state of Texas actually having a prison. You know how they have prisons

1231
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:42,540
where they have death row and execution rooms and stuff like that? They'll just have another

1232
01:49:42,540 --> 01:49:49,040
one that just has a room full of coyotes. That would be a very gruesome death.

1233
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:54,700
Potentially worse than the guillotine. Death by coyotes. But here's a question for you,

1234
01:49:54,780 --> 01:50:01,720
Vinny, and your listeners around the world. Is this prison? Are we living in a prison now?

1235
01:50:02,260 --> 01:50:06,580
It's the biggest open-air prison there is. It's good old planet prison earth.

1236
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:13,220
Yeah, I was thinking about that today too. Of course, a lot of Americans, a lot of people

1237
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:18,680
obviously still deal in credit. If they didn't have their credit cards, they wouldn't be able to

1238
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:23,240
purchase goods and services. But every time you make a transaction, Vinny, whether or not

1239
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:28,520
it's a credit card or a debit card, or they're just taking a snapshot or a picture of your

1240
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:32,480
license plate as you're driving across the street past an intersection, or if you try to board a

1241
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:37,320
plane nowadays, you're going to have a sexual relationship with the TSA worker. That's just

1242
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:43,220
how things work here in the good old red, white, and blue free America. We're fighting overseas

1243
01:50:43,220 --> 01:50:48,600
in all these wars. We've got young men and women about our ages stepping on IEDs, getting their

1244
01:50:48,600 --> 01:50:52,740
arms and legs blown off if they're lucky, if they don't get killed by it. And they say we're

1245
01:50:52,740 --> 01:50:58,540
fighting these tyrannical dictatorships and regimes because we're trying to preserve freedom. We're

1246
01:50:58,540 --> 01:51:03,640
trying to liberate the rest of the world. Let me ask a fundamental question. Why don't we have

1247
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:09,580
freedom here? If this is what young men and women are dying for across the world, then why is it

1248
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:14,320
that we're in a prison? Why do we have this draconian legislation being passed? Why do we

1249
01:51:14,320 --> 01:51:18,900
have bills like SOPA aimed at threatening the very existence of alternative media,

1250
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:25,260
shows like the Vinnie Eastwood show, shows like our show at greenwave.com?

1251
01:51:26,240 --> 01:51:31,580
Yeah, well, it's like Smedley Butler, the Medal of Honor winner, said when he was a Marine,

1252
01:51:31,940 --> 01:51:37,240
he was just basically working for United Fruit. Whenever there's a company interest in another

1253
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:42,760
South American country where the certain Panamanian dictator or whatever was kicking

1254
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:48,760
up a fuss and threatening their profit margin, in would go the boys. That's all that troops have

1255
01:51:49,340 --> 01:51:55,360
always been used for, always will, is to protect corporate interests. Not entirely dissimilar from

1256
01:51:55,360 --> 01:52:00,200
how police officers are today. They're not out there to help you, to serve or protect you in a

1257
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:05,600
large amount of cases. They're really out there to just gather revenue from you for this all

1258
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:10,460
overarching scumbaggery corporation that they want you to live in as a partner, which is called

1259
01:52:10,460 --> 01:52:20,850
fascism. They want you to be a part of the downfall of your own country, and they're going to use your

1260
01:52:20,850 --> 01:52:26,570
money to do it. And that's exactly what they are doing. We have a caller on the line there. If

1261
01:52:26,570 --> 01:52:31,670
you're on the line there, you can speak up if you like. If not, don't worry, we'll just talk over

1262
01:52:31,670 --> 01:52:37,310
the top of you. And Chris, I wanted to know, from getting up in the corporate sector and the banking

1263
01:52:37,310 --> 01:52:41,750
and all of that, I presume you probably found out like I did that the whole competitive environment

1264
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:46,610
thing is one that might on occasion be riddled with a lot of mistrust?

1265
01:52:48,550 --> 01:52:53,630
Well yeah, I think there's a lot of mistrust. I think that people's priorities in America,

1266
01:52:53,830 --> 01:52:59,850
a lot of people at least, it's not everybody, it's dominated by greed, it's dominated by me or the

1267
01:52:59,850 --> 01:53:06,230
highway, it's dominated by the idea and the paradigm that I'm going to basically earn as much money as

1268
01:53:06,230 --> 01:53:11,290
I possibly can, and I'll step over you and stab you in the back and twist the knife if I have to.

1269
01:53:11,930 --> 01:53:16,510
You know, if I have to barter and sell my firstborn son for an extra million dollars,

1270
01:53:16,590 --> 01:53:20,810
I'm going to do it. And when I do do it and I collect that million dollars, or maybe it's even

1271
01:53:20,810 --> 01:53:26,630
10 million dollars, I'm going to build a gigantic house in suburbia and I'm going to have a gigantic

1272
01:53:26,630 --> 01:53:31,850
mortgage. I'm going to make it so big, I'm going to build a fence around it and I'm going to have

1273
01:53:31,850 --> 01:53:37,390
armed guards outside of it making sure nobody else can get in because that's the American dream.

1274
01:53:38,610 --> 01:53:42,150
I thought that was the Panamanian dictator's dream. Oh, wait.

1275
01:53:46,010 --> 01:53:51,530
That seems to be what it's all about nowadays. The guy with the most stuff when he dies

1276
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:54,870
wins, and anybody else is going to go to a FEMA camp.

1277
01:53:56,590 --> 01:54:03,130
Yeah, well, that's a sad reality, I hope. My hope is, and I think this is starting to change,

1278
01:54:03,130 --> 01:54:07,710
even if it's just with a minority of people, is I think a lot of Americans,

1279
01:54:08,110 --> 01:54:14,070
after being brutalized by the downturn in the real economy, of course, they can fabricate and

1280
01:54:14,070 --> 01:54:18,910
manipulate a stock market, a Dow Jones Industrial Average of 12,000 on quantitative easing to

1281
01:54:18,910 --> 01:54:25,370
infinity, Operation Twist, and the latest wham, bam, thank you, ma'am manipulation program coming

1282
01:54:25,370 --> 01:54:30,850
out of Ben Bernanke. It will ultimately make the US dollar worthless and send millions of

1283
01:54:30,850 --> 01:54:35,670
Americans to poverty, which is what it's already doing. But I think the positive of it is after

1284
01:54:35,670 --> 01:54:42,890
being burned and things like real estate being off 50, 60, 70, 80% peak to trough in some parts

1285
01:54:42,890 --> 01:54:47,550
of our country, a lot of people, again, Vinny, they're just opting out of the program, my friend.

1286
01:54:48,250 --> 01:54:52,390
If you don't get people to buy in in this program, guess what? Everything crashes.

1287
01:54:53,190 --> 01:54:57,050
Everything goes down. I think that's what we've got. You've got a generation of nonbelievers.

1288
01:54:57,870 --> 01:55:03,030
Well, I love to be an unbeliever, and nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition.

1289
01:55:03,330 --> 01:55:07,430
Thanks, Chris Green, for coming on the show with us today. You can check him out

1290
01:55:07,430 --> 01:55:12,910
on Americanfreedomradio.com and Greenwaveradio.com, I believe.

1291
01:55:13,790 --> 01:55:18,010
Greenwave.com and on YouTube, Seagreen with an E-34.

1292
01:55:19,310 --> 01:55:23,350
Seagreen with an E-34. Seagreen with an E-34.

1293
01:55:24,110 --> 01:55:28,350
Seagreen with an E-34. Apparently, if you repeat things three times, people remember it a little

1294
01:55:28,350 --> 01:55:31,750
bit better. So we're glad to use that little bit of propagandistic brainwashing right here on the

1295
01:55:31,750 --> 01:55:35,890
Vinny Eastwood Show. And thanks very much, Chris. Thank you, American Freedom Radio,

1296
01:55:36,290 --> 01:55:38,730
and thank you, the listeners. Love you so much.
