1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:16,680
Everyone's asleep. Everyone but me. And I can't help feel like I'm doing this all by myself.

2
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:46,980
We took the long road, they had enough. Walking on seashells, my feet are cutting, I'm home. Another planet now.

3
00:00:49,480 --> 00:01:02,880
No time for females, I'm out of love. I'm making up details, don't give a f**k and I'm alone. I'm so frustrated now.

4
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:18,180
But everyone's asleep. Everyone but me. And I can't help feel like I'm doing this all by myself.

5
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:34,640
Another morning, I'm feeling rough. Don't get too on it, I'm getting up and it's so, so complicated now.

6
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:49,660
It's time for my work, baby, oh. Set off the fireworks, baby, oh. Cause everyone's asleep. Everyone but me.

7
00:01:50,340 --> 00:02:03,140
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Vinnie Eastwood Show, broadcasting live on Americanfreedomradio.com and, incidentally, the VinnieEastwoodShow.com.

8
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:14,360
And my producers found out yesterday, looking at Alexa.com, that out of the 150 million websites in the world,

9
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:22,280
the Vinnie Eastwood Show's only been around for, well, less than two years, and it's now in the top 1% of websites in the entire world.

10
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,960
So I'm doing not bad, hopefully. Hopefully. Maybe it'll get better. Maybe it won't. Maybe people will just go, you know what, Vinnie's getting too big.

11
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:36,340
He must have sold out to the New World Order. He must be a Zionist shill. I'm pretty sure that'll happen.

12
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:51,240
Okay, today we are hoping to have a guest called The Greek call in. So if The Greek is listening, the phone lines are open for you, mate, and you can call right on in any old time you please.

13
00:02:51,360 --> 00:03:02,180
In the meantime, I was going to talk about the New Zealand situation with regards to these asset sales and the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement.

14
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,800
Because I think this is actually probably one of the most scary, scary things that's happening to the country right now,

15
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:16,800
is that you have these New World Order trash, you know, working for the banking interviews, working for the banking cartels and what have you,

16
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,200
that come in and get elected, and nobody's ever really heard of them.

17
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:30,660
Like, I'd never heard of Mitt Romney before him starting to run for the Republican nomination and everything like that.

18
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,360
Never heard of Obama before he came in and started running for president and all of that sort of stuff.

19
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,900
It's just like, these people kind of almost come out of nowhere.

20
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,840
Like, their background is completely unknown to any of us because we don't actually get involved, right?

21
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,620
You know, we're not at politics every day. We don't go to Congress. We don't protest outside a lot of the time.

22
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,120
And even if we do, we're not naming names, shaming shames, and what have you.

23
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,480
Basically, these scum fracks get away with it because we don't know who we're dealing with.

24
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,900
And if you don't know who your enemy is, how exactly are you going to fight them?

25
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,820
If you don't know what their tactics are, how exactly are you going to defeat them?

26
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,120
So dig this. Here's the tactic of the enemy.

27
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,180
Manipulate people with the media to tell them that there's a big economic crisis.

28
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:35,300
Then when they react to that big economic crisis, they will willingly get anybody who says that they can save them into power.

29
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,580
That's how easy it is to manipulate our society.

30
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,260
Most people don't think about anything at all, at any point.

31
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:51,760
I forget who it was. It might have been Winston Churchill who said the best argument against democracy is a conversation with the average voter.

32
00:04:51,760 --> 00:05:00,680
And I hold that to be 100% true because I have talked to many average voters and they don't know Shiite Muslim about anything.

33
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,180
They can't define anything. That's the thing. You've got to ask them to define right wing, define left wing.

34
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,520
They can't do it. Define economics. They can't do it.

35
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:33,180
So you have a whole bunch of completely uneducated, manipulated, totally brainwashed, mind-controlled slaves who are willing to destroy their own country for no good reason.

36
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,740
And it's just the thing, they're completely unaware.

37
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:44,880
This lack of awareness, wholesale, doesn't matter what country you're in, we all experience this massive lack of awareness, do we not?

38
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:52,020
And it's not my fault that everybody's not aware. It's not your fault. We're the ones going out there trying to tell the truth.

39
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,160
It's not our fault when they don't listen to us either.

40
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,840
It's not our fault when our countries get sold out.

41
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,660
It's not our fault. It's not our problem.

42
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,880
We're not the ones who created it. We shouldn't be the ones whose sole responsibility is solving it.

43
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:21,600
And more to the point, solving such a massive problem, let's say if I did take responsibility for saying, oh, hold on a second, the whole country's fracked, I have to do something.

44
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:29,800
Many activists do this and they find out very early on that it's not easy to do it on your own.

45
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,040
If anything, it's nigh on impossible.

46
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,080
That's another thing that I found out about all the activists in New Zealand.

47
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:47,520
Whenever any of them are in trouble, they always know other activists within their movement or in other areas or something like that, and they always come out of the woodwork to protect each other.

48
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:54,620
We really do have an opposite mechanism starting to work here in the truth movement.

49
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,900
Let me just try and break it down.

50
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,280
Media, assets, government, social.

51
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,600
These are the three things that I think probably really need to be defined for people in the truth movement.

52
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,940
Media, assets, social.

53
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,920
Media currently manipulate everybody by telling them lies and whatever.

54
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,360
Cool.

55
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,240
Who do they get to do all the commentary?

56
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,620
They get paid shills and what have you.

57
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,760
What does the truth movement have to do?

58
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,500
Get unpaid shills.

59
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,420
I'm a shill in some way, sense of the word.

60
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,740
I am shilling the truth all day long.

61
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,440
I'm shilling counseling and truth and ideology and what have you.

62
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,240
So technically, yes, I am.

63
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,780
Except I'm doing the exact opposite of what the current media do, and that's all that needs to happen.

64
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:54,400
You just have a look at whatever the establishment is doing, do the direct opposite, and you're most likely going to be right on the money.

65
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,880
Okay, it's pretty simple.

66
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,540
Do the direct opposite of whatever they want you to do.

67
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,700
Assets.

68
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,440
They want you to sell your assets.

69
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,980
Ergo, you have to keep your assets.

70
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,440
Very straightforward.

71
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:15,920
They want you to sign massive trade agreements, which take away your country's sovereignty and give evil companies like Monsanto the capacity to sue your company

72
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:22,200
without legislation stopping anything that would make them a profit.

73
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:32,419
For instance, if they wanted to come and dump toxic waste in the middle of Queen Street, for example, main city.

74
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,100
And the government said, you know what?

75
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:45,500
Dumping toxic waste in the middle of our main shopping areas is going to cause a lot of damage to the local population, and it might dampen the local businesses and everything like that.

76
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:51,560
So we're going to pass legislation that makes it illegal to dump toxic waste in public places.

77
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,300
Monsanto will go, you know what?

78
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,740
We're going to have to take you to court then because you're threatening our fracking profit margins.

79
00:08:59,220 --> 00:08:59,840
And I'm not kidding.

80
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:06,060
I'm making a really insane example to just kind of show you exactly what they are capable of doing.

81
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,980
If they wanted to, they could do this under this Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.

82
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:20,900
And if you're in the United States or in Japan or anything like that, any massive scum fracker corporation will be capable of doing this to you as well.

83
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:29,700
We are all going to be exterminated in terms of economics by this type of treaty.

84
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,520
Now, the United States has already suffered under NAFTA and GATT, so they already know what we're talking about.

85
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,320
They know what happens when you do these big, massive trade agreement deals.

86
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,280
People in the economic community know what happens when you join massive economic communities.

87
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,320
You're basically putting all your eggs in one basket.

88
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:49,520
Okay?

89
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,120
Now, everybody knows that putting all your eggs in one basket is an incredibly stupid idea.

90
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,160
Because if you stumble in any way, shape, or form, you're going to lose the lot.

91
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,060
And that's precisely the agenda.

92
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,200
Tie everybody together.

93
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,300
Right?

94
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,180
Not entirely dissimilar in a way witches are tied together and burned at the stake.

95
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,000
That's what's going to happen to our economies under this sort of stuff.

96
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:15,900
Okay?

97
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,160
Who benefits?

98
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,520
Not you.

99
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,940
And not me.

100
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,140
Not our countries.

101
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,400
Not our sovereignty.

102
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,920
Not our personal liberties.

103
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,240
Not our economies of any kind.

104
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
It's not possible.

105
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,420
It's not their real intention for this.

106
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:36,540
If the intention was to do any good, the agreements would not be secret from the public.

107
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:43,620
People would be able to look and say, ooh, I don't like that little bit there.

108
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,160
Maybe we can actually do something about it.

109
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:46,880
But no.

110
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,660
Doesn't work that way.

111
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,700
And the last aspect I wanted to explain is social.

112
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:53,480
Okay?

113
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,600
New World Order wants you to not be social.

114
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,420
Wants you to not hang out with other truthers.

115
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,680
Wants you to feel alone.

116
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,500
Wants you to withdraw into yourself.

117
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,780
Wants you to lose your mind and start becoming drug dependent and everything like that.

118
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
Well, look at it this way.

119
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,220
What's the normal aspect of a normal person's life?

120
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,480
We've got the Greek calling in now.

121
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,360
I'll come to you in a sec, mate.

122
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,080
You know how you go out before you became a truther and you used to go out drinking on Friday nights with mates or something like that?

123
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,020
You go around to their house.

124
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,780
Maybe you watch a movie or something like that.

125
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,220
Hey, still do that.

126
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,080
All right?

127
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:31,240
Except go around to a truther mate's house instead of watching some mindless movie.

128
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,980
Watch a documentary together.

129
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,720
So it's the same methodology.

130
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,400
Go and have dinner with a truther.

131
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:47,140
In fact, I have Tiff and Dan, two listeners who came around to my house the other week and invited me and my girlfriends here around for dinner tonight.

132
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:47,600
Okay?

133
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,380
We're going to go around.

134
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,020
We're going to have a nice chat and be friendly and all of that sort of stuff.

135
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,640
That's what you're supposed to do, man.

136
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,280
Okay?

137
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,340
Don't stay alone.

138
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,800
It's a bad idea.

139
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,720
At least I think so anyway.

140
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,800
You know, everybody's really cool in the truth.

141
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,680
Well, not everybody.

142
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,740
There's plenty of cool people in the truth movement.

143
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,900
Let me rephrase.

144
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:14,300
And by all means, if you're tired of hanging around with slaves talking about stuff that doesn't matter, find yourself a truther mate.

145
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,840
Email me if there's a truther that I know in your particular area or your particular state or whatever.

146
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,840
The video would show a social network.

147
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,040
I'm going to be launching this.

148
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,180
God knows when.

149
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:30,960
I just want people to send me emails with their current location and maybe what their interests are or anything like that.

150
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:38,800
And what I'll do is I'll send you the email addresses of people in your area, not so you can just chat with them on Facebook, but so you can actually meet them.

151
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,520
You can actually talk with them.

152
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,620
Okay?

153
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,880
That is the most important thing that you need to realize in life is that you are not alone in this.

154
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,060
Okay?

155
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,980
I'm 10,000 miles away.

156
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,220
I can't be there with you at all times.

157
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,620
All of you listeners, on the other hand, you can be there for each other.

158
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,880
You really can.

159
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,400
And I'll be there for anybody who needs me.

160
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:00,940
All right.

161
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,320
The Greek.

162
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,060
Welcome to the show, mate.

163
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,400
You're on the air.

164
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,440
Greetings, Vinnie.

165
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,540
Thanks.

166
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,780
Thanks for having me on.

167
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,540
Well, it's good, man.

168
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,320
We've got you here for a good two hours.

169
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,560
And I was explaining to my friend Jono last night, Greg, about you.

170
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,460
And he said, well, who's he?

171
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:28,920
And I say, well, imagine that you were put here by an alien civilization.

172
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:52,840
And your task as a trusted science laboratory researcher for the civilization is to explore, research every single aspect of this planet and the universe from the human conditions perspective as a subjective sort of experiment.

173
00:13:52,840 --> 00:14:03,560
And you need to know everything about atomic structure, about how plants really work, how the body really works, how the universe truly rotates and everything like that.

174
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:10,660
If you know everything from the micro out to the macro, that's basically the knowledge base that the Greek has.

175
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,740
And every single time he's called into the show, I have learned something radically new that has changed my perspective on everything.

176
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:20,440
Wow.

177
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,100
That's about as good as a intro as I can probably get to you, mate.

178
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,500
Oh, man, I might as well hang up because I don't know if I can live up to that now.

179
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:39,480
Well, let's start off by calling you Dr. Vinny Eastwood because laughter is absolutely the best medicine and you do prescribe it often.

180
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,520
Yeah, I do.

181
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:49,940
And I'm wondering if there's going to be any overdoses of Vinny Eastwood show laughter and somebody will have a bad reaction and go shoot up a school or something like a Prozac.

182
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,260
Yeah.

183
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:51,840
Yeah.

184
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,280
Maybe me calling in is a side effect.

185
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,320
Yeah, it could be.

186
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:57,960
It could be.

187
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,660
I mean, was it voluntary?

188
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,480
Okay.

189
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:07,840
Okay.

190
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,080
Well, let's start off with the normal question that we asked all the guests.

191
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,800
Tell us a little bit about who you are and what it is you do.

192
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,300
Oh, gosh.

193
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,780
Oh, golly.

194
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,860
You give a pretty good explanation there.

195
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:26,680
I like to take the position that I'm just visiting here and trying to be objective and a little referral to that movie.

196
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,140
K-Pax, your produce is not so great anymore.

197
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,300
Yeah, I don't think it is.

198
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,380
Yeah.

199
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,180
You know what I mean?

200
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:41,160
It is possible, but to get good produce here.

201
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:55,440
But, yeah, pretty much what I do is I'm observing and I'm trying to basically gather enough information and compare it with people's belief systems,

202
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:09,020
what they say is true, what they actually do versus what they say, and basically how the inhabitants of the earth are interacting with their environment and each other

203
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:17,920
and trying to form a body of work that would distill basically the current state of the situation

204
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:25,440
so it can be easily described and outlined to someone who wanted to know more about what's going on here,

205
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,340
which actually happens to be the inhabitants themselves in some cases, and you call it the Truth or Movement.

206
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,880
So, hopefully, in that case, I believe that in many aspects of what we look to explain as what is the truth,

207
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,340
a lot of people go into long-winded discussions and very, very narrow and deep topics,

208
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,720
but I believe it is possible to form a very general outline, let's say with bullet points and marks,

209
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,480
that one can go into depth later and it covers the entire field of existence on this planet.

210
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:05,609
Now, thinking about this, because that's one of the main aspects that you talk about when you talk about mainline, massive philosophical discussion,

211
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:11,270
what's the meaning of it all? Have you come up with a working hypothesis for what the meaning of life is?

212
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:22,770
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Well, you have to define life, and it's very difficult to define it using the conventional bodies of knowledge

213
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:31,790
that people usually subscribe to, science and religion and philosophy, because the mainstream teaches that we live in a dead universe.

214
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:36,550
We're nothing more than chemical substances, products of explosions and random effects.

215
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:38,870
But as we look a little closer...

216
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:44,890
We're coming to break, unfortunately, so we'll come back to you just in a few minutes.

217
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:49,550
The Greek is my guest, ladies and gentlemen. We'll be back in just a few minutes after the break.

218
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:54,830
You can join us in the chat room at TheVinnieEastwoodShow.com.

219
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:59,430
And also check out the other stuff at TheVinnieEastwoodShow.com. Lots of info there. Back in a minute.

220
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,370
Jamming like it was a thing of the past.

221
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:35,870
Brinding on through the universe at breakneck speed, transmitting out to the distant star clusters of the scumbaggery universe.

222
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:46,030
And we have a very special guest, the Greek. He's trying to explain to us what his working hypothesis is for the meaning of life.

223
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:46,870
The Greek, welcome back.

224
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:48,790
Hey, man, thanks.

225
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,370
Yeah, as you were asking me the meaning of life, well, there's several meanings to it.

226
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,750
Depends on your level of observation.

227
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:04,930
And again, we were saying that they do teach everything's pretty much a dead substance that somehow has coalesced into something living.

228
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,870
So from using that as a foundation or a basis to explain the meaning of life...

229
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,710
Well, let me just digress for one second.

230
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:25,790
When Sarah Vaughan, a great jazz musician, was asked what makes a great jazz musician, and she says it's the audience.

231
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:37,010
So the truth in one aspect, based on who your audience is, will be shunned and laughed at, and sometimes they'll even want to kill you for saying it.

232
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:43,630
Other audience will be indifferent, and other audience will be pretty susceptible to the information.

233
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:52,390
And not only just listening to it, but actually doing a little bit of homework and applying it practically and proving it out for themselves.

234
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,890
So I just wanted to make that a caveat, you know, based on what I'd like to say about it.

235
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,750
What is the meaning of life?

236
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:06,550
Well, I want to just tell you what I found out in terms of the summary.

237
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:17,250
If you look from a secular point of view, secular meaning scientific, mathematical, cultural, philosophical, even religious, yes, because religion is secular.

238
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:23,710
Most religions have nothing to do with the divine writing that they supposedly are subscribing to.

239
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:38,910
You will see there's been so much misery, strife through the ages, that the purpose of actually being here at this particular stage that we're in is to taste it.

240
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:43,130
There is absolutely nothing to learn from this experience.

241
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:47,910
And I know I might catch some flack from this, but there is nothing to learn.

242
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:57,630
There's nothing anymore to learn than if you've never had an apple before in your life, and you didn't know what it tasted like, and you tasted it, now you know what an apple tastes like.

243
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:05,190
What did you learn from that? Well, you learned that it does have taste, and it's a particular flavor that you can identify with an apple.

244
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,550
And that is the meaning of life at this point, where we are right now.

245
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:16,950
And I can gather this based on roughly 6,000 years of recorded history.

246
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:26,530
Well, that's a good pool of evidence, as opposed to mainstream science, which has a pool of evidence of, like, what?

247
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:35,010
A couple of dudes who invented some stuff and told everybody else what everything's about, and everybody else believed them because they were too stupid to disprove them.

248
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,990
What do you mean, in terms of the age of the universe and matter and planets and things like that?

249
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:58,910
Well, you know, I was more thinking about modern science and how, basically, if you have a look really deep into any scientific principle or mainline theory that everybody just kind of takes as an axiom and uses that as their scientific basis for their whole career and everything like that, like the Big Bang Theory.

250
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:01,850
Like, here's my summary of the Big Bang Theory.

251
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:03,110
I thought it was quite interesting.

252
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,050
Nothing exploded, and then suddenly there was everything.

253
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,590
That's the Big Bang Theory.

254
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,130
Right.

255
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,210
Nothing was there, and then nothing exploded.

256
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:12,970
Yeah.

257
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:24,710
Who was it, Mark Twain, who said that to say that everything that came from a random explosion is the same as saying that Webster's Dictionary is a result of an explosion in a printing factory?

258
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:26,010
Yeah.

259
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,170
You see, it doesn't make any sense.

260
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:41,730
We were talking about micro and macro, and I find that everything on a micro scale is exactly the same, like modeled on everything in the macro scale.

261
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:57,470
Like, I think they took a picture of the universe, or rather, and it kind of like was a sort of a cluster in the middle with sort of streamers sort of coming off of it, and then they took a picture of a human brain cell, and it's a cluster in the middle with streamers coming out of it.

262
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:08,270
So it's like the whole universe is just one other organism's, just one giant brain cell that we can only perceive, and it's all inside us, and it's all outside us at the same time.

263
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,470
Like, everything's built upon each other.

264
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,810
There's nothing that's disconnected.

265
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,170
Yes, exactly.

266
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,790
It's all connected, and there's many levels to it.

267
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:29,950
For example, when you look at all the divine texts of the world, the major ones would be the Koran, what they call the Bible, and say the Mahabharata or the Bhagavad Gita, which would be the Hindu text.

268
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:40,210
If you look at the storylines in there, and I mean the correct translation and interpretation, you'll see they are all in agreement.

269
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:46,350
But the actual religions that subscribe to these texts are not in agreement.

270
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:52,590
And when you approach any of their leaders, they'll say, well, you know, we don't go by the text, we go by tradition.

271
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,950
It's the same thing with the scientists.

272
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:04,670
I noticed on the chat, you know, you pointed out how they explained that nothing exploded and turned into, you see, that's how ridiculous they are.

273
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:11,270
But if you question the methodology, they'll say, well, who are you?

274
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,030
Where's your degree?

275
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:12,850
Where's your PhD?

276
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,170
So they could never directly address the information.

277
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:17,830
Well, you know what I'd do?

278
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,770
I'd tell them that my degree came out of nothing.

279
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,670
Yes, that's a good one.

280
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:37,590
One way to get people's molecules rearranged, let's say, is to just, I kind of do this sometimes, you always have to wonder what kind of shock value someone can handle.

281
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:45,210
But those that can handle, let's say, a medium shock value, I ask them, do you know what the most degrading thing you can do to anyone is, especially a child?

282
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,330
And they say, well, no, what's that?

283
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:48,650
It's to grade them.

284
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:55,490
Well, why is it to grade them and degrade them is the same thing, okay?

285
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,110
It's just different.

286
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,750
It's just different.

287
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:57,310
Wordplay.

288
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:04,770
Yeah, what it does is it paralyzes your ability to rationally think, and rational thinking is a whole other topic almost.

289
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:15,150
But you go into a learning environment, and they present to you that you will be graded based on your responses, based on how well you respond.

290
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:24,170
And now that's paralyzed your ability to rationally think, and now your incentive is operating under the threat of penalty.

291
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,230
Right?

292
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:33,210
So now you're operating under the threat of penalty instead of being inspired by doing the right thing.

293
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:42,690
So you've triggered, you know, how many children are growing up in a household, I can imagine, that say, mommy, daddy, why do I have to go do this?

294
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,550
Because if you don't do that, you're going to go to jail.

295
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,970
Or if you don't do this, you won't be able to get a job.

296
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,370
But they could never address the subject matter directly.

297
00:25:52,270 --> 00:26:01,270
And now we have a society, I'm using the corporate way, that you have a society on the planet right now that is motivated by penalty,

298
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:11,450
which has actually disabled certain functions that allow it to, for example, exercise critical thinking and develop it like a muscle.

299
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,210
Exercise objectivity.

300
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:21,870
Exercise a healthy emotional expression.

301
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:29,790
And you force them to go into a state of armoring, you know, an armored emotion where things are kept back because of fear of penalty.

302
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:36,670
You see, so the school, what they call the school system, the education system, this is really funny.

303
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:40,610
When you look at all departments of education, you know, on the surface of all the countries,

304
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:43,410
they're not formally known as a department of education.

305
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,550
They're always known as a department of public instruction.

306
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,090
So you will do what we say or else, right?

307
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:52,430
Yeah.

308
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:53,810
Yeah.

309
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:58,650
Because doing anything else is verboten.

310
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,300
Yeah.

311
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:09,180
There's an old saying, I think it was the Bolsheviks in Russia, when they would have their meetings,

312
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:19,320
and they said, everyone, once we install this new form of government, everyone will enjoy beef for dinner and strawberries for dessert every night.

313
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,320
And it sounded great to most of the people.

314
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,900
Someone in the back raised their hands and said, what if I want to eat beef or have strawberries for dessert?

315
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,000
They said, you will do what we tell you to do.

316
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:30,760
You see?

317
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,740
So it's very interesting.

318
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,700
The whole point of life is to not tell other people how to live theirs.

319
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,100
It's to allow them to live it the way that they want kind of thing.

320
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,900
And it's like everybody benefits when everybody's getting exactly what they want.

321
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:50,160
You know, it's called a reciprocal relationship with the universe, I think.

322
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,080
That's basically what it's supposed to be.

323
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:59,720
I mean, no star wanders around solar systems knocking out planets because he's jealous of their curvature or anything, does he?

324
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,420
Yeah, all the time.

325
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:07,000
Yeah, if you look at the scientific model, if you want to just look at that real quick,

326
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:12,780
you know, they show you a solar system with a thermonuclear sun in the middle and all the planets going around in needle elliptical orbits.

327
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,940
That is the same thing as saying the Earth is flat.

328
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,400
It just does not happen because this is a universe of scale, not of these discrete phenomenon.

329
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,140
I mean, have you ever seen anything orbiting anything else?

330
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:27,280
Actually, you look in your home or outside or talk to anyone that's seen anything orbiting?

331
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,000
It just doesn't happen.

332
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:32,280
Occasionally I have a cat orbiting me.

333
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,120
Well, it doesn't last very long and it's a temporary position.

334
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,260
So, you know, as we look at it, everything is a universe of scale.

335
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:44,280
I was on another show in American Freedom Radio giving more in-depth explanations.

336
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:53,580
For example, if you take, let's say, an atom, the smallest form of material that we can handle of hydrogen or carbon or iron or whatever,

337
00:28:53,580 --> 00:29:00,460
and you made it the size of the sun or the size of a planet, is it still, let's say, a hydrogen atom or is it a planet now?

338
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,580
And if you take a planet and shrink it down to the size of an atom, is it still a planet or is it an atom?

339
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:14,800
So the way we discern things is by its scale, its size, and where it is in the state of equilibrium.

340
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,680
It's because we want to define things.

341
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,420
We want to put things into boxes, categories, because that's the way we can make sense of them.

342
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:30,480
And what's interesting, though, is the more boxes and categories we try to arbitrarily put into things,

343
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:36,740
it actually limits our understanding because we're not actually in that box with it really looking at it,

344
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,840
really feeling it, really understanding it.

345
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:44,420
We're simply putting it on a shelf somewhere and ignoring it and saying, that's in that shelf, cool.

346
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,580
Yes, it is.

347
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,820
But the thing is, if one were to address the problem with the inhabitants on the Earth right now,

348
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,400
it would be something that would appeal to their direct intelligence.

349
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,880
And what I mean by that is also that everyone on this planet has the same intelligence.

350
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,660
The difference is their ability to perceive.

351
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,200
In other words, you can put 7 billion TV sets somewhere.

352
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,480
It's the ones that have the aerial antennas or hooked up to the cable, let's say,

353
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,900
that are going to get the best reception.

354
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:20,360
But if you hook them all up and allow them to flow, in other words, if they were properly connected,

355
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,440
they would all operate almost the same way.

356
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,140
So this whole idea of intelligence is flawed.

357
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,180
We all have the same intelligence.

358
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,720
In other words, if you go out and buy a computer that has a certain specification,

359
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,560
if there's another million of those computers with specific memory, let's say,

360
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,680
they will all operate pretty much the same.

361
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,300
The ability is, is it connected?

362
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,240
Is it able to process the information?

363
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,920
And do you have an operating system downloaded?

364
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,740
In other words, when you buy the machine, the computer that is, and connect it,

365
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,780
the initial prompting on the screen is,

366
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,940
well, before we perform any of these functions as advertised,

367
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,580
you need to download the operating system.

368
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,720
And just to go out on a limb,

369
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:10,800
the purpose of all of these divine scriptures of every culture in the world is that operating system.

370
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:18,300
These are aspects of law, aspects of history, aspects of science.

371
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,520
And when I say law, I don't mean traffic law.

372
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,360
I mean how to be a steward of this planet.

373
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:33,540
This triggers a remembrance in my mind of Sumerian culture.

374
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,820
And it was essentially like, almost like the Big Bang.

375
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,120
First there was nothing.

376
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,080
And then all of a sudden there was this really sophisticated culture with law,

377
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,680
mathematics, architecture, and philosophy, and all of this other stuff.

378
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,320
And it's like, where the heck did it come from?

379
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,220
Well, you have to look at, well, again, remember we said it's universe of scale.

380
00:31:56,540 --> 00:32:00,680
That culture on a global level is very much like the culture today.

381
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,060
People had free access to travel.

382
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:08,460
You'll find that people got around quite well throughout the entire planet back then.

383
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:15,840
And you will find, there's a couple of really good archaeologists out there that do cryptoarchaeology,

384
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:21,340
and they'll show that from that culture that you just mentioned, the Sumerian culture,

385
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,740
you'll find artifacts that they have all over the entire planet,

386
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:30,980
dating from that golden age, let's say, that you, I think, alluded to, all over the planet.

387
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,940
And it's just not disclosed.

388
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:36,160
And the same thing with the Greeks, the same thing with the Romans.

389
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,420
They were everywhere.

390
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,520
It's just history has changed.

391
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:43,280
I mean, look at how history has changed just in the past 10 years.

392
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,800
Give it a few thousand.

393
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:55,260
If you wanted to prove to people in, let's say, 10,000 years' time that you were here, right here, right now,

394
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:00,500
you'd have to go through a heck of a lot of effort to even build something that would even last that long,

395
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:11,940
let alone be able to be visible still, let alone actually be recognizable as something that was man-made, right?

396
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:17,000
At the moment, there's pyramids all over the world that don't look like pyramids.

397
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,500
They've been eroded and what have you, and people don't even recognize them as pyramids.

398
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,240
They just think they're big hills or whatever.

399
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,440
And then you take a look at them from aerial shots, and it's like, oh, my God.

400
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:33,300
That 900-foot hill comes down on all four sides in perfect angles,

401
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,000
and it's covered with bush and trees and all this sort of stuff,

402
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,820
and it's like in the middle of Yugoslavia or something.

403
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,580
Oh, my God.

404
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,440
Oh, my God.

405
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,300
That's a giant pyramid.

406
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,880
Somebody left that here, and not to mention they're all over the place.

407
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,700
So think about this.

408
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,820
If culture and that download, as you were talking about, had the capacity,

409
00:33:53,380 --> 00:34:01,500
would it even be able to be downloaded today from that technology being left behind?

410
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,620
I'm thinking of just an interesting question, and we'll come back to that after the break,

411
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:10,920
and we'll also bring you up through Skype, Greg, so you just hang on the line there.

412
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,480
And also we have a caller coming in, Cecilia from Montana,

413
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:20,260
and we will be getting to you just after the break in a few minutes.

414
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:25,199
Join us in the chat room, ladies and gentlemen, at TheVinnieEastwoodShow.com.

415

Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.

431
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:34,610
Welcome back to the show that's all about shining bright.

432
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:38,730
sending out these light ray thingies all the way through the universe we've got

433
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:44,430
our caller Cecilia in Montana I'll come to you in just a second I said something

434
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:48,670
over the break that I think was quite a good analogy and wanted to repeat I love

435
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:53,990
repeating my own analogies it's like let's say for example you're an

436
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:57,710
enlightened individual okay I'm not claiming that I am I'm not claiming that

437
00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:01,390
anybody else's or whatever it's all up to your perspective oh he's in like

438
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:06,550
doesn't matter okay if you want to spread knowledge okay let's say I'm

439
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:12,030
broadcasting from this radio station right here okay and you're listening to

440
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:18,010
this think about this I'm a Sun okay I'm the center of my own solar system

441
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:25,130
and I shine in every direction okay the vast majority of my light that goes out

442
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:31,790
will fall upon nothingness okay in other words deaf ears empty space okay

443
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:36,850
because space is cold it's 240 below zero or something like that

444
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:46,690
as a great tell me and the only time when that light or information is of any

445
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:54,810
use to anything is when it hits a planet ie you your mind or whatever and only

446
00:36:54,810 --> 00:37:00,950
the planets are capable of turning that light into heat and energy and actually

447
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:09,670
sustain life so if I give you information light and you receive it the

448
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:16,490
energy the heat and and everything like that you can then use it right but if I

449
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:21,130
was not shining there would be no possibility of anybody even a small

450
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:25,350
amount of planetoids within within my light radius would ever benefit from it

451
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:30,010
whatsoever and so that's what each and every single one of us is I think is our

452
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:35,990
own little Sun beaming out the light and the Enlightenment to other people trying

453
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:42,390
to you know keep them thinking and stay alive in the head and in the heart that

454
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:46,990
kind of thing at least that's how I look at it anyway I could be wrong so we've

455
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:53,310
got a caller now I want to go to her Cecilia in Montana you're on the air

456
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:58,190
hello Vinny great to talk to you man this is great that you're like 10,000

457
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:04,030
miles away and here I am way over here talking to you it's like your sunshine

458
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:10,330
is reaching 10,000 miles and remember that that star could be seen from light

459
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:15,790
years away it doesn't have to be that close right and then someone looking up

460
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:23,010
at that light from light years away it's a great conversation I really uh

461
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:28,770
that's why I called up but was thinking about like what you're talking the other

462
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:35,450
guest you have there uh was talking about the atom you know like the Sun

463
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:41,650
being an atom and you know and the atom looks like the solar system when you look

464
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:47,230
at it under a microscope and there's a out in the middle of the desert in Peru

465
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:54,810
there's a six mile by four miles spider that's made with rocks right only could

466
00:38:54,810 --> 00:39:00,270
be seen from like a thousand feet up in the air and the one leg and the one leg

467
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:07,070
on the spider is a little bit longer that it uses into in copulation with a

468
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:13,250
female spider but the only way that you know that you can know that that long leg

469
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:21,570
is used in copulation of that spider is under a microscope in a cave in this

470
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:29,410
spider is very very rare it only lives in caves deep under the ground and to

471
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:36,350
see this spider copulate you gotta see look under a microscope to observe that

472
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:42,930
one little longer leg on the right side in the same spot on the same spider

473
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:47,930
that's six miles big and four miles wide and you got to see it from a

474
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:53,130
thousand feet up just like if he was in a big giant microscope looking down and

475
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:56,290
this thing is something like 4,000 years old

476
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:06,450
hmm well it is like that and and it's and that's not the only site that

477
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:14,050
implies a tech hmm I think civilization took a long civilization took a long

478
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:20,050
turn I think we turned away from earth we think that we could create our own

479
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:25,950
existence we forgot the knowledge of nature just imagine the world we could

480
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:31,710
have a civilization joined with nature and I think you know there's a lot of

481
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:35,830
people across the earth now that realizes this you know and this is the

482
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:41,190
big tug-of-war I think you know the capitalists want to keep you know

483
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:45,410
everything working the way it is so they can make their money but the real

484
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:50,370
true capitalists that want to work with the earth and the technology together and

485
00:40:50,370 --> 00:40:55,070
make it work good for the people and forget about the profit of the

486
00:40:55,070 --> 00:41:00,410
capitalistic idea with the true capitalistic idea to get civilization

487
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:08,690
and nature working together we could do mind you know unthinkable things like

488
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:16,990
reaching them and start that shot and hearing you guys and ripples everywhere

489
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:21,910
and the ripples hit me and I love the show man and I just wanted to call in

490
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:29,630
hello we're very welcome so thank you for your call man and I also wanted to

491
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:36,010
ask you something I wanted to comment on the aspect that our first question

492
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:41,250
what's life's all about you know we live in this reality of the duality and that

493
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:48,790
brings choice we can't avoid it that's the free will and and we got the choice

494
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:54,410
to make the hate or to love and I think we're created to make that choice and

495
00:41:54,410 --> 00:42:00,670
create and I say choose well and create love that's what we're here for because

496
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:06,630
this world tries to kill our love tries to kill the love between human and earth

497
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:11,210
you know this civilization that took the wrong turn trying to kill our love for

498
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:17,490
the earth and civilization and and we got to make the choice and keep the love

499
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:23,150
alive and that's why we are here so keep the love alive life is short choose

500
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:30,350
well and and and choose man you know bring it alive love alive like the heart

501
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:35,910
song you know yeah well think about this you made an interesting point there about

502
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:41,810
our reality is duality and I find whenever you're basically if you've got

503
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:46,590
the right idea about something you go through you accomplish it and it gets

504
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:49,170
finished but if you got the wrong idea about something you have to keep

505
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:53,630
repeating it so reality of duality I translate that as redoality because

506
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:57,330
that's what we're doing most of the time in our society isn't it we're redoing

507
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:04,650
things that have already been done that have already failed and I think that

508
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,770
what's happening here is that we were talking about these ancient technologies

509
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:12,350
ancient civilizations and what-have-you maybe they got it all figured out and

510
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,030
they're all of them and maybe peace and harmony or whatever this is just my

511
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:20,050
theory I don't have any evidence to support it maybe but let's say they had

512
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:25,610
it all figured out and some psychopathic scumbaggery control freak manipulative

513
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:29,270
evil council not entirely dissimilar to the type we've got today with the

514
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:32,790
Bilderberg groups and Council on Foreign Relations in the Vatican and the City

515
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:36,650
of London and Washington DC and Barack Obama and all these kind of eclectic

516
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:41,790
filth kind of get together and they're like you know what everybody's peaceful

517
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:46,550
loving happy it means we don't have any control over them because they've

518
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:50,090
managed to maintain control of themselves they're actually have capable

519
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:56,990
of existing and they don't need us that that really ticks me off let's mess

520
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:02,630
everything up and start over from scratch let's let's redo it okay and

521
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:06,610
this time instead of everybody being peaceful happy enlightened and getting

522
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:11,570
along sweet as and all is a nut with us having no extra power over them we

523
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:16,150
want everybody to be fighting each other all day long every day of every

524
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:20,450
century and I want all of the power that would normally be given to them

525
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:26,830
through the sheer love and competence to be given and usurped to us that's what I

526
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:31,850
think happened okay oh might be sounds like the thinking of a psychopath to me

527
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:39,930
Greg any thoughts oh yeah I've got a couple of thoughts first of all the

528
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:46,370
caller spot-on on the type of thinking that I'm trying to impart here you see

529
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:51,730
the other thought on that is yeah you're pretty close to it but it is the picture

530
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:59,870
remember it works on on both sides in other words yeah well let's just say

531
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:06,010
we're in a vicious circle right now that is that is one state one way to look at

532
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:10,450
it that anything you try to do actually just feeds that same direction and until

533
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:17,090
that circle is broken there is no advancement and there with that circle

534
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:20,210
will be broken and there will be advancement and it's coming in the next

535
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:25,330
two decades let's say but again the caller I want to commend him on his

536
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:34,990
perspective that was really good okay well we're coming to a break now have

537
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:38,710
you got anything any final words of wisdom or shout outs that you want to

538
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:49,830
give this is here yep yeah I just want to say it's a great show I'm glad I

539
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:56,150
found you thanks thanks for letting me speak I'm glad you I'm glad you found us

540
00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:00,630
too man this is another thing this is the reason why the Vinny Eastwood social

541
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:03,770
network I think is gonna be really awesome because everybody who finds this

542
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:07,690
show really loves it because they like me they're real cool they like to have a

543
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:11,430
good time they're not they're not freaking stupid and they're not a

544
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:15,290
douchebag that's gonna screw you over or lie to you for personal gain if

545
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:18,930
anything your friends in the truth me or at least my friends in the truth

546
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:24,350
movement sacrifice almost as much for me as I do for them and that's I think the

547
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:28,650
way we should all really be living running our businesses running our lives

548
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:32,430
and running our families you've got to sacrifice for each other because you

549
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:36,970
find out that if it's all for one and one for all that bundle of sticks that

550
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:41,410
would snap individually is unbreakable you're listening to the Vinny Eastwood

551
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:45,330
show join us in the chat room at the Vinny Eastwood show doc calm the Greek

552
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:49,050
is my guest call another two one eight double three nine eighty five twenty five

553
00:47:55,580 --> 00:48:03,280
number two of the fastest two hours and talk radio it's the Vinny Eastwood show

554
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:09,520
broadcasting live on American freedom radio.com and incidentally the Vinny

555
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,860
Eastwood show.com and if you can't remember the Vinny Eastwood show.com

556
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:16,500
just remember Vinny with a Y because it's the most important question and

557
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:21,000
Eastwood like Clint the guy who got shot while he was wearing some kind of a

558
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,020
boiler thing around his chest and a fistful of dollars and he actually

559
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:28,780
wasn't shot okay Vinny Eastwood but he with a Y with an Eastwood like Clint Eastwood

560
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,660
pretty straightforward Google that you're a Muslim and you'll find the website

561
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:38,000
pretty easy all right so my very special guest today is probably one of the most

562
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,120
enlightened intelligent people that I've ever had call into the show and

563
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,720
that includes the the long list of incredible guests that we've had as well

564
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:54,860
the Greek and as expected phone lines are lighting up so we're going to go to the

565
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:59,080
first one here has been holding on for about six minutes Freema Freema are you

566
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:06,220
on are you there? How's it going Vinny? Somewhat fabulous yeah loving your show

567
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:12,660
man listen to you every day every day every day every day and I'm getting a

568
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:18,700
little upset with all the repeats but that's cool I guess I have to agree with

569
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:23,280
you on your guest man I listened to him the other night on Santos and I was

570
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:29,980
really impressed I have a question for the Greek here do you do you think that

571
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,600
there's any validity to the fact that some of these kids these days and maybe

572
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:40,880
us also when we were in you know public schools not soaking up so much of this

573
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:48,700
information because for some reason that we know that it's incorrect oh yeah oh

574
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:53,400
yeah you know you definitely know because this this thing we call

575
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:58,440
consciousness is something streaming in it's it's not it's it's not only

576
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:07,080
captured by us and processed by us but it's constantly streaming in yeah I kind

577
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,440
of felt that way some of us felt like we were kind of retarded in school and as

578
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:17,020
we got older you know that's funny that's funny yeah I feel I felt like I

579
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:20,080
was retarded in school but after I got out of school I realized it was

580
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:29,580
everybody else that was retarded it's great you know it wasn't until later on

581
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:33,940
in life when I got into you know hiring and firing positions in the high-tech

582
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:39,440
industry and stuff where I realized that you had you know kind of a one to twenty

583
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,740
ratio for people that were likely to end up getting it eventually what do you say

584
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:51,380
to that that's really really high I think it would be like maybe one out of two

585
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:56,120
hundred really really small really really really small but it's growing

586
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:02,820
just like anything else again it's it's a streaming that's coming in we're

587
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:07,360
receiving it but there's the thing is the is your antenna in the right position

588
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:12,180
which is I don't want to say right position because there is no real you

589
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:15,720
can't explain it temporarily but just to just to say what they're doing in the

590
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:20,020
schools again to be a harsh critic of it is they're getting you used to being

591
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:24,840
manipulated and just like any addict you always want to get your fix so now

592
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:28,680
you're they have a culture of people on the planet they're addicted to being

593
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:33,600
manipulated so they're looking for manipulation it's it's more specific

594
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:38,400
than that the CIA have done it done a lot of tests on mind control under MK

595
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:45,820
ultra and they found out that mind control is addictive yes and mind

596
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:49,680
control being let's say a form of manipulation with impulses like we were

597
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,960
talking about earlier you suspend one part of the mind and and make another

598
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:01,020
part of the mind more receptive see my perspective on on high school at the

599
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:06,060
very least was that it is in fact not entirely dissimilar from MK ultra in

600
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:14,460
which it is a trauma-based mind control program to produce agents for the system

601
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,680
yeah I agree yeah I got one going into high school this after the summer here

602
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,520
and it was my other kids that had to get to re-educate it when they got home from

603
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,880
the school every day and seemed like him at least with my kids that they're

604
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,380
getting a different perspective and I worked for the school district out here

605
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:40,900
in California for a couple years before I actually had to quit couldn't see

606
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:45,560
myself spending another 20 years in that system man I'm telling you you

607
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:50,100
actually working in the in the maintenance you know in facilities area

608
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:54,020
you're always in different rooms and stuff and you end up hearing some of the

609
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:58,160
shit these teachers are telling these kids and and the way they try to you

610
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,840
know feed them propaganda manipulate their thought processes just a crack up

611
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:07,180
especially to someone who's listening you know from the outside yeah well see

612
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:11,680
this is something that has occurred to me recently and every single time I say

613
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,640
it to other truth is they go yes yes oh my god it's a brilliant idea a truth of

614
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:21,400
high school okay you send your kid your history teacher teaches real history

615
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:25,440
your science teacher teaches real science your biology teacher teaches

616
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:32,820
real biology that kind of stuff we need the Greek teaching here from what I can

617
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:38,000
well he's the dig okay what difference does it make if you're in a lecture

618
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,960
theater with 300 other people and you've got one lecturer in the front of you in

619
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:46,280
university whereas you could have a couple hundred people on a Skype call

620
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:51,560
from home with the Greek talking to you as an audience what's the difference the

621
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:58,400
difference is it doesn't cost you $10,000 a year okay and you actually get

622
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,640
knowledge that's of some benefit and you don't have to leave home that I mean

623
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:08,440
the truth of school if we were to create it and I think we're working on a few

624
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,720
things in the background with a few other of my mates and everything like

625
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,520
that in order to get this off the ground but if we were to do it it would have to

626
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:21,020
be a completely and utterly digital online school okay so if your kids were

627
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:24,460
to come to the school and it would probably have to be 10 pages and and

628
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:27,700
what-have-you to teach the sort of sophisticated information we've got

629
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:33,740
they'd have to be doing it as a home school program but then again the state

630
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:37,580
mandates particular curriculums and things of that nature so it'd be

631
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:41,640
interesting to find out the inner workings of it and whether or not such a

632
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:46,700
school educating children about the truth as opposed to brainwashing them to

633
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:54,380
be slaves for the state would be illegal wouldn't it good it's made illegal or at

634
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:57,320
least that's my perspective anyway we're gonna get to our next caller now

635
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:02,500
Freeman do you have anything any final comments or words or shout outs no man

636
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:08,580
I'm gonna drop you an email when you get the social network going yeah yeah I'll

637
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:13,280
say everybody's just going on to a list and so once that list gets going kind of

638
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,800
a big packer or whatever and I've got a whole bunch of people from different

639
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:22,060
cities I'm gonna read out that list of cities on air and ask people within

640
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:27,600
those cities that do listen to the show to quickly email me and I'll forward

641
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,300
their emails on to the other people on the social network so that way you can

642
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:35,660
actually meet up kind of thing yeah maybe we can get together out here and

643
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:40,980
make some truth or music yeah man and and and now with the internet we don't

644
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:45,500
have to travel everywhere to make music do we not at all

645
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:50,940
sorry man you have a good weekend thanks for your call brother all right

646
00:55:50,940 --> 00:56:00,220
next caller now it's a new caller area code four five oh we're just gonna grab

647
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:08,620
your first name and what state are you calling from okay this is Johnny from

648
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:18,640
Montreal Canada all right welcome Johnny cool my French accent will come out so I

649
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:29,680
apologize but just as long as you don't reveal your croissant not from Paris but

650
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:37,800
I'm just calling about something you you touched on yesterday which is it would

651
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:45,000
be a good thing to take a break from all those magnificent Brutus Brutus shows

652
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,960
because it could get you down because I'm telling you if you saw my Facebook

653
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:57,680
page it's that's the only thing I do I mean is I give out information that's

654
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:04,600
been given to me which I double-check and triple-check it could be through you

655
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:12,140
through Alex Jones to Jack blood or whatever and I'm kind of I don't know

656
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:17,560
hooked on it and and demoralized also because I'm you know I'm 28 years old

657
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:25,000
I'm an eligible bachelor and I I don't even feel like getting a new girlfriend

658
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:32,380
or going back to the gym I'm not doing a hunger strike or whatever to not to

659
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:39,280
intake care what Bill Gates wants to give to me to eat but then again I guess

660
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:45,600
taking a break would be a good thing so that's what I wanted to call about and

661
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:53,880
get your take on it well let me ask you something any job you've ever had it's

662
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,420
work isn't it okay you're sitting there you're doing something regardless of

663
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:04,820
whether it's pushing papers marking a kids or grading children at school as the

664
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:10,080
Greg would like to say or anything of that nature it's still a job okay being

665
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:16,580
a truther being a patriot is a job but unlike normal employment there is duty

666
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:22,200
that forced you into that job okay you had the realization that oh my god

667
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:27,320
there's scumbaggery everywhere and nobody else is gonna solve this problem for me

668
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:32,480
I have to solve it right now that's a lot of personal responsibility to take on

669
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,500
your shoulders for something that ain't your fault you and I didn't set up this

670
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:41,800
system did we Jeremy no and you and I alone are not going to be able to

671
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:49,880
overthrow this system and so what it is I feel is a balance okay anytime you go

672
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:55,420
to work you take a weekend off but if you're if your work is being a truther

673
00:58:55,420 --> 00:59:00,100
your work is at home and on the weekends you're still working aren't you so you

674
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:05,100
don't have a chance to give your brain time to rest or your heart time to slow

675
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:10,860
down and and things like that balance I believe is the ability to go from either

676
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:15,860
extreme and then come back to the center again so you can be extremely into the

677
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:22,560
truth movement and then go offline for a week or two and have some time off meet

678
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:27,020
your family have dinner and and watch some movies or anything you want to do

679
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:31,520
to relax and recharge your batteries and then you come back and you realize

680
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:37,860
that you're far more energized far more capable of doing even more work because

681
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:43,220
you took care of yourself right because we understand that there's a time

682
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:47,960
pressure here that the new world has got a timeline we feel that oh my god we

683
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,340
have to do everything now now now now now now but but they're working with a

684
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:55,400
massive apparatus they got lots of people who work and shifts they sleep

685
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:00,620
and stuff like that if we subtract our sleep in order to try and compete with

686
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:06,060
somebody who is then we're gonna burn out faster than they will won't we so we

687
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:10,040
have to learn how to take care of ourselves otherwise if you can't take

688
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:18,650
care of yourself how on earth are you gonna protect anybody else true but how

689
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:31,430
can I mean do you actually have hope that we're gonna see 2013 or 2014 or are

690
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:37,170
we gonna be is is the nuclear reactor number four gonna melt down totally and

691
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:44,570
we're gonna North America's gonna be on the inhibitor both what's what you can

692
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:51,410
in front of you and you can only make decisions based upon the exact reality

693
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:54,510
in front of you that you were forced to deal with like those are the only times

694
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:58,670
when you can actually do it like let's say for instance somebody tells you ten

695
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:04,250
years ago that in ten years time you're going to be hit by a car now does that

696
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:08,450
mean you worry about being hit by a car for a whole ten years or does that mean

697
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:12,450
that you perfectly fine and happy for nine and a half years and then about

698
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:15,670
half year leading into it you kind of think I'm gonna be a little bit more

699
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:23,190
cautious around cars I think right so you put yourself under undue stress by

700
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:26,850
reacting to things that aren't actually right there in front of you like the

701
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:32,650
Fukushima radiation thing it's an invisible menace and it's on top of

702
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:37,410
everybody right now so that means that there are currently probably radioactive

703
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:42,070
iodine particles in my thyroid glands in yours and it's and it's slowly sitting

704
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:46,770
there causing cancer so that's a very real reality so we can react to that

705
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:51,570
how do you react to detox your body from radiation well one of the most

706
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:58,310
efficient substances is marijuana marijuana is a incredible detoxifier for

707
01:01:58,310 --> 01:02:02,450
radiation and in fact to the point where you can you can plant entire hemp fields

708
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:07,890
on radioactive soil and they will absorb the radioactivity into the plant matter

709
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:14,670
okay and then but you're not talking about smoking some joints like you're

710
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:19,610
talking about hemp oil yeah well no hemp oil smoking joints or all of that kind

711
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:23,390
of stuff it all it all works well and biochemical level does the same thing

712
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:28,190
because the human body is essentially an upside-down plant your brain is where

713
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:33,750
the is where the roots of that plant are and when you let's say you take that

714
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:38,490
analogy of the hemp plant that has its roots in the soil and it detoxifies takes

715
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:45,510
all the radiation out your brain is up here and the hemp will take or again all

716
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:51,010
those toxins out of that root system and on top of that there is do you like do

717
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:56,190
you like Indian food curry sorry on occasions do you like it to eat

718
01:02:56,190 --> 01:03:05,770
no no all right well anyway for those who do who are you listening there's an

719
01:03:05,770 --> 01:03:11,670
interesting herb called a turmeric it's a very very common spice that's used in

720
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:16,430
curries all over the place very good for getting rid of radiation if you like

721
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:28,590
oh yeah so it's really good and and also turmeric is very good for any wounds

722
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:32,310
you might have muscle bruising things like that mix it with a little bit of

723
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:36,050
water turn it into a paste and then if you got like a sprained ankle or

724
01:03:36,050 --> 01:03:40,550
something like that rub it on and put a bandage over it and your foot will be

725
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:44,610
healed probably by morning and it does the same thing to your body detoxifies

726
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:49,390
it from radiation and it also gives you a better almost it gives you the

727
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:53,330
ability to manufacture more endorphins you know that kind of love drug that

728
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:58,410
makes you feel happy within your body there's also rosemary rosemary is really

729
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:06,990
good for getting rid of radiation ginger and garlic and ginkgo leaf ginkgo leaf

730
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:11,190
is very interesting there's only one type of plant that now grows near

731
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:19,350
Chernobyl the ginkgo tree everything else died isn't it interesting and this

732
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:24,230
stuff can detoxify the heck out of you so there's a reality and there's some

733
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:29,230
simple solutions and those solutions are all around you but if you worry about

734
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:33,450
the reality that you have to deal with instead of looking at the solutions to

735
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:38,490
those problems the problem seems much bigger than they actually are getting

736
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:43,110
rid of radiation and not dying is a lot easier than one would think and a lot

737
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:47,250
less stressful than we make it you listen to the Vinnie Eastwood show we'll

738
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,190
be right back after the break at the Vinnie Eastwood show dot-com

739
01:04:54,070 --> 01:05:03,190
I'm gathering people wherever you roam and admit that the waters around you have

740
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:08,050
grown and accepted that soon you'll be drenched to the bone

741
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:17,290
if your time deal is worth saving then you better start swimming or you'll sink

742
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:18,610
like a stone

743
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:35,130
oh yeah times are changing it's and it's it's funny there because it's the

744
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:40,950
only constant in the universe we're talking over the break about memory and

745
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:47,330
the Greeks got a memory problem he remembers everything it's photographic

746
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:51,610
okay it's all a real vivid living quality and all of that sort of stuff

747
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:59,050
and most people are either a one out of focus and so whatever they do remember

748
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:05,910
it's kind of blurry and fuzzy or the aperture is not open enough and they

749
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:13,610
cannot see at all just think about that for a moment ladies and gentlemen about

750
01:06:13,610 --> 01:06:19,270
capturing what you see and just how important it might wind up being trust

751
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:23,950
me little bits of information here and there can be very very very interesting

752
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:28,750
and if you actually instead of just listen to it and think about it and and

753
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:34,730
digest it and swallow it and actually use that information go out and make

754
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:40,130
something happen with it you're unstoppable there's a lot of knowledge

755
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:44,730
out there a lot of knowledge a lot of it's very useful some of it not so

756
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:50,630
useful my knowledge of the who's the Republican candidates and what have you

757
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:58,510
that's not useful information that's a waste of time Joe in LA calling in

758
01:06:58,510 --> 01:07:14,790
what's up man real nice nice yeah absolutely yeah I was listening your

759
01:07:14,790 --> 01:07:21,010
comment you know about losing hope and stuff like that but don't lose hope man

760
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:26,810
cuz my hope I told any before comes from people like yourself and people like

761
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:32,850
Vinny who take the time to spread the information that's vital you know for

762
01:07:32,850 --> 01:07:37,730
humanity and for our friends and family I have a girlfriend for about two years

763
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:42,330
we're going to celebrate our two-year anniversary she's a non-truther she

764
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:45,590
doesn't really like to talk about a lot of stuff that I talked to her about

765
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:52,710
because it kind of depressing to her but I would suggest you know just have fun

766
01:07:52,710 --> 01:07:57,570
whenever you can take some time away from the movement go out and date lots

767
01:07:57,570 --> 01:08:02,330
of girls and meanwhile you know you still do what you're doing and with

768
01:08:02,330 --> 01:08:06,130
your Facebook friends I'm the same way I almost my posting all about truth I've

769
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:11,050
taken about two months off of Facebook and don't want to overwhelm my friends

770
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:15,950
but at the same time I'm reinvigorated reinvigorated I'm gonna go back on

771
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:20,729
there and in two months worth of stuff that's been on the news I'm sure some

772
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:26,350
of the people that have been warning now are going to be probably listening a

773
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:29,310
little bit more since they see stuff on the news that's happening with the

774
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:33,109
drones and with the bottling of for the women and children in American airports

775
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:40,250
so just hang in there bro and don't don't lose hope man because I could say

776
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:46,410
15 years ago the movement was not even a fraction of what it is today I meet

777
01:08:46,410 --> 01:08:49,750
people on the streets and it's just amazing sometimes they already know

778
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:56,109
what's going on and I think we we've already hit the 100th monkey and we're

779
01:08:56,109 --> 01:09:01,450
about to the third world order there they're scared they know that we were on

780
01:09:01,450 --> 01:09:04,510
to them and they're trying to figure out what what what their next move is going

781
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:09,250
to be but I keep spreading a word man and have fun as much as you can and try

782
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:16,410
to enjoy life as much as possible well that's that's sage advice and I follow

783
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:21,930
that advice to the letter every day I'm constantly attempting to amuse myself I

784
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:26,810
mean why do you think I deliver so many lame puns on this show because they

785
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:31,810
amuse me they may really tick people off that are listening in and what have you

786
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:37,430
but it amuses me so I do it and I'm acting under the assumption though that

787
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:41,310
it's the older people in the truth movement you're talking about how the

788
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:44,689
truth movement 10 15 years ago used to be a fraction well imagine somebody like

789
01:09:44,689 --> 01:09:48,770
let's say who am I looking at on my desktop here G Edward Griffin I got a

790
01:09:48,770 --> 01:09:52,410
picture of G Edward Griffin there and he'd been in the movement for like what 60

791
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:56,450
years something like that plus and yeah I mean doing all this hard-out work

792
01:09:56,450 --> 01:10:02,370
exposing scumbaggery like to the ninth degree and the Quigley formula and or and

793
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:08,270
and and the creature from Jekyll Island and I asked him you know what's kind of

794
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:12,790
going on with this thing here how can you see us coming through I mean I'm young

795
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:17,170
I'm energetic I want to see everything happen now and he says well you know

796
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:21,870
when I was young and energetic and I wanted to see happen now I realized

797
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:26,450
something very important that the world doesn't move as fast as I want it to but

798
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:32,610
it does move what you got to do is instead of looking for exactly what you

799
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:39,550
want to see you look for the signs of what you want to see coming about all

800
01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:44,910
right so if you want to have a look and and and be hopeful about the truth

801
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:49,330
movements and everything like that you need only look at your window you need

802
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:56,050
only tune in to radio we are everywhere now absolutely the same gentleman you

803
01:10:56,050 --> 01:11:02,010
mentioned he he said it's taking the new world order a hundred years to put their

804
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:07,390
plan in motion least here in the United States of America and it's gonna take a

805
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:13,470
process of those of us who are aware to take back take back those chiefs of

806
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:19,730
power by running for office by becoming teachers by simply just speaking to

807
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:24,450
people and educated people around us and that's what's happening I could see it

808
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:29,270
happening even inside inside the Ron Paul movement with regard to what's

809
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:34,050
happening this week and a lot of states a lot of Ron Paul people are trying to

810
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:37,370
make a change from the inside I'm kind of losing hope as far as trying to

811
01:11:37,370 --> 01:11:41,510
change establishment I'm almost on the point of preparing myself anarchist but

812
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:48,090
you know look for the signs is there any sign that the establishment has learned

813
01:11:48,090 --> 01:12:12,110
its lesson and is changing itself no just think about this instead okay we

814
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:18,570
are the establishment now do you see us improving growing taking more control

815
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:26,850
becoming more visible becoming stronger yes in every single direction we are

816
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:31,050
taking over we are expanding every single corporation out there that works

817
01:12:31,050 --> 01:12:35,310
for the new world order has truth is working for them now people who were

818
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:42,470
working there quietly happily slaving away and some truth just wouldn't let

819
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:53,790
them go and I'm just like take the DVD take the DVD we're so persistent and

820
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:57,310
that's what I like about people who have truth on their side versus those who

821
01:12:57,310 --> 01:13:02,110
have eyes on their side those who have lies basically have an ideology built

822
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:07,410
upon sand and and it's very easy to tip those little houses over they have to

823
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:12,030
they have to say a thousand lies before somebody will believe it but somebody

824
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:18,110
with the truth can only say it once and it'll bowl that house of cards full of

825
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:27,510
BS and this is what is I find very encouraging ultimately is that they

826
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:33,170
have to try literally a thousand times as hard to be half as effective as all

827
01:13:33,170 --> 01:13:38,250
of us because we're too many okay and I think that's why ultimately they want to

828
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:46,030
get rid of us all yeah I agree I think there's nothing more gratifying than

829
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:50,970
seeing the look on her face especially when you show the YouTube videos of

830
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:58,290
activists going and throwing a wrench into the machine on my television on the

831
01:13:58,290 --> 01:14:05,370
radio and it's hilarious because like you said we're we're in there we have

832
01:14:05,370 --> 01:14:09,470
moles everywhere we have people who are we're converting the mind even of those

833
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:13,490
who consider themselves part of the establishment because they realize that

834
01:14:13,490 --> 01:14:18,590
their families are on the line as well so anyways Vinny and your guests my break

835
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:27,150
is over I usually call during work so I actually call during a break thanks for

836
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:32,810
the call another mole in the new world order system working away there all

837
01:14:32,810 --> 01:14:41,530
right yeah yeah I love slavery it's good okay now we don't have any more callers

838
01:14:41,530 --> 01:14:46,710
at this particular moment so one thing I wanted to ask you Greg I mean people

839
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:53,530
people keep asking me this question what gives you hope oh that's a really good

840
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:59,950
question and that's all I try to spread but it's it's it's more of it's not what

841
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:05,470
they think when I try to tell them what to have hope for and what one quick way

842
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:10,570
to look at it is if you look at a body of information that's been always right in

843
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:17,470
the past I mean spot-on in thousands of details you can pretty much count on it

844
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:23,130
being right about what it has to say about the future and that is the hope

845
01:15:23,130 --> 01:15:30,130
that I'm that I'm referring to the problem with actually myself explaining

846
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:36,250
in shorthand where that hope actually lies is is difficult with most people

847
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:42,330
because it's based on their concept of time their concept of where they are and

848
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:47,930
the dominating primary forces and I believe once before we did discuss time

849
01:15:47,930 --> 01:15:53,470
but the current time the way that people view time is completely engineered and

850
01:15:53,470 --> 01:15:59,430
completely artificial yet a quick definition of time time is nothing more

851
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:05,590
than the recordation of events in in terms of the way we look at it in the

852
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:12,190
way we communicate and in the aspect of where we are in our existence if you

853
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:15,970
look at certain ancient bodies of knowledge they're called scriptures in

854
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:20,890
many part of the world they've been a hundred percent spot-on about events that

855
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:24,550
happened in the past and they're a hundred percent spot-on of events to

856
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:30,470
happen in the future the problem is we have like you mentioned the out-of-focus

857
01:16:31,730 --> 01:16:34,870
everyone says well that's your interpretation everyone has an

858
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:38,990
interpretation but if you look at that word interpretation very carefully it

859
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:43,790
must be precise just like an ambassador who takes an interpreter with them you

860
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:48,290
know that interpreter must be precise it's not an opinion or a version it must

861
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:52,330
be precise so if we look at the ancient wisdom and what is coming upon us based

862
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:58,210
on a true measurement of time there's tremendous hope after this period and

863
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:01,990
one way to explain it is if you want to do a two-hour movie do you buy exactly

864
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:05,590
two hours of film or do you get a little extra film because you have to roll the

865
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:10,990
credits in the end we are in the credit part of this existence right now the

866
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:14,830
time ended let me just put it secularly I'll just get to the point time already

867
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:21,310
ended in 1998 the fall of 1998 you are in the credits part of the movie so you

868
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:25,650
have a movie here that's several millet many millennia long and the credits are

869
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:31,010
going to be rolling Oh roughly 30 to 45 years so you're you could judge based on

870
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:38,350
1998 coming on there is no such thing as 2012 or 1998 for that matter but I'm

871
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:42,270
just giving you a reference point kind of like converting inches to meters right

872
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:50,510
like you know for example yeah you see the real quick you know the the we this

873
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:56,810
they're teaching that is a heliocentric universe but from the earth it's a

874
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:59,630
geocentric in other words we see the Sun going around the earth from this

875
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:03,570
perspective and we see the stars in certain positions we're supposed to keep

876
01:18:04,170 --> 01:18:08,350
record events with these precise instruments you know the day starts at

877
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:14,790
noon it doesn't start at midnight you see so that just changes things pretty

878
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:19,970
radically and your month starts with the moon and not the new moon the dark moon

879
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:23,590
but the full moon because the full moon rises in the east just like the Sun and

880
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:27,850
they're both exactly the same diameter and they switch places according to the

881
01:18:27,850 --> 01:18:33,130
seasons so when you read ancient documents you won't find September or

882
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:39,870
October or November or December those are prefixes for September October November

883
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:46,590
December you see because September means 7 October means 8 November means 9 and

884
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:58,270
12 November as 11 when it really means 9 is 10 when it really means 8 you see so

885
01:18:58,270 --> 01:19:02,230
it's all right in front of us you know are we gonna grab it and go or are we

886
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:10,370
gonna just leave it alone and let someone else deal with it now also I

887
01:19:10,370 --> 01:19:14,730
find I was talking before about how I'm kind of like my own amusement generator

888
01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:20,490
right well we also all have to understand that we are also our own hope generators

889
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:25,670
okay because you know what gives you hope either a one seeing something done

890
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:31,370
that gives you hope or doing something that gives you hope okay like let's say

891
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:35,850
for example if you never see anybody ambushing your politicians or your

892
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:40,410
corrupt scumbaggery in your particular town right and then you go out with a

893
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:44,930
camera you know what I'm gonna expose the scumbaggery myself and you do it you

894
01:19:44,930 --> 01:19:50,330
upload it and not only have you given yourself hope self-positive reinforcement

895
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:55,450
but every single person who watches that video also gets to share in that hope

896
01:19:55,450 --> 01:20:00,770
okay it's not difficult to generate it and it goes back to that old adage man

897
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:06,270
the only thing that is necessary for evil to succeed is for good men to do

898
01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:11,870
nothing okay trust me ladies and gentlemen doing nothing is real easy can

899
01:20:11,870 --> 01:20:18,430
you name me one easy road that leads to a good place no the good places are

900
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:27,170
always at the end of very long hard roads and you best be understanding of

901
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:35,550
that because the journey is what strengthens you is what builds you is

902
01:20:35,550 --> 01:20:42,710
what makes you into who you are if you want to get from point A to point B what

903
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:49,410
is there in between is that connection between me thinking about something and

904
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:54,930
doing something the most important part okay the original concept doesn't matter

905
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:59,930
the action itself doesn't matter but when you bring them together when you

906
01:20:59,930 --> 01:21:04,770
think and then you act you create something that didn't previously exist

907
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:12,110
that's what gives you hope creating something real via your own actions or

908
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:17,050
seeing somebody else do it and then that inspires you to do it yourself okay

909
01:21:17,050 --> 01:21:21,030
it's real simple and I inspire myself every day

910
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:45,200
oh

911
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:10,960
welcome back ladies and gentlemen to the most operatic two hours in talk radio

912
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:22,840
broadcasting live on American freedom radio.com and incidentally the Vinnie

913
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:30,880
Eastwood show.com and now what was I talking to oh yeah yesterday after the

914
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:35,320
show had a Skype chat with a couple of the listeners and supporters and stuff

915
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:40,680
I think there was only like three of us there but we talked for like over

916
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:44,140
an hour and a half or something like that and and I liked it I like being

917
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:47,320
able to actually talk to the listeners you know just not be on air and nobody's

918
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:50,740
got any pressure there's no FCC regulations and they can ask me just

919
01:22:50,740 --> 01:22:55,300
questions direct it's just a part of a discussion so I feel like doing that

920
01:22:55,300 --> 01:23:00,800
again today so if you want to have a Skype chat with me and and some of the

921
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:04,180
other listeners or whatever that are in the chat room just go to the chat room

922
01:23:04,180 --> 01:23:09,800
at the Vinnie Eastwood show.com and we'll give you the other Skype details

923
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:17,000
and and and all of that stuff there so just pop your Skype name in and I will

924
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,760
add you and then we'll have a convo after the show the Greek is my very

925
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:30,740
special guest and always awesome final segment here for final words of wisdom

926
01:23:30,740 --> 01:23:35,840
the things that that really give us hope essentially I think I think that's what

927
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:40,920
a lot of truthers have been asking me predominantly lately they seem they seem

928
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:46,580
to ask me all the time about what gives me hope what encourages me or do I see

929
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:52,760
us winning or any stuff like that and I always give a really positive response

930
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:56,220
I'm very interested to know what the Greeks response to that kind of

931
01:23:56,220 --> 01:24:00,200
questioning would be oh yeah yeah it's not a simple one but I could give you a

932
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:06,380
roundabout way that'll maybe convey what one approach let's say first of

933
01:24:06,380 --> 01:24:10,520
all most people on this planet are living in an engineered reality what what

934
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:14,100
I mean by that is what they think they know doesn't even exist but they've been

935
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:19,080
sort of convinced that it does through the trickery of some sort of perception

936
01:24:19,080 --> 01:24:24,160
of the senses and just they're either the level of apathy that's been instilled

937
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:31,580
or just ignorance of what is really going on once that once someone is

938
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:36,980
living in this engineered reality right and there's many many examples you've

939
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:43,180
given through the years as well whatever hope springs from that is is quickly

940
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:47,680
changed and and it becomes nothing more than hearsay rumor or gossip and you're

941
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:51,420
you're on this roller coaster you know we they promised us this and see it didn't

942
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:56,620
come and he promised us that it didn't come so the way we're what real hope is

943
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:04,400
the one way that I would convey it is to get your feet firmly planted on the

944
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:08,620
ground you know how many times do people you know just well here especially what

945
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:13,380
they call the the former US of a that someone asks you you know you ask them

946
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:16,140
you know how are you and then they say well I'm hanging in there and I say well

947
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:21,100
I like to have my feet on the ground so it just starts with the way you you think

948
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:26,560
the language that you use the next thing is can you start using objectivity to cut

949
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:33,940
through the information you're receiving and look at the sources objectively and

950
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:41,200
then start formulating a base of knowledge based on objectivity that would

951
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:47,920
be one approach and the other thing I would just I would say is is there are

952
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:52,020
three important things were the most important things to maintain a physical

953
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:58,500
body would be food clothing shelter right food clothing shelter so are you

954
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:03,900
optimizing your food are you optimizing your clothing and are you optimizing

955
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:07,860
your shelter your dwelling place and that would be a really good place to

956
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:12,020
start it and where you can actually see results and then you will build up the

957
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:16,840
hope and then you can ask anyone hey how is your hope going today you know great

958
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:21,760
man I found this out try that great you see it's not just a single thing we call

959
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:26,320
hope that we could just put up a banner and that's been done before no pun

960
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:33,710
intended but so that's just a quick roundabout way you see it's it's food

961
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:38,130
clothing shelter for the physical aspect and for the mental aspect are you being

962
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:42,690
objective or are you falling for a perceived engineered reality that's just

963
01:26:42,690 --> 01:26:46,970
doesn't just doesn't exist and one way to explain that would be do as I say not

964
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:51,310
as I do right like you turn on the mainstream media everything's getting

965
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:54,450
better and you just you know turn off the TV look outside and everyone's

966
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:58,390
frowning and things are not getting better shops are closing you know people

967
01:26:58,390 --> 01:27:04,390
are sicker and fatter and dumber and you know so which one is it mmm well I love

968
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:09,490
that I love that phrase I do as I say not as I do because I remember what was

969
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:15,950
it I was on Waiheke Island this one time and one of my mom's friends Gary he gets

970
01:27:15,950 --> 01:27:21,610
out of the he gets out of the truck and he's going in to get a video and he took

971
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:26,770
and he tells us don't drive drunk boys and then as he gets back into the truck

972
01:27:26,770 --> 01:27:33,350
after after getting his video he pulls a bottle of scotch out of it and takes a

973
01:27:33,350 --> 01:27:37,410
sip and puts it back in the truck and he comes over to talk to us and he says do

974
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:44,350
as I say not as I do it's just great and it goes to show you that we're all

975
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:51,410
individuals right and drugs information love anger fear they all

976
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:56,990
react to different people differently because we're all snowflakes in a sense

977
01:27:56,990 --> 01:28:04,230
aren't we like that yeah and here's the interesting part you see the once we

978
01:28:04,230 --> 01:28:09,650
acknowledge this is on the subject of individuality that we are all are really

979
01:28:09,650 --> 01:28:15,870
the same that's when the true individuality or the discrete benefit of

980
01:28:15,870 --> 01:28:21,070
everyone sharing what they have will come forth you see when you force the

981
01:28:21,070 --> 01:28:26,630
issue that we're all different and that you I mean when that's taught like for

982
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:30,610
example the the they teach competition is good but they never use the word

983
01:28:30,610 --> 01:28:35,930
cooperation and when you look at when you look at the actual power base there

984
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:39,730
is no competition amongst them they're all cooperating but when they appear

985
01:28:39,730 --> 01:28:44,110
they appear to be competing so they they never teach cooperation they teach

986
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:48,370
competition and if you go let's say the the finest restaurants are always in

987
01:28:48,370 --> 01:28:51,070
what's called a restaurant district they're all right next to each other

988
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:54,310
they're not competing the finest clothing you find in the garment

989
01:28:54,310 --> 01:29:03,290
districts you see you see they all group together so do you you know it does that

990
01:29:03,290 --> 01:29:08,370
mean that this right here like an American Freedom Radio is part of the

991
01:29:08,370 --> 01:29:12,810
truth district right and instead of having physical districts and outlet

992
01:29:12,810 --> 01:29:18,690
shops and things of that nature we now have digital districts and what it does

993
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:24,490
is it allows people to shop for the finest information from from the home

994
01:29:24,490 --> 01:29:30,050
essentially what it does is it brings the finest products within your reach

995
01:29:30,770 --> 01:29:35,830
yeah it allows each one to excel and what they know and what they like to do

996
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:42,670
best and they don't feel hindered impaired or intimidated by someone else

997
01:29:42,670 --> 01:29:47,130
in the same exact field right next to them who is also doing what they find

998
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:54,570
their best at doing it's working together it's the opposite what is the

999
01:29:54,570 --> 01:30:00,150
opposite of something it can't be nothing no it can't be nothing it has to

1000
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:03,130
be something else that allows equilibrium to happen right because

1001
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:07,850
everything is moving and everything has a sense of opposition and attraction

1002
01:30:07,850 --> 01:30:14,490
well it's true nothing can't oppose something correct because nothing's

1003
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:22,770
nothing doesn't exist correct so the the the so the whole concept of of the way

1004
01:30:22,770 --> 01:30:29,290
we view things is is very simple is if we don't know of certain process what we're

1005
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:35,030
being told to do is correct or not how long do you have to observe its reaction

1006
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:39,550
whether it's beneficial or not beneficial to say hey stop we can't we

1007
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:43,470
shouldn't do things that way well I think it's about it's about you know

1008
01:30:43,470 --> 01:30:47,690
we're all searching for knowledge or whatever I'm starting to think that it's

1009
01:30:47,690 --> 01:30:52,010
it's not so much about searching for knowledge anymore it's about accepting

1010
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:56,610
it's about accepting the realities like let's say for example you wanted to go

1011
01:30:56,610 --> 01:31:01,250
and accomplish something like I want to go be awesome the way to become awesome

1012
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:06,770
is not to go and try and be awesome it's just to realize and accept that you

1013
01:31:06,770 --> 01:31:11,610
already are and you don't actually have to work that hard to be it and that

1014
01:31:11,610 --> 01:31:16,670
satisfaction really allows the awesomeness of Vinny Eastwood to come on

1015
01:31:16,670 --> 01:31:23,010
through absolutely and it's like that with everyone Vinny if you have an

1016
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:27,050
inspiration when I say inspiration see all things come from inspiration it's a

1017
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:31,970
feeling it's it's an and who and everyone's experienced at one point or

1018
01:31:31,970 --> 01:31:40,990
Dix some experience it more or less than others what we have you see such we've

1019
01:31:40,990 --> 01:31:47,090
got limited experience limited time but we've got infinite consciousness so

1020
01:31:47,090 --> 01:31:52,410
we've got infinite ability to explore okay it's kind of like wealth you can't

1021
01:31:52,410 --> 01:31:56,190
take it with you it only benefits you while you're still alive and that's what

1022
01:31:56,190 --> 01:32:02,510
knowledge does as well and just like wealth you can allow other people in

1023
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:08,070
your descendants to inherit it and I think that's probably a good spot to

1024
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:12,330
leave it Greg we are come to the end of the show thank you so much for coming on

1025
01:32:12,330 --> 01:32:16,210
for a full two hours it's been great man brilliant thanks very much man it's been

1026
01:32:16,210 --> 01:32:21,550
a privilege to be here thank you hmm and some people are asking are you ever

1027
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:25,890
gonna get a website together because a lot of people were starting to ask me a

1028
01:32:25,890 --> 01:32:29,930
little bit about you as well yes yes I will but not now it's all about timing

1029
01:32:29,930 --> 01:32:34,150
though the right information at the right time and right now we'll just

1030
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:38,430
trek along like this but you'll be one of the first to know thank you all right

1031
01:32:38,430 --> 01:32:43,150
well ladies and gentlemen best-case scenario you can hope for you can go to

1032
01:32:43,150 --> 01:32:48,950
the Vinny Eastwood show.com and up the very top there of the website there'll

1033
01:32:48,950 --> 01:32:53,110
be a little bar called featured interviews and the very first time I had

1034
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:57,830
the Greek call in was after I interviewed George Norie so it's the

1035
01:32:57,830 --> 01:33:02,730
very top interview on that featured interviews page is me interviewing George

1036
01:33:02,730 --> 01:33:06,370
Norie and then the Greek calling in for about 40 minutes so there's some other

1037
01:33:06,370 --> 01:33:11,470
content there and so yeah I mean that's best I could do for you and and now we're

1038
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:16,030
gonna have another archive and we're gonna have it on YouTube so when your

1039
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:19,690
website is up and running Greek you'll have plenty of content to put on there

1040
01:33:19,690 --> 01:33:23,130
you'll see the Vinny Eastwood show ladies and gentlemen and we'll see you

1041
