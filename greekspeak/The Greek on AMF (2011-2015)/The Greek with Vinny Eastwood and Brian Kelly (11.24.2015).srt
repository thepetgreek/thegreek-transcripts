1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,560
Oh, I got a love that keeps me waiting.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:12,300
Oh, I got a love that keeps me waiting.

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,760
I'm a lonely boy.

4
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,990
Hey, could I come again, please?

5
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,370
Yeah, the night is worth the pain.

6
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:54,230
You're listening to New Zealand's number one rated alternative talk radio.

7
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,210
It's the Vinnie Eastwood Show.

8
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,350
Just because we're being exterminated doesn't mean we can't make it fun.

9
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,770
Otherwise, what's the point of being killed?

10
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:12,690
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to yet another exciting episode of the Vinnie Eastwood Show,

11
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,490
broadcasting live on American Freedom Radio.

12
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,150
For your listening discomfort, it's the lighter side of genocide.

13
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,790
Just because we're being exterminated doesn't mean we can't make it fun.

14
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,930
Otherwise, what's the point of being killed?

15
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:34,310
Now, I have a guest turning up in about 15 to 20 minutes, and I'm going to talk about this whole concept.

16
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:41,690
I had this interview with Kevin Annett that I've just published up and spread all over Facebook today,

17
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,650
which has been responded with a legion of hate, as expected.

18
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:55,410
Number one, if you talk bad about any kind of religion,

19
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:00,230
see, even right now, a whole bunch of people who are deeply religious,

20
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,610
who believe in the Lord and Jesus and so on and so forth,

21
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,949
getting their backs arched up a bit,

22
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:16,510
because any criticism of the concept of a faith-based religion is abhorrent, right?

23
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:18,190
I'm just thinking about this.

24
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:24,510
I've got so many friends who are deep believers in things that I don't really believe in,

25
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:30,290
and yet we get along so well, because we're not dicks to each other.

26
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,730
I mean, maybe that's the real difference, isn't it?

27
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,050
The difference between somebody who's religious and somebody who's a zealot.

28
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,110
I mean, hell, let's go one step further.

29
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:47,450
What if it's a cult?

30
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,880
What if you've been part of a cult, right?

31
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,620
What's a cult?

32
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,940
You've got a hierarchical structure.

33
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,300
Organize religion.

34
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,140
You've got a preordained doctrine that everybody has to adhere to.

35
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,800
Organize religion.

36
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,840
You've got a central leader kind of thing that runs the whole organization.

37
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,700
Organize religion.

38
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,140
All right, so there you go.

39
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,820
That's how you know you're part of a cult.

40
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,660
Sorry to lay that on you,

41
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,520
but religion isn't the only cult that people are a part of.

42
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,040
There are cults of all kinds of followings.

43
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,160
Fan club cults, cults of personality.

44
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,680
There's TV show cults, you know, like the Star Wars cult.

45
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,400
Just think about that for a minute.

46
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,900
How many films have what they call a cult following?

47
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,720
All right, what does a cultist do?

48
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,340
I mean, let's think about this.

49
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,720
What if you introduce yourself not as a Star Wars fan, but as a Star Wars cultist?

50
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,880
Hello, I'm a Star Wars cultist.

51
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,200
Really, bro?

52
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,620
It kind of seems really creepy all of a sudden.

53
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,280
You're just using a different word, one that's not patently acceptable.

54
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:13,880
Oh, I know, because I've kind of gotten over the fact that I don't have to lie to myself.

55
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,740
I'm a cultist.

56
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,740
Star Wars cultist. I love it.

57
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,720
Can't get enough of it.

58
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:29,940
Give me a Jabba the Hutt and a Han Solo any day over a Pizza Hut and a handle of beer.

59
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,540
That's what I'm talking about.

60
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,120
Obsession.

61
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:40,660
Veneration for a person, object, some kind of thing.

62
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,960
Do you love it?

63
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,860
Do you viciously defend it?

64
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,200
Have you got butterflies in your stomach whenever people talk bad about it?

65
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,960
You don't know why.

66
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
You have no clue.

67
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,500
Why would somebody feel bad about it?

68
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,000
You know?

69
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:09,100
I've just been looking around lately and I've been having these conversations about religion and that kind of thing.

70
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,780
There's red meat issues in that.

71
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:22,020
I'm not doing it because I'm trying to get a rise out of people and I'm trying to suck a hit off them or any crap like that.

72
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm just genuinely interested in the topic right about now.

73
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,400
Christmas is coming up.

74
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,200
Tis the season to believe in things.

75
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,280
Stuff in the Bible.

76
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:49,080
It's clearly marked in there, in the Bible, that on Jesus' birthday, the 25th of December, that you must celebrate it by having an enormous tree draped with lights and expensive decorations and stuff like that.

77
00:05:49,160 --> 00:06:01,020
With a large meal around everybody and have a whole bunch of products that are made and manufactured in China for everybody that hasn't earned them.

78
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,380
Just give it to them because it's the season for giving.

79
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,120
Leviticus fucking chapter 3 or some shit.

80
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,840
It's right in there, man.

81
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,960
Celebration at Christmas.

82
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,460
You see?

83
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,560
Nobody even follows their religions anymore.

84
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,700
That's what I'm starting to find out that's different as well.

85
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:32,580
If you're an idiot, saying that you believe in a certain thing doesn't make you not an idiot.

86
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,100
That's the interesting thing that I've been thinking about lately.

87
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:45,260
A lot of people use their belief structures as an excuse to not listen and to not be reasonable.

88
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,910
This isn't all people that have a belief structure, mind you.

89
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,650
Just some.

90
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,150
Maybe because you need to have that.

91
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:06,770
I understand that specifically there is a reason why I believe in a higher power and a God and everything like that.

92
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,150
It's because I know that I can derive power from it.

93
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,270
How do I know that?

94
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,430
Because I've done it myself and hit an awakening?

95
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,190
No.

96
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:18,870
Statistics.

97
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:24,870
Have a look at the survival rates of people that are in POW camps.

98
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,970
Let's take Vietnam, for instance.

99
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:27,890
Alright.

100
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,650
Let's have a look at all the atheists in the POW camps.

101
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,710
How many of them survived?

102
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,110
Very few.

103
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:39,750
Let's have a look at the really, really deep Christian believers in the Vietnam POW camps.

104
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,850
How many survived?

105
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,510
A hell of a lot of them.

106
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,150
See, that alone is a reason to believe in something.

107
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,810
Even if it's not there.

108
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,670
Even if you don't have a defined belief of what it is.

109
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,690
Just believe.

110
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,190
That belief alone is something that will give you hope.

111
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:11,070
Because when you're in despair, a situation where you have no hope whatsoever, your body starts to shut down.

112
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,730
It doesn't try to survive.

113
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,270
It can't see tomorrow.

114
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:25,830
So, if I bag religion, it's not because I'm bagging the belief and the power that it gives you.

115
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,670
I'm not blagging morality.

116
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,570
I'm not blagging history.

117
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:38,630
I'm not blagging anything apart from those who misuse it.

118
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,630
Psychopaths in particular, who develop little cults.

119
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:43,590
Alright?

120
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,230
There was a joke this morning.

121
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:51,810
You know, I've never seen an atheist blow shit up or kill people in the name of atheism.

122
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,350
But that's probably because they don't shout,

123
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,530
FOR NOTHING!

124
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,410
before blowing themselves up.

125
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,870
Can you just imagine that?

126
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,330
That would be quite classic, wouldn't it?

127
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,470
Get like a little cartoon or a sketch or something.

128
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,270
Atheist terrorist.

129
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,470
FOR NOTHING!

130
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:18,190
There's all this dust in the wind.

131
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:19,270
You know?

132
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:27,750
He only gets like half a dozen virgins in the afterlife because he doesn't believe that you need 72.

133
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,280
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,040
I'm sorry.

135
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,280
Here's another thing.

136
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,060
I apologize if I'm making fun of anybody's belief structure.

137
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,260
I don't mean to do that.

138
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,880
I make fun of everything, just in general.

139
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,220
Belief structure is just part of the gig.

140
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:49,460
You know?

141
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,520
Let's say you're taking it seriously.

142
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,620
Let's say you're an atheist or a Christian or a Muslim or some denomination of cultist.

143
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,320
And you get offended by the very concept

144
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,660
that I don't like false belief,

145
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,680
that I don't like blind belief,

146
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,980
that I don't like things that aren't fact-based.

147
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,740
I don't like things that don't have a reason to be there.

148
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,320
Now, that means that a lot of you shouldn't be offended

149
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,320
because there is a reason why you believe what you believe.

150
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,280
There are some facts that substantiate it.

151
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,100
Okay?

152
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,220
So I'm not talking about you.

153
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,260
Am I?

154
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,280
Talking about those people who are idiotic,

155
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,960
who's zealotry.

156
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,300
The fucking zealotry.

157
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,540
My God.

158
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,760
All caps, comments all over YouTube.

159
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,280
You must convert.

160
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,940
Otherwise your eternal soul will never be saved.

161
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,920
You must accept Jesus into your heart.

162
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,920
Oh God, I just love Jesus so much.

163
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,300
You don't even know anything about the guy.

164
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,660
I mean, he was a barefoot, unemployed, homeless,

165
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,440
healing, travelling, hippie, Palestinian Jew.

166
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,580
I mean, you can't get any more messed up than that.

167
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,480
Alright?

168
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,800
So if anybody's like that and you want to deify them or anything,

169
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,830
why in the hell do you have a reason to be angry with anyone

170
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,280
if that's your deity?

171
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,320
Yeah?

172
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,700
Am I wrong?

173
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,180
The only person you should be upset with

174
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,780
is somebody who's evil.

175
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,100
Somebody who actually tries to corrupt the innocent.

176
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:51,610
Yeah?

177
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,470
Think about that for a second.

178
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,190
Who's your enemy?

179
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,330
I wonder this myself.

180
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,250
Who's my enemy?

181
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:08,630
And I'm starting to realize that my enemies are all psychopaths.

182
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:12,450
Every single person that I can count off of my head,

183
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,330
people that have screwed me over,

184
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,950
who are really horrific,

185
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,790
who are sexual predators and things of this nature,

186
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:25,950
all of them that I've had any personal contact with,

187
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,390
who I've since developed feuds with,

188
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,390
are freaking psychos.

189
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:31,590
Alright?

190
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,330
Some of them feign religion.

191
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,770
Some of them say that they're free men on the land.

192
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,210
Some of them say that they're great talk radio show hosts and patriots.

193
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,110
Dude.

194
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:45,570
Dude.

195
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,830
Exposing psychopaths is actually kind of one of the most important things to do

196
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,310
in any institution.

197
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:53,910
Alright?

198
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,070
Again, have a look back at it.

199
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,150
Is your institution controlled by a psychopath?

200
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,470
Is it hierarchical with one guy at the top?

201
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,130
Psychopathic controlled.

202
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,390
Every time.

203
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:06,890
You know?

204
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:11,090
It's like impossible for someone who's not a complete psycho

205
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,380
to get to the top of a giant organization.

206
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,000
Right?

207
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,880
Unless they built it themselves

208
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,900
and are currently running it themselves

209
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,580
and there's nothing to really be at the top of

210
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,300
because it's just them.

211
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,340
Right?

212
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,180
See, there's a difference in it.

213
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,700
Maybe it's just the desire to be surrounded

214
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,180
on all times by fawning sycophantic scum.

215
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,720
I don't believe that I need that.

216
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,160
You know?

217
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,760
People who go,

218
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,240
Oh, Vinnie, you're so great.

219
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:48,940
I love it.

220
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,420
I mean, you know, it's nice.

221
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,720
Thank you very much.

222
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,340
I'm not ungrateful.

223
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,230
Just as long as people are willing to pull me up on things.

224
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:01,870
You know?

225
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:04,610
If I'm wrong, show me the evidence.

226
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,050
Right?

227
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,810
Like I was talking about Kevin Annett before.

228
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,230
And a lot of the reason why people don't like him

229
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,470
is because in 2013,

230
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,690
he launched a common law court case

231
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,650
and arrest warrants of the Queen, the Pope,

232
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,570
and a number of other high-level Vatican and government officials.

233
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:26,110
Now, that's a common law jurisdiction thing.

234
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:30,210
So that means you've got an arrest warrant for the Queen.

235
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,870
It's an actual legit one.

236
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,430
You could grab the Queen and drag her away

237
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,830
and you wouldn't technically be breaking the law.

238
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,830
But who's going to do that?

239
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,610
So what happened was nothing happened

240
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,530
apart from a whole bunch of people in the Vatican resigning

241
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,910
all of a sudden for some reason.

242
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,550
And what people have done is they've construed that

243
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:58,570
as instead of him trying, you know, just trying,

244
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,090
giving it a go, and it's just not working,

245
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,990
they construed that as he's a fraud.

246
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:05,790
Right?

247
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,450
I don't understand that.

248
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,890
Also, I've heard a lot of other accusations

249
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:16,350
like he's a womanizer and he's traveling all around the world,

250
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,450
living the life of Riley and stuff.

251
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,530
I haven't seen anything to substantiate it.

252
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:21,850
All right?

253
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:24,870
It's like every time somebody throws out an accusation,

254
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,090
I don't care who it is that's throwing out the accusation.

255
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,730
I don't trust accusations alone.

256
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,190
I need to see something to substantiate it.

257
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,510
I need to see.

258
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:41,970
Because if you're going to pigeonhole somebody,

259
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,810
you know, just go,

260
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,610
all right, I really don't like this guy anymore.

261
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,650
He's off my radar for good.

262
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:53,290
It's going to take a bit of evidence

263
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,150
before I determine whether or not

264
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:58,410
somebody's actually a fraudulent bad person.

265
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,450
And accusations simply aren't enough.

266
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:02,990
You know?

267
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,610
They're not enough.

268
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,830
And that's how you know when you're dealing with a shill

269
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,710
or somebody who's just crazy or somebody who's just wrong,

270
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,770
is they keep playing the name-calling game.

271
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,230
They keep going and going and going,

272
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,450
saying all this stuff and making all these accusations.

273
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,270
And did they provide a single screenshot?

274
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:21,910
No.

275
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,270
Did they provide any video evidence

276
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,190
or anything that could actually be constituted

277
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,050
as some kind of case that they're making?

278
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:32,210
No?

279
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,970
Then they're talking out of their ass.

280
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:37,250
Right?

281
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,070
I'm sorry, whoever you are,

282
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,170
that's like spreading BS about anybody.

283
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,150
This is a very generalized concept

284
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,830
that I'm talking about here now.

285
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:52,710
People just make stuff up all the time.

286
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,930
And you know what the funniest thing is?

287
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,490
So many people believe it every time.

288
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,099
Don't check up on it.

289
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,260
Oh, that guy's a scumbag all of a sudden.

290
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:06,920
I knew it.

291
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,980
I knew it all along.

292
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:08,900
Really?

293
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,880
Somebody came out and criticized them openly?

294
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,339
Somebody who you think is trustworthy

295
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,140
and their words is enough?

296
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,880
Even people I know to be trustworthy,

297
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,720
I don't trust just their word alone

298
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,560
when it comes to throwing somebody under the bus.

299
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,440
I will throw people under the bus

300
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,640
if they're a scumbag,

301
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,220
if they're a parasite on human life,

302
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,960
if they betray people left, right and center

303
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,840
24, 7, 3, 6, 5

304
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,200
for their entire existence,

305
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,720
if that's what they do to people.

306
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,020
Yeah, they're going to be thrown under the bus.

307
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,880
Sorry, bro.

308
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,800
This is your stop.

309
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,380
I'm like that.

310
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,900
As soon as I know,

311
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,660
I know that somebody is a psycho scumbag

312
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,400
who's a manipulator and a liar,

313
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,980
I know for a fact that I cannot trust them

314
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,500
and never want to associate with them ever again.

315
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,660
And what's interesting is that

316
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,000
those people that you block off like that

317
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,260
and say you parted on bad terms or anything like that

318
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,400
or they started getting real uppity at you,

319
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,420
they never come back to you and apologize

320
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,860
and say, oh, I'm sorry I acted like a dick, bro, man.

321
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,880
I was just really...

322
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,480
See, psychos can't apologize at all.

323
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,620
Now, our guest, Brian Kelly,

324
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,640
appears to be ready,

325
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:50,000
so I'll just get that contact info to the studio there.

326
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,320
But I really am quite incensed

327
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,120
when I see people get manipulated

328
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,000
by accusations and things

329
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,850
that are completely unfounded

330
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,500
and people believing them

331
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,420
without asking for any evidence.

332
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,540
That's all I'm asking for.

333
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,840
If you want to pigeonhole me or anybody,

334
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,860
just ask to see a little bit of evidence

335
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,440
before you believe whoever's opinion.

336
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,460
This person says that about that person

337
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,880
and I believe them because such and such

338
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,980
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

339
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,200
Yeah, but that's all personality assumption, bro.

340
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,800
Have you got anything solid?

341
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,240
Something that isn't just shifting sand

342
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,020
of opinion and logical fallacy name-calling?

343
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,700
You don't, do you?

344
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,120
Just shush then, okay?

345
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:50,660
Shh!

346
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,240
I don't care that you've got five fake YouTube accounts.

347
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,540
I will block them all, okay?

348
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,280
They will get blocked just like that

349
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,140
and I will never have to hear from you again

350
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,980
after each and every one of your subsequent fake accounts

351
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,760
has been blocked.

352
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,160
Now, I'm a bit sick at the moment.

353
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,760
I'm holding down a gargantuan,

354
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,760
like an oil drum-sized ball of flames.

355
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,220
That's quite a horrific thing to say on talk radio, isn't it?

356
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,400
No response from the studio,

357
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,540
so I'm going to see if I can bring in Brian Kelly here myself.

358
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,840
No, that's not working.

359
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,180
Okay, sorry about this, ladies and gentlemen.

360
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,580
I have to produce on air

361
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,040
and I'm feeling sick and tired

362
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,060
and I need a holiday, bro, at the end of this week.

363
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,340
It's going to be holiday time.

364
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,200
But my very special guest joining me right now is Brian Kelly

365
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,400
from Brian Kelly's newsroom.

366
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,300
Welcome to the show.

367
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,600
Brother Benny Eastwood, it is good to be here.

368
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,440
It's been a long time, man. How are you doing?

369
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,820
It has been a long time and I'm doing sickly,

370
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,800
but I'm about to go on holiday after a few more shows

371
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,580
to round out the week before Thanksgiving

372
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,420
and I'm looking forward to recuperating from...

373
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,280
I should have just said, I'm good.

374
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,510
That would have been the shorter version, but I'm with you.

375
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,530
I like details, so it's good to hear that you're doing all right.

376
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,290
Oh, damn, that was funny.

377
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,030
That cracked me up, I do.

378
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,310
So anyway, what have you been up to, Brian?

379
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,430
Oh, man, I'm good.

380
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,910
What's been waiting in the wings?

381
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,490
I don't follow the news at all.

382
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,850
Do you follow the news at all?

383
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,210
No, I went through a phase when I was doing my blog.

384
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,270
If you've gone to my blog recently,

385
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,870
you'll notice I haven't made a blog post in probably about six months

386
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:03,190
and that's as a result of not following the news really at all.

387
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,570
So I've transitioned to doing more boots on the ground kind of projects,

388
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,230
which I'm here in Bali doing now,

389
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,650
but every once in a while something will come my way.

390
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:17,430
For example, some of the Syria stuff is illuminated lately

391
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:20,770
because I've got a friend over there that's on the ground in Syria right now

392
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:26,390
and obviously if something pops up that's as important to share

393
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,230
as what's happening in that country,

394
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,550
then I pay attention.

395
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,770
But for the most part, no, man, I'm not listening to the radio shows,

396
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,530
no offense to you, I know you've got an awesome show.

397
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:40,350
I'm not reading blogs and I'm staying out of newsrooms and chats

398
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,110
because I feel like if I need to know it,

399
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,610
somebody will shoot me a link and then I'll dig a little.

400
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,230
Brian, if I may,

401
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,590
you just described my exact protocol for life.

402
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,490
I'm out of the game a bit,

403
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,810
but I'm very much in the game in another level.

404
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,870
You just described my exact protocol for life.

405
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:00,790
It's a good blueprint. It works.

406
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,270
I mean, dude, dig this. I've figured it out

407
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,710
and there's a reason why we do it.

408
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,470
Number one, news doesn't fucking matter.

409
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:12,270
Once you come to that realization that it actually doesn't fucking matter

410
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:15,150
staying up to date with shit that's happening 10,000 miles away

411
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:17,630
that doesn't actually involve you in any way, shape or form.

412
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:22,950
Dude, that's the honest way to put it, for sure.

413
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,610
Like, oh, I fucking figured it out!

414
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,390
Well, you know, man,

415
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,750
when I first went down the rabbit hole,

416
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,730
it was like I couldn't get enough news.

417
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,090
I needed to know what the fuck was going on

418
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:40,090
because my entire world view was challenged in so many ways

419
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,650
and then I think I got to the point where I was in news paralysis

420
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:49,070
and the only way to let go of those symptoms

421
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,350
was to just back away from the whole thing.

422
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,690
And I've got to tell you, it's working.

423
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,730
In a lot of ways.

424
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:00,130
See, you're doing exactly what I recommend my listeners do

425
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,290
is turn off the Vinnie Eastwood show

426
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,850
and start going and doing your own thing, your own activism or whatever.

427
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,070
In fact, you've got to really turn off everything.

428
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:13,770
It's like, in life, energy gets given to what you put your attention to.

429
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,930
Now, if you're putting your attention to someone else

430
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:20,890
as opposed to yourself and your family, your world and your contribution to it,

431
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:24,450
I think you've missed a priority or two.

432
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:31,070
I know a lot of people that spend 18 hours a day

433
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:33,130
staring at their monitor screen.

434
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,890
I was one of them for a long time.

435
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:39,550
And on one hand, you have information being empowering

436
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:44,170
because I believe when we empower ourselves with what's going on,

437
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,070
all it simply does is it allows us for freedom

438
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,390
of a much wider scope of options

439
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,950
of how to conduct ourselves

440
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:56,470
and what's available within the limitless space of possibility at all times.

441
00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:00,290
But you get to that point where all of a sudden that becomes overload.

442
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:03,170
And it doesn't serve a purpose after a while.

443
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:08,570
And shutting the computer and actually going and doing something

444
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:15,350
seems to be the only natural progression out of that mode

445
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:20,050
of constant overload of information.

446
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,530
You just get to the point where it's like,

447
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:25,090
fuck man, enough is enough sooner or later.

448
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,970
So yeah, it's fun to be actually creating something.

449
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,690
I've got some cool stuff going on

450
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,950
and every once in a while I'll pop in and pop out as needed.

451
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,950
But it's important that people like you keep doing the work

452
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,310
and putting out information because there are lots of people around the world

453
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,950
that are still new to a lot of what's really going on

454
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:50,070
and need that shake in order to be able to snap out of the mind control,

455
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,370
cultural, social conditioning matrix that they're in.

456
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,990
And for that purpose, to that end, it is highly valuable.

457
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,850
Well, the whole concept of good management is to make yourself redundant.

458
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:07,370
So if the concept of the show is to wake people up,

459
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,930
no, it's not to wake people up.

460
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:13,790
The people who are listening to the show probably have already, quote, unquote, woken up.

461
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,330
The idea of listening to the show is you'll listen to it enough

462
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,690
that you'll want to get out of bed and you'll want to go to work against the new world order.

463
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,350
That's what I'm talking about. That's real productivity.

464
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:28,630
I mean, there's some people who literally cannot do that though.

465
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,770
They're still – they're tramped.

466
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:36,530
It's like you can work your life and you find your place in your workforce

467
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:40,510
and after a while you realize that you haven't played – you found your place in the world.

468
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,310
And you're trapped where you are.

469
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,550
You're trapped in your house that has a mortgage.

470
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,210
You're trapped in your job that has set hours.

471
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,590
You're trapped in a mindset.

472
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,530
You're trapped in your family's environment.

473
00:26:54,110 --> 00:27:01,490
You're trapped in perhaps a surroundings that isn't conducive to truthing and activism, et cetera.

474
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,030
Maybe everybody thinks you're nuts in your house.

475
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:07,250
Maybe everybody tells you you ought to calm down.

476
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:12,010
You ought to just do your job and shut up and drink the Kool-Aid like the rest of us.

477
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:18,850
You know, before when I was doing blogging and doing radio shows two times a week,

478
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:24,230
that was what you just shared was my main theme and message.

479
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:28,370
If I were to say that I had one on an ongoing basis,

480
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:34,950
which is that the fastest way to change the world is for people to follow their passion,

481
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:40,350
to break free of that system that keeps people slave laboring

482
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,990
and doing some nine-to-five job that they couldn't fucking stand

483
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,130
and throwing themselves into the deep end

484
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:50,790
and realizing that they are capable to break free from that system.

485
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:54,450
I mean, I quit my job in February of 2013.

486
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:57,470
I had $8,000 to my name and I had no fucking idea.

487
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,170
Excuse my language. I can swear here, right?

488
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,450
Yeah, you fucking can.

489
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,250
I had no fucking idea how I was going to survive.

490
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,230
But something told me this isn't it.

491
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,390
It's not working.

492
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,270
There's no joy.

493
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,210
There's no passion.

494
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,310
There's no creativity.

495
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,870
I fucking hate it.

496
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:15,610
So it's worth it to me to throw myself into the wind and just see what happens.

497
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:22,070
And the fact of the matter was that that was the biggest crucial turning point that led to...

498
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,630
I haven't punched a time card since.

499
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,310
And here we are in November of 2015.

500
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,110
And guess what?

501
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,290
I haven't died of starvation.

502
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:32,290
I haven't spent any days in the street without a roof over my head.

503
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:36,130
And the universe has paved very creative and very unpredictable ways

504
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:41,070
for me to be able to navigate the terrain without having to worry about how to survive.

505
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,910
And I think that at the crux of people staying within that system,

506
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,470
that kind of mind-controlling system,

507
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:53,810
is that I don't know how I'm going to survive if I step outside of this sense of security,

508
00:28:53,810 --> 00:29:00,430
this sense of being able to ensure that I keep food on the table and the roof over my head.

509
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:04,030
And that, breaking free from that illusion of self-limitation,

510
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:09,530
is the key to be able to transcend that process on every level.

511
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:10,070
And it works.

512
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,930
I know a lot of people that have done it also.

513
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,530
And it's scary as shit.

514
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:17,350
But somehow, everybody figures out a way to make it work

515
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:20,750
because we all have some sort of higher calling.

516
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,290
We didn't come into this world to sit in a fucking cubicle,

517
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:27,730
to die under fucking lamps that are frying our brains,

518
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:30,470
and to punch fucking numbers into a fucking computer all day.

519
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,910
Now, that's an extreme example, but I know people that fucking do that.

520
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,830
And it's not the way to live.

521
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:41,510
And the faster people unplug from that harvesting-type scenario,

522
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:50,510
the less energy, the gas all of a sudden in the tank of this global commercial-based system

523
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:55,770
that we live in worldwide, that just all of a sudden comes crashing down, collapsing down.

524
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:57,390
So they don't want free thinkers.

525
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,550
They don't want people that are following their heart and following their passion

526
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:05,330
because that means less cogs in the wheel of the system that keeps people in control.

527
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:10,170
So it is a vicious cycle, a vicious system, but highly empowering to break free from.

528
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:16,150
And sometimes it takes those that are still stuck there to hear stories like mine

529
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:22,710
to realize that it is very much possible and can be an exciting and scary as shit process.

530
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:27,750
Well, yeah, and again, this seems to be a recurring theme on the show already.

531
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,810
Everything you've said basically happened to me as well.

532
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,510
Like, for example, you had $8,000 and you quit your job in 2013.

533
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:42,310
I had $11,900 worth of shopping vouchers and $5,000 cash in 2007 when I quit my job.

534
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,050
But same thing, I've always had a roof over my head.

535
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,710
I've always had a meal in my belly.

536
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,950
I've always had just enough money to pay the bills whenever I need them.

537
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:59,770
And it's kind of like if you're sitting there and you've got 20 different screens in front of you,

538
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:05,510
you don't know what any of them are saying because they're all talking at once.

539
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:13,590
When you turn all of them off but one, because you know that you can't focus,

540
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:20,950
you can't do anything but by distract and block out everything that doesn't matter,

541
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:24,810
and you don't do it because you necessarily want to.

542
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:27,110
You do it because you're compelled to.

543
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,390
There's something that tells you that you have to do it.

544
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:33,370
You don't have a choice because you're going to drive yourself insane

545
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:38,930
or kill yourself or kill somebody else, probably the boss,

546
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,930
and it's not going to work out very well for everybody.

547
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,650
Nobody wins in that scenario.

548
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,830
So, yeah, I don't advocate killing your boss.

549
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,370
However, there's been a few that I've wanted to.

550
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:58,910
But, yeah, the sooner you extricate yourself from that, all of a sudden the world opens up.

551
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:02,030
Synchronicity becomes much more prevalent.

552
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:07,590
Meeting the right people and being in the right situations and scenarios at the right time

553
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:12,450
that seems very divinely, in some level, inspired.

554
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:19,550
It's just a much more pleasant way of living on every level.

555
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,390
And that doesn't mean it's not hard.

556
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:24,610
I mean, there's been times where I had no clue,

557
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,930
and I know that you can speak to this also,

558
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:30,550
but where that next money was going to come from to ensure that rent was paid

559
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:33,110
or whatever, that you were able to get groceries.

560
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:38,510
But somehow, at the 11 1⁄2 hour, something pops up,

561
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,650
and then all of a sudden you know.

562
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:42,310
And the more times that happens,

563
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:47,410
I think the more faith you have in that process that we're being taken care of.

564
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,610
And then all of a sudden you realize,

565
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:52,050
okay, next time this happens, I promise myself I'm not going to stress out about it.

566
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:52,990
And then sure enough, you do.

567
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:56,510
But the more consistency you have and the more comfortable you get with the process

568
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,770
of just allowing the universe to unfold before you,

569
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:03,910
the more you realize that there's a whole lot more going on than what we can see,

570
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,390
taste, smell, hear, touch.

571
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,830
Am I missing any other senses?

572
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,750
Above an extra sensory perception.

573
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:16,030
But when you're working, you've got a schedule, you know,

574
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:19,950
and you tell yourself what the plan for the day is every freaking day.

575
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:25,250
But when you work for yourself, the plan tells you what to do.

576
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:29,090
It's like it actually comes out of the ether kind of thing,

577
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,290
just magically appears, like literally.

578
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:36,250
There was this one time I got up in the morning and it was bill day,

579
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:39,750
and I was like, okay, I got the water bill, the internet bill, and the rent.

580
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:40,990
That's $500.

581
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,630
I don't have $500.

582
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:46,790
So I go to my PayPal, and there's $500 in there.

583
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,350
Boom.

584
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:56,830
That's the exact scenario I'm talking about.

585
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:03,890
Some magical donation that came from somewhere or some tax return check

586
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:07,090
that you got lost in the mail three years before.

587
00:34:07,389 --> 00:34:10,250
I mean, you really never know where it's going to come from.

588
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,250
But it just somehow seems to.

589
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,449
And I think that it is.

590
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:22,929
It's this false sense of security that Matrix-style-esque jobs we feel provide for us

591
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,070
that keeps us in those positions.

592
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,190
I mean, I've talked to people.

593
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:31,210
It's the same all the way up this perceived level of control

594
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:34,170
that dictates the way that the world works.

595
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:38,949
All the way up in the upper echelons, the elite and the illuminati.

596
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:39,810
I've heard the stories.

597
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:44,310
First-hand accounts that they don't know what they would do

598
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:48,510
if they exited ranks and went another way

599
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:56,930
because their livelihood requires them to stay within the system that they have around themselves.

600
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,770
It's not easy at any level.

601
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,030
Just because something isn't easy doesn't mean it's not possible.

602
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,750
But it does.

603
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,310
It takes a leap of faith.

604
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,410
Shit, if we can't do leaps of faith, man,

605
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:14,250
then we've got a long rocky road ahead of us.

606
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:16,490
I feel like we're at this turning point

607
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:22,290
in where we are in the process of human evolution

608
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,930
that it doesn't really matter.

609
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,110
This might be a very optimistic way of looking at it,

610
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,710
but it doesn't really matter what anybody does

611
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:34,470
because this whole thing is unfolding in this perfect way.

612
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,990
And so you can either resist what's happening

613
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,610
or you can let go of the side of the river and just go slow.

614
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,050
And things have a tendency of just getting a whole hell of a lot easier.

615
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,550
So that's my little bit on that.

616
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:50,930
And for anybody that's out there that's sitting on the fence

617
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,910
and trying to figure out what the fuck to do and how the hell to do it,

618
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,030
don't worry about how to do it.

619
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,770
Just do it, you know?

620
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:00,510
Forgetting, letting go of the how and trying to put together a plan.

621
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,590
I mean, let all that shit go

622
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:05,010
because if I were to try to make a mind map

623
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:07,190
of how I was going to do it back in February 2013,

624
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:10,590
how I'm doing it and how I thought I was going to do it now back then,

625
00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,230
look, absolutely nothing like each other whatsoever.

626
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,250
And because it goes to the point that you made

627
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,470
that the universe somehow has it all under control.

628
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:22,590
So you either have faith in that process or you don't, you know?

629
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,050
And I'm not here to try to tell anybody how to live their lives,

630
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:29,690
but my story, your story, some of these other stories are great examples

631
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:35,970
that really the only thing to fear is fear itself,

632
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,090
for lack of a better non-creative way of saying it.

633
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:40,750
Yeah.

634
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,570
Everybody in life is worried about money.

635
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,730
You know, I'm worried about money, you're worried about money.

636
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:49,390
Even people that have got jobs have to worry about money.

637
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,410
But also the problem is if you have a job,

638
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,850
you also have to worry about the fact that you're starting to hate yourself.

639
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:02,470
And in life, some people, you know, choose to work.

640
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,510
Some people choose to work for themselves.

641
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:09,410
And some people just sit on the fence, you know?

642
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:13,510
And I'm just trying to burn the fence down.

643
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:21,490
It's time to get a bulldozer and just knock this damn fence over.

644
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,750
We'll do it fucking Gaza-style, bro.

645
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,470
I want to burn it, really.

646
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:30,810
I want to burn it and I want to do it in a really sacrificial kind of way

647
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,390
that's almost dark, you know?

648
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,230
I don't know if that makes me weird or crazy.

649
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:38,730
All I want to do is dance around the burning fence

650
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:41,350
after everybody suddenly had to choose what they do with their life

651
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,310
and not allow other people to fucking tell them

652
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:45,630
what they have to do with their life, you know?

653
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:49,270
And it'll be like dancing around it, naked, jiggling in the air,

654
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:52,210
and the chicken is smeared in goat's blood.

655
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,370
It'll be fucking fantastic.

656
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:56,610
We're going to mutilate it, like with a spoon.

657
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,150
Just really kind of have fun with it, man.

658
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,430
That's what I would vote for.

659
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,950
It'll be like a...

660
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,450
It'll be like the Doors concerts or something.

661
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,710
I'm thinking pay-per-view.

662
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,110
We make loads of money and we send the money from Africa

663
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,310
to feed starving children.

664
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,650
I mean, it's really, at the end of the day, it's for a good cause.

665
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:17,330
No, no, no, no.

666
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,070
I've got a better idea of what to do with the money.

667
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:23,030
You hire African mercenaries to kill all the people

668
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:26,010
that are giving bad drugs and stuff like that

669
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,770
to all the Africans that's causing AIDS.

670
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:31,350
If you have that petition, I would love to sign that

671
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,170
on behalf of myself and all of humanity.

672
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:35,350
That reminds me.

673
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:38,670
I remember there was an ex-CIA assassin, Chip Tatum,

674
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,990
and he's come out about some of the operations

675
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,510
that he did back in the day,

676
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,870
working for this hit squad under the US government,

677
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,070
sort of privatised, right?

678
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:51,030
And he says that he has a hit list that he wants,

679
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:56,390
like a list of really freaking bad people

680
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,310
that just need to be taken out

681
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:01,050
because they won't go any other way.

682
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,290
And he was asking for donations.

683
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,010
He started a Kickstarter plan.

684
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,500
Now that is taking crowdfunding to a whole new level, man.

685
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,020
Put it on Pledge Me, bro.

686
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,480
You know, I guarantee you that fund

687
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,280
did not end up an empty bucket.

688
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,100
Somebody put some money into that cause, I know it.

689
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,820
Only got $20 in my pocket.

690
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,040
You know, $20 in a third-world country

691
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,200
can go a very long way, man.

692
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,380
That's at least one takeout.

693
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,060
You can find somebody desperate enough to take out one guy.

694
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,100
That's at least one clip of 9mm.

695
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:39,320
Yeah.

696
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,780
Throw in a few corndogs.

697
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,900
You're good to go, man.

698
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,640
You're talking making serious, serious, very creative business.

699
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,080
I like the way your mind thinks, man.

700
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,640
I appreciate that about you.

701
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,780
I like it, too.

702
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,440
Everybody talks about this as well.

703
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,720
I don't like the idea of violence or killing or anything.

704
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,180
You know, I'm just joking about

705
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,020
sending mercenaries over there to just kill them and torture them

706
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,300
and ruthlessly butcher their families and things like that

707
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,600
and redistribute the wealth, okay?

708
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,760
It's just a joke, bro, okay?

709
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,580
And in fact, that's another thing.

710
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,800
I figured out that my show,

711
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,480
if I say anything that's controversial or really horrific

712
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,520
or something like that

713
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,460
and people want to, like, charge me with inciting terrorism or whatever,

714
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:23,400
I've got this great little caveat that I can just bust out.

715
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,080
It was a joke!

716
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:28,720
Yeah, man.

717
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,680
That's a soundbite.

718
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,420
You're good to go.

719
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,300
That's written in ink.

720
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,000
It's on the Internet.

721
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,860
It never goes away.

722
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,100
And, you know, that's your out.

723
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,020
It's called the lack of a smoking gun.

724
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,740
And it works, you know?

725
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:42,120
Maybe I could have that as something on the opening of the show,

726
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,760
like pre-recorded or something.

727
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,220
The Vinny Eastwood Show.

728
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,380
If anything on this show offends you or makes you want to kill Vinny,

729
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,440
just remember, it was a joke!

730
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,120
And just remember, if that doesn't work,

731
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,260
the way to always get out of everything,

732
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,760
you see it in all the movies,

733
00:40:59,020 --> 00:40:59,980
you just claim insanity.

734
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,340
And Vinny, if you did that, I would believe you.

735
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,340
Because, dude, you're borderline insane,

736
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,400
and that's what I like about you, man.

737
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,940
Well, a lot of people call me insane,

738
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,740
and I take it as a compliment.

739
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,860
Because in a world this fucked up,

740
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,060
if somebody were to say that I had a real handle on things,

741
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,040
I'd feel insulted.

742
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,400
Sanity is very overrated, man.

743
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,460
Insanity is the new cool.

744
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,840
And it really means really letting things go and just saying, fuck it.

745
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,800
And I know a lot of people that are doing that very well.

746
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,020
And it is the way to go.

747
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,060
I mean, on my business card, my tagline is just say, fuck it.

748
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:39,680
And it works.

749
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,540
It's not really.

750
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,140
I think I might make that now.

751
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,760
At least part of my email signature.

752
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,800
Fuckit.com

753
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,040
Is it an animal, mineral, or vegetable?

754
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,060
Can I eat it?

755
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,820
Can I live in it?

756
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,480
Can I fuck it?

757
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,940
You've got to put everything in life through the can I fuck it filter.

758
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,080
And that makes everything really fun.

759
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,160
Wow.

760
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,680
I'm thinking of a great business idea.

761
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

762
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,200
Fuck it glasses.

763
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,760
There'll be an app that you can put into Google Glasses.

764
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:19,480
It'll highlight in green the things that you can fuck.

765
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,140
Jacuzzi air filter system or something like that lights up in green.

766
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:27,580
Like, really?

767
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,440
I can fuck that?

768
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:28,980
Absolutely.

769
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:34,820
It's a triple-triple abraded cock fucking massager right there, bro.

770
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:42,920
Who would have ever thought that I could, you know, I could fuck this, whatever the what you want to call it, this widget.

771
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,200
You know, it really just opens up a whole bunch of possibilities.

772
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,940
The can I fuck it widget by briankelley.com

773
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,480
My mother's going to be so proud.

774
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,520
I can't wait to send her the link to this video.

775
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,740
You make your mama bosom swell with pride.

776
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,620
So what else is going on with you, man?

777
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,700
Well, you know, I've just been thinking about the Christmas season and all the shops are starting to put up their Christmas decorations.

778
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,140
And apparently they started doing it a month ago, like on television.

779
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,800
Like, so I've heard I watch fucking television.

780
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,920
But yeah, apparently there's been Christmas advertisements going throughout the whole month of November and October.

781
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:31,940
It's just like Christmas season starts earlier every year because everybody just goes.

782
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:39,040
Hey, you know what makes people want to part with their cash guilt tripping them about not buying their loved ones a present.

783
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:39,680
Boom.

784
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,660
Like where's the Christmas decorations?

785
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,900
I brought it back.

786
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,740
Black Friday.

787
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,180
Yeah, I haven't.

788
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:57,860
I don't know.

789
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,780
I don't I'm not sure how any of that stuff we're advertising.

790
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:11,880
I mean, all that stuff is just so so far outside of my reality anymore that I find it hard to believe that anybody is still going out and dropping thousands of dollars leading up to Christmas.

791
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,700
I don't know.

792
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,340
It's just the concept that doesn't make sense to me anymore.

793
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,180
I mean, don't get me wrong.

794
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:16,880
I go home.

795
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:17,640
I celebrate Christmas.

796
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,600
I buy my family a few a few a few cool things.

797
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:26,100
But it's funny because somebody asked me the other day here in Bali where I'm living now.

798
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,360
Oh, you're going over there.

799
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:28,180
Oh, you're Christian.

800
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,300
They just assume that everybody that celebrates Christmas is Christian.

801
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,680
I'm like, no, even atheists, I think, in the United States celebrate Christmas.

802
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:49,200
And that's how well ingrained the kit can Christmas condition shopping program is within people that they don't even have to believe in what Christmas is supposed to represent.

803
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,660
They still go out and buy shitloads of stuff that they don't need.

804
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:53,420
See me.

805
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:59,020
I celebrate Ramadan by drinking and smoking more because the Muslims can't.

806
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,000
Oh, yeah.

807
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:06,400
Nice.

808
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:12,940
Why not see the whole concept of a holiday season?

809
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:21,700
I got this saying, even notice that holidays never come early enough and they always end too soon.

810
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,940
And I think I figured out why it is, bro.

811
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,720
It's because your holiday is merely a break from working.

812
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,180
All right.

813
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:40,700
And if your work's not uber fulfilling, that gives you plenty of time to relax and stuff like that and recuperate.

814
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,180
You need that.

815
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,480
In fact, you know, kind of think of it.

816
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,560
Everybody needs holidays, bro.

817
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,720
And some people don't take them and they burn themselves out.

818
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,660
I've seen so many activists just go.

819
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:58,980
Because I think the whole fucking world will just collapse without them doing their very important work for a couple of months or something like that.

820
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:04,600
And then before they know it, you know, a couple of months later, they they totally burn out.

821
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,300
They quit being an activist completely.

822
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:09,600
And then they go back to get a slave job, completely disillusioned.

823
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:17,820
And then basically join the other side and say that everybody who's an activist is just an idiot that's wasting their time because they were an idiot and wasted their time.

824
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,800
Well, I you you just described many people that I know.

825
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,400
We must swim in the same sea of activists.

826
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,740
Yeah. You know, I mean, it's funny.

827
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:35,520
I don't I don't have the same perception of holidays or weekends as I used to.

828
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,440
I don't have really a week every day is kind of this.

829
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,660
I don't wake up on Monday morning stressed because I don't have a set schedule.

830
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:51,880
So, you know, there's not really something that I'm doing that's so grueling that needs to be a holiday, needs to be taken to escape from it.

831
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:56,360
So, you know, and that's a that's a pretty good place to be.

832
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,980
And I'm very grateful that that's that is the scenario.

833
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:10,760
But yeah, man, it's you know, when you work a terrible job that you absolutely cannot stand, you know, come four o'clock on Friday, you're ready to get the fuck out of Dodge.

834
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,720
And on Sunday night, you're growing up in anxiety.

835
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,520
You got to go back to work the next day.

836
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:20,720
And I don't think that's what we were sent here to do.

837
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,940
So we're kind of looping back around on what we originally started talking about.

838
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,620
Well, you just described something there.

839
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,520
And you said by the end of the week, people want to get the fuck out of Dodge.

840
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,900
It takes me six months.

841
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,180
All right, before I just can't handle work and I need a holiday roundabout.

842
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:36,240
Yeah.

843
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,080
Yeah.

844
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:42,820
And I usually take maybe a month or two or two off if I if I really need it.

845
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,860
And it's mostly just the emotional recuperation.

846
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:59,100
The thing about interviewing people with problems, emotional problems, and, you know, people have been ritualistically abused and people who get persecuted by the media and shit like that, because I'm a sensitive and empathetic person.

847
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,200
I actually give a fuck when they tell me about this kind of shit.

848
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:06,600
So I take on some of their baggage in order to lighten the load for them, lighten the load.

849
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:07,020
I do.

850
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:09,900
But however, I get stuck with the baggage.

851
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:20,920
And after a period of time, I got so much other people's baggage on me that I literally start to have meltdowns, like on a daily basis kind of thing.

852
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,080
I get really angry for no reason.

853
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,040
I start yelling and screaming at the computer.

854
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,160
In fact, I yell and scream in the computer quite a lot.

855
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:28,940
Fuck this shit.

856
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:38,540
You and me both, man.

857
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

858
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:50,760
It's when we live in a world that is that is fueled by massive amounts of just sickness on so many levels.

859
00:48:50,760 --> 00:49:01,820
I mean, it's very easy to fall within that viewpoint of, holy shit, the world is going to hell in a handbasket and everything is just fucked and it doesn't matter what we're going to do.

860
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:10,840
I mean, I know a lot of those people that they think that humanity is heading toward its final point where we're not going to be around much longer.

861
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,040
And, you know, shit is fucked.

862
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,940
This shit is really fucked up on a lot of levels.

863
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:21,620
I mean, I know you've seen the thick of it with some of the people that you brought on your show over the years.

864
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:26,410
I always seem to have lost Brian.

865
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:28,250
Yeah, he's gone.

866
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:29,090
Bugger.

867
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:30,430
All right.

868
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:31,730
That's very unfortunate.

869
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:38,670
Anyway, yeah, well, something you were saying before was kind of interesting to me.

870
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:44,670
Like when you get up on Monday morning, you know, you're not stressed because you don't have any schedule to keep or anything like that.

871
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:49,090
And that's not too similar to me.

872
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:50,290
I mean, like I've got a schedule to keep.

873
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:51,830
For example, on Mondays I do nothing.

874
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:59,670
You know, I hated Mondays for so long that I officially, you know, decided that I'd do four days a week of talk radio so I wouldn't have to work on Mondays.

875
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:10,450
But in the United States sense of the word, it means I don't have to work on Saturdays because we're a day ahead of you on this timeline.

876
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:16,910
But something that Brian was talking to me about, about time management, right?

877
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:23,570
I remember I interviewed this guy who's like an expert on what would you call them?

878
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:24,570
Entrepreneurs.

879
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:28,670
And he says that they've got a system called organic time.

880
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:30,030
All right.

881
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,010
Now, really think about this.

882
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:38,190
If you didn't have a watch, you didn't have a clock or anything like that, and you're just sitting there, you're working away on something for a period of time.

883
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:42,810
And you go, I really don't feel like doing this anymore.

884
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:44,550
I'm going to take a break from it.

885
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:46,730
And you go off and you do something else.

886
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:48,150
Organic time.

887
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:50,010
You just operate by your feelings.

888
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:51,690
You do what you feel you want to.

889
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,690
And you take breaks when you need to.

890
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,610
You know, it's not like having a set schedule.

891
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:59,250
You know, you've got to be at work by 8 a.m.

892
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:07,170
You know, I don't – I'm usually up and working by 8 a.m. anyway.

893
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:10,010
But that's by choice.

894
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:11,210
It's not because I've got a schedule.

895
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,690
You know, just get up and start working.

896
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:15,650
There's nothing else to do around here.

897
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:18,650
You know, what am I going to do?

898
00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:20,350
Sit on my deck chair, watch the sunrise?

899
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:21,570
Boring as hell.

900
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:26,030
I'll just stick a camera there and then use it as a slow creeping shot in the video later.

901
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:27,250
You know, better idea.

902
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:36,430
But yeah, you'd be surprised how much more productive you can be when you're not on somebody else's time card.

903
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:37,250
Yeah?

904
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:38,910
When you make your own time.

905
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:43,110
And you'll find this as well is that you can make time.

906
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:44,550
All right?

907
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:49,330
You can actually manufacture time out of thin air just like that.

908
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:50,630
Quite interesting.

909
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:53,850
It might sound a bit confusing at first.

910
00:51:54,330 --> 00:51:56,190
But here's how –

911
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:58,990
The person you are trying to reach is not accepting calls at this time.

912
00:51:59,490 --> 00:51:59,750
Hang up that call.

913
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:00,710
Please try your call again later.

914
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:02,130
Yeah, there we go.

915
00:52:04,110 --> 00:52:05,090
Shoot, what did I do?

916
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:07,230
Totally missed my place.

917
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:08,270
Man, that was distracting.

918
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:09,230
Hmm.

919
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:10,250
Hmm.

920
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:13,850
Haven't had any coffee for the entire hour as well.

921
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:15,850
Brain's starting to freeze up.

922
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:16,510
Yeah.

923
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,450
I'm saying the word uh and um too much.

924
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:27,970
When you have coffee, ladies and gentlemen, very important for talk radio show hosts.

925
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:35,630
Gives you increase in cognitive function and provided it's not GMO or sprayed with nasty chemicals and stuff,

926
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:37,490
it can actually not be that bad for you.

927
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:42,170
I heard that people who drink a bit of coffee live longer.

928
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,830
And I can understand that.

929
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:50,750
Because if I didn't have coffee, I wouldn't want to live that long.

930
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:55,770
I crack me up.

931
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:56,470
I do.

932
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:57,290
I do.

933
00:52:58,750 --> 00:52:59,690
But anyway.

934
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:00,750
Yeah.

935
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:12,170
You know, I don't want to sound too pushy here, but quit your job.

936
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,670
Because it's dragging you down.

937
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:23,670
Unless, of course, you actually have one of those very rare instances where you're working with cool people.

938
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,350
You're doing cool stuff.

939
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:26,790
And it's really fulfilling.

940
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,430
It actually makes you happy.

941
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:31,690
And you get home at the end of the day and you feel great.

942
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,410
And you can actually raise your kids.

943
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:37,090
You've got more than enough money to get by.

944
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:39,330
And you contribute to society as well.

945
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:43,070
And in your spare time, you're not just working and relaxing.

946
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:47,350
You're actually doing something else on your own time.

947
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:50,650
Dude, that's like one of the perfect things.

948
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:53,370
I actually wish I could do that, you know.

949
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:58,210
It would be cool to have a nice, fun, cool job with a whole bunch of mates.

950
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:06,050
And get paid a hell of a lot to do some really awesome stuff that's very interesting and fulfilling.

951
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:12,110
As well as, at the end of the day, be able to go home and do a whole bunch of activism.

952
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:15,790
But unfortunately, there's not enough time.

953
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:19,430
So I made it, you know.

954
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:24,670
Just go, OK, let's have a look at the things in my life that are soaking up my time.

955
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:29,010
And let's eliminate them one by one in order to free up time for the things that I want to do.

956
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:30,130
Just that simple.

957
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:36,250
Now, American Freedom Radio is having a marathon at the end of this week, I believe on Saturday.

958
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:38,890
So make sure to check that one out.

959
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:45,990
There's Jordan Maxwell, Carol Rosen, Dean Clifford, and some dude from Iraq.

960
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:50,510
Something Ford or whatever about WMDs.

961
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:52,170
It's on Sunday. Sorry, Sunday.

962
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:54,770
So, yeah, tune into that, ladies and gentlemen.

963
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,870
And throw a few bucks American Freedom Radio's way.

964
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:00,930
And while you're at it, throw me something for Christmas as well.

965
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:02,510
You know, because what am I going to do?

966
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:04,590
You know, beg the universe for presents.

967
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:08,790
We'll see you after the break, ladies and gentlemen. Don't you go anywhere.

968
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:33,770
Welcome to the world's meeting place.

969
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:35,350

972
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:40,170
Oh, yes. I like it very much.

973
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:40,650
Radio.

974
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:42,210

We're trying to become commercial free apart from a few honorable advertisers that we would give ad space to even if they couldn't pay us.

994
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:19,350

995
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:24,810
then you must realize that you cannot be a part of it if you're just sitting on the sidelines watching.

Some can only afford $1 a month while others can afford $100 a month.

999
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:44,590
Regardless of the size of your contribution, it all adds up to keeping the network owners and the radio hosts housed and fed at the end of every month.

1000
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:45,450

00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,850
The freedom to broadcast the truth is not free at all.

1014
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:59,470
So what is American Freedom Radio worth to you?

1015
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:05,210
The empowering information with fun, honest and pure integrity behind it provides an example to follow.

1016
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:09,230
Friendships to flourish with the moral altruism that pulls no punches.

1017
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:18,190
The hosts sacrifice and show remarkable discipline in their duty to deliver quality radio in service to the community with strength, wisdom and loyalty.

1018
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:25,010
The founders of AFI wish to thank you personally for sharing your views and insights to make the best radio and alternative media.

No taboo topics.

1026

No fear of doom.

1027
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:56,170
We are American Freedom Radio.

1028
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:18,590
Welcome back to our number two of the Vinnie Eastwood show.

1029
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:24,050
Broadcasting via pirate radio signal from the private prisons run by General Zod.

1030
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:29,050
Located in the freshly terraformed Krypton colony of Auckland, New Zealand.

1031
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:34,370
Humanity's last and best hope in the fight against taking ourselves too seriously.

1032
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:37,490
Here's your host, Vinnie Eastwood.

1033
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:46,940
Welcome back to our number two of the fastest two hours and talk radio.

1034
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:52,080
It's the Vinnie Eastwood show broadcasting live on American Freedom Radio.

1035
01:00:52,900 --> 01:01:01,680
Now, if the studio is willing, I'd really like to open the call lines up and allow the listeners to ring in.

1036
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:04,200
I'll let you know when those lines are open.

1037
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:08,480
The number is 218-339-8525.

1038
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:12,580
That's 218-339-8525.

1039
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:19,280
If you're in New Zealand like me, you need to call like a plus one or a plus zero or something.

1040
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:23,880
It's definitely a plus one on top of that puppy for that international calling.

1041
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,320
And sometimes it doesn't actually even cost that much to call the States.

1042
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:31,020
I used to sell like toll calls for a living and stuff like that.

1043
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,000
It should be remarkably cheap.

1044
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:40,680
Sometimes it can even be cheaper than calling other places in New Zealand, depending on the time of the day.

1045
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:53,080
Anyway, I want to also kind of thank Brian Kelly for coming on and being a good dude.

1046
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,080
However, moving on.

1047
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:03,680
We were talking in the first hour about religion.

1048
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:12,880
The call lines are now open, so if you'd like to call in and express your thoughts on that or anything else, you want to ask me anything.

1049
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:14,880
Don't feel uncomfortable.

1050
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,420
Seriously, I'm Vinnie.

1051
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:19,440
I'm comfortable with everything.

1052
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:26,720
You can just come straight on up and ask me anything you want.

1053
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:31,520
So long as it's not abusive or defamatory or something.

1054
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:32,780
Within reason.

1055
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,160
So the caller lines are now open.

1056
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:40,840
The number is 218-339-8525.

1057
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:45,620
That's 218-339-8525.

1058
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:47,020
That's the number to ring in there.

1059
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,320
Please call in now.

1060
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,500
If you're listening, please call.

1061
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,100
Because I've run out of ideas.

1062
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,420
I'm coming to the end of my tether.

1063
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,520
I'm freaking exhausted.

1064
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:02,460
In the meantime, it's just going to be like a one-man therapy session.

1065
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,120
I'm just going to freaking unload on you.

1066
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:14,820
In the last hour, I talked about all the baggage that was being draped on me by all the people that I've got on as guests and all the trolls and everything that come out after the videos and just fucking with them all the time.

1067
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,140
It's like, oh, my God.

1068
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,620
Sometimes it's just too much, bro.

1069
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:21,680
Honestly.

1070
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:25,400
And it's not just like it's too much all of a sudden.

1071
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,520
It creeps up on you.

1072
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:33,760
And I think I only really get about two weeks warning.

1073
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:39,620
I can only handle about a fortnight worth of shows when I don't want to.

1074
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:47,140
That's the only reason why I'm here right now is because of my obligation to the network.

1075
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:48,200
Network didn't ask me.

1076
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,640
I can take any day off I want.

1077
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,520
But I feel obliged to be here.

1078
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:56,760
And the fact that I really don't feel like it is kind of inconsequential.

1079
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,760
I mean, really, there's a broader scheme at play here.

1080
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:09,900
However, I'm not going to risk burnout over it, which is why I'm going to be going on holiday soon.

1081
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,300
Holiday for me is doing nothing.

1082
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:22,120
Other people who work when their job sucks or whatever, and life is hard, et cetera, et cetera.

1083
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:28,160
However, when you're an activist, taking a holiday is simply not working.

1084
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:39,020
I just have to stay at home, maybe do some stuff around the house, maybe catch up on some stuff.

1085
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:40,460
It's not terribly exciting.

1086
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:49,740
I would like to go away somewhere, somewhere I haven't been.

1087
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:57,700
And I found out that because of my drug dealing conviction when I was a teenager,

1088
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,740
I have to disclose that to the US government if I ever want to come there.

1089
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,340
And in fact, I have to disclose it to everywhere.

1090
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:10,160
Because although New Zealand has a law called the Clean Slate Scheme,

1091
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:16,120
which says after seven years all your records are kept secret and nobody can even ask them for you,

1092
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:19,760
unfortunately, New Zealand legislation doesn't apply in other countries.

1093
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:23,000
That's the little caveat that they've got on that.

1094
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,820
And they don't advertise that widely as they should, I think.

1095
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:31,100
Clean Slate Scheme, it only helps you if you're in New Zealand.

1096
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,900
Which means you can't really leave the country.

1097
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:38,560
Not with a conviction like mine.

1098
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:42,560
I only had like frickin' 13 grams on me.

1099
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:47,280
That was it.

1100
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:50,900
And I got 300 hours of community service.

1101
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:53,040
I was lucky I didn't go to jail for up to eight years.

1102
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:57,560
They treat it more seriously than manslaughter, bro.

1103
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:01,070
They really do.

1104
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:06,490
There was a dude up in front of me who was like,

1105
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:14,580
growing five plants and sexual assault, resisting arrest.

1106
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:19,540
And this is like his umpteenth time in court.

1107
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,400
Gets 150 hours community service.

1108
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,920
I go up pleading guilty.

1109
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,140
13 grams of cannabis.

1110
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:32,320
First time I've ever been in trouble with a law at all.

1111
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:35,980
And 300 hours community service.

1112
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:37,940
Just like that.

1113
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:39,200
It was unbelievable.

1114
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:43,540
Almost as unbelievable as the guy who was before the guy in front of me.

1115
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:47,500
It was like some recovering heroin addict.

1116
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:56,380
Who was in there, quite literally, because he stole a jar of raspberry jam.

1117
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:01,660
And BP took him to court.

1118
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:04,400
You know, pay a lawyer to prosecute him and everything.

1119
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:12,900
And then the court ordered reparations of like $4.16 to replace the jar of jam.

1120
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:17,620
Oh man.

1121
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:19,920
Those were harsh times.

1122
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:23,140
You know, I almost have a panic attack when I start thinking about

1123
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,580
back, how hard it was and how young I was.

1124
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,160
How naive.

1125
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:31,440
My God, I was a very different creature back then.

1126
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:32,560
It was just 10 years ago.

1127
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:33,960
Bugger me.

1128
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:38,380
The years do fly when you're exposed in scumbaggery, I must say.

1129
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:45,120
And I think I've figured out the reason why time seems to pass quicker

1130
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,360
when you mostly focus on scumbaggery.

1131
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:54,160
It's because there's so much of it that you get lost in this kind of K-hole.

1132
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:56,060
The scumbaggery K-hole.

1133
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:03,080
And just a heads up, we've got a caller in there.

1134
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:07,880
The Greek wants to join in via Skype.

1135
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:13,340
So if you want to connect them up, AFR, that'd be lovely.

1136
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:17,040
Or Greek, if you want to message AFR and get them to bring you in.

1137
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,380
That will work as well.

1138
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:22,420
And kind of maybe talk on religion for a bit.

1139
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,180
The Greek talking about religion.

1140
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,220
Fuck me, that could be dangerous.

1141
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:36,040
I've really got to turn down the gain on my mic somewhat, don't I?

1142
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:38,160
It's like so loud.

1143
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:41,960
And I'm like laughing all the time and it's just like going crazy.

1144
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:43,260
It's terrible, isn't it?

1145
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:45,260
So sorry about that, ladies and gentlemen.

1146
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:46,180
Is this better?

1147
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:47,520
I hope it is.

1148
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:50,479
Because if not, I'm screwed.

1149
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:59,060
But yeah, I wanted to kind of relate the reason why I make jokes about everything.

1150
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:05,420
You want to know the real honest truth why I make jokes about everything?

1151
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:09,560
Because I'll go crazy if I don't.

1152
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:13,069
Real crazy.

1153
01:09:13,069 --> 01:09:17,250
You know, as simple as I can explain it,

1154
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:26,490
the terrible, terrible thing about being a comedian

1155
01:09:27,149 --> 01:09:31,590
is that you're smart enough to realize how bad things are

1156
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:35,410
and your only coping mechanism is to laugh at them.

1157
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:36,569
You can't change them.

1158
01:09:37,729 --> 01:09:41,210
You can explain them to people and help them see it for what it is.

1159
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:46,510
Seeing something for what it is is actually pretty powerful.

1160
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:50,170
I mean, here's another thing.

1161
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:52,670
A lot of truthers who don't contribute to the truth movement

1162
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:56,830
don't make videos or do radio shows or do activism of any kind.

1163
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:59,670
They're really hard on themselves and they shouldn't be.

1164
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:05,310
It's a big, big machine, this world.

1165
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:13,630
And if you don't have the kind of narcissistic flair that people like me have

1166
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:20,550
to get on talk radio and just riff it for hours on end just because you can,

1167
01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:24,710
don't feel bad about yourself that you're not contributing in that way.

1168
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:26,790
There's your own way to contribute somewhere.

1169
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:29,770
It might just be raising your kids right.

1170
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:36,450
Maybe your kids will do something really big in the future that will change the world.

1171
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:39,630
Just raising your kids right is good enough.

1172
01:10:39,930 --> 01:10:41,670
So I told somebody at a party this one time.

1173
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:44,770
Now we've been joined by the Greek.

1174
01:10:45,630 --> 01:10:46,750
He's the only Greek I know.

1175
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:49,940
Hey, mate.

1176
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:52,640
Hey, I've heard that before.

1177
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:57,000
Hey, and New Zealanders don't use the word mate.

1178
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,180
No, it's Kiwi.

1179
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:00,360
We use the word bro.

1180
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:02,260
Oh, that's right, bro.

1181
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,860
Like Hawaii, it's bra.

1182
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:06,000
I forgot about that.

1183
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,980
That's also in South Africa.

1184
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:12,960
Yeah, mate, I'll just have to go down to the shop to get some cigarettes, bra.

1185
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,680
Yeah, it's the bra.

1186
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,620
So what has gotten into you?

1187
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:19,100
Why do you want to discuss about religion?

1188
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:21,160
Or what about religion?

1189
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:26,320
Maybe I'm masochistic.

1190
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:36,280
I need a whole bunch of fucking crazy religious, zealous, crazy, fucking stupid people coming at me and attacking me for talking some sense.

1191
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:37,680
All right, all right.

1192
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:40,120
Religion just means something you do regularly.

1193
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,460
Like I do that religiously, right?

1194
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,440
I do this or that.

1195
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:48,140
Like I brush my teeth or tie my shoelaces and do talk radio, right?

1196
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:49,620
Or something like that, religiously.

1197
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:50,760
That's all it means.

1198
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,240
I think what people have turned it into is...

1199
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,020
Wait a second, wait a second.

1200
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:56,560
Does that mean you can masturbate religiously?

1201
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,100
Yeah, if you're a master.

1202
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:00,700
Or a priest.

1203
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:06,410
Sorry, you were saying?

1204
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:10,780
Have we lost you?

1205
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,600
Just for a moment.

1206
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:14,160
That wasn't very religious.

1207
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:16,940
Okay, all right.

1208
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:25,580
Well, I usually go around saying things like, you know, there's not a religion on the planet that does or knows anything.

1209
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:28,620
That's in the texts that they allegedly subscribe to.

1210
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:33,140
And I'll challenge anyone to bring up anything in any religion.

1211
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:41,420
And I will show you that what they're saying will not be found in context in any of the texts that they allegedly subscribe to.

1212
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:42,520
Period.

1213
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,120
That is a fact on this planet.

1214
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:48,660
So I think we've lost our minds.

1215
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,240
Because it's not really based on anything.

1216
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:54,520
Neither is the money, neither is medicine, neither is anything.

1217
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:57,000
So in that case it's a lie.

1218
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:06,300
Anything that has a major hierarchical structure and one big central leader or central figure that you're not allowed to question or bring to court on child pedophile charges, it's a cult.

1219
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:08,320
Or pedophile.

1220
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:11,760
A pedophile is someone who likes shoes.

1221
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:12,600
But anyway.

1222
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:17,650
No, no, actually there's also a pedophile is somebody who really likes bicycles.

1223
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:19,640
Right.

1224
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:22,100
Or a velophile, that would be.

1225
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:22,720
Anyway.

1226
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:26,400
And there's also a PDF file, but that's for a Word document.

1227
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:29,320
Yeah, for those that are wordy.

1228
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:43,600
But, okay, you know the secular historians, which are self-professed atheists typically, professors, they'll tell you this is the Christian era.

1229
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:49,120
So it is really when people say Christianity, you know, that is the predominant one.

1230
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:52,160
And in the news lately it's been the Islamic one.

1231
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:57,160
So, I don't know, which way you want to go?

1232
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:01,940
Well, I was also thinking the other day about persecution.

1233
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:07,680
Persecution of anybody for anything is not really a good thing if they're not harming anybody.

1234
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:13,280
But some Christians get persecuted and they freaking deserve it.

1235
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,760
You know, just like if you...

1236
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:22,260
What were those people who like hang out outside the... America's most hated family?

1237
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:27,000
They hang outside the graves of veterans holding big signs that said God hates fags.

1238
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:27,800
You know?

1239
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:29,860
Which God?

1240
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:35,760
Which God? Because the fags have their own God as well, so you're going to have to work that one out.

1241
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:36,400
But anyway.

1242
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:45,000
The fag God, you know, and they have a little bath house on top of Mount Olympus.

1243
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:46,700
There you go.

1244
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,400
Where the mounting goes on.

1245
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:57,000
Yeah, those Greeks, the guys would all do each other and then go home and beat their wives.

1246
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:58,700
Those ancient Greeks, yeah.

1247
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:04,000
But anyway, that was the festival, I guess, that's coming up that everyone...

1248
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,800
The darkest day of the darkest part of the month, you know, it's coming up here for everyone.

1249
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:09,620
They got their own version of it.

1250
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:13,020
But yeah, God is an oxymoron because there's many.

1251
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:16,760
It's kind of like saying aunt or...

1252
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:20,180
You know how we use language in a certain way that's accepted?

1253
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:21,700
You know, we could say it's an army.

1254
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,900
You know, we don't mean...

1255
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:26,420
Well, it's just one person in the army.

1256
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:28,420
We know when we say army, it's a multitude.

1257
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:33,300
And people have forgotten that when they say God, it's a multitude of gods.

1258
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,760
And that's in all of the ancient texts.

1259
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:38,260
And of course, who cares about what the ancient texts say?

1260
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,900
Because those people were ignorant and savage, of course, you know.

1261
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:43,860
We don't have to read any of that stuff.

1262
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:46,100
We have computers now.

1263
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:47,680
We don't have to read anything.

1264
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,800
We have religion now.

1265
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,140
We don't need to read what these things are supposedly based on.

1266
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:57,240
But yeah, that's one of the interesting parts.

1267
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,860
It's part of what I call cosmic censorship.

1268
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:05,600
The planet has been cosmically censored by forces.

1269
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:08,080
I'm not talking about the archons and the reptilians

1270
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,740
and all the crap you hear on the internet going on.

1271
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:13,580
Because if you listen to all that and see what it's based on,

1272
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:14,740
it's based on nothing again.

1273
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,940
But if you look at what's been memorialized for thousands of years,

1274
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,860
there is a cosmic censorship put on mankind

1275
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:25,680
to stuff up his ears and his eyes so he can't perceive.

1276
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:27,500
Isn't that interesting?

1277
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:29,660
Well, I don't know.

1278
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,560
It sounds like the mainstream media's job to me.

1279
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,060
Along with other things, yeah.

1280
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:36,560
And let's go back to the persecution.

1281
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:38,840
You know, all that persecution,

1282
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,020
a lot of those people that do the persecuting

1283
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:44,600
just want to persecute for any damn reason.

1284
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:46,500
It's just the way they are.

1285
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:51,820
I was also thinking the other day,

1286
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:54,160
and this is actually the thought that I originally had,

1287
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,480
but I forgot to express it,

1288
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,160
is that my heart actually goes out to people

1289
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,540
who are persecuted for their beliefs.

1290
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:01,880
You know?

1291
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:05,800
I really do feel that probably

1292
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:10,740
some of the widest persecuted groups at the moment

1293
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:12,220
are Muslims and Christians.

1294
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:14,100
And that's interesting,

1295
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:15,620
because they're persecuting each other.

1296
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:17,500
But hold on, but hold on.

1297
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,160
If all you're going on is belief,

1298
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:20,560
maybe you should be persecuted,

1299
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:22,240
because you're really stupid.

1300
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:22,920
Sorry.

1301
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:27,060
You need to actually pursue something that's substantive.

1302
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:30,820
What has happened is that people have,

1303
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,280
what's been put on them,

1304
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:33,820
because it's easy,

1305
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,060
it's kind of like, you know,

1306
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,820
eating out of a can or microwaving food.

1307
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:40,480
Who wants to cook an hour and a half dinner anymore, right?

1308
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,300
So what they do is they've convinced everyone,

1309
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:46,380
oh, you have a right to believe in what you want to,

1310
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:46,960
and that's it.

1311
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,260
You can't go to war when we tell you to.

1312
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:53,180
Well, you say that maybe they should reprioritize

1313
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:55,140
and try to live a life of substance,

1314
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,160
but do you think that having a belief

1315
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:59,660
instead of knowing what it is,

1316
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:01,620
do you think that that in and of itself

1317
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:04,560
can deprive somebody of having a life of substance?

1318
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:06,220
Oh, absolutely,

1319
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,840
because your life of substance is governed by law,

1320
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:11,980
meaning not traffic law or tax law or whatever,

1321
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:13,120
or cannabis laws,

1322
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:16,160
but law is what you eat, what you wear,

1323
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:17,140
how you keep time,

1324
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:18,640
how you raise a family,

1325
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,760
how you plant your crops,

1326
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:20,780
how you deal with your neighbor,

1327
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:21,760
how you get into a contract.

1328
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:22,640
You see what I mean?

1329
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:25,840
Law is like what they call ethics and morality,

1330
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:27,420
and also your functional,

1331
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,640
how you function in the world, right?

1332
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,540
That comes from your deity, from your God.

1333
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,200
Well, I pray to my God all the time.

1334
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,660
No, no, it's nothing to do with prayer.

1335
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:38,120
Now, prayer is when you,

1336
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,440
it's like in the military,

1337
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,040
you have the communications officer, right?

1338
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,520
That's the guy who communicates.

1339
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:47,660
That's what prayer is.

1340
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:48,960
You know, it's interesting.

1341
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,240
You ever seen the Christian meme?

1342
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,040
They show you putting your hands closed, right?

1343
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,160
You know, when they pray.

1344
01:18:56,700 --> 01:18:57,180
Yeah.

1345
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,380
That comes from Hinduism.

1346
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:03,020
Namaste.

1347
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:03,920
Yeah.

1348
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:07,940
Biblically, it's your hands are spread out

1349
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:08,720
and palms faced.

1350
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:14,160
Palms faced to something else.

1351
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:16,520
Greg, you're cutting out a little bit today there, bro.

1352
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:17,800
You still back with us?

1353
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:18,000
Why?

1354
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:22,720
Hands spread out, palms faced up.

1355
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:25,500
That's the method of communication

1356
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:29,000
for the biblical deity.

1357
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,500
Now, the Christian deity is,

1358
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,320
here's the thing.

1359
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:35,980
The Christian deity is not biblical.

1360
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:37,700
Zero percent.

1361
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:40,120
I've been looking at this for over a decade,

1362
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:42,200
and I haven't found anything

1363
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:44,600
that Christians do that's in the Bible.

1364
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:45,680
Now, hold on a second.

1365
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,240
That might sound very general and irrational,

1366
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,540
but if I try to maintain some rationality,

1367
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:52,560
if they did one out of a thousand

1368
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,020
or .01 percent of what they did was biblical,

1369
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:58,560
I'd have to grant them that, right?

1370
01:19:58,900 --> 01:19:59,820
To be rational.

1371
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,540
But I haven't found anything that Christians

1372
01:20:02,540 --> 01:20:05,020
believe in, say, or do that's in the biblical text.

1373
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:08,200
Now, that's fascinating to me,

1374
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:10,380
how far off and opposite the mark they are.

1375
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,080
Maybe it's because the biblical text

1376
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,220
was, you know, cobbled together

1377
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:17,440
a couple of hundred years ago in the New Testament,

1378
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:19,600
and it doesn't actually apply to today,

1379
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,100
you know, with all our technologies

1380
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:23,220
and our cultural changes and stuff like that,

1381
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,780
believing the earth is round and shit.

1382
01:20:27,940 --> 01:20:30,240
Well, there's actually several places in the Bible

1383
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:31,260
that tell you the earth is round.

1384
01:20:33,140 --> 01:20:33,520
So...

1385
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:34,860
Well, when I say and shit,

1386
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,340
I also mean just a broad-brush caveat

1387
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,960
of a whole bunch of superstitions

1388
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,720
that we're sort of left go of,

1389
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:42,660
even if they didn't believe in the flat earth at the time,

1390
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:44,140
as they didn't even believe

1391
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,580
that there was a flat earth

1392
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:46,700
in the time of the Greeks.

1393
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,680
You will never find a flat earth memorialized

1394
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:51,120
in any literature in history.

1395
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:52,420
Yeah, exactly.

1396
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,240
That is because people don't read

1397
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:55,160
and they make stuff up.

1398
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:57,520
What is it called, telephone or something?

1399
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,040
When someone tells a story to someone

1400
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,560
and when it's five times removed, it's changed?

1401
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,780
No, that's all that Chinese whispers in high school.

1402
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:07,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.

1403
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,320
Chinese whispers, yeah.

1404
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:09,560
It's better than Chinese handcuffs.

1405
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:18,100
But here's the interesting part

1406
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:21,120
about any deific communication.

1407
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,780
There's something called paganism,

1408
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,180
which is basically,

1409
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:28,500
the people were peasants

1410
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,120
and the feudal lord wanted them

1411
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:31,080
to do their job

1412
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,860
and when it was discovered

1413
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:35,540
that understanding what the gods

1414
01:21:35,540 --> 01:21:36,240
wanted to communicate

1415
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:37,360
required a lot of study,

1416
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,300
he just made up a couple of simple stories

1417
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,400
so they could go back to work.

1418
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:42,640
That's all your religion is on the world right now.

1419
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:45,080
Whether it's Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism,

1420
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,220
Christianity, Islam,

1421
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:48,380
they're all like that.

1422
01:21:48,460 --> 01:21:49,420
They're just little tales.

1423
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
None of them have anything to do

1424
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:51,780
with what's in the text.

1425
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:54,300
Now, what I mean by the paganism part,

1426
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,480
do they do in New Zealand,

1427
01:21:55,540 --> 01:21:56,040
when you go to court,

1428
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:56,940
they have you swear on a Bible,

1429
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:57,760
put your hand on the Bible,

1430
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:58,780
say the truth, all truth.

1431
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:00,540
No, no, no.

1432
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:01,420
In New Zealand,

1433
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,280
they just turn off the recording devices

1434
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:13,060
and most of them here,

1435
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:14,080
use them as door stops.

1436
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:16,500
They're just communications.

1437
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:17,880
What if you have it on a thumb drive?

1438
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:18,920
Can you swear on the thumb drive?

1439
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:19,820
You see what's going on here?

1440
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:21,240
It's a little rabbit's foot talisman.

1441
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:23,380
Humanity's been reduced to this

1442
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:24,820
little tiny slave class

1443
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:27,700
and the priests and the scholars

1444
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:29,380
that were familiar with these texts

1445
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:31,080
in any part of the world

1446
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,520
realized the proprietary of the information

1447
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:36,080
and looked at how people behaved

1448
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:37,080
and said,

1449
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:44,200
well, it was a bad judgment call

1450
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:45,220
because now the people,

1451
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:46,560
how are they going to elevate themselves

1452
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,500
and understand law and physics and science

1453
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:49,380
and all that stuff, right?

1454
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,280
Because there's a very high level of science

1455
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,800
in these ancient texts as well.

1456
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:54,560
So anyway,

1457
01:22:56,740 --> 01:22:58,300
I've spent the past 10 years

1458
01:22:58,300 --> 01:22:59,140
almost full time

1459
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:01,120
looking at all of the texts

1460
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:01,920
throughout the planet

1461
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,600
and it's hard to make these statements

1462
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:05,340
that I'm making.

1463
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:07,280
I really never wanted to say them in public

1464
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:15,020
because someday here coming

1465
01:23:15,020 --> 01:23:16,160
people are going to start

1466
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,140
trying to figure out

1467
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:18,480
why things aren't working out

1468
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:19,540
and they might actually go back

1469
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:20,600
and look at the materials

1470
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:23,160
that they're supposed to be based on,

1471
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:24,240
whether it's laws.

1472
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:26,980
That's why I think once in chat, Vinnie,

1473
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,720
I was looking for the New Zealand

1474
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,180
cannabis laws because they're all,

1475
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:33,740
typically they have a little thing.

1476
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:36,040
Could be the Misuse of Drugs Act 1978

1477
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,220
or 1976.

1478
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:38,100
That's right.

1479
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:43,160
And then there's another code

1480
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,080
that says it's been repealed

1481
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,780
because they hide that away.

1482
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:48,800
And the U.S. is Title 21, I believe,

1483
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:51,200
and possession has been repealed.

1484
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:52,540
It's just intent to distribute

1485
01:23:52,540 --> 01:23:54,100
and manufacture that people are.

1486
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:56,300
I don't know how you can manufacture cannabis,

1487
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,280
but anyway.

1488
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,960
With a Budman processing machine

1489
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,320
that churns, you know,

1490
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:05,160
bud goes in, joints come out.

1491
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:06,880
Yeah, it would be like

1492
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:07,720
counterfeiting money.

1493
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:08,740
I guess you need the right ink

1494
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:13,820
to do that.

1495
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:13,920
Okay.

1496
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,440
Yeah, that could work.

1497
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,620
Or conveyor belt.

1498
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:19,700
So with the religious part,

1499
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:21,320
your law comes from it.

1500
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,500
Now, here's the interesting part.

1501
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,380
It's a completely lawless society,

1502
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:27,700
completely at this point.

1503
01:24:27,800 --> 01:24:28,960
Now, it doesn't mean there's no order

1504
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,360
when what's what the mainstream

1505
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,600
puts in people's mind is

1506
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:32,460
if you don't have any law,

1507
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:33,140
there is no order.

1508
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:34,360
You can have a lot of law

1509
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:43,040
in the world.

1510
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:43,360
You know what I mean?

1511
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:44,860
America?

1512
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:47,240
Possibly.

1513
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,540
Which one, though,

1514
01:24:49,540 --> 01:24:50,940
North or South or both?

1515
01:24:52,740 --> 01:24:53,860
Is it North or South?

1516
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:55,520
Either way,

1517
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,240
it doesn't matter.

1518
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:00,200
It's still lawless.

1519
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:01,960
But New Zealand is the same.

1520
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,380
So the entire Western world

1521
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:04,740
and Eastern world is lawless

1522
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:05,320
at this point.

1523
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:07,220
Let's just throw in a little trivia,

1524
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,000
biblical trivia.

1525
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:10,540
I know because no one,

1526
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,520
I'm one of the five people on the planet

1527
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:13,820
who's read it, believe it or not.

1528
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,820
You have this thing called Christmas, right?

1529
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,220
Coming up.

1530
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,680
Now is the time for

1531
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:24,220
biblical TV trivia

1532
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:26,020
with your host, Luke Rieck.

1533
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:27,880
So there are these big mega churches

1534
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:28,820
over here in,

1535
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:30,300
well, I guess they have,

1536
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:33,060
do they have mega churches in Las Vegas?

1537
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:35,300
We have what's called Destiny Church

1538
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:36,520
where Bishop Brian Tamaki

1539
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:37,740
named himself Bishop

1540
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:39,760
and then gets a whole shitload of millions of dollars

1541
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:40,980
and buys several houses

1542
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:42,860
in swanky suburbs in Auckland

1543
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:44,460
and tells everybody he's a pauper.

1544
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,900
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about.

1545
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,120
So they have these big sites here

1546
01:25:50,940 --> 01:25:51,720
on the Internet

1547
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:52,160
and they say,

1548
01:25:52,220 --> 01:25:53,180
well, no one really knows

1549
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:56,040
when this J-E-S-U-S character was born,

1550
01:25:56,540 --> 01:25:57,840
so we're just going to go with it

1551
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,320
and it's not pagan.

1552
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:00,920
I'm like, wait a second.

1553
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:04,980
Well, you know how timekeeping

1554
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:06,700
changes from society to society

1555
01:26:06,700 --> 01:26:08,040
and giving a name or

1556
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,840
let's say an existing time period

1557
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:11,880
way of keeping time

1558
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,300
doesn't carry over, right?

1559
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:15,020
Like there was no January through December

1560
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:16,160
2,000 years ago

1561
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,560
or Monday through Friday.

1562
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:21,180
These are recent timekeeping inventions

1563
01:26:21,180 --> 01:26:22,440
so the way you keep time

1564
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:23,320
is astronomically

1565
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,660
because astronomical occurrences

1566
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:27,040
are extremely accurate

1567
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:29,100
and regardless of what timekeeping

1568
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:31,200
you use,

1569
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:33,620
the stars and moon and the sun don't lie.

1570
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:35,120
Exactly, and that way

1571
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,580
everything you do in your life

1572
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:39,700
has an astronomical chance of occurring.

1573
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:42,720
Yeah, or sub-astronomical

1574
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:43,960
in this case, being on Earth.

1575
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:46,200
But what's interesting,

1576
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,080
if you want to know,

1577
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:47,980
it's very specific,

1578
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:49,620
the Christ was a biblical Christ.

1579
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,660
Don't confuse this with Jesus, by the way,

1580
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:53,160
because there's like ten Jesuses.

1581
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:53,960
There's one that says,

1582
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:55,420
if you don't believe in me,

1583
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:02,140
you do this, you do that.

1584
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,420
It's just too confusing.

1585
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:04,340
They may have a black one,

1586
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:05,400
an Asian one,

1587
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:07,180
and also the letter J

1588
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:08,400
was invented in 1500,

1589
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,380
so unless you're into medieval history,

1590
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:11,300
forget it.

1591
01:27:11,640 --> 01:27:12,980
You hear that, Jesus?

1592
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,360
Your name doesn't even exist!

1593
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:18,160
And I've actually met

1594
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:19,940
a couple of Jesuses in the past

1595
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,660
out here, there's a really good

1596
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:22,740
fish taco shop

1597
01:27:22,740 --> 01:27:25,400
and he has J-E-S-U-S

1598
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:32,940
Jesus served me three fish tacos.

1599
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:34,280
It's like, bro,

1600
01:27:34,340 --> 01:27:36,300
has he got enough fish to feed the whole party?

1601
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:37,680
Yes, he fucking does!

1602
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:38,880
Yeah, he does.

1603
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:41,660
Now, here's the point.

1604
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,080
In the biblical text,

1605
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:46,020
I saw a great sign in the sky,

1606
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:47,280
it was a virgin giving birth,

1607
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:49,080
she was cloaked with the sun,

1608
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:49,900
the moon at her feet,

1609
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:51,260
and she had 12 stars at her head.

1610
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:53,940
Holy crap, that's the constellation Virgo,

1611
01:27:54,340 --> 01:27:55,660
Draco, part of the Draco

1612
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:56,980
is at the top of the constellation.

1613
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:01,780
He's in the middle of the constellation

1614
01:28:01,780 --> 01:28:05,780
and we know it's the middle of the month

1615
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:06,960
because it's a crescent moon,

1616
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:08,260
because the sun and the moon are in the west.

1617
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:11,020
So what you do is you go to an astronomical observatory

1618
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:11,660
and you say, hey look,

1619
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:13,620
I've got this constellation, the moon, the sun,

1620
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:14,980
and this here, when does this happen?

1621
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:16,760
And they'll tell you, oh yeah,

1622
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:20,420
this astronomical observation happens

1623
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:23,240
maybe three times every 20 years or so.

1624
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:25,860
Well, if you look at when the Christ

1625
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:26,780
was supposedly born,

1626
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:28,760
King Herod died two and a half years later

1627
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:32,320
and Caesar cast a census on his empire,

1628
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:34,120
so we know secular records show

1629
01:28:34,120 --> 01:28:36,240
between 2 AD and 8 BC.

1630
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:38,100
So you just go to the astronomical computer

1631
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:39,780
and you say, when did this event happen

1632
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,200
between 2 AD and 8 BC?

1633
01:28:42,740 --> 01:28:46,380
And you get a pinpoint day of 3 BC,

1634
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:49,160
the day of 11, the month of September.

1635
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:50,640
There you go.

1636
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,460
So that's when he was born

1637
01:28:53,460 --> 01:28:54,820
according to the Gregorian calendar.

1638
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:56,860
Now, does the 11th day of September,

1639
01:28:56,860 --> 01:28:59,100
has that somehow brought an inference?

1640
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:00,420
Yeah, I was going to say that.

1641
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:02,900
Yeah, September 11th,

1642
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:04,400
like somebody like did a star chart

1643
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,740
and then says, okay, well this is what they said

1644
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:08,940
the stars look like on the night of Jesus' birth.

1645
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:10,620
What date did that happen?

1646
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,040
Well, it had to be September 11th.

1647
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:14,200
Yeah, well that's,

1648
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:16,660
and this is, what I'm saying is not my opinion.

1649
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:17,520
It's not for debate.

1650
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:18,960
Anyone can do that.

1651
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:20,760
Anyone can look this up because

1652
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:22,480
when I first started doing this

1653
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:23,700
I had to go to a planetarium.

1654
01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:27,540
This was 12 years ago.

1655
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:29,020
The computing power,

1656
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,980
it just wasn't available to get that.

1657
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:35,300
So the university wanted 500 bucks to do it.

1658
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:36,500
But I went to the planetarium.

1659
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:38,900
We know they do the light show at night.

1660
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:41,040
And all the guys, they got nothing to do

1661
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,820
during the day, they're just smoking pot,

1662
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:44,100
whatever, and you go in there

1663
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:45,740
and they'll just show you the light.

1664
01:29:45,740 --> 01:29:47,680
I think you've confused the planetarium

1665
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:48,660
for the sanitarium.

1666
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:49,880
There you go, okay.

1667
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,400
So yeah, it was very interesting.

1668
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:54,080
So these things go on and on.

1669
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,200
Also they show you this little nativity scene

1670
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:57,140
with three wise men,

1671
01:29:57,260 --> 01:29:58,880
and we don't know how many, whatever.

1672
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,160
That's not true, that didn't happen

1673
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:03,000
because in the biblical text it says

1674
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,600
that these men from the east came

1675
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:06,880
when he was in his father's workshop.

1676
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:09,240
So he was about two and a half or three years old.

1677
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:10,840
Now what this is,

1678
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,000
I'm not saying that the biblical story is true

1679
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,280
or anyone should believe it or anything.

1680
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:17,260
I'm just showing the stark contrast

1681
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:18,760
between what people believe

1682
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:21,260
and what is in the text that they say

1683
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:23,160
they're being bribed to, right?

1684
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:25,560
The text is true.

1685
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,610
Let's just say this for a conjecture.

1686
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,560
Let's say the text is true,

1687
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:34,200
but nobody's read it or understood it.

1688
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,980
Does a tree make a sound if it falls

1689
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:38,000
and no one's there to hear it?

1690
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:39,080
No, no, no.

1691
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:41,180
If a man speaks his mind in a forest

1692
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:42,320
and no woman hears him,

1693
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:43,460
is he still wrong?

1694
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:46,140
Why does it matter?

1695
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:48,280
Isn't he the king of the castle?

1696
01:30:50,160 --> 01:30:51,640
I don't think so.

1697
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:53,660
Because she says so.

1698
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:55,020
I mean, look,

1699
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:57,180
the wife is the boss, all right?

1700
01:30:57,340 --> 01:30:59,920
She runs shit here.

1701
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:00,760
I just live here.

1702
01:31:01,340 --> 01:31:02,860
Well, here I'm the boss

1703
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:04,800
and I know that because she tells me I am.

1704
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:07,100
Anyway, never mind.

1705
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:09,460
You can't trust what women say, bro.

1706
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:11,480
Yeah.

1707
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:13,380
Okay, here's another one.

1708
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:16,720
You know in the Islamic community

1709
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:18,120
they think they're so righteous

1710
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:22,260
because the women are covered in hajibs

1711
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:24,320
and burqas and all that stuff, right?

1712
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:27,480
It's so righteous.

1713
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:30,400
Hey, and speaking of which,

1714
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,740
I saw an amazing video today

1715
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:34,180
of this Muslim couple

1716
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:35,860
and they had two seats

1717
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:37,420
and the street was flooded

1718
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:41,000
and the guy was standing in the water

1719
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,840
and he would take one seat

1720
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:46,660
and then put it in front of his wife

1721
01:31:46,660 --> 01:31:48,580
and she'd step from one seat to the other

1722
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:49,280
and he'd grab it

1723
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:51,700
and he made sure that she didn't

1724
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:53,160
drown in the floodwaters.

1725
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:55,160
I thought that was very sweet.

1726
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:57,400
Yes, but again,

1727
01:31:58,600 --> 01:31:59,460
if you read their text,

1728
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:00,940
well, in ancient times,

1729
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:01,740
let's just say it this way,

1730
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:02,640
in ancient times,

1731
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:04,040
you know what a uniform is,

1732
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:06,120
you could see what someone's profession

1733
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:07,480
is from a distance, right?

1734
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:10,920
In the ancient world up until recently,

1735
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:12,560
actually, in that part of the world,

1736
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:14,060
if you saw a woman that was covered

1737
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:16,780
the way women are supposedly covered today

1738
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:18,380
in that part of the world,

1739
01:32:24,930 --> 01:32:25,290
that's a constitution.

1740
01:32:25,970 --> 01:32:28,370
Yes, so these people have lost their minds.

1741
01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:30,390
It goes across the board.

1742
01:32:30,530 --> 01:32:32,290
All religions, they're just insane.

1743
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:35,090
Well, here's the good part.

1744
01:32:35,510 --> 01:32:36,990
You know, what you just said

1745
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:39,330
makes a whole shitload of sense right now.

1746
01:32:40,710 --> 01:32:42,510
Well, let me just,

1747
01:32:42,650 --> 01:32:43,890
there's a family actually

1748
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:45,490
that moved in not too far from here

1749
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:47,250
and the husband has the wife covered

1750
01:32:47,250 --> 01:32:49,230
and I'm suspecting it's a wife or a sister

1751
01:32:49,970 --> 01:32:51,490
and she's holding a baby

1752
01:32:51,490 --> 01:32:52,510
as she's walking around

1753
01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:56,250
for an hour with that woman, you know?

1754
01:32:56,350 --> 01:32:57,330
I mean, she's wearing the uniform.

1755
01:32:58,770 --> 01:33:00,310
But anyway, this is, yeah,

1756
01:33:00,410 --> 01:33:02,770
and they think it's a form of being righteous.

1757
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:04,310
It's just, this is,

1758
01:33:04,450 --> 01:33:05,230
who was it?

1759
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:07,190
Wolfgang Goethe.

1760
01:33:07,590 --> 01:33:09,310
He said that you need not visit

1761
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:12,450
an insane asylum to meet disordered spirits

1762
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:14,390
because the earth is the insane asylum

1763
01:33:14,390 --> 01:33:15,930
of the universe.

1764
01:33:17,850 --> 01:33:18,930
Sounds about right.

1765
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:20,730
There's madness everywhere you look.

1766
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:23,330
I mean, nobody can be on Facebook

1767
01:33:23,330 --> 01:33:25,050
or YouTube comment sections

1768
01:33:25,050 --> 01:33:26,890
for more than five minutes

1769
01:33:26,890 --> 01:33:29,510
before knowing that that is a self-evident truth.

1770
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:31,250
Yeah, I want to throw this in.

1771
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:32,070
Important.

1772
01:33:32,290 --> 01:33:33,950
Remember how we talked about being lawful?

1773
01:33:34,050 --> 01:33:34,530
What's lawful?

1774
01:33:34,570 --> 01:33:35,410
It comes from your deity.

1775
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:36,870
Well, it's very simple.

1776
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:38,590
If you don't have a deity,

1777
01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:39,930
then it's real simple.

1778
01:33:40,050 --> 01:33:41,450
Do you obey the laws of the state?

1779
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:42,250
Well, yes.

1780
01:33:42,370 --> 01:33:43,710
Okay, then the state is your God

1781
01:33:43,710 --> 01:33:45,050
and April 1st is your holiday.

1782
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:53,930
Well, same thing.

1783
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:56,630
Here's the interesting part.

1784
01:33:57,350 --> 01:33:58,690
You know what legal claims are

1785
01:33:58,690 --> 01:33:59,570
or lawful claims?

1786
01:33:59,710 --> 01:34:00,890
When someone makes a claim,

1787
01:34:01,110 --> 01:34:04,050
it stands until someone else rebuts it

1788
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:07,670
or counters it accordingly.

1789
01:34:07,950 --> 01:34:08,670
So if it's written,

1790
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:10,230
you should write it down

1791
01:34:10,230 --> 01:34:11,830
if you're going to rebut someone's claim.

1792
01:34:12,230 --> 01:34:14,090
What's interesting about the biblical text

1793
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:16,230
is there's some claims in there

1794
01:34:16,230 --> 01:34:18,410
that this particular group

1795
01:34:18,410 --> 01:34:19,830
created everything

1796
01:34:19,830 --> 01:34:22,210
and they sit at the highest position.

1797
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:23,910
And as far as I could tell,

1798
01:34:24,470 --> 01:34:25,730
it's never been rebutted.

1799
01:34:27,250 --> 01:34:28,570
So that requires,

1800
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:29,950
if you have a lawful mind,

1801
01:34:32,310 --> 01:34:33,070
some investigation.

1802
01:34:33,650 --> 01:34:35,270
Now, what I mean by that is,

1803
01:34:36,350 --> 01:34:37,570
someone could go to their house

1804
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:39,370
and have a white piece of paper

1805
01:34:39,370 --> 01:34:40,270
nailed to the door and says,

1806
01:34:40,330 --> 01:34:41,630
yeah, greetings, this house will be

1807
01:34:41,630 --> 01:34:42,930
foreclosed on in 30 days.

1808
01:34:43,270 --> 01:34:44,410
Well, if they don't have a lawful mind,

1809
01:34:44,450 --> 01:34:45,850
they just take it off the door

1810
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:50,510
and see what happens.

1811
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:52,470
Or if someone has a lawful mind,

1812
01:34:52,530 --> 01:34:53,370
looks at the notice and says,

1813
01:34:53,450 --> 01:34:54,950
oh, is there contact information here?

1814
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:56,790
Who's the authority?

1815
01:34:56,930 --> 01:34:58,430
I need to work this out

1816
01:34:58,430 --> 01:34:59,530
before it gets out of hand.

1817
01:35:00,010 --> 01:35:01,470
See, most people see these things,

1818
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:02,430
these claims,

1819
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:03,950
and they've been trained socially

1820
01:35:05,230 --> 01:35:06,630
to disregard them.

1821
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:09,520
It reminds me of this time

1822
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:10,920
that my wife accidentally

1823
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:12,340
put margarine on my toast

1824
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:13,580
and I asked her to scrape it off

1825
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:24,260
because margarine is alien.

1826
01:35:24,520 --> 01:35:25,840
You put margarine in the body,

1827
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:26,500
the body says,

1828
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:27,840
well, I don't know what to do with this.

1829
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:30,500
That never happened.

1830
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:31,540
That was a fictional story,

1831
01:35:31,700 --> 01:35:32,540
like the Bible.

1832
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:37,780
Here's another thing.

1833
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,960
Is the Bible actually 100% true?

1834
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:42,760
Because it's been so many thousands

1835
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:43,860
of years of whatever.

1836
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:45,840
Let's say,

1837
01:35:46,700 --> 01:35:48,140
if you've got a legal case,

1838
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:48,760
there's a thing called

1839
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:49,940
a statute of limitations.

1840
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,320
There's things called cold cases,

1841
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:57,960
things that are so old

1842
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:00,100
that nobody solved them at the time,

1843
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:01,140
and nowadays,

1844
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:02,320
there's just no fucking way.

1845
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:05,460
Maybe that's what the Bible is.

1846
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:08,440
It's a giant cold case

1847
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:10,980
that people are investigating

1848
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:12,600
and still haven't managed

1849
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:13,580
to come to the bottom of.

1850
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:15,080
Well, here's the thing.

1851
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:16,660
If it's a legitimate communication

1852
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:18,040
from a deity,

1853
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:20,140
it doesn't seem like,

1854
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:21,680
why would they act in futility?

1855
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:25,920
They have an IQ of 2 million or so,

1856
01:36:26,980 --> 01:36:27,560
let's say.

1857
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:29,380
But here's the thing.

1858
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:31,620
Have you ever heard of Aesop's fables,

1859
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:33,580
The Fox and the Grapes?

1860
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:36,120
No.

1861
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:39,820
Aesop was one of these Greeks,

1862
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:40,520
you know, right?

1863
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:42,980
The story of The Fox and the Grapes

1864
01:36:42,980 --> 01:36:44,320
was a fox is walking along a path.

1865
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:44,940
He's really hungry.

1866
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:46,200
He sees these beautifully ripe grapes

1867
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:47,280
and he says, oh, I'd like to have some.

1868
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,260
So he jumps up and he's trying to reach them

1869
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:51,240
and he's spending a good part of the afternoon.

1870
01:36:56,160 --> 01:36:56,580
Well, he's hungry now anyway.

1871
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,040
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1872
01:37:00,180 --> 01:37:00,440
Right?

1873
01:37:00,640 --> 01:37:02,620
So the biblical text is like this.

1874
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:04,580
For example, I've studied it quite a bit

1875
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:06,180
and it's a language of preservation

1876
01:37:06,180 --> 01:37:07,460
because it's never been translated,

1877
01:37:07,660 --> 01:37:08,500
by the way, into English.

1878
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:11,460
All the versions you get are not translations.

1879
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:14,420
There's 4,800 critical errors

1880
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:15,840
in the first 10,000 words.

1881
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:16,720
So anyway,

1882
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:20,480
it's just a communication.

1883
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:24,680
I'd never recommend that anyone

1884
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:27,540
go and read the biblical text or study it.

1885
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:27,800
Why?

1886
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:30,760
Because you're not going to understand

1887
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:31,640
anything in it anyway.

1888
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:32,640
So why waste your time?

1889
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:35,680
That's actually the conclusion I came to

1890
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:38,900
just before finishing Genesis.

1891
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:40,180
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1892
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:42,380
Well, first of all,

1893
01:37:42,420 --> 01:37:44,900
it's written on a 100th grade level

1894
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,600
and your, quote unquote,

1895
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:48,060
smartest professors are operating

1896
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:49,480
on a 5th grade level right now.

1897
01:37:50,140 --> 01:37:51,160
So you're not going to,

1898
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:52,300
there's no way you're going to do,

1899
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:55,620
it has to be deciphered.

1900
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:56,360
It's backwards.

1901
01:37:57,420 --> 01:37:58,500
But here's the thing,

1902
01:37:58,540 --> 01:37:59,120
that's irrelevant.

1903
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:01,040
All the ancient texts are very similar.

1904
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:03,600
But what's good about it

1905
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,580
is that you're coming up into

1906
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:06,720
a part of human history

1907
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,800
where people you've heard before

1908
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,220
are going to realize

1909
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:11,660
that they've got to go back to basics.

1910
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:12,340
Like you've heard,

1911
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:15,600
I think AFR used to run a David Icke voiceover

1912
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:16,020
where he said,

1913
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:17,920
look, we've got more lawyers than ever

1914
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:24,840
before, you know.

1915
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,500
The more banks, the more poor we are.

1916
01:38:27,620 --> 01:38:29,280
Doctors destroy health.

1917
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:30,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1918
01:38:32,200 --> 01:38:33,500
Lawyers destroy the law.

1919
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:35,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1920
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:36,800
I have it on here

1921
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:38,640
somewhere

1922
01:38:40,300 --> 01:38:41,520
on my computer.

1923
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:43,960
But yeah,

1924
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:45,200
here it is.

1925
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:46,880
Boom, I've found it.

1926
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:48,420
It's by Chris Hedges actually

1927
01:38:48,420 --> 01:38:50,140
and Icke was just quoting it.

1928
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:51,820
We now live in a nation

1929
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:55,360
where banks destroy justice,

1930
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:57,420
universities destroy knowledge,

1931
01:38:57,820 --> 01:38:59,200
governments destroy freedom,

1932
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:01,240
the press destroys information,

1933
01:39:01,780 --> 01:39:03,220
religion destroys morals

1934
01:39:03,220 --> 01:39:05,400
and our banks destroy the economy.

1935
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:06,420
Very good.

1936
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:08,800
Okay, now how much of that can a society,

1937
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,880
a planetary society take

1938
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:12,080
before,

1939
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:14,240
where all they have to do

1940
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,220
is stop and say,

1941
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:18,820
what are these things based on?

1942
01:39:19,460 --> 01:39:20,700
So they're going to call the lawyers

1943
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:21,340
on their laws,

1944
01:39:21,340 --> 01:39:22,780
they're going to call the religious people

1945
01:39:22,780 --> 01:39:25,060
where they get their information,

1946
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:26,160
they're going to call the doctors

1947
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:27,560
on their studies that you see.

1948
01:39:27,940 --> 01:39:29,280
This time has not come yet

1949
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,920
and when that time comes

1950
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:32,140
there's going to be some sanity.

1951
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:34,880
Is that what you've been waiting for, bro?

1952
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,560
Because you've got whole bunches of information

1953
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:38,960
that you've refused to share.

1954
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:40,600
You've started to bring it up

1955
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,940
and then decided not to share it.

1956
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:43,980
Is that what you're actually waiting for?

1957
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:46,940
The general realization by the planet

1958
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:48,460
that every single institution

1959
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:52,780
and then people

1960
01:39:52,780 --> 01:39:53,700
will be able to receive

1961
01:39:53,700 --> 01:39:55,460
what you can tell them?

1962
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:57,960
Man, I couldn't have said it better myself.

1963
01:40:00,100 --> 01:40:00,740
Thank you, Vinnie.

1964
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:02,900
Are you asking or telling?

1965
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,140
Well, I guess I just answered

1966
01:40:06,140 --> 01:40:06,940
my own question.

1967
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:10,580
There's a time for everything.

1968
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:11,480
It's just like, remember,

1969
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:12,660
have you ever heard of,

1970
01:40:13,320 --> 01:40:14,740
what is it, the guy who,

1971
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:17,000
back in the early 1900s

1972
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,480
who used to catalog all the anomalous,

1973
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,480
paranormal events,

1974
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:21,560
starts with an F, I think.

1975
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:22,260
What's his name?

1976
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:24,240
He was like the first,

1977
01:40:26,580 --> 01:40:27,020
anyway,

1978
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:28,680
they asked him,

1979
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:30,960
if all these,

1980
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:32,220
everything has been,

1981
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:33,880
there's nothing new under the sun,

1982
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:35,620
why did the steam engine

1983
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:36,980
only come out 100 years ago?

1984
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,780
He says, because it was steam engine time.

1985
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:42,460
You see, Hero's engine, 200 BC,

1986
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:43,720
the Greeks had a turbine,

1987
01:40:43,820 --> 01:40:44,400
a steam turbine,

1988
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:49,600
it wasn't steam engine time.

1989
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:51,580
They had to wait for Fulton.

1990
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:53,020
You see, so right now

1991
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:53,940
it's not time for that.

1992
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,780
You've got to know the right time as well, right?

1993
01:40:56,940 --> 01:40:59,440
Well, the elite have a sense of timing,

1994
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:01,600
and I think,

1995
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,600
what was it, astro-theology,

1996
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:05,640
you don't believe in astro-theology

1997
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:06,860
or any of that stuff?

1998
01:41:07,380 --> 01:41:08,200
Oh, no, well, astro-theology,

1999
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:10,280
all that stuff is the fox and the grape,

2000
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:11,600
so they don't understand what they're reading,

2001
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:12,620
so they'll make stuff up.

2002
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:16,000
It sounds good to other people.

2003
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:17,980
What do you believe, though?

2004
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,380
I mean, here's the thing,

2005
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:22,880
you don't actually have any beliefs,

2006
01:41:23,060 --> 01:41:24,140
you've got what you know

2007
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:25,960
and what you're curious about.

2008
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:27,920
Yeah, because they used to hang around

2009
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:29,080
farmers and miners.

2010
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:31,380
If you're on a mine or a farm

2011
01:41:31,380 --> 01:41:33,300
and you start talking beliefs,

2012
01:41:33,340 --> 01:41:34,640
you'll get kicked off that place

2013
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:35,940
because they have to function

2014
01:41:35,940 --> 01:41:36,960
on things that work.

2015
01:41:40,050 --> 01:41:42,750
Well, maybe that's an interesting way

2016
01:41:44,830 --> 01:41:45,950
that the world is misfiring,

2017
01:41:46,890 --> 01:41:47,490
misfunctioning,

2018
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:48,090
because,

2019
01:41:49,610 --> 01:41:51,430
just hear me out here,

2020
01:41:52,650 --> 01:41:55,050
maybe people are so stupid

2021
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:57,150
that they don't realise

2022
01:41:57,150 --> 01:41:57,970
that they're stupid.

2023
01:41:58,510 --> 01:42:00,050
I heard an interesting statistic

2024
01:42:00,050 --> 01:42:02,110
that tells you everything you need

2025
01:42:02,110 --> 01:42:03,070
to know about America.

2026
01:42:03,850 --> 01:42:06,350
Lewis Black, comedian, said this,

2027
01:42:06,670 --> 01:42:07,770
there was a recent study

2028
01:42:07,770 --> 01:42:09,470
in the United States

2029
01:42:09,470 --> 01:42:12,490
that determined that 4% of Americans

2030
01:42:12,490 --> 01:42:13,710
believe that they're below

2031
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:14,950
average intelligence.

2032
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:19,430
And it's always not the one

2033
01:42:19,430 --> 01:42:20,050
being interviewed,

2034
01:42:20,190 --> 01:42:20,890
it's the next guy,

2035
01:42:20,970 --> 01:42:21,710
like the T-shirt,

2036
01:42:21,870 --> 01:42:23,030
I'm with Stupid,

2037
01:42:23,230 --> 01:42:23,710
remember that,

2038
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:24,770
with the finger pointing over,

2039
01:42:25,010 --> 01:42:25,730
in the 70s?

2040
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:26,870
Exactly.

2041
01:42:28,410 --> 01:42:30,390
Stupid people are like insane people,

2042
01:42:30,650 --> 01:42:31,650
they don't know they're stupid.

2043
01:42:32,030 --> 01:42:32,970
Insane people don't know

2044
01:42:32,970 --> 01:42:34,030
that they're insane.

2045
01:42:42,490 --> 01:42:42,890
So I ask these questions,

2046
01:42:43,110 --> 01:42:44,030
am I going crazy?

2047
01:42:44,930 --> 01:42:46,310
But a crazy person does not.

2048
01:42:47,250 --> 01:42:47,710
Well look,

2049
01:42:47,850 --> 01:42:50,510
I think there's a level of stupidity

2050
01:42:50,510 --> 01:42:52,290
around with everyone,

2051
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:53,310
it's just that some people

2052
01:42:53,310 --> 01:42:54,770
are less stupid than others,

2053
01:42:55,390 --> 01:42:56,870
and there's a level of insanity

2054
01:42:56,870 --> 01:42:58,030
going around with everyone

2055
01:42:58,030 --> 01:42:59,890
and some people are just less insane

2056
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:00,470
than others.

2057
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:01,830
You know what it's like?

2058
01:43:02,110 --> 01:43:04,390
It's like when I was in a wood shop

2059
01:43:04,390 --> 01:43:05,650
and we had to plane

2060
01:43:06,810 --> 01:43:08,290
these little shafts

2061
01:43:08,290 --> 01:43:10,050
of bloody wood off this thing

2062
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:11,010
in order to smooth it down

2063
01:43:11,010 --> 01:43:12,050
to the shape that we want.

2064
01:43:12,530 --> 01:43:13,810
Get this one off,

2065
01:43:13,910 --> 01:43:14,710
and that one off,

2066
01:43:14,730 --> 01:43:15,490
and this one off,

2067
01:43:15,510 --> 01:43:16,270
and this one off,

2068
01:43:16,350 --> 01:43:17,530
and before you know it

2069
01:43:17,530 --> 01:43:18,630
you've actually got something

2070
01:43:18,630 --> 01:43:20,290
that you can be proud of,

2071
01:43:20,410 --> 01:43:22,370
something that's got craftsmanship.

2072
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:23,570
But it takes a hell of a lot

2073
01:43:23,570 --> 01:43:24,630
and you have to discard

2074
01:43:24,630 --> 01:43:27,950
most of what you had to start with.

2075
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:35,910
It's like climbing a glacier

2076
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:37,130
and getting off the stinking rock.

2077
01:43:37,230 --> 01:43:37,550
But anyway,

2078
01:43:38,070 --> 01:43:39,010
did I just say that on air?

2079
01:43:39,230 --> 01:43:41,870
Okay, so anyway,

2080
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:43,710
you see how it goes?

2081
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:47,540
Everything's just kind of nuts anyway,

2082
01:43:48,640 --> 01:43:49,520
and maybe,

2083
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:51,340
maybe that's part of the reason

2084
01:43:51,340 --> 01:43:52,420
why so many truthers

2085
01:43:52,420 --> 01:43:53,560
think that they're going crazy,

2086
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:54,900
is because everything else

2087
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:56,820
is fucking nuts, right?

2088
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:59,420
And everything's so stupid.

2089
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:00,200
Have you ever noticed

2090
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:08,980
that?

2091
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:09,680
Well, you know,

2092
01:44:09,740 --> 01:44:11,480
just on a tangent here,

2093
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,860
which is along the same path,

2094
01:44:13,300 --> 01:44:14,680
there's a lot of talk about

2095
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:16,340
misinformation, disinformation,

2096
01:44:16,700 --> 01:44:17,620
lack of information,

2097
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:18,860
ignorance, stupidity.

2098
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,820
I haven't found that to be

2099
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:21,960
the main problem.

2100
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:23,080
The main problem is

2101
01:44:23,080 --> 01:44:25,260
when you confront someone

2102
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:26,480
with a piece of information

2103
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:28,400
that is newly imparted to them,

2104
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:29,700
okay, new to their psyche

2105
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:30,480
and consciousness,

2106
01:44:30,940 --> 01:44:32,740
put cognitive dissonance aside.

2107
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:34,560
We're talking about rational thought here,

2108
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:35,580
okay, and critical thought.

2109
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:37,440
Very often you'll get,

2110
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:39,600
you know, I haven't heard of that before,

2111
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:41,200
and you know what?

2112
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:43,080
I don't want to know about that,

2113
01:44:43,120 --> 01:44:44,000
and I don't care.

2114
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:46,520
Wow.

2115
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,620
Okay, so that's not ignorance anymore.

2116
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:51,540
That is a response

2117
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:54,040
of stubbornness, rebelliousness,

2118
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:55,500
let's say apathy.

2119
01:44:56,220 --> 01:44:57,440
Do you get where I'm going with it?

2120
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:58,140
No.

2121
01:44:58,440 --> 01:44:58,920
It's fear.

2122
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:00,700
They're afraid to admit

2123
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:01,300
that they're wrong

2124
01:45:01,740 --> 01:45:02,640
because they've been taught

2125
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:03,820
throughout their entire life

2126
01:45:03,820 --> 01:45:05,420
that being wrong is a bad thing

2127
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:07,040
as opposed to an experience

2128
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:07,860
you can learn from.

2129
01:45:08,060 --> 01:45:08,620
Well, hold on.

2130
01:45:08,720 --> 01:45:10,080
I didn't say something right or wrong.

2131
01:45:10,180 --> 01:45:11,660
This is a new bit of information

2132
01:45:11,660 --> 01:45:12,900
that they could have never gone

2133
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:14,280
either left or right on it.

2134
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:15,720
This is a totally new bit

2135
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:16,380
of information.

2136
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:18,680
It doesn't conflict

2137
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:20,040
with their belief structure at all?

2138
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:21,180
It's just a random factoid?

2139
01:45:22,040 --> 01:45:22,500
Yeah, yeah.

2140
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:23,620
Like, let's say chemtrails,

2141
01:45:23,700 --> 01:45:24,560
you know, sometimes I'll be

2142
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:25,180
in a parking lot

2143
01:45:25,180 --> 01:45:26,080
and I'll see a rational,

2144
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:28,540
a seemingly rational individual

2145
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:29,520
and I'll say,

2146
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:30,110
well, you know,

2147
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:31,320
it's interesting,

2148
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:32,620
there's not contrails, you know.

2149
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:33,080
I'll say, oh, really?

2150
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:33,860
I've never noticed that.

2151
01:45:34,580 --> 01:45:35,340
They're steam, right?

2152
01:45:35,380 --> 01:45:36,100
I'll say, no, they're not steam.

2153
01:45:36,220 --> 01:45:37,700
I'll explain why they're not steam.

2154
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:38,240
They're like, you know what?

2155
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:39,660
Yeah, I'm not into that.

2156
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:40,500
I don't want to know about it.

2157
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:41,220
I'm like, dude,

2158
01:45:41,380 --> 01:45:42,660
you're breathing it.

2159
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:43,000
What do you mean

2160
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,160
you don't want to know about it?

2161
01:45:45,140 --> 01:45:46,900
Well, it's the psyche.

2162
01:45:47,960 --> 01:45:48,400
No, no, no.

2163
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:49,560
Because those people

2164
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:50,540
are operating under

2165
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:51,300
a belief structure.

2166
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:52,520
The belief structure is

2167
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:53,840
I'm not a lab rat

2168
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:55,480
in a giant open-air

2169
01:45:55,480 --> 01:45:55,940
fucking

2170
01:45:56,700 --> 01:45:57,960
breathe tank experiment.

2171
01:45:58,240 --> 01:45:58,440
Okay?

2172
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:00,220
Hold on.

2173
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:01,840
Yeah, but it's not about belief.

2174
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:02,440
There's just like,

2175
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:03,440
go to a Christian,

2176
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:04,080
open the Bible

2177
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:05,940
and show them something in there.

2178
01:46:06,020 --> 01:46:06,840
The first thing they'll tell you,

2179
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:08,200
well, that's not my Bible

2180
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:10,080
so it can't be the same thing in there.

2181
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:11,140
Or, you know,

2182
01:46:11,220 --> 01:46:13,240
I have three books in the car.

2183
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:14,220
I have the Book of Mormon,

2184
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:14,960
the Koran,

2185
01:46:15,380 --> 01:46:16,180
and the Bible.

2186
01:46:16,340 --> 01:46:17,200
So if I ever get into

2187
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:18,480
these conversations in public

2188
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:19,220
and they want to argue,

2189
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:20,260
I say, I happen to have a copy

2190
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:21,220
in the car right here.

2191
01:46:22,540 --> 01:46:24,740
And I once had a parking attendant

2192
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:27,580
who was a Muslim, self-professed,

2193
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:29,100
and he was telling me

2194
01:46:29,100 --> 01:46:29,920
about this and that,

2195
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:30,340
this and that.

2196
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:31,600
I said, where'd you hear that?

2197
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:32,140
And he said,

2198
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:33,840
well, at the mosque with the imam.

2199
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:35,120
I said, that's not in the Koran.

2200
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:35,960
He says, yes it is.

2201
01:46:35,980 --> 01:46:36,200
And I said,

2202
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:38,300
I happen to have a copy right here.

2203
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:39,060
Let me show you.

2204
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:40,040
You see?

2205
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:41,000
It just, yeah.

2206
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:41,860
So the belief,

2207
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:43,200
what does belief have to do with it?

2208
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:45,180
Well, I think

2209
01:46:46,620 --> 01:46:48,160
what you do is

2210
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:50,820
eventually you lose curiosity

2211
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:52,880
and you don't want to know.

2212
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:53,520
All right?

2213
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,300
It's not like you can't know.

2214
01:46:55,480 --> 01:46:56,680
It's that you don't want to.

2215
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:57,040
All right?

2216
01:46:57,060 --> 01:46:58,440
But how can you lose curiosity?

2217
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:00,260
You can lose curiosity

2218
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:03,660
by a number of different mechanisms.

2219
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:05,740
Curiosity, for example,

2220
01:47:05,820 --> 01:47:06,620
getting punished.

2221
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:07,220
You know,

2222
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:08,320
if you're curious about something

2223
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:09,940
and you go do that at work

2224
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:10,320
or whatever

2225
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:11,400
and you fuck something up

2226
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:12,880
and the boss punishes you

2227
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:13,700
or even maybe

2228
01:47:13,700 --> 01:47:16,420
that could start to manifest

2229
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:18,140
during your younger years

2230
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:20,460
and your parents punish you

2231
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:21,960
for questioning certain things

2232
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:22,500
or whatever.

2233
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:24,380
And basically,

2234
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:26,380
through a series of

2235
01:47:26,380 --> 01:47:28,220
trauma-based mind control incidents

2236
01:47:28,220 --> 01:47:29,820
called modern life,

2237
01:47:30,180 --> 01:47:32,220
you can lose your curiosity

2238
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:33,460
quite easily

2239
01:47:33,460 --> 01:47:35,320
and most people have already.

2240
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:37,860
You know what's interesting?

2241
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:38,780
I'll throw this in there.

2242
01:47:38,840 --> 01:47:41,580
I've seen that in ancient life as well

2243
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:43,120
through what's been memorialized.

2244
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:45,800
You know,

2245
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:47,660
the ancients were like this as well.

2246
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:50,760
When an old idea gets old enough

2247
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:52,680
that it becomes forgotten,

2248
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:54,420
when it returns,

2249
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:56,100
people think that it's new.

2250
01:47:56,580 --> 01:47:56,840
Yeah.

2251
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:59,980
That's why if you want a really new idea,

2252
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:01,440
read a really old book.

2253
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:05,300
When the hell was the last time

2254
01:48:05,300 --> 01:48:06,320
somebody actually came up

2255
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,140
with a new idea?

2256
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:09,400
Oh, no.

2257
01:48:09,440 --> 01:48:10,920
We'd have to redefine the word new

2258
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:12,360
if nothing is new.

2259
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:16,000
There's nothing new under the sun.

2260
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:17,400
It's all just a repetition

2261
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:18,840
and stuff like that.

2262
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:20,060
God damn it.

2263
01:48:20,180 --> 01:48:21,920
There's an experiment going on here.

2264
01:48:22,140 --> 01:48:23,760
That's what I'm starting to really think about.

2265
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:25,080
There's actually a point,

2266
01:48:25,340 --> 01:48:27,120
like a computer game,

2267
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:27,840
or a hologram,

2268
01:48:27,940 --> 01:48:28,860
or something like that.

2269
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:30,820
There's actually an objective here.

2270
01:48:31,240 --> 01:48:33,380
Now, the human race hasn't fulfilled

2271
01:48:33,380 --> 01:48:36,780
whatever the fuck that objective is yet.

2272
01:48:37,260 --> 01:48:38,180
And until we do,

2273
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:39,480
we're going to keep repeating

2274
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:40,640
the same fucking cycles.

2275
01:48:41,040 --> 01:48:41,540
No, you're not.

2276
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:42,500
Hold on, it has.

2277
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:45,920
Because it's just like baking a cake.

2278
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:46,920
It needs a cure.

2279
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:48,320
There's a curing period.

2280
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:50,500
Just like a cake is, what,

2281
01:48:50,540 --> 01:48:51,960
45 minutes at a certain temperature

2282
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:55,540
or certain epoxies hold for 30 minutes.

2283
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:57,120
There's a curing period.

2284
01:48:57,220 --> 01:48:58,680
In other words, until it's set.

2285
01:48:59,740 --> 01:49:01,580
And that period ended already.

2286
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:04,240
And that's what's so freaking exciting.

2287
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:07,000
But the problem is that time isn't reckoned

2288
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,180
with the Gregorian Pope's work schedule.

2289
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:10,840
So, anyway.

2290
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,860
You know how they say it's 2015 or whatever?

2291
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:15,380
Whatever happened all the other years before that?

2292
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:16,740
What the hell's going on?

2293
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:18,920
And if today is what they call

2294
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:20,220
whatever this day of the week,

2295
01:49:20,280 --> 01:49:21,540
last year was another day of the week.

2296
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:22,700
So what day of the week is it?

2297
01:49:22,980 --> 01:49:25,480
You know, the biggest problem that I see

2298
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:27,240
is that everyone is,

2299
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:28,020
that's not a problem.

2300
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:29,600
I don't really see it as a problem.

2301
01:49:29,780 --> 01:49:31,160
I'll retract that statement.

2302
01:49:31,580 --> 01:49:33,700
Is that everyone is operating

2303
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:35,040
under the Pope's work schedule.

2304
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:36,900
And even something maybe as trivial

2305
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:39,320
and as minimal and as insignificant

2306
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:41,040
as keeping time has been lost.

2307
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:45,880
It's a very heavy slave outline

2308
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:47,080
that's been put on mankind,

2309
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:48,500
which is the Pope's work schedule.

2310
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:50,820
That's why when I hear people

2311
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:51,920
bad-mouthing the Vatican,

2312
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:54,240
all I have to do is ask them what day it is.

2313
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:55,940
And if they say anything between January

2314
01:49:55,940 --> 01:49:57,580
or December, Monday through Friday,

2315
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,160
they're admitting with their own mouth

2316
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:01,300
that they're the Pope's subject.

2317
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:03,080
So they're pretty twisted.

2318
01:50:03,900 --> 01:50:07,460
But not that bad-mouthing the Vatican

2319
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:08,880
is twisted, but I'm just saying

2320
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:11,580
that people don't have their house in order.

2321
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:13,220
You've got to get it in order first

2322
01:50:13,220 --> 01:50:16,120
before you go about and do things like that.

2323
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:19,220
That's why I sort of kind of stay retracted.

2324
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:21,800
But anyway, I'm open to all suggestions

2325
01:50:21,800 --> 01:50:23,460
and considerations if there's anything

2326
01:50:23,460 --> 01:50:24,900
you'd ever want to hear discussed.

2327
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:27,420
So I'll just put that out there.

2328
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:29,600
Yeah, I don't know.

2329
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:30,460
I was just thinking about

2330
01:50:30,460 --> 01:50:32,080
the purpose of life itself.

2331
01:50:32,560 --> 01:50:34,680
For me, it's quite easy to find

2332
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:35,840
my purpose in life.

2333
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:38,760
But I'm talking about life in the aggregate.

2334
01:50:39,060 --> 01:50:41,260
I'm talking about all the organisms

2335
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:42,840
and everything.

2336
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:46,660
It's working together in some way

2337
01:50:46,660 --> 01:50:47,860
in a symbiotic fashion.

2338
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:51,620
And behaving independent of each other.

2339
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:54,080
But is there actually an overall purpose?

2340
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:57,640
There's a reason why this fish died today

2341
01:50:57,640 --> 01:50:59,400
of radiation poisoning and a reason

2342
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:01,180
why that squirrel died yesterday

2343
01:51:02,340 --> 01:51:04,660
after getting run over by a kid

2344
01:51:05,420 --> 01:51:07,080
that stole his mum's Jeep

2345
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:10,460
and filled it up with really high-octane petrol

2346
01:51:10,460 --> 01:51:12,280
and drag-raced his mates on a skateboard

2347
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:14,420
that had rocket boosters attached to it

2348
01:51:14,420 --> 01:51:15,740
and the poor squirrel got run over.

2349
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:19,100
There's a purpose that's an overlying

2350
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:21,880
real strange interconnected web.

2351
01:51:22,460 --> 01:51:23,080
And here it is.

2352
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:24,520
It's very simple.

2353
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:27,940
Humanity is too egocentric.

2354
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:30,380
The world revolves around me.

2355
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:31,320
It's all about us.

2356
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:32,680
We'll get over it. It's not.

2357
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:36,080
There's a multitude of cosmic things

2358
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:37,160
going on right now.

2359
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:39,100
And there's an element or an entity

2360
01:51:39,100 --> 01:51:42,040
called death, as you so gave us

2361
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:42,860
the examples on.

2362
01:51:42,860 --> 01:51:45,020
And when this element,

2363
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:46,340
this thing called death,

2364
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:48,220
or in other circles it might be called

2365
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:50,320
entropy, which is degradation, rot,

2366
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:52,560
decay, entropy.

2367
01:51:53,020 --> 01:51:54,600
Like an energetic system suffers

2368
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:56,840
entropy when they lose their power.

2369
01:51:57,720 --> 01:52:00,100
This entropic destruction

2370
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:01,600
or something called death.

2371
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,020
This is a time for its peaking.

2372
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:07,680
And death will be put to death.

2373
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:10,860
It actually already has at some point.

2374
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:12,500
Not here.

2375
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:14,880
And when it reaches here, meaning the Earth,

2376
01:52:14,980 --> 01:52:16,140
there will be no more death.

2377
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:18,780
And that will really change the consciousness.

2378
01:52:19,120 --> 01:52:21,200
And what I mean by that is imagine being born

2379
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:23,060
and not going through puberty

2380
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:24,680
until you're about 35 or 40.

2381
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:26,820
You know, if there's a funeral

2382
01:52:26,820 --> 01:52:28,700
for someone at 100 years old,

2383
01:52:28,740 --> 01:52:29,760
it'll be a child's funeral.

2384
01:52:30,980 --> 01:52:33,240
So this is kind of pretty amazing.

2385
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:34,800
And yes, there is a meaning of life.

2386
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:36,900
And it's not about us right now, even though it is.

2387
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:40,840
Yeah, that sounds about right.

2388
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:44,080
It's when death, it's very difficult to see.

2389
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:45,760
Here's another analogy of it.

2390
01:52:45,780 --> 01:52:47,580
Have you ever heard of anyone being brought up

2391
01:52:47,580 --> 01:52:50,020
or raised or born in a war zone?

2392
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:52,340
You know, if you ever discussed anything

2393
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:54,360
with old European people,

2394
01:52:54,460 --> 01:52:55,780
oh, I was born during the war,

2395
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:57,060
and childhood was terrible.

2396
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:59,720
We had to eat shoes and couldn't find any food

2397
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:00,120
and all that.

2398
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:02,860
This is a period of over 6,000 years

2399
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:04,640
where mankind has been in a war zone.

2400
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:06,340
Don't take it personally.

2401
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:09,420
Yeah, the meaning of life is quite simple.

2402
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:10,600
It's just that it's so simple

2403
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:11,640
that it can't be described

2404
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:13,000
because we're mid-range thinkers.

2405
01:53:13,420 --> 01:53:15,260
We cannot comprehend the complex

2406
01:53:15,260 --> 01:53:17,460
and we cannot comprehend the simple.

2407
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,440
And explaining the meaning of life

2408
01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:20,980
in a mid-range way is very difficult.

2409
01:53:20,980 --> 01:53:23,120
But I just use the contrast

2410
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:24,540
that when there is no more death,

2411
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:26,160
you will see more meaning

2412
01:53:26,160 --> 01:53:27,660
in what just happened,

2413
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:30,220
the entire human epoch.

2414
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:32,900
Well, that's because at the point

2415
01:53:32,900 --> 01:53:34,560
where you no longer fear death,

2416
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:36,020
you're not struggling in the survival

2417
01:53:36,020 --> 01:53:38,080
because when you're struggling for survival,

2418
01:53:38,260 --> 01:53:40,500
you're in a lower brain fight-or-flight mode

2419
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:42,400
and you can't access higher fucking consciousness.

2420
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:44,400
So imagine how many people

2421
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:47,180
would be able to access higher consciousness

2422
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:49,400
if they had no fear of death.

2423
01:53:49,620 --> 01:53:50,540
Yeah, but look,

2424
01:53:50,900 --> 01:53:52,320
okay, fear of death,

2425
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:53,040
I don't like that.

2426
01:53:53,400 --> 01:53:54,900
Look, I'll just throw in this,

2427
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:56,600
it's not whether I like it or not,

2428
01:53:56,600 --> 01:53:58,120
but the ancient Greeks

2429
01:53:58,120 --> 01:54:00,360
used to say that those who were afraid of dying

2430
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:01,960
or have fear don't know how to live.

2431
01:54:02,420 --> 01:54:04,160
So maybe focusing on how to live better

2432
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:05,540
and then the fear part goes away.

2433
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:07,980
Yeah, well,

2434
01:54:08,580 --> 01:54:10,500
like I said before, it makes sense

2435
01:54:10,500 --> 01:54:12,460
because to me, the only things

2436
01:54:12,460 --> 01:54:14,140
that make sense have some kind of cosmic

2437
01:54:14,140 --> 01:54:15,260
irony to them.

2438
01:54:16,200 --> 01:54:18,060
Oh yeah, there's a sense of humor, there's irony,

2439
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:19,580
there's everything, yeah.

2440
01:54:20,200 --> 01:54:21,620
Everything is something

2441
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:24,180
and nothing, right?

2442
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:26,180
That's cosmic irony.

2443
01:54:26,820 --> 01:54:28,380
Like, for example, somebody could be

2444
01:54:28,380 --> 01:54:30,240
a great lover and a complete

2445
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:30,720
bastard.

2446
01:54:33,340 --> 01:54:34,240
Alright, well,

2447
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:35,840
anyway, the Greek, thank you very much.

2448
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:37,100
It was great.

2449
01:54:37,600 --> 01:54:39,820
And ladies and gentlemen, remember on Sunday

2450
01:54:39,820 --> 01:54:42,260
to check out the American Freedom Radio Marathon

2451
01:54:42,260 --> 01:54:44,220
we need to raise some

2452
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:46,220
cash for the studio, so please

2453
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:48,020
check that out, promote it,

2454
01:54:48,300 --> 01:54:50,240
share it out on social media,

2455
01:54:50,780 --> 01:54:52,300
email your congressman

2456
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:54,300
and stuff like that, tell them to shut us down

2457
01:54:54,300 --> 01:54:56,360
because if they do shut us down, it'll give us a hell of a lot

2458
01:54:56,360 --> 01:54:57,080
more attention. Please,

2459
01:54:58,320 --> 01:54:59,960
just go apeshit, alright?

2460
01:55:00,780 --> 01:55:02,120

Hemp is not marijuana, and marijuana is not hemp.

Are you the kind of person that lets everyone else

2500
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:55,260
do all the work, just hoping that you'll be able

2501
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:57,900
to get some of the crumbs that fall from the table?

2502
01:56:58,120 --> 01:57:00,860
Or are you the kind of person that rolls up their sleeves

2503
01:57:00,860 --> 01:57:04,080
and does the dirty jobs that no one else wants to do?

2504
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:07,080
Are you hoping that all the activists giving their blood,

2505
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:09,540
sweat, and tears to serve humanity

2506
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:11,840

2507
