1
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,620
That's true, Dr. Zayas.

2
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,140
Here we go from the Sunshine State.

3
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,840
I'm Greg Carlwood, and do you ever feel like life has lost its meaning?

4
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:57,500
That so much time and attention is sucked up by the construct and the cage conveniently placed around our ability to do almost anything?

5
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,560
A litany of limiting factors that are largely artificial but hold us back nevertheless?

6
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:13,020
Money, time, employment, bureaucracy, logistics, and the always flashy and seductive screen-based everything tend to steal the majority of any given lifetime.

7
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:20,240
And few people ever even ask what life might actually be for or challenge the monstrous matrix of the capstone cabal.

8
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:27,420
Well, if the game has been to make people ignorant of or even enjoy their servitude, then someone somewhere is certainly winning.

9
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,780
But today we're going to unpack a lot of what plagues us, examine the suppressed or hidden mechanisms that drive the unadulterated world,

10
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:42,240
and try to get a bead on that almighty truth with a capital T by talking with a couple of knowledgeable and philosophical free thinkers

11
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,120
who lay out much of their mindset and positions on various subjects through the website Greekspeak.com,

12
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,880
where the majority of the content, insights, and ideas come from a man known as the Greek.

13
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,400
And the website and methodical presentation of the material is laid out by his associate, the Archon.

14
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:07,479
There you can find detailed articles and podcast episodes covering everything from cosmic censorship, communication, and education,

15
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,460
to the corrupted sciences, food and diet, the economy, the legal system, and more.

16
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:20,100
I've certainly enjoyed their work and learned a lot from the insights and curious anecdotes of the Greek, and I'm psyched to get into it with them today.

17
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:28,680
The Greek-speak architects, intellectual explorers of everything, and cultural critics, the Archon and the Greek, welcome to the Higher Side.

18
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,260
Oh, thanks for having us, Matt.

19
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,660
Yes, thanks for having us, Greg.

20
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,320
Yeah, this is going to be great. I have heard hours of your material, talking together, and enjoyed it quite a lot.

21
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,720
You cover pretty much all aspects of life, culture, and society.

22
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:49,900
And I've heard the Greek describe himself as someone who's just visiting the Earth and taking notes, which I like.

23
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:57,720
But what can you guys tell us about how you forged this relationship, your goals for the Greek-speak venture,

24
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,340
and ultimately, where you've cultivated your knowledge and wisdom that people will find there?

25
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,960
Oh, just to give a sort of brief intro, first of all, thank you for having us.

26
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,360
I am the Archon, which is just really a harmless pseudonym for my youth that I used for making content on the Internet.

27
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:23,920
So as far as how we became acquainted, some years back, I had heard of the Greek from the appearances that he made on different Internet radio programs,

28
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,020
be that Freeman Fly or elsewhere, and so I eventually reached out to learn more.

29
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,400
And we would discuss the subjects that he had brought up, ranging from politics to science to finance.

30
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:44,560
But more than anything else, he was really able to unpack the nature of everyday life as a sort of mirage that's being upheld by various institutions,

31
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,640
like the media and pop culture, and also to objectify that as something that was malevolent in its origins,

32
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,700
which most people don't pay attention to.

33
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,760
And so, you know, that just led to more conversations over the years, and I would eventually create the Greek-speak website,

34
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:07,560
which I will specify has a unique spelling of S-P-E-E-K at the end, so not S-P-E-A-K,

35
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,860
Greekspeak.com, and, you know, compiled some articles there, and we later did a podcast on these various subjects,

36
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,760
so anyone can check that out at their leisure.

37
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,720
And yeah, I'll let the Greek sort of elaborate on where he's at now and some of the projects that he has going on.

38
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,480
Oh, okay. I'm at the same place I was pretty much when I came into this world,

39
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,380
still trying to figure things out and just trying to describe what we can garner and gain from our perception.

40
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:42,080
I would say the lifelong endeavors and experiences that we have here are all based on our input,

41
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,500
whatever we get basically from our parents, society, on and on and on.

42
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:54,680
And when we look for an equivalent, a physical equivalent or a perceivable equivalent in the world to what we've been told,

43
00:04:55,260 --> 00:05:01,200
it's sort of hard to find, so we have to sit back and just trust what we've been told and go along with it.

44
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,800
I think the human on the planet right now, I call them surface-dwelling earth inhabitants,

45
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:14,910
and very specific about that, because there's much more than just being on the surface, is very, very domesticated.

46
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,060
And just to cut to the chase, back in, I think, the recent 2020 events that happened,

47
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:30,300
showed very much, let's say an example, literally what happens when you have a domesticated being.

48
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,080
How difficult would it be, for example, if you have some domesticated beings, we call them pets,

49
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,280
and it's not convenient to have them anymore, you just put them down, don't you, right?

50
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,220
And no one really balks about that too much.

51
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:49,140
So that's just a very quick cut to the chase kind of point of how to perceive things.

52
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:55,960
And again, I say I'm just visiting this planet taking notes, because how else can one objectify?

53
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,520
Pretty much the point of view that I have is when you become objective,

54
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,720
you are sort of on the sidelines, but still a participant in the field, let's say.

55
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,360
One of the things that I constantly harp on is if everyone wanted to just turn everything on the planet,

56
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,720
the entire society into a paradise, I'd say, have at it, but I want nothing to do with it.

57
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,700
And if you all just wanted to destroy each other and create utter chaos, have at it, I want nothing to do with it,

58
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,960
is the stance that I usually take.

59
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,180
I like it. And you say surface-dwelling earth inhabitants.

60
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,500
Well, that is a curious phrase, specifically surface-dwelling.

61
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,100
This is not where I plan to go with this, but I am really intrigued by things that could exist or life underneath the surface.

62
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,620
What say you?

63
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,100
Oh, clearly evident. You know, here's the metaphor that's the overarching metaphor.

64
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,460
Okay, Greg, I just built a new house, okay, and I have new furniture coming, right? Why not?

65
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:06,620
And furniture truck arrives. Do I place all of the furniture on the roof and just live on the roof all year long?

66
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:14,120
Or do I put them inside the house and live inside where I have the comfort and control of, you know, living in the house offers?

67
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,860
I mean, if you had someone place all their furniture, bedroom, living room, whatever, on the roof of a building,

68
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,820
they're subject to all the surface weather attacks, lack of privacy, right?

69
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:33,060
But an intelligent being would definitely dwell inside, if that makes any sense.

70
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,860
So, you know, we're sort of subject to the, however you want to take it,

71
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,420
visuals that were given by, quote-unquote, NASA and government agencies of what's going on, let's say, quote-unquote, with other planets.

72
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,680
And they all look barren on the surface.

73
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:54,600
And that's a clear mark of a potential of a highly evolved society that would be dwelling inside the house instead of on the surface.

74
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,820
Very simple analogy there for me.

75
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:06,300
Yeah, yeah. You know, I've used the analogy of nature and what it creates and basically, you know, fruits.

76
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,420
Look at fruits. Like, they're always far more interesting inside than outside.

77
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,960
You look at an orange, it's just a rind on the outside.

78
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,280
All the good stuff is in the middle.

79
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,520
And nature seems to produce things that are within that kind of framework.

80
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,800
So, what about the Earth itself?

81
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,740
Wouldn't the most interesting parts be inside based on what nature tends to produce?

82
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,880
And we now know there are forests and giant oceans inside the surface.

83
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,360
So, I agree with you that it's logical to be inside, but not all things that are logical actually happen.

84
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,800
What do you think is actually down there?

85
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:50,280
Or what could you say about a potential intelligent being being down there?

86
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,800
Another branch off of humanity perhaps?

87
00:08:54,780 --> 00:09:03,360
Sure. I would suggest that do I have a direct relationship that I knowingly know from beings from there?

88
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,280
I would say no.

89
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:10,180
But we have lots of, let's call them myths and legends for those that want to subscribe to that.

90
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,120
No, I don't have any direct knowledge.

91
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:20,240
But I would suggest basic logic and reasoning using the roof and furniture analogy to be a place to go.

92
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:26,160
And the criticism that I offer to the public at large is basically what I see on the surface.

93
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,160
That's why I denote it as surface-dwelling Earth inhabitants.

94
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,860
There's many ways to go with that.

95
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,040
So, we're just on the surface of a very, very dynamic thing.

96
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,340
Just like if you look at fruit, for example, it's more interesting on the inside.

97
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,480
One thing is the silent power of things that grow.

98
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,980
It's incredible when you look at things that grow, trees, fruit, plants, and so on, that are attached to the Earth.

99
00:09:52,300 --> 00:10:00,900
It's the conversion, let's say, or transmutation of water and soil into these wonderful things based on the topography or the program in the seed.

100
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:09,160
You can have the same soil and water, and the programming of the seed will yield whatever corresponding fruit there is.

101
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,640
And it's basically an atomic transmutation into all these things.

102
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,280
And it's extremely dynamic, yet it's silent, very quiet.

103
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,100
And it's, like you said, very interesting on the inside.

104
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:26,000
And they all bear a geometric structure that have more in common than we give it.

105
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:33,840
For example, the apples and oranges analogy, meaning they're very different, but they do share an archetype, a geometry that's very similar.

106
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:41,600
And I would say that if we go back to the surface, there's also a dynamic that's very much shared there.

107
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:49,060
If you look at all the cultures on the Earth, for example, they're diverse based on various histories.

108
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:56,460
And even if you look at the corresponding current culture of all the surface-dwelling Earth inhabitants of various nations or so,

109
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,000
they carry on things from their history and their culture.

110
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,980
But the thing that they all have in common is their gullibility.

111
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:20,180
And those that seem to have the upper hand and control of, let's say, the One World Earth or the One World Order kind of concept rely on people's gullibility.

112
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,220
And unfortunately, people are very reliable.

113
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,940
Yeah, well said. No argument here.

114
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,780
So in the cosmic censorship episode, the Greek says we need to ask the philosophical question,

115
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:40,480
is man supposed to be as he is today, essentially property, numbered, labeled, and controlled?

116
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,520
Well, I think most of us listening would agree that we've been captured,

117
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:51,980
but getting a handle on how man is supposed to be outside of this capture is harder to identify.

118
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:56,820
What would you say about that, the way things should be or even could be?

119
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:05,960
Yeah, I would suggest that the overarching criticism or what we see the condition, the overarching condition,

120
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,240
here's the hard part, is supposed to be the way it is right now at this time.

121
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:21,340
One loose analogy would be when you have an infant, do they usually need diaper changes and what happens if you don't, right?

122
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,560
And because their diapers are being changed and it's kind of critical,

123
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,840
what happens if they're ignored or left to their own volition, let's say?

124
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,680
It's not going to work out well.

125
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,600
So I would say that things are the way they're supposed to be now,

126
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,540
but there is something about, let's just say, the voluntary nature of things.

127
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,040
I use that very loosely because most things are in that category.

128
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,020
We choose to be that way.

129
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:55,220
So I would offer there's a gradient or different levels of choices that can be made

130
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:00,180
that you can actually be the baby that needs the diaper change or not.

131
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:06,480
And that's where I instill the concept of cosmic censorship, meaning it's not tangible.

132
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,240
It's something that is a limit on each individual and with the society as a whole.

133
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,280
But even though it's overarching and intangible,

134
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:22,620
once it's acknowledged that there is a limitation that pretty much leads to the gullibility,

135
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:27,120
it can pretty much be almost dealt with at that point.

136
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,160
There's not much else you have to do but acknowledge that you are being censored.

137
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,000
And I do find that term provocative, cosmic censorship.

138
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,240
You don't say elite cabal censorship.

139
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:46,940
This kind of implies a layer of deception or blockage from truth at a level higher than human even.

140
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,960
Where does that come from and how has it affected humanity throughout the ages?

141
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,000
Well, I would say where it comes from maybe at this point is not important.

142
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,740
Just like when, let's say, something is delivered to your home, again, the furniture,

143
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,500
you can pretty much, through labeling and loose association, say,

144
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,200
well, this came from here and it was made by these individuals.

145
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,020
But there's so much more involved in that.

146
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,840
And then there's the point where you could be completely removed.

147
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,640
And, you know, many American children are asked where milk comes from,

148
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,980
and they say, well, it comes from the store, right?

149
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,120
So at this point I don't have a direct answer for that,

150
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,000
but I do see through the commonality the transcultural, transnational,

151
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,200
transhistoric effects of this being persistent throughout society.

152
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,920
So I'm not so sure of the source of it.

153
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,940
And I think giving it cosmic, which harkens back to the Greek word meaning worldly, basically,

154
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,300
but not just limited to man's world.

155
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,200
Fair enough. Yes, it makes me think about just the structure of reality.

156
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:57,040
And you'll hear a lot of gurus and spiritualists talk about a soul school,

157
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:07,200
that this reality is somewhat structured to be a process of enlightenment or curiosity or exploration.

158
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:15,920
And cosmic censorship kind of speaks to me as something adjacent to a process of discovery,

159
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,280
that it can be discovered if you get away from all the distractions that are put in front of us

160
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,540
and you actually explore the natural reality.

161
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,680
Things will be revealed to you in layers or systematically.

162
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,060
What do you think about that?

163
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,900
Well, yes, and when you describe something having layers, it still comes to you as a whole, doesn't it?

164
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:43,000
And you could almost look at all the layers at once and then just zero in and focus on one, if you'd like.

165
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,780
But unfocusing on the layers and just looking at the whole package as it comes to you,

166
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:54,240
then you'll notice that what the whole package has in similarity is that all these layers are contained in it.

167
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:01,500
And even though they do look different, they tend to be repeats, just maybe cross-hatched or going across each other,

168
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,440
but they're repeats of almost the same thing amongst all the layers.

169
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,960
I see that.

170
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,780
We sound very philosophical right now, by the way. We haven't bitten into any meat and bones yet.

171
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,500
Oh, well, here comes the meat.

172
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:21,500
So one of my favorite subjects that you guys have unpacked is the episode on science,

173
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,180
really just how various scientific disciplines have been co-opted and controlled.

174
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,420
The most interesting aspect to me in all of this is what's been lost

175
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:39,380
in trying to restore these discarded disciplines like alchemy or a better understanding of natural biology

176
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,640
or seemingly exotic technologies.

177
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,420
And let's start with the technologies, the real nuts and bolts, literally,

178
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:52,840
because we hear about anti-gravity devices and the work of people like T. Townsend Brown.

179
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,640
I've heard the Greek mention the NIMSA group, something not a lot of people talk about.

180
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:03,540
Well, what can you tell people about some of the examples of technologies and really transportation systems

181
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:11,579
that have been kept from them in exchange for metered, highly controllable systems that limit how free we could actually be?

182
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:18,579
Wow, okay. In this case, again, if I brought up something as simple as electricity,

183
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,359
yes, you walk into a room, it's dark, you reach over on the wall, hit a switch, and the light comes on, right?

184
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:30,660
All the way, you know, used in every way you can imagine from what they call power plants to, you know, batteries not included.

185
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:36,960
They still are able or not able to describe exactly or explain what it is.

186
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,060
They can describe it, but they cannot explain it.

187
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:45,560
That is a perfect example of the intangible being relied on and how it affects the way we live.

188
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:54,000
In terms of transportation, just to, let's say, jump to the most important part, the buzzword is anti-gravity, isn't it?

189
00:17:54,340 --> 00:18:02,320
It seems like once we have that to our avail, we won't need roads and supposedly we won't need the fuels we use and all this other stuff.

190
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,460
There's an understanding of gravity that is, let's say, a misunderstanding.

191
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,900
In other words, the understanding that we're given makes it unworkable.

192
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,020
First of all, many people call it a force.

193
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,340
And if you look at the actual referencing of gravity, it is not a force.

194
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,580
It's simply an acceleration.

195
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:26,840
We kind of examine it as a force because when we, let's say, drop a brick on our foot, we feel the force of that brick.

196
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,960
But that's not gravity.

197
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,700
That is the brick accelerating through gravity, and then the final force is the contact with your foot.

198
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:44,680
So just like, for example, let's say back to transportation devices, one thing that you look at, I don't like calling them automobiles because they're not really autonomous.

199
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,540
They're engine-driven wagons, okay?

200
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,420
And not motor vehicles because motor means electric.

201
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,880
Engine is the way we use them, but we're going into the motors now anyway.

202
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:01,340
One of the things, one of the fads with those things is to make them more aerodynamic so you have less drag, right?

203
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,620
All right.

204
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,160
So it seems like everything in nature seems to be about resistance.

205
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:17,020
And if you have, let's say, three portals or three openings and an object is to go through one of those openings, it will naturally choose the one that offers what?

206
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,400
The least resistance, right?

207
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:19,900
Give an example.

208
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:31,520
I think it's Scientific American in the mid-1800s or later part of the 19th century did an article about a 600-mile-per-hour subway car in New York City.

209
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,780
Are you familiar with this?

210
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,360
Have you heard it?

211
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,460
No, I haven't.

212
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,120
Yeah.

213
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,500
I think it's like 1870-something.

214
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,740
Don't hold me.

215
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,640
I'm just paraphrasing.

216
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:47,080
Scientific American, when they just first came out, 600-plus-mile-per-hour underground subway car.

217
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,900
Well, it sounds like, what?

218
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,300
What is he talking about, right?

219
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,560
Yeah.

220
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,840
It was not a very long stretch.

221
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,960
What they did was it was basically air-driven.

222
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:02,020
They pushed air behind the subway car and they created a vacuum in front of it.

223
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:08,420
So as long as the air pushing behind it and the vacuum in front of it were in balance, it doesn't matter how fast it's moving.

224
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,960
It will never see any resistance, right?

225
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,200
And this was achieved 150-plus years ago, and it was used as an example.

226
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,840
Of course, it was shelved and put away.

227
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:27,500
So when we go back to the meme of the anti-gravity, if it's an acceleration, well, what is it?

228
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,360
It's very simple.

229
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:35,780
Nature always sets up movements based on levels of pressure and direction.

230
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:45,680
So in essence, if we sense that the gravity is pulling us down, well, we're moving, let's say, from a high altitude to a low altitude.

231
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,240
That is an illusion that we're being pulled.

232
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:55,260
How about the idea that there is this ephemeral force, or it could be empirical, known as the aether.

233
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:02,820
And away from the Earth, the pressure is higher, and as we go closer to the Earth, the pressure is lower.

234
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,960
So we're actually just feeling a pressure gradient.

235
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:13,380
So once this is understood, where we just decrease the resistance on one end and increase the resistance on the other,

236
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,560
we have motion towards the direction of the decreased resistance.

237
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:24,700
And this is the basis of electricity, of what they call gravity, of what we call even just air conditioning vents,

238
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,880
the way the air moves into the room and returns back to the air conditioner to get recirculated again.

239
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,160
It's all about differences in pressure.

240
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:38,400
And once this is taught as the basics of, let's say, what we call our sciences,

241
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:46,180
then we have an opening into open thought and development as we can, but we don't at this time.

242
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:52,920
Yes, the way it's usually explained to me by, say, the alternative scientists,

243
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:58,440
I like to say the natural scientists, the ones who are kind of looking at the world the way you're describing it.

244
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,400
We say alternative, but that kind of implies that the mainstream is primary

245
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,240
and alternative is secondary when it really should be the other way around.

246
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,900
But I'm led to believe that the Earth has a negative charge,

247
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,120
that a lot of what we call gravity is a byproduct of electricity,

248
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:24,320
and that if we can counter the negative charge, you know, two negative magnets repel each other,

249
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:31,760
then we can start to play around with transportation modalities that really would blow people's mind

250
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,080
because they're operating in an incorrect framework.

251
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:41,980
Is that kind of how you see it, that anti-gravity is really just countering the Earth's natural negative charge?

252
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,540
Well, you just opened up a big can of worms.

253
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,520
When we say charge and all this, it's like charge of what?

254
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,560
Is it electrical? Is it physical? Is it, you know, emotional?

255
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,240
You know, it's actually all of that.

256
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,280
Let me just give you an example.

257
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
There's a little meme that went around the Internet for a while on how the big jumbo jets,

258
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:08,240
they don't really use the fuel that they purport to use based on their fueling sheets.

259
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,000
You know, say they need 5,000 gallons of gas, but the fuel tanks can't hold more than 2,000,

260
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,160
so how are they flying, right? Have you heard this before?

261
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,500
Yeah, and there was someone that went around, it's kind of obscure if maybe it could be found,

262
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:26,720
and they were asking aircraft engineers and pilots, what really makes these airplanes fly then?

263
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,920
And he says, well, it's really that everyone that's on the plane and is directing the plane

264
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,840
and working on the plane believes that they do.

265
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:33,760
Weird.

266
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,700
That's how they work. Yeah, it's really weird.

267
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,540
So now we're in a Twilight Zone kind of reality when we're trying to find the, quote-unquote, notable science, you know?

268
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,300
Notable science meaning, like, you know, referencing material, right?

269
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,940
Stuff you write down and is repeatable.

270
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:54,640
So when we say charge and things like that, again, we have to be able to define the thing

271
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,000
and explain it a little bit better than just the descriptions that we get.

272
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:07,540
So a negative charge would be, for example, the part that is taking away or creating the suction or the vacuum,

273
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,120
and the positive charge would be the one that's pushing.

274
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,380
And that could be done, again, physically, electrically, and emotionally.

275
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:22,160
Well, now you're sounding like Rudolph Steiner with the different layers of adding emotion to concepts like this,

276
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,280
scientific concepts.

277
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,260
Yeah, very interesting stuff.

278
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:34,900
So this more accurate understanding could potentially give way to technologies that work in this framework

279
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:42,040
far earlier than people would expect, because right now we have this combustion-based,

280
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,300
inaccurate model of how physics works.

281
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:54,380
And if you just peel that back, you can find examples of people who made technologies that work in this system

282
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,420
a long, long time ago, right?

283
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:01,920
Yeah, I would suggest there was a little more accuracy in the verbiage and the language that was used.

284
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,720
You know, you said combustion engine.

285
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,540
You know, for example, if you're using a gasoline engine, you know, down at the floor you have the brake

286
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,000
and the other thing they call the gas pedal, don't they, right?

287
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,040
It's really an air pedal.

288
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:20,220
When you push that thing down, it opens, let's say, the butterfly in the carburetor or the fuel injector to let more air in,

289
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,040
and then the amount of air is measured and then determines the amount of fuel that's put in.

290
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,440
So if we change our language and our perception, we'll see things a little different.

291
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,520
We're not really putting gasoline, let's say, for example, in cars to burn the gasoline,

292
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,600
because gasoline actually doesn't really burn in a closed container.

293
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,220
It's the vapor part that burns, right, on the top.

294
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,280
We're actually burning the air.

295
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:46,500
That's why you could substitute gasoline for hydrogen and propane like forklift in a warehouse, right?

296
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,320
So we're chasing after creating, again, a pressure difference in the air,

297
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,460
and eventually that could be tweaked and modified.

298
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,800
But from working on spark plugs and throttle bodies and easily doubling the mileage of a, quote-unquote,

299
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,220
combustion engine that doesn't have computer controls,

300
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,280
and the reason I'm saying this is because if you go to a new car factory,

301
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,800
when the car rolls off of the assembly line, you'll see a guy with what looks like a laptop or something,

302
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,780
and they tune the engine, because some of the cars that come out of the factory,

303
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,740
let's say it's supposed to get 20 miles to the gallon, right?

304
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,640
Some might come out getting 5 miles to the gallon.

305
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,320
Well, that's no good.

306
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,240
We have to make it 20.

307
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,640
And some might come out making 60 miles to the gallon.

308
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,360
Well, that's no good.

309
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,280
We have to make it 20.

310
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,240
So they tune the engine using the computer.

311
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:38,140
And unfortunately, just to jump over to a thing, they have something called an oxygen sensor or a fuel sensor.

312
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:43,400
If it's really supposed to be a pollution control device, shouldn't it be like a pollution sensor?

313
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,280
So, again, the language and all these other things, but let's say a combustion engine,

314
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,400
like a lawnmower or something that doesn't have a computer on it,

315
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,900
can easily be doubled just, you know, with a few hours' worth of work

316
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,860
or not even just adjusting the throttle body and the spark plug.

317
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:06,040
But once you have something that has a computer control, it instills what I call a sabotage, right?

318
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,000
So, again, the computer is, let's say, a thought machine.

319
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,380
Think of it that way, right?

320
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,920
So, again, it goes back to the thinking.

321
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,080
I like it.

322
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:22,320
So going back to the NIMSA group, I've heard you say that they used to call airplanes sky lubricators,

323
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:27,700
kind of a, you know, jokey pejorative saying that their technologies were better

324
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,160
because they were working on advanced airships.

325
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:37,840
And I've also heard you tell a story that you found in a text from a university library

326
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,340
that was taken from a garbage dump in Libya,

327
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,280
and that spoke to something that sounds like a piece of technology out of time.

328
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,660
Talk to us about these examples that show us that this is really the reality when you dig

329
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,840
and you find these little anecdotes.

330
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,700
Well, the thing is we're subject to what they call resets,

331
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,840
whether it's every few centuries or every few millennia.

332
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,180
And give an example.

333
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:10,180
It's not very different if you lived a very long time ago in the way that you're thinking now.

334
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,960
Without giving a direct example, because there are many,

335
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:19,220
I think there's a lot of stuff on the Internet that's dedicated to parts and things like that.

336
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:26,540
But one thing I just want to bring up is that when we are, let's say we meaning humans,

337
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,820
on the surface, go to a certain technological level,

338
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,260
they're sort of knocked down by some form of catastrophe,

339
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,120
whether it's extreme social catastrophe, you know, war, economics, plagues,

340
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,880
or a natural catastrophe like the Great Flood, for example, and other minor catastrophes.

341
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,200
We get back to a situation where we're just desperate to be alive.

342
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,440
And then eventually we rediscover these things as being new, and they're really not.

343
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,160
I always give a metaphor.

344
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:01,180
The only thing that changes, well, I shouldn't say the only thing that changes,

345
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,260
but there are things that change every time the society reaches a technological apex, for example.

346
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:13,160
And the example that I want to give is if you brought someone in from the past, let's say, to the future,

347
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,860
what would they be amazed at?

348
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,140
Most people would say, oh, the Internet, electricity, airplanes.

349
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,960
And I suggest they won't.

350
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:25,180
The thing that they will find to be the hardest thing to conceive is how we're dumping asphalt

351
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:29,280
and covering our roads with this black tar everywhere, right?

352
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,740
Because that was very well known in their society then, and it had very limited use.

353
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,120
So I would suggest that it's not microwaves or radios or computers that they would find hard to adjust to,

354
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:45,280
but all of this black tar petroleum that we're coating our roads with, how impractical is that?

355
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,260
I'm just giving that as a way to just look at the world.

356
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,680
Yeah, I agree.

357
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,260
And only because I mentioned that story from the university library

358
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,960
and this garbage dump in Libya that they extracted.

359
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,640
Basically, you talked about ancient Greek suppression,

360
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:10,360
where it seemed to be a story about this guy who was scaring people away from the markets

361
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:16,540
with this thing that he had, which was described as a horseless wagon that spit out fire, smoke, and lightning.

362
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:22,420
And so the merchants were like, hey, cops, you've got to go get this guy and do something with him

363
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,240
because people won't come out and it's stopping commerce.

364
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,780
And I don't know if there's much of a conclusion there,

365
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:35,300
but it's just an example of these stories peppered throughout history that are never elevated to the surface.

366
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:42,420
But in aggregate, you just can tell that history is a lot different than it's presented to us.

367
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:43,680
Like you said, these resets.

368
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,520
Right, and we're sort of at the point of another one now.

369
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,700
There's a couple of people that are bringing up the topic on the Internet that can be researched,

370
00:30:53,700 --> 00:31:00,240
and I would suggest if you're interested in the subject of the resets, go ahead and look for it.

371
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:06,680
But I would say that what you do on a day-to-day and how you perceive yourself and those around you

372
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:11,820
and the situation that you're in, meaning whatever society you're in, takes precedent on that.

373
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,480
Because one thing that you'll find through history is those that survived the resets

374
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,660
were sort of in a different, more, let's say, elevated spiritual, mental, emotional state.

375
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:30,540
And in some cases, it was kind of like you wished you were not one of the survivors because it was so rough.

376
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,440
But on the other side, there's a preservation element that those that did survive were almost like selective survivors

377
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:44,240
because they had just some aspects about them that were, quote-unquote, might I say, superior than the rest.

378
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,040
That makes sense to me.

379
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,020
And I wanted to bring the archon back in here a little bit.

380
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:59,280
I know that you're primarily the guy who works on the website, and you just kind of allow the Greek to do his thing.

381
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:04,540
But I'm curious your thoughts on some of the stuff we're talking about, the technologies, the physics,

382
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,420
this alternative model that seems to exist outside of the mainstream.

383
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:09,860
What do you think?

384
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,000
Well, those things are very interesting.

385
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:21,040
I mean, in general, I think that when we talk about cosmic censorship, that's something that should be contemplated.

386
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:27,560
It's not so much a lack of information that brings it about because we know that information is in overproduction today.

387
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,140
I think the real thrust of something like that lies in preventing comprehension.

388
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:38,800
It's this force that disassembles intelligible narratives and renders conclusions unreachable,

389
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:44,600
which is why a lot of people live in this sort of unawareness of where society stands and what's going to happen next,

390
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:49,320
which is a mindset that I do think should be scorned and avoided,

391
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:56,600
because it reveals that ultimately people have a preference for the things that are most like themselves.

392
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,100
So a person that's ignorant is ultimately going to be drawn to things that are ignorant,

393
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:06,380
and that in order to reach some type of higher level of enlightenment, you kind of have to separate yourself from that.

394
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:14,580
It starts with that sort of mindset switch that the things that we've been told are normal are really the things that are dangerous.

395
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:20,340
I do remember some time maybe six or seven months ago when I was getting a haircut at a friend's place,

396
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,220
and he had a sticker on the table in front of me where it said, beware normal people.

397
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,600
And I found that to be slightly comical because that is very much true.

398
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,140
It is these types of things that are often thought of as being innocuous in our society,

399
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,380
quote-unquote normal people, the school system, the financial system,

400
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:43,940
which actually are the source of a lot of our troubles and our inability to gain the proper orientation.

401
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:52,480
So I am not as specialized on the matters of science as the Greek is, although I'm learning about that slowly but surely.

402
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,720
But what I have found always caught my attention was the absurdity of this thing that we call society

403
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,340
and the way that institutions misdirect everybody's attention towards things that are unimportant.

404
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,780
Yeah, yeah, I certainly agree.

405
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,480
A lot of times we are putting the target kind of on academia and the Royal Society

406
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:18,560
and those who injected all this into the culture and over many decades, centuries,

407
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:25,120
have crafted the false paradigm that the normal people eat up, and I think you're right.

408
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,800
So the Archon, that's just a fun pseudonym, as you say.

409
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,679
But I am curious about the Greek's thoughts on real Archons,

410
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:44,739
or the term which suggests there are spiritual forces, mind parasites, that kind of feed on us, that direct reality.

411
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:51,500
Some say they're attracted to power, they can identify power, and our own elite are possessed by these Archons.

412
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,800
That's obviously a Gnostic trope.

413
00:34:53,800 --> 00:35:00,040
But what are your thoughts on influences that are not really seen, not even acknowledged?

414
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,540
Non-physical influences, spiritual, some might say.

415
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,760
Oh, I would say definitely.

416
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:12,740
Sometimes the thing is measured by the effect more than what it actually is, right?

417
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:17,040
Actually, most of the current science, all of the probes and measuring equipment,

418
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,780
doesn't really measure the thing, it measures what the thing does.

419
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:27,060
And when we look at what the thing does, meaning the spiritual beings all the way,

420
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,960
let's say, when we say spiritual, non-corporeal, non-physical,

421
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:35,600
down, there's a gradient to where then you have physical beings,

422
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,900
but they don't exhibit the qualities that average humans do.

423
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:41,640
Let's say they live longer, and they have powers,

424
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,340
let's say like walking through walls would be one meme that one can bring up.

425
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:52,340
And then they transition down to the average human that might have insight into those

426
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:56,100
and might have some of that power, which we call, let's say, the masters.

427
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,780
And then it transitions down to the students of the masters,

428
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,500
then it transitions down to, need I say, the normie.

429
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,940
So that would be like a gradient.

430
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,280
And if we see what the normie is capable of,

431
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,200
and going the gradient now backwards, let's say upwards,

432
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,080
not necessarily because upwards means better, just in power,

433
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,100
we start to see a removal of what the normie world is,

434
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,080
and we start to see a point where the normie world is mixed in with the supernatural

435
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:32,520
and super powerful world, and then we rise up and it becomes all supernatural above that.

436
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:38,040
So there's a gradient there, and there's an interbreeding of both mind and physicality

437
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,900
when you go up and down through the scale.

438
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:47,060
Again, I think that from just looking at what's been memorialized,

439
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,440
the reason things are memorialized through history,

440
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,900
written whether it's clay tablet or parchment or paper or now digitally,

441
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:59,320
when something is memorialized it's because it's important for posterity,

442
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,000
for people to know, that people who are not present,

443
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,140
whether it's geographically present or in time, to have this information carried over.

444
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:11,400
What is memorialized about what I just mentioned and what you asked about, let's say,

445
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:18,060
super beings all the way down, is very different to what people,

446
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,580
let's say everyday people, if you were to ask them about them, have to say.

447
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:27,520
What you will find memorialized is a much more tangible story or structure

448
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,080
than what people think about.

449
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:35,020
So when we say that there are these beings, let's just say superior in power,

450
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:40,380
there's quite a bit of information about their characteristics and how they maintain that power,

451
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,300
where the average person that thinks about the subject is not aware of.

452
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:50,240
Yeah, and for people who might wonder what you actually mean by that,

453
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,480
what are those characteristics?

454
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:56,700
Because we do have people like Charles Fort, we can go back even further to biblical texts

455
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:01,820
where angels and things are described far differently than the religions project them.

456
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:08,680
But when you get to the core of the characteristics of these super intelligences or super beings,

457
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,860
what do they look like to you or what makes them up?

458
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,520
Well, you know, the interesting thing, the easiest to discuss are the anthropomorphic ones.

459
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,080
Like if you go to the biblical text, for example, man was made in their image, let's say, right?

460
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:23,660
The gods.

461
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:30,220
They lack physicality or the limits of physicality but yet can manifest as such if needed

462
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,960
or if so desired.

463
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,420
And then that leads more into the question, what is physicality?

464
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:40,040
You know, we were sort of discussing science earlier,

465
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:48,320
and I would suggest that from the mystical point of view, even to what is considered contemporary science,

466
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,960
one will actually, if you delve into the subject, there is no physicality.

467
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,540
It's just a state of motion.

468
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:04,820
And an example of that would be if you have, let's say, a typical desk fan or a bicycle wheel on your table,

469
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,560
when it's not moving, you can put your hand in between the blades

470
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,980
or in between the spokes of the bicycle wheel just fine.

471
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:18,600
But once it's rotating, if you approach any of the area, it will seem like a solid object, right,

472
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,720
because of its movement.

473
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:25,860
So there's something about movement and oscillation, frequency, as it's usually described,

474
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,740
that these beings have control over.

475
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,780
And the easiest ones to discuss are the ones that are quote-unquote anthropomorphic,

476
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,960
like, for example, from the biblical story or angels.

477
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,500
You know, we don't think of something that we don't recognize.

478
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,480
We recognize them as being sort of human in form.

479
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,020
And I would suggest that is one aspect of it and the easiest one to discuss.

480
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:57,140
So imagine an ability to dematerialize or not have a physical form based on your control over the motion of things.

481
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,320
Yeah, that's super interesting.

482
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:07,020
I don't hear people talking about motion or vibration.

483
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,320
Vibration, yes, but not so much in the motion sense.

484
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:21,260
Yes, but when you listen to some of these descriptions, they sometimes appear as rotating concentric rings or some kind of light,

485
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,220
things that do suggest that that might be a mechanism that they're controlling that alters the perception

486
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:32,460
or allows them to be seen or unseen from people that they're trying to encounter.

487
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,100
Oh, absolutely.

488
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:38,540
Eventually we might discuss, or you'll find in the Greek-speak discussion,

489
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:45,000
is the in-your-face examples that are put out in society and memorialized and easily referenced.

490
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:52,780
One of the easiest ones to come across that is a shocker if you're perceptive is I tell people,

491
00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:01,400
go to the Internet and do a search for a cross-section of intestines or cross-sections of lungs or cross-section of skin.

492
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,920
And this is for an anatomical drawing.

493
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:12,700
And then I would suggest do a split screen and type in a browser a cross-section of a steel-belted radial tire.

494
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,280
And you compare the two.

495
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:22,320
Structurally, the two meaning whether it's a cross-section of the human lungs or animal lungs or skin or intestines,

496
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:29,000
compare the cross-section with a steel-belted radial tire, and you'll see structurally they're identical, structurally.

497
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,200
In other words, nothing passes through there.

498
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,580
So we're constantly told that we absorb, right, nutrition, even the alternatives.

499
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:43,380
Oh, yeah, we have something that you will absorb more nutrition, you know, and it lowers blood pressure.

500
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,100
And we're like, how is that absorption happening?

501
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,060
Look at all of the hydrophobic layers in the intestines.

502
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,280
Nothing goes through that.

503
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,440
How is it working, right?

504
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:58,300
So there's the concept of induction, which is a very simple concept, for example.

505
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,140
They have these induction cooktop stoves.

506
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,720
It's a glass-top stove, and you can have a pot of water boiling on it.

507
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:09,040
And you just move the pot off to the side, put your hand right on the glass top.

508
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:09,760
It's room temp.

509
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,940
And you move the pot right over the glass top again, and it starts to boil again, you know, through induction.

510
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:22,320
Most of the devices that we use use coils and capacitors, let's say, but coils work on induction.

511
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:28,880
You know, I have a power toothbrush, and when it goes into the charger, there is no metal contact at all.

512
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,340
It's just the plastic bases come near each other, and there's an LED that blinks and lets me know it's charging.

513
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,120
You see?

514
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:43,660
So once we understand and start using the concept of induction, whether it's from the part of the creative part,

515
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:49,440
or the part that creates locomotion, you know, when it's taught to us as young children,

516
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,000
then we'll have a society that will be, you know, more advanced at moving forward.

517
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:00,920
Hmm. Yeah, you're touching on something I was going to bring up, the importance of induction versus absorption.

518
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:08,520
It might be a little fuzzy to some people out there, because they both kind of invoke this taking in sort of mechanism.

519
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:14,940
But you've talked about the biological vacuum that it needs to be studied, that blood pressure is a farce.

520
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:15,340
Yep.

521
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:21,760
All of our concepts of how biology functions are by looking at things that are dead, which is idiotic,

522
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:30,580
and it's the how the biological vacuum is maintained question that actually starts the research.

523
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:35,700
But sadly, nothing on this has been done since Victor Schauberger in the 1930s.

524
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,600
Well, what are some of these biological processes that we could correct the record on

525
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,320
and help demystify how biology really works?

526
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:54,460
Well, what's interesting is that things that are living versus things that are not living do have the difference of what we call,

527
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,940
you know, life, essentially.

528
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:01,300
And that is something that we all kind of, yeah, well, Greek, that sounds very obvious.

529
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:08,760
But when we get into defining it and explaining it, the biological vacuum is one of the core principles to examine.

530
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,920
For example, if you look at the human body, all of the fluids in the human body,

531
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:22,060
you'll see that there's no way that there is anything direct like a tool or a machine like the heart or anything

532
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:27,660
that is moving all the fluids evenly based on the hydrodynamic principles that are taught.

533
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:34,100
But if we consider that the pressure inside the body is slightly less than the outer environment,

534
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:41,980
then we have the freedom of the liquids to move in the direction of where that vacuum sustains more vacuum.

535
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,740
Essentially, it's a big, broad subject.

536
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:53,780
But when you combine that with induction, which is where you have a barrier where things cross immaterially,

537
00:44:53,780 --> 00:45:01,920
where you've heard, you know, the elite pretty much invented science fiction to disclose to us what's going on.

538
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:08,620
In something I call cosmic information, in a cosmic law, information is information.

539
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:11,020
It doesn't matter if you call it fact or fiction.

540
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,680
The thing is, did you get the idea?

541
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,500
If you want to call it fact or fiction or truth or non-true, that's up to you.

542
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:25,160
So they have this thing called the transporter or the food replicator that they showed in Star Trek,

543
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:31,600
and that should be taken very seriously because it's not a very, let's say, far-off notion

544
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,320
into what's actually happening in every living organism.

545
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:46,880
So they obviously have twisted the truth and they describe mechanisms in the body that are not exactly accurate.

546
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,660
They want to suppress the reality of this induction.

547
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,580
Well, where would that study lead?

548
00:45:53,680 --> 00:46:00,940
Why is it so important to them to say, well, your body just absorbs the nutrients rather than this induction process?

549
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,980
What are they afraid of us discovering there?

550
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,120
Okay, the thing is, are they afraid?

551
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:08,500
Are they fear-based?

552
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,000
You know, there's a big meme about that, being fear-based, right?

553
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,540
I don't think they're that much afraid in the way the situation is currently.

554
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:22,100
I think what they're doing is, one thing you'll see in the Greek-speak I use a lot, they're pranking.

555
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,960
It's a form of pranking.

556
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,640
It brings entertainment.

557
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,400
You know, give an analogy.

558
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,100
I visited another world once.

559
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,240
This is just an analogy.

560
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:37,480
And the biggest industry on that world was Kevlar or bulletproof underwear.

561
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,960
And I asked why.

562
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:46,440
It says because it's a custom, it's customary to put a thumbtack down on a seat before anyone sits on it.

563
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:53,160
And to prevent the pain, they have a big industry that produces Kevlar underwear that everyone buys.

564
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,300
So I suggested, well, just stop putting thumbtacks on seats.

565
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,300
And they said, well, you can't do that.

566
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,200
We've been doing it for a long time.

567
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:10,300
And if it starts to catch on, those that produce that bulletproof Kevlar underwear are going to really come after me, aren't they?

568
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,140
Because I'm messing up their business.

569
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,760
So it's a combination of pranking.

570
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,860
It's a combination of control, a combination of culture.

571
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:31,440
The reason why one of the things that sets gasoline prices, for example, is how much do you have to pay to go a certain distance, right?

572
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,460
That's why often diesel fuel costs more because you get better mileage on diesel fuel.

573
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:37,500
It's very interesting.

574
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:42,620
So I would suggest that it's just a strict control system.

575
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:50,100
There is an emotional component to the induction, meaning if you're in a bad emotional state,

576
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:54,280
you usually won't perform as well as if you're in a good emotional state.

577
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,320
When I say perform, I mean in your daily life, whatever it is, even just sitting down to have a meal.

578
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:04,840
So there's an emotional component, an energetic component, and a physical component to everything we can possibly discuss.

579
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,240
I like it.

580
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,780
And let me ask you about alchemy.

581
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:15,700
It's another subject that has a rich history, but it all sort of dries up about 100 years ago.

582
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:21,960
We're told that's because the work was really theoretical and didn't actually constitute a real science.

583
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,960
Materials can't be transmuted into other materials.

584
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,920
What are your thoughts on the field of alchemy and its actual value?

585
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:38,580
Well, the basic definition of alchemy, well, basic in a loose way, is where you involve spirit or mind into the process.

586
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,600
And the individual is a variable or a component in whatever process you're doing.

587
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,660
And that goes to chemistry, for example, when we discuss alchemy directly.

588
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:54,460
And chemistry is just a matter of synthesizing things or making things that you might need that are not around, right?

589
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:59,640
The typical one would be turning base metals into gold, right?

590
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,780
Because gold, let's say, is desirable, or whatever.

591
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:08,620
But I would suggest that alchemy, again, if the mind component, the emotional component,

592
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:16,140
and the state of whoever is working on the process is removed publicly, in other words, from the public mind,

593
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:19,920
then the public becomes very dependent on what's put out to them.

594
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,620
And they become less powerful and more dependent.

595
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,360
Again, it's a dependency aspect.

596
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:32,540
But I would suggest that alchemy, and I can give you, let's just say, sort of indirect and sort of direct,

597
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:36,420
that the schools of alchemy have gone underground,

598
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:42,360
and they're still being used today by the large chemical companies' industrial concerns.

599
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,780
They're definitely being used today.

600
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,660
If you look at the field of what's called catalysts, for example,

601
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:53,820
if you have vegetable shortening, it's a material that looks like a putty.

602
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:54,480
It's not liquid.

603
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:58,620
It's basically water and oil mixed together, but you can't mix water and oil together.

604
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:04,760
But if you run it over nickel beads, a catalyst, nickel does not add itself to the mix,

605
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:10,500
but because it went over the nickel catalyst, now the water and oil don't separate, right?

606
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:14,060
There are processes still in metal alloys.

607
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,400
I'll give an example.

608
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:21,480
Beryl bronze, which is one of the hardest, well, most durable, not hardest, but durable in bearing,

609
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:26,340
meaning you have two metals rubbing up against each other, a bearing surface.

610
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:30,540
There is a particular alloy that's of many alloys,

611
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:34,880
but beryl bronze where you have beryllium, copper, tin, zinc, and other things mixed together.

612
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:39,060
If you melt those metals and put them together, you're not going to get beryl bronze,

613
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,480
the qualities of beryl bronze.

614
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,380
What must be done is while all those metals are molten in a vat,

615
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:50,320
one must break off a fresh green branch from a hardwood tree

616
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:54,860
and stir the molten metal with this fresh green branch and drop it in.

617
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,520
Then you will get the qualities of beryl bronze.

618
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,960
Now, if that doesn't sound like alchemy being used today, I don't know what is.

619
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,140
It's still being used today.

620
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,000
It's just not public.

621
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:11,360
Yeah, these are the little anecdotes that I just find really unique about hearing you speak.

622
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,540
Another aspect of the intelligence of nature and the symbiosis that you've said kind of in passing

623
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:23,180
is that poison ivy won't grow unless it's in the presence of white oak,

624
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:27,860
and white oak bark is the remedy for poison ivy.

625
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,900
Now, this is something that I did not know.

626
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:34,300
I got poison ivy a lot when I was young running through the woods of the Midwest.

627
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:40,420
I didn't realize it had this symbiosis, and I'm curious about other examples of that

628
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:45,760
and the intelligence of nature and how the natural world has a lot of this baked in.

629
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,740
We are just so divorced from the natural world these days.

630
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,160
We're in these concrete jungles that even a little example like that is intriguing.

631
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:00,400
Well, yeah, I like giving or send people to the direction of what's called macrobiotics

632
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,020
or the yin and yang concept.

633
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:02,920
It's an Asian.

634
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:07,200
What I don't like about recommending it is that it's very Asian-oriented,

635
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,900
and people think they have to be Japanese or Chinese to understand it, right?

636
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,160
The yin and yang symbol is very much interrelated.

637
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:18,780
I would suggest that the concept of balance, every culture had it,

638
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:24,140
but a lot of Westerners are sort of turned off because they think I'm trying to make them Asian-centric.

639
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:29,220
Which I'm not, but it's the only place that it's been preserved, right,

640
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,820
the concept of yin and yang, expansive, contractive, right, and properties

641
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:36,300
and how the balancing actually works.

642
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:44,320
I would suggest that the remedy or the solution must be in place prior to

643
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:50,320
or at the same time the problem or the malady is brought into existence.

644
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:54,520
It's kind of like, let's just use a dummy load kind of term,

645
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,480
like God and the devil came together, right?

646
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:00,160
You can't have negative or good without bad.

647
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,480
They come in together.

648
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,980
I use Star Wars as an example.

649
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,820
People think that the Jedi have to defeat the Sith.

650
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,840
It's not about that.

651
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,600
It's never in the storyline.

652
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,440
The storyline is to put it in balance.

653
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,020
It's not to eliminate one or the other.

654
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,240
Sith are not trying to eliminate the Jedi, and the Jedi are not trying to eliminate the Sith.

655
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,540
It's just to keep them in balance.

656
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:22,900
When one gets much stronger than the other, there's an imbalance,

657
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,280
and this is pretty much how nature works.

658
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:26,760
I like it.

659
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,000
And just to step back to alchemy a bit,

660
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:32,960
I've heard you say that if you just examine the mechanisms of the body,

661
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:38,760
you can see alchemy and transmutation as a part of general biology.

662
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:42,500
When you are low on something, you don't take that thing.

663
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,960
You take something else that helps your body produce that thing.

664
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,340
Talk to us about that a bit.

665
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:53,520
A simple direction to point people at is to look up the work of Louis Kevran,

666
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,820
K-E-V-R-A-N.

667
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,340
He did the biological transmutation experiments,

668
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,040
which about a decade ago I had met someone just by chance

669
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,680
that was part of one of those experiments in the Moroccan desert.

670
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,760
But what he had done was examined,

671
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,160
and also using the basic scientific nomenclature,

672
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:17,240
a chicken egg and how it's mostly calcium, pure calcium.

673
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:24,340
And he decided to eliminate anything that a group of chickens in the experiment

674
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:26,760
were eating with calcium in it at all.

675
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:30,460
So these chickens were eating food that was devoid of calcium.

676
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,360
They went through great lengths to make sure that none of the feed had any calcium content.

677
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,220
But the chickens still produced a robust calcium egg,

678
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:41,400
and they didn't have any bone loss or beak loss or anything else.

679
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,920
So he discovered basically that it was traces of magnesium and sodium

680
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,200
inside the living being that created the elemental calcium.

681
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:55,820
And the same goes for humans with potassium, for example, as an electrolyte.

682
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:59,820
A lot of people are like, oh, I eat bananas because they have potassium, right?

683
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,920
Well, it's actually, again, you need a high-quality sodium

684
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,520
and physical activity for the body to produce potassium in the blood.

685
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:14,160
So he has a, I wouldn't say extensive work, but he has many, many direct examples like that.

686
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:17,200
Lewis Kervran would be an easy place to check out.

687
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,220
Let me just throw one thing in there.

688
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,980
One of the metrics that they use for food is calories, right?

689
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:30,420
Now, the calorie counting thing, it was really crazy a decade ago.

690
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:33,720
It's not so much anymore, even prior to a decade ago.

691
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,940
But let me just suggest the caloric measurement is basically the amount of temperature it takes

692
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,360
to raise one gram or one cubic centimeter of water.

693
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,540
It's a very simple metric.

694
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:47,860
If you see how it's done, it looks basically in a lab or it's a glass tube.

695
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,020
They put the object.

696
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:52,060
They want to find how many calories it has in the glass tube,

697
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,200
and they seal it, purge it with pure oxygen.

698
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:56,540
Something looks like a spark plug goes boom.

699
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,680
Everything just completely burns.

700
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:02,820
It's submerged in a bath of water, and they measure the amount of water

701
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:06,200
and the amount of heat it gives off, and there's your caloric output.

702
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:13,060
The only thing with that is that if you were to eat a banana for potassium, right, as most people say,

703
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,360
let's say a banana's got 80 calories.

704
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:17,640
When you poop it, can you burn that poop?

705
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,600
Of course.

706
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,960
You can continue burning it.

707
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:26,180
So unless you know anyone who poops charcoal, the calories are an irrelevant metric for food.

708
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:33,720
So unless you're pooping pure carbon, it's an irrelevant metric,

709
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,120
like blood pressure and other things.

710
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,360
Blood sugar is another one.

711
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,900
Well, let's get into blood a little bit more.

712
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:46,120
I mean, I was always fascinated by Rudolf Steiner talking about blood,

713
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:52,180
saying that it's basically a spiritual substance or a substance that links the spiritual and physical

714
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:55,140
and that it's something you can't actually get at.

715
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:00,140
Outside of the body, because once it's oxygenated, it is a different thing.

716
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:07,920
So it's like really quite curious that it can't really be totally known in a sense

717
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,200
because of where it's kept beneath the skin.

718
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:17,280
And as you mentioned about studying things that are dead, this is not exactly what blood is.

719
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:22,040
Blood needs to be alive and inside the body to be what it naturally is.

720
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:26,860
What are your thoughts on if blood pressure is a farce and blood sugar is a farce?

721
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:31,380
Well, they say that one of the biggest causes of death is heart disease,

722
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:34,140
and that obviously involves the blood.

723
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:36,600
What is going on with the blood and the heart?

724
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:39,500
What's the proper way to think about this stuff?

725
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:46,640
Well, okay, one way to look at it is just even a cursory examination of all of the organs in the body,

726
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,900
you'll see that they're all alien to each other, right?

727
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:54,420
Even an early student in the medical field, you'll show him a liver cell,

728
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:58,220
and he'll identify it as such, or a cell from the kidneys, identify it as such.

729
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:03,160
They're very, very, a brain cell, if you've ever met anyone who still has any of those, by the way.

730
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,460
But if you look at all of the cells, they're very distinct,

731
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:10,680
almost as if you have these alien creatures that have come together from different universes

732
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,520
or different worlds to work together.

733
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,620
And when they were assembled in the body, actually all living things,

734
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:23,460
mammals especially and other creatures that are mobile, have all of these alien-looking organs, right?

735
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:30,160
And they're all pretty much there to produce and sustain the blood in the body.

736
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:36,120
They all have their own attribute of what they do, so the blood is essentially the focus.

737
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,120
One thing that I would suggest, we said blood pressure is a farce,

738
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:44,860
you know, basically the cuff that restricts blood flow is an unnatural occurrence,

739
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:50,840
and they're basically just measuring the beats in between the paws and the beat of the heart.

740
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,840
It's, again, a fallacy of a metric.

741
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:01,520
But I would suggest that the blood is a byproduct or the goal of all of the organs of the body to sustain and produce.

742
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,360
So it is very mystical in that aspect.

743
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:12,640
If you study live blood studies, there was, I think, a duo of father and daughter in Canada a few decades ago,

744
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,340
and they were able to, for a short time, view live blood under a microscope,

745
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:19,320
and they would see little flashes of blue light under the slide.

746
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:23,720
And where the flash of blue light subsided, there would be a new cell developed.

747
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,400
It could be a red blood cell.

748
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,340
Sometimes it was a white blood cell.

749
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:30,400
Sometimes it was a yeast cell, right?

750
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,200
So all of these things were being produced under, let's say,

751
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:40,620
the effects of little flashes of yellow or blue light under the slide trying to keep the blood alive.

752
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,400
Wow, wow.

753
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:45,440
Yeah, that's the kind of stuff that really intrigues me.

754
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,740
And just from guests of the past that I've talked to,

755
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:54,140
it seems like the mechanisms of water, electricity, frequency, and vibration

756
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:59,200
are the real underpinning aspects of reality that we should be studying and experimenting with

757
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,460
because the results seem almost magical.

758
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:06,900
There's this unknown quality to a lot of things that are going on in nature

759
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:10,460
that we just either take for granted or are completely ignorant of,

760
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,840
like that flash of light sort of thing.

761
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:18,180
It seems like, in terms of health, we need proper charge.

762
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:23,200
I mean, we talked about charge and how that term isn't necessarily descriptive enough,

763
01:00:23,380 --> 01:00:26,440
but walking on the earth seems to matter.

764
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:31,020
Salt seems to help the conductivity of our body,

765
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:35,980
and proper structured water seems to help produce healthy cells.

766
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:41,220
Those seem to be some of the biggest components, yet everyone focuses on just diet.

767
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:43,740
Well, I think these other things should be right up there.

768
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:48,140
Yes, and these other things are a state of mind and which lead to emotion,

769
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,200
which lead to action, thoughts, and then eventually manifestation.

770
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:53,320
You mentioned magic.

771
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:59,500
You know, there's many sayings about it that one society's science is another society's magic, right?

772
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:04,500
And the thing about magic or alleged domain or prestidigitation is

773
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:09,620
people can see a woman being sawed in half on stage and put back together,

774
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:15,240
and when they exit the theater, you can have them swear on an affidavit

775
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,360
that they saw a woman being sawed in half and put back together.

776
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:22,620
So what's really going on is the magician lies and you swear to it,

777
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:27,220
and that's pretty much one way to distill down on what's happening in this society.

778
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:34,340
That is true, but outside of stage magic, I mean, if we're going to talk about that,

779
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:42,300
I do think there is a natural technology there that's been used by, say, shamans for a long time.

780
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:46,860
It seems to involve the ancient megalithic stone circles somehow

781
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:51,860
that it seems like from other researchers have been intentionally altered

782
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:57,220
or certain stones displaced to maybe make that technology not work anymore.

783
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,580
Now it just looks like, oh, an interesting feature.

784
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:02,580
How cute the ancients were putting these rocks together.

785
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,940
But there seems to be real mechanisms of magic.

786
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:12,000
You seem to be able to alter consciousness in a way that draws forth intelligences

787
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,320
for communication inside the pentagram, inside the circle.

788
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:21,360
A lot of these things seem to be quite real, but they're obscured by the term magic

789
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:26,520
and what we think of as stage magic, but it really seems to be a natural technology.

790
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,160
What do you think?

791
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:28,480
Oh, absolutely.

792
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:34,500
Going back to the alchemy where beryl bronze is a very desirable material in industry

793
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:40,640
and you can have the formula, but if you don't have the procedure, it won't work.

794
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,660
Very often you hear people absconding with industrial secrets.

795
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:49,200
They have the formula for coke or some alloy or some chemical process, right?

796
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,500
And the recipe is just like a paragraph of what you need to mix together.

797
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:56,860
But the procedure manual is 300 pages thick.

798
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,780
When to mix what at what temperature, what time of day, you see?

799
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:05,540
So you mentioned the megaliths or monoliths and stone.

800
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:08,280
Those are forms of communication that require procedure.

801
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:15,840
If you don't understand their procedure, it's just a grouping of very large, heavy stones, isn't it?

802
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,920
Yes, very interesting that you say that.

803
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,740
Can you give us any insights into the procedure?

804
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:25,760
I know a lot of it's been lost, but there are little pieces

805
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,620
that some people seem to be able to extract from their research.

806
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,980
Well, when you brought up the stones, it's a matter of time.

807
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,860
We're not aware of any new monoliths other than maybe the guide stones

808
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:42,060
or something like that in Georgia that were recently blown up.

809
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:46,620
But we're not aware of new structures going up or functioning structures,

810
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:49,260
let's say, outwardly to us.

811
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,780
So it's a matter of time.

812
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:56,460
There was something about time being a factor, and that's where I kind of sarcastically bring up,

813
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:01,180
it's one of the strong points of Greek speak, is the Pope's work schedule, right?

814
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,100
How do you keep time?

815
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,220
So there's an alignment.

816
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:09,940
Like I mentioned, you can abscond with some secret recipe from some industry

817
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:13,780
and know what your shopping list is, but you don't know how to put them together.

818
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:19,980
Putting things together in time, which is just the memorialization or record of events,

819
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:22,440
because without events changing, there is no time.

820
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:25,960
A lot of people say there is no time and that they're correct,

821
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,740
but that means there's no change.

822
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:33,100
And change, even in the old philosophical point, is the only thing for sure is change, you see?

823
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,800
So time will always exist.

824
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,000
It's just your record of it.

825
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,300
This society has been captured hostage under what I call the Pope's work schedule.

826
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,140
If you ask anyone what day it is,

827
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:48,640
they're going to tell you something between January and December and Monday through Friday, right?

828
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:53,180
And if you go to something what I call lawful timekeeping,

829
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:58,240
which is actually taught in astronomy, not astrology, but astronomy, in University 101,

830
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,740
they give about a five-minute discussion on this,

831
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:06,940
is that the day is measured with the solar aspect of the objects in the sky

832
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:09,640
and the month is measured with the moon.

833
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:12,600
It's not a lunar calendar. It's not a solar calendar.

834
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:16,680
Just like, for example, if you have a clock, you have the longhand and the shorthand.

835
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,900
It's not a longhand clock or a shorthand.

836
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:21,200
And then you have the second sweeping hand, you see?

837
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,940
So it's a matter of combining the two.

838
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:30,240
Just to drop in a little thing for the listeners, they could research it on their own.

839
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,620
The day starts at solar noon, at high noon, not at midnight.

840
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:42,960
And one thing about that is that it's actually mentioned in a way that the old dictionaries used to be defined.

841
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,780
You'll find that in the Julian calendar date on the timekeeping authorities,

842
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,040
I think there's a website for the Naval Observatory in Colorado

843
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,120
and there's another one for the Greenwich Mean Time,

844
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:59,960
in their Julian calendar description, which is the basis of the Gregorian calendar,

845
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:06,020
they'll tell you for scientific and astronomical purposes, the day starts at solar noon,

846
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:09,740
but for the public at large, it's midnight.

847
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:14,920
That's almost, I want to give the analogy of how the original old dictionaries were written.

848
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:16,840
They didn't know how to define words exactly,

849
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:21,080
because a dictionary is not about the meaning of the word, it's about the diction of the word.

850
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,120
They want everyone to have a uniform pronunciation.

851
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:28,020
That's why when you look up a word in a dictionary, it shows you that phonetic spelling first.

852
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:30,380
It's for consistency for the public.

853
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:33,840
But when they put in a word like oats, for example,

854
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:39,840
they defined it as what we feed horses in England, but it's the staple of the people of Scotland.

855
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,780
Kind of like a put-down.

856
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:47,100
So you'll see all these put-downs put out by the academic authorities in your face.

857
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:52,460
That's basically the sun ruling or being the day count at high noon.

858
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:55,880
There's a lot of religious aspect to that, where people say,

859
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:59,860
well, you know, in the old Hebrew calendar, it's sundown, or midnight now,

860
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:02,080
or, well, okay, go ahead, have at it.

861
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,400
The other thing is, when you go to the lunar side,

862
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:10,460
you know, for thousands of years, people settled their debts when the full moon came around.

863
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:16,400
You'll find a lot of mentioning of that, if you can find some documents that talked about,

864
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,620
you know, how conventional people behaved in the past.

865
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:24,760
So today, don't you get your bills to settle your debts on a monthly basis?

866
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:27,860
You get your monthly bills, usually.

867
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:31,020
So there's certain things in our culture that's still there.

868
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:35,020
Again, going back to the sun, you know, people, when they fasted for a day,

869
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:39,220
they broke their fast at the end of the day, and it was called breakfast, right?

870
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:39,980
Yeah.

871
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,980
So it's very interesting, and there's no discussion on lawful timekeeping.

872
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:48,000
So once you understand the alignments and the time of day,

873
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:52,000
just like the procedure manual for some industrial chemical process,

874
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,900
again, the shopping list is very small,

875
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:58,420
but the procedure manual on how to put these things together could be quite elaborate.

876
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:04,460
Once you remove the aspect of how to keep time, what happens to these stone monoliths?

877
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:07,000
I mean, you might have some academic going around and saying,

878
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:10,400
oh, yeah, for a certain time of year and a certain day,

879
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:14,040
the sun goes between these two stones and forms a shadow here.

880
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:16,819
It's like, yeah, so ask him what day it is.

881
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:19,380
See, he can't get into any procedure.

882
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:20,240
Interesting.

883
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:22,660
Yes, it seems like the orientation,

884
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:28,540
the cosmic orientation in some of those places would be an important mechanism

885
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:31,460
for what these technologies were able to do.

886
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:32,560
Yeah.

887
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:33,819
Give an example here.

888
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,479
Like, I'm an Old Testament kind of guy.

889
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,620
No, I don't want to go out and slaughter Canaanites or anything like that,

890
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:41,359
but when I say I'm an Old Testament kind of guy, you know,

891
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:43,600
just basically the do's and don'ts, for example.

892
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:48,939
So when you read in the biblical text, on the 13th day of the first month, right,

893
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:55,200
or on the 10th day of the 7th month, if you're using the calendar as such

894
01:08:56,100 --> 01:09:00,319
or what the quote-unquote Jewish culture is using or whatever,

895
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,060
you're not going to figure out those days.

896
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:06,660
But once you understand that the full moon is the first day of the month

897
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:08,960
and the day starts at solar noon,

898
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:12,140
you'll be able to find out and be present on those days.

899
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:15,000
Because, for example, in the biblical text, those are appointed.

900
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,560
They're called appointed days.

901
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:18,560
It's an appointment, right?

902
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,720
You ever get something called an appointment and don't show up?

903
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:22,560
Hmm.

904
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:22,960
You know?

905
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:23,420
Yeah.

906
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:23,880
Get it?

907
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:25,240
You don't show up for your appointments?

908
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:28,680
Sometimes they still charge you for the appointment, right,

909
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:29,640
even though you didn't come.

910
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:34,380
So it's a very weird and strange world once you start to see how simple it is.

911
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:35,040
Yeah.

912
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:39,279
It's really intriguing to see the echoes of some of this

913
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:42,180
in the language and the traditions.

914
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,080
You know, when I speak to occult practitioners,

915
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:48,640
they're always emphasizing the timing.

916
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:53,180
And any time I've thought about even exploring that world,

917
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:56,280
it's just like the timing aspect is so overwhelming

918
01:09:56,280 --> 01:10:00,620
because our society uses – it eats up so much of our time.

919
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:05,640
But they're always emphasizing that certain actions for maximum potency

920
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,380
must be done at certain times.

921
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:11,060
And maybe that's an aspect of why it's not so arbitrary

922
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:14,680
that we have the Gregorian calendar and the 24-hour clock,

923
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,780
the Pope's work schedule, as you say.

924
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:20,420
Maybe these are some of the deeper ways it affects us

925
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:23,260
and what we could do with our reality.

926
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:24,460
Yes.

927
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,300
Well, there's something called navigation.

928
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:29,440
And in navigation, it doesn't matter even just driving

929
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,160
from one city to another, you have to have two things.

930
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,420
You have to know your distance and you have to know your time.

931
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:37,220
When you know your distance and your time, you can figure out your speed.

932
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:41,260
If you know your speed, you could figure out your time and your distance, you see.

933
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:47,220
So once you eliminate that component and disorient people from, let's say, lawful –

934
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:49,260
when I say lawful, it means you don't have to subscribe

935
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:51,780
or buy anything to learn it, right, or use it.

936
01:10:52,500 --> 01:11:00,300
Once you understand that you remove the time aspect from people's ability to navigate –

937
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:03,280
now, when I say navigate, it could be from when you get out of bed

938
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:07,480
and walk to the kitchen in the morning all the way to navigating your week,

939
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:08,800
month, or the rest of your life.

940
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:14,700
Once you eliminate their ability to perceive time in a natural sense, what does that do?

941
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:15,960
You screwed up what?

942
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,780
Their navigation abilities in every aspect, right?

943
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:25,240
Yeah, there are so many health-focused people right now

944
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:29,200
that are emphasizing the importance of the circadian rhythm,

945
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:34,880
that it affects all of our organs and that we need to get sunlight at the right times

946
01:11:35,340 --> 01:11:38,000
and just get the right cycle going,

947
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:42,460
and the effects on health are way more severe than even just what you eat.

948
01:11:43,140 --> 01:11:44,980
Well, I'd like to just add something to that.

949
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:47,680
I'm brought into many conversations regarding health,

950
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:51,540
and I usually start off by just shouting a bunch of pejoratives and hanging up.

951
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,200
Why is that?

952
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:53,560
Why do I do that?

953
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:55,960
Well, because there's really no such thing.

954
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:02,400
When one says health, it implies a physical condition and fitness level.

955
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,020
So when someone asks, for example, how do I be healthy?

956
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:08,020
I would say, for what?

957
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,540
Are you planning on climbing Mount Everest?

958
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,060
Are you planning on sitting at a desk job?

959
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:15,560
Are you a single mom with four children?

960
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:21,100
Are you a UPS driver or a podcaster that likes to play tennis?

961
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:23,280
What are you looking to do?

962
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:30,440
So there really is no universal concept of health as we function in this life that we have.

963
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:34,840
It's what level of fitness and conditioning do you require from yourself

964
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,100
based on what you aspire or are doing.

965
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:38,580
Does that make any sense?

966
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:39,820
It does.

967
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:40,220
Yes, it does.

968
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:47,340
I think really most people just want to avoid those symptoms of illness and feeling yucky.

969
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:53,320
I'm avoiding certain terms, but you want to create a chasm between those chapters of your life

970
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:56,560
where you're stuck in bed for a week, and that's what people generally mean.

971
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:01,020
I'll give an analogy, and people can think about this in many ways.

972
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:08,960
Early on when the macrobiotic movement from Japan, like Michio Kushi and Shizuko Yamamoto,

973
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:13,640
landed in the U.S. in the 60s and 70s, they landed in San Francisco,

974
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:19,800
and they started doing, let's say, clinics and seminars, workshops on eat whole foods,

975
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,100
things that are not processed.

976
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:24,660
What do I mean by that is if you go and buy food for yourself,

977
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:28,080
if it comes on a package with labeling, it's still processed.

978
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:34,540
So, in essence, buying things that have not been processed, using that word again.

979
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:39,500
They were holding these clinics, and they had a general population that was coming.

980
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:43,360
For the first few times, they held these workshops in the 60s and 70s.

981
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:48,600
But after about two or three weeks, most of the audience fell away,

982
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:52,940
except for a lot of the young people that were experimenting with drugs,

983
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
let's just say, in the 60s and 70s.

984
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:57,860
And they stopped one day, and they said,

985
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:01,360
why do you particular guys keep coming back?

986
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:05,760
And they say, well, because once we started eating whole grains and whole vegetables,

987
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:10,300
the way you mentioned, we didn't need to do drugs anymore,

988
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,000
and we still felt high all the time.

989
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:12,920
That's why we're here.

990
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:20,420
So that was a very interesting, poignant example of how you're feeling.

991
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:26,720
And it is true, by the way, if you eat seasonally, whole foods,

992
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,980
it means animal as well, on occasion, animal, you know, poultry, fish, meat, whatever.

993
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:36,000
You will feel a sense of revitalization in the body,

994
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:39,700
because basically that's what the body is here to do,

995
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:43,060
is to process things that are whole in nature,

996
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:47,320
which is an entire other discussion of what processed foods and health and disease is.

997
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,900
Yeah, there's so much debate about what's the right diet,

998
01:14:51,060 --> 01:14:56,520
but the universal constant is that it's getting off of the industrial diet.

999
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:59,620
That is what makes people feel better, regardless of what you're eating,

1000
01:14:59,700 --> 01:15:01,020
as long as it's whole foods.

1001
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:03,520
And the seasonality is really interesting.

1002
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:09,680
I've heard that described as what food really is, fruits and vegetables.

1003
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:15,320
It is a container for light energy to then make its way into our body.

1004
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:18,440
So there's different qualities of light in different seasons,

1005
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,200
and different containers hold it differently.

1006
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:26,220
It's like another system that's parallel to the circadian rhythm,

1007
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,420
that's just like a seasonal rhythm,

1008
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:34,200
and being in flow with it has effects that are optimal for people.

1009
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,300
What's optimal is the simplicity of it.

1010
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,960
Let's look at it from the chemistry point of view.

1011
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:42,400
If you're living in a cold climate,

1012
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,700
let's say latitudes that are generally cold,

1013
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:49,680
and you start to consume things that are grown in the tropics.

1014
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,160
When those things are grown in the tropics,

1015
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,640
the reason why they're growing is because they're in balance.

1016
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,720
And if you're in a cold climate,

1017
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:03,240
and you eat things that are grown in a warm climate or warm area, warm season,

1018
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:06,340
they will adjust your body to the warm season.

1019
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:07,100
Really?

1020
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:08,400
And you're in a cold place.

1021
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:09,980
It's very easy to determine.

1022
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:14,640
It will thin out your blood and have you adjust to a warm climate,

1023
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:19,200
and you will just be freezing no matter how warm you try to stay.

1024
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,300
And the opposite is true.

1025
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:22,280
If you're living in the tropics, let's say,

1026
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:25,720
and there's this new fad about eating Arctic salmon.

1027
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:30,000
You start eating the Arctic salmon, which is in balance in a cold area,

1028
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:32,600
you will not be able to cool down in the tropics.

1029
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:33,600
It's very simple.

1030
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:36,560
I have many examples where I met someone a while back,

1031
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:39,180
and I'm here near Tucson, Arizona.

1032
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:41,240
It doesn't get that cold, but, you know,

1033
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:44,380
in the fall I could still be out in a long-sleeve shirt just fine.

1034
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:47,400
She was wearing a sweater and a hat,

1035
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:50,000
and she was kind of chilly and feeling cold,

1036
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:52,040
and I was comfortable in a long-sleeve shirt.

1037
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:54,980
And I went over to her house, and she had bananas on her counter,

1038
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:56,760
and I said, what are these?

1039
01:16:56,780 --> 01:16:58,780
And she says, well, I eat those every day because of potassium.

1040
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,060
And I said, well, let's get rid of the bananas,

1041
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:04,760
and we went out and got a piece of salmon and poached it.

1042
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,720
And I said, eat this for the next three days.

1043
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:10,180
And in three days, she was out with just a long-sleeve shirt like me,

1044
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:10,960
feeling just fine.

1045
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:14,500
So you can see immediate results with just the seasonality

1046
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:15,860
from just the basic chemistry,

1047
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:19,020
then energetic and emotional perspective as well.

1048
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:20,200
Right on.

1049
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:20,860
That's interesting.

1050
01:17:20,980 --> 01:17:23,420
I've never heard anybody talking about temperature

1051
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:25,700
and the seasonality aspect like that.

1052
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:26,120
Yes.

1053
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,860
That's really unique.

1054
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:30,640
So I wanted to bring the Archon in again.

1055
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:34,440
I know he's playing co-pilot here, and I appreciate it,

1056
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,700
but he did take the time to be here with us today.

1057
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:39,240
I feel like it's rude to not bring him in a couple of times.

1058
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:42,020
So, Archon, what do you think?

1059
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:43,380
We have some time left.

1060
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,680
I have, obviously, a few other things I want to get to,

1061
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:50,320
but what do you consider some of the Greek's most unique positions

1062
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:53,280
or insights that we should definitely get on the record here?

1063
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:59,040
Well, I think that, for me, it helped me with attaining a certain level

1064
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,860
of objectivity with how I look at things,

1065
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:04,760
particularly with the things that he's talked about concerning deception,

1066
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:07,540
which I think you've touched on once or twice in the conversation.

1067
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:11,720
The fact that one of the chief qualities of this society

1068
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:17,680
is that humans seem destined to never really know the truth about anything,

1069
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:21,860
and not only do these illusions appear impenetrable,

1070
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:25,160
but even this notion of the truth is a very poorly defined concept.

1071
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:29,400
So we now live in, as you may have heard previously,

1072
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:34,480
in a post-truth world where post-modernism has come back to the forefront

1073
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,760
where people profess that nothing can be known.

1074
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:41,380
And so it's a society where this deception is very much paramount,

1075
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:44,660
which is why people expect their news to inform them

1076
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:47,340
when, in fact, it deludes them, and they expect their jobs to be meaningful

1077
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:50,260
when, in fact, most jobs are banal and repetitive.

1078
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:54,660
And it's our parents and our schools and government and media

1079
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:58,700
that work together to create this tier of reality that is known as the mainstream,

1080
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:01,780
where everything just runs on plausible deniability,

1081
01:19:02,300 --> 01:19:05,420
but when you examine the so-called truisms that uphold them,

1082
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,380
they don't really hold up.

1083
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:11,680
And I find that the Greek has unpacked these things in a very easy-to-access way,

1084
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:16,520
where you're able to ruminate on them and generate further conclusions from them,

1085
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:19,420
where, you know, we're being taught that these institutions

1086
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,460
are the high churches of reliable authority,

1087
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,060
but it becomes more and more evident that, in fact, they're not.

1088
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:31,240
And I also think that it kind of lends credence to this idea of conspiracy theories,

1089
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:32,540
even though they are mocked now.

1090
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:35,620
It's become very much routine in the last 10 years to disparage them,

1091
01:19:36,020 --> 01:19:39,900
but there's something in them that people are more and more compelled to pay attention to

1092
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:42,460
because mainstream narratives don't really make sense.

1093
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,540
And so that's kind of what I've tried to do with Greekspeak.com,

1094
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:48,080
is unpack these different facets of society

1095
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,900
in ways that help people move their thoughts along.

1096
01:19:52,300 --> 01:19:58,940
Yes, well, you are really great at summarizing complex stuff, as is the Greek,

1097
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:03,740
and I appreciate the structure you have made on the website.

1098
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:07,180
And it kind of speaks to what I've heard the Greeks say

1099
01:20:07,180 --> 01:20:11,600
in terms of general navigation of reality,

1100
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,780
that rejecting what's commonly accepted right away

1101
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:18,130
and then going back with diverse discernment

1102
01:20:18,130 --> 01:20:22,410
is always the right way to navigate.

1103
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:26,890
It's just the default way should be to reject what's commonly accepted

1104
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:29,910
and go back and really go over it

1105
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:34,190
and be fully aware and present with that investigation.

1106
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:38,790
And I think that applies to literally every subject.

1107
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:44,650
I think that's probably distilled down to the simplest advice for getting through this mess.

1108
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:48,490
Yeah, I would actually refer to a quote.

1109
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:50,610
I don't know how many years ago the Greek made it,

1110
01:20:50,710 --> 01:20:52,230
but he basically said,

1111
01:20:52,730 --> 01:20:56,070
you know, take everything you know that you think is right-side up

1112
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:58,650
and turn it upside down, and now it's actually right-side up.

1113
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:02,530
And that's actually been helpful for discerning a lot of things.

1114
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:08,470
We see these kinds of things sort of reoccur in pop culture tropes as well.

1115
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:12,150
I think of the movie They Live, right, where the guy puts on the glasses

1116
01:21:12,150 --> 01:21:15,510
and a lot of things that seem one way are actually the very opposite.

1117
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:19,790
So that sometimes helps for making sense of things.

1118
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:23,150
Well, Greek, let me ask you about that.

1119
01:21:23,270 --> 01:21:26,590
The notion that we should flip everything 180 degrees,

1120
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:30,310
you know, that applies to, say, the timekeeping

1121
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:32,510
because we're told the day starts at midnight.

1122
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:34,070
And you say, no, it's actually high noon.

1123
01:21:34,110 --> 01:21:39,910
That's a complete 180, a total clear-as-day inversion.

1124
01:21:40,670 --> 01:21:44,510
But that line of thinking has also gotten people,

1125
01:21:44,910 --> 01:21:47,830
I would say maybe off track, I don't know exactly,

1126
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:51,050
but people say, oh, well, if we're told the Earth is round,

1127
01:21:51,170 --> 01:21:55,550
well, it must be flat because that is the polar opposite of that.

1128
01:21:55,890 --> 01:22:01,970
I'm just curious if you think that that 180 inversion is always applicable

1129
01:22:01,970 --> 01:22:05,430
or if it's sometimes taken in the wrong direction,

1130
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:11,130
or should people, even out of spite, even out of just contempt, say,

1131
01:22:11,230 --> 01:22:15,010
you know what, I'd rather operate as if everything is exactly the opposite

1132
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:17,190
of any mainstream thought?

1133
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:22,270
Well, that's where the concept of knowing versus information comes in

1134
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:24,710
because you can get information of all sorts,

1135
01:22:24,830 --> 01:22:26,430
and some is a lie and some is not.

1136
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:30,170
But if you just focus on the knowing, if you know something is a lie,

1137
01:22:30,290 --> 01:22:32,210
well, it's discerned immediately.

1138
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:36,450
Flipping something, let's say, like the shape of the Earth

1139
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:41,630
and, let's say, large concepts, we were discussing biology.

1140
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:44,670
Even that, for example, if you just take the standard notion

1141
01:22:44,670 --> 01:22:48,610
that you're a pressurized filter bag, that might work for you.

1142
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:53,470
But ultimately, when you run into a glitch or a problem, it won't.

1143
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:55,730
And the same thing is with the shape of the Earth.

1144
01:22:56,470 --> 01:22:59,610
There was a sort of, I wouldn't say a movement as recently

1145
01:22:59,610 --> 01:23:02,690
because there was no Internet back then, but in the mid-'80s,

1146
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:04,970
there was a lot of concern about the shape of the Earth,

1147
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:06,330
and I was quite involved in that.

1148
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:11,210
I was questioning publicly, what shape is the Earth?

1149
01:23:11,330 --> 01:23:14,470
And I found out that, depending on what you do,

1150
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:17,630
if you're an architect or a farmer, it's as flat as a board.

1151
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:21,030
But if you're a surveyor, you better believe it's round

1152
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:25,010
because you can't strike a triangle on the ground that has 180 degrees.

1153
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:26,510
It'll always be greater.

1154
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:30,230
So, again, it's one's perception and what you're trying to do.

1155
01:23:30,690 --> 01:23:34,310
This gets into, need I say, simulation theory concept.

1156
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:36,430
It's what you focus on.

1157
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:42,350
Flipping at 180 is very easy, I should say, to gain success with the mainstream.

1158
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:45,870
Like, I love how accurate the mainstream news is based on that

1159
01:23:45,870 --> 01:23:49,970
because whatever they tell you, what's going on is really the opposite, right?

1160
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:53,090
So when they tell you there's terrorism, it's really not terrorism.

1161
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:54,310
It's some kind of exercise.

1162
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:57,490
When they tell you it's an exercise, it was really terrorism, you see,

1163
01:23:58,090 --> 01:23:59,510
is one way to look at it.

1164
01:24:00,190 --> 01:24:04,690
The more mainstream the notion, whether it's science, religion, politics, or whatever,

1165
01:24:05,130 --> 01:24:07,790
the 180 works really well.

1166
01:24:07,930 --> 01:24:08,810
It may not be 180.

1167
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:13,750
It might be 179 degrees, right, or 181 degrees, pretty close.

1168
01:24:14,150 --> 01:24:17,450
But when you use that principle on, let's say, mainstream concepts,

1169
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:19,210
it's frighteningly accurate.

1170
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:23,390
So, again, it would be knowledge versus information.

1171
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:28,670
You know, when you know a lie is a lie, well, what about information?

1172
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:30,070
What about facts?

1173
01:24:30,190 --> 01:24:31,430
They don't matter anymore, do they?

1174
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:32,850
Right.

1175
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:37,690
And let's apply that inversion principle, that 180 type of thinking,

1176
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:43,610
to the question of aliens because the mainstream is talking about this

1177
01:24:43,610 --> 01:24:44,710
more than ever.

1178
01:24:45,090 --> 01:24:48,430
And, of course, it seems like throughout the 90s and early 2000s

1179
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:54,090
they seeded certain people in the alternative community to frame the ET question

1180
01:24:54,090 --> 01:24:56,130
within a certain structure.

1181
01:24:56,930 --> 01:25:02,330
And I'm more skeptical than ever that the sci-fi lens is the accurate one

1182
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:04,390
because the Pentagon's talking about it.

1183
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:09,210
So I think there's non-human beings that exist.

1184
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:12,190
We talked a little bit about the hierarchy, the spiritual hierarchy,

1185
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:16,430
but I'm very skeptical of this context we're told to think about them in.

1186
01:25:16,430 --> 01:25:19,430
How would you invert the concept of aliens?

1187
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:22,930
If they come from space, we're told, do they really come from inside the earth?

1188
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:28,110
All of the above, but no one's right, no one's wrong.

1189
01:25:28,190 --> 01:25:29,490
It's a matter of one's perception.

1190
01:25:30,030 --> 01:25:33,630
What are you planning on doing with the information and the knowledge of them

1191
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:34,570
or them?

1192
01:25:34,890 --> 01:25:39,330
I mentioned earlier that all of the organs in living organisms tend to be alien

1193
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:40,810
to each other and they're in agreement.

1194
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:44,310
And if something was, for example, completely alien,

1195
01:25:44,310 --> 01:25:47,190
it would be outside your perception so it wouldn't matter anyway.

1196
01:25:48,410 --> 01:25:50,950
I know it sounds like a philosophical lawyer to answer,

1197
01:25:51,610 --> 01:25:56,450
but it doesn't really matter at this point because there's a level of hypocrisy

1198
01:25:56,450 --> 01:25:58,630
here also in society.

1199
01:25:59,690 --> 01:26:02,110
You know, there's all kinds of hypocrisy,

1200
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:06,090
and the hypocrisy here is you don't know enough about yourself to be able to

1201
01:26:06,090 --> 01:26:08,610
introduce yourself to another species.

1202
01:26:08,750 --> 01:26:13,610
For example, in the 1950s the typical meme was the saucer lands on someone's

1203
01:26:13,610 --> 01:26:15,230
front lawn and the little green men come out.

1204
01:26:15,330 --> 01:26:17,450
What's the first thing they say to the guy watering his lawn?

1205
01:26:18,410 --> 01:26:23,190
Take me to your leader because obviously you don't know a damn thing.

1206
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:24,790
You see?

1207
01:26:25,930 --> 01:26:27,830
Yes, yes, I get that.

1208
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:31,850
And really I don't know what I would do with the information except it would be

1209
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:35,330
the satisfaction of my curiosity.

1210
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:38,930
Obviously that's why I do what I do is asking these questions and trying to get

1211
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:42,010
at things that people don't really get at that often.

1212
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:44,170
And maybe there is no way to know,

1213
01:26:44,270 --> 01:26:49,650
but I do like the general concept that we don't know ourselves enough to even

1214
01:26:49,650 --> 01:26:51,230
know something else.

1215
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:52,470
We should probably start there.

1216
01:26:53,050 --> 01:26:54,770
Well, I just want to interject one more thing.

1217
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:58,370
There's an old saying that says we have found the enemy and the enemy is us.

1218
01:26:58,930 --> 01:27:02,690
We have found the aliens and the aliens are, you guessed it.

1219
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:04,450
Yes.

1220
01:27:04,730 --> 01:27:09,990
I do think that there's something to be said for how many pop culture tropes do

1221
01:27:09,990 --> 01:27:10,950
refer to this.

1222
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:14,990
You were talking earlier before about the mind control parasites that

1223
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:16,690
manipulate society from the shadows.

1224
01:27:17,290 --> 01:27:20,490
Perhaps you can say slash ETs or ET control.

1225
01:27:21,370 --> 01:27:24,030
These are things that have had a lot of staying power,

1226
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:25,390
whether that's, you know,

1227
01:27:25,470 --> 01:27:26,810
revenge of the body snatchers,

1228
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:28,730
animorphs in the 90s,

1229
01:27:28,810 --> 01:27:30,710
or more recently a parasite.

1230
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:35,750
I think we've heard of perhaps somebody called Donald Marshall speak of,

1231
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:37,330
you know, the Vril and things like this.

1232
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:41,410
I do think that the frustrating aspect is that no one has really come forward

1233
01:27:41,410 --> 01:27:45,270
recently who can give an accurate and believable account of these things

1234
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:48,030
where there aren't leakages in their story.

1235
01:27:48,190 --> 01:27:51,170
Like most of the messengers who convey this information will typically be

1236
01:27:51,170 --> 01:27:52,250
compromised in some way,

1237
01:27:52,630 --> 01:27:55,930
whether it's mentally or through some kind of inconsistency in their story.

1238
01:27:56,090 --> 01:27:59,050
So it does warrant a bit further examination,

1239
01:27:59,270 --> 01:27:59,550
I think.

1240
01:28:00,330 --> 01:28:03,170
I think it has been obfuscated a lot in the alt media.

1241
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:07,010
It might serve people better to refer to historical records.

1242
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:10,590
Because there are all kinds of aberrations that happen throughout history that

1243
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:14,390
get either covered up or eventually they go underground so that things can move

1244
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:16,210
on in an uninterrupted way.

1245
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:20,770
What comes to mind for me is there's a lot of references,

1246
01:28:21,570 --> 01:28:24,010
especially medieval times to the dog-headed people.

1247
01:28:24,490 --> 01:28:25,990
I've never been able to really pronounce their names,

1248
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:29,030
but I think it's Cynocephaly or Kinocephaly.

1249
01:28:29,450 --> 01:28:30,470
It's quite hard to spell,

1250
01:28:30,610 --> 01:28:31,890
but if you Google dog-headed people,

1251
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:32,730
you'll come across it.

1252
01:28:33,370 --> 01:28:33,630
You know,

1253
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:34,970
they were known by the ancient Greeks,

1254
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:37,110
persisted into late antiquity.

1255
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:37,910
Obviously,

1256
01:28:38,190 --> 01:28:40,630
Egyptian gods like Anubis channel that visual.

1257
01:28:41,370 --> 01:28:45,450
And so the same goes for the ideas of parasites or ETs or whatever else.

1258
01:28:45,490 --> 01:28:48,390
It may be that ancient records hold more of an answer for that than

1259
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:49,270
contemporary stuff.

1260
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:50,190
Yeah,

1261
01:28:50,490 --> 01:28:51,070
I agree.

1262
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:54,870
And another thing that makes me skeptical of the contemporary stuff and the

1263
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:57,370
people who speak about it is typically their resumes.

1264
01:28:57,730 --> 01:29:01,450
They're generally involved with military intelligence or ex-military.

1265
01:29:02,030 --> 01:29:07,470
These are not the people that I want to get my raw truths about the ET reality

1266
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:08,810
from,

1267
01:29:09,190 --> 01:29:11,570
but because of their framing,

1268
01:29:11,710 --> 01:29:13,070
I tend to just default to,

1269
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:14,010
what else is there?

1270
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:18,530
They're either beings from inside the earth that live alongside us and always

1271
01:29:18,530 --> 01:29:18,850
have.

1272
01:29:18,910 --> 01:29:24,130
They aren't just some distant visitors that occasionally pop through or

1273
01:29:24,130 --> 01:29:25,090
they're multi-dimensional,

1274
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:27,690
which again is closer to home.

1275
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:31,650
They're something of a passenger on this ride along with us.

1276
01:29:31,730 --> 01:29:34,830
We've just kind of removed all religious context.

1277
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:37,670
We're strictly materialist as a general culture.

1278
01:29:38,130 --> 01:29:40,370
So these things are just put in a box of,

1279
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:40,590
well,

1280
01:29:40,650 --> 01:29:45,870
you must be mistaken when you have an encounter yet people always do.

1281
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:47,230
I hear stories all the time,

1282
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:48,570
obviously part of the job,

1283
01:29:48,690 --> 01:29:53,430
but those stories in aggregate really make you think like there is something

1284
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:54,150
else here.

1285
01:29:55,750 --> 01:29:59,590
It's more embedded in our environment than we're led to believe.

1286
01:30:00,330 --> 01:30:01,170
Yeah, clearly.

1287
01:30:03,430 --> 01:30:05,310
So while we still have a little time,

1288
01:30:05,390 --> 01:30:08,730
I want to get into some provocative stuff I still have in the outline.

1289
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:10,270
In a previous interview,

1290
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:10,790
Greek,

1291
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:14,590
you were asked about project looking glass technologies that can see the

1292
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:17,150
future and the most likely outcomes.

1293
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:17,630
And you said,

1294
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:17,890
yes,

1295
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:18,610
it's possible.

1296
01:30:18,610 --> 01:30:23,490
It seems like technologies like this that might be in use behind the curtain

1297
01:30:23,490 --> 01:30:29,210
could have been either ancient relics or given to the elite by so-called

1298
01:30:29,210 --> 01:30:29,850
aliens.

1299
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:30,270
Well,

1300
01:30:30,590 --> 01:30:35,430
which source of such a technology do you consider to be more likely?

1301
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:38,830
The concept of amplification.

1302
01:30:40,330 --> 01:30:44,690
We use something called a bicycle because just paraphrasing here,

1303
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:49,090
you can walk three miles or use a bicycle and travel 11 miles for the same

1304
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:49,430
energy.

1305
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:50,390
And you have a seat,

1306
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:50,850
you know,

1307
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:51,430
when you're tired,

1308
01:30:51,510 --> 01:30:51,710
right?

1309
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:53,790
It's very similar.

1310
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:55,490
I give an example,

1311
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:56,510
let's say,

1312
01:30:56,610 --> 01:30:58,430
starting from the human body.

1313
01:30:58,870 --> 01:31:01,750
Have you ever been in a really tight spot,

1314
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:02,830
a real bad situation,

1315
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:06,290
and there's a little voice you hear that says,

1316
01:31:06,330 --> 01:31:07,610
everything's going to be all right.

1317
01:31:08,290 --> 01:31:08,730
Yeah.

1318
01:31:08,890 --> 01:31:10,410
Most of us experience that.

1319
01:31:10,410 --> 01:31:11,930
But what I'm suggesting that is,

1320
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:15,730
is that's you in the future recalling that event.

1321
01:31:17,090 --> 01:31:18,530
And then someone will say,

1322
01:31:18,610 --> 01:31:18,710
well,

1323
01:31:18,710 --> 01:31:18,930
Greek,

1324
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:21,030
what if I don't hear that little voice?

1325
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:21,810
Well,

1326
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:27,910
that means that it just might be your end or you will not recall this event in

1327
01:31:27,910 --> 01:31:28,390
the future.

1328
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:29,090
Right.

1329
01:31:29,170 --> 01:31:29,910
If you make it,

1330
01:31:29,950 --> 01:31:30,230
you see.

1331
01:31:30,650 --> 01:31:33,790
So what I'm suggesting here is that we can't change the past,

1332
01:31:33,910 --> 01:31:36,370
but we can influence it because hearing that little voice,

1333
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:37,410
everything's going to be all right,

1334
01:31:37,410 --> 01:31:40,130
doesn't change that you're not in a bad spot.

1335
01:31:40,270 --> 01:31:41,250
You're still in a bad spot,

1336
01:31:41,930 --> 01:31:43,650
but it influenced it slightly.

1337
01:31:44,270 --> 01:31:44,470
You see.

1338
01:31:44,930 --> 01:31:49,130
So that is actually very pragmatic because how do I know?

1339
01:31:49,290 --> 01:31:49,390
Well,

1340
01:31:49,410 --> 01:31:51,430
actually I brought up the point and you said,

1341
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:51,670
yeah,

1342
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:51,990
right.

1343
01:31:52,390 --> 01:31:53,430
You've gotten that as well.

1344
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:55,850
So imagine we have a metric,

1345
01:31:57,090 --> 01:31:59,570
not just the scientific tools that are available today,

1346
01:31:59,610 --> 01:32:02,450
but let's just say there are scientific tools that are available today,

1347
01:32:02,510 --> 01:32:03,850
not the ones available to us.

1348
01:32:04,090 --> 01:32:06,210
That actually measures how that happens.

1349
01:32:06,210 --> 01:32:09,170
Just as simply as one point,

1350
01:32:09,230 --> 01:32:10,970
we had a mail letters across the country.

1351
01:32:11,070 --> 01:32:13,730
Now we can just do it with audio.

1352
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:19,470
And that is completely describable before it went from pony express to

1353
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:19,890
railroad,

1354
01:32:20,070 --> 01:32:20,670
to airplane,

1355
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:20,970
to,

1356
01:32:21,090 --> 01:32:21,490
you know,

1357
01:32:21,510 --> 01:32:21,950
all that.

1358
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:27,070
And we bypass that just simply by using wires and a signal over the wire.

1359
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:29,630
And we bypass that now by going wireless.

1360
01:32:30,010 --> 01:32:31,930
All of that is totally explainable.

1361
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:38,630
What this looking into the future or the past is completely explainable once the

1362
01:32:38,630 --> 01:32:42,170
tools and the methodologies and the processes are made available.

1363
01:32:42,810 --> 01:32:43,550
And again,

1364
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:44,330
like Sam mentioned,

1365
01:32:44,650 --> 01:32:47,370
there are people coming out and describing these things,

1366
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:49,750
but again,

1367
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:50,690
it's just a description.

1368
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:53,870
There really hasn't been anyone that's come forward and just laid out an

1369
01:32:53,870 --> 01:32:54,150
explanation,

1370
01:32:55,250 --> 01:32:55,430
you know,

1371
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:56,590
a DIY kit,

1372
01:32:56,670 --> 01:32:56,870
right.

1373
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:59,250
Or it's not available to the public,

1374
01:32:59,250 --> 01:33:03,570
but I would suggest just hearing that little voice is actually you in the

1375
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:03,850
future.

1376
01:33:03,970 --> 01:33:07,910
Recalling it is something that is really measurable.

1377
01:33:08,270 --> 01:33:09,330
And once it's measurable,

1378
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:10,410
guess what?

1379
01:33:10,490 --> 01:33:12,090
Just like walking on a bicycle,

1380
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:13,070
it can be amplified.

1381
01:33:14,510 --> 01:33:14,870
Yeah.

1382
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:17,490
Very interesting way to explain it.

1383
01:33:17,870 --> 01:33:19,630
I think that makes a lot of sense.

1384
01:33:19,730 --> 01:33:19,850
Now,

1385
01:33:19,910 --> 01:33:22,970
if a technology like that,

1386
01:33:22,990 --> 01:33:25,370
that kind of told the future or amplified,

1387
01:33:25,550 --> 01:33:27,950
it could be discovered as an ancient relic.

1388
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:30,810
That says some interesting things about the ancient world.

1389
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:33,270
There are researchers that suggest this,

1390
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:37,690
but I'm curious what you think about how much of colonization,

1391
01:33:38,350 --> 01:33:38,970
war,

1392
01:33:39,410 --> 01:33:39,990
invasion,

1393
01:33:40,430 --> 01:33:45,290
how much of these situations are actually driven by a secret motivation to

1394
01:33:45,290 --> 01:33:50,390
uncover such things rather than the reasons were given on the surface.

1395
01:33:51,790 --> 01:33:51,990
Oh,

1396
01:33:52,070 --> 01:33:53,370
that humanity,

1397
01:33:53,370 --> 01:33:58,290
let's say surface dwelling earth inhabitants specifically are kept in a

1398
01:33:58,290 --> 01:34:03,350
cage where their society can reach a technological or scientific or

1399
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:06,270
performance apex that is limited.

1400
01:34:06,570 --> 01:34:09,450
And then they're knocked down and they start all over again with very little

1401
01:34:09,450 --> 01:34:13,090
from the past is basically the modality,

1402
01:34:13,190 --> 01:34:15,290
the MO on the earth,

1403
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:16,850
as far as we can see.

1404
01:34:17,710 --> 01:34:18,590
So yes,

1405
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:19,890
all of that plays a big point,

1406
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:23,330
but there is going to be a relief from that,

1407
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:24,190
I would suggest.

1408
01:34:24,410 --> 01:34:26,090
And I'm not just suggesting it from,

1409
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:27,830
let's say a personal hopeful perspective,

1410
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:31,030
but from what is known as a prophetic perspective.

1411
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:32,270
And when I say prophetic,

1412
01:34:32,390 --> 01:34:36,530
meaning from every culture that there will come a time where we will be freed

1413
01:34:36,530 --> 01:34:37,370
from this cycle.

1414
01:34:39,270 --> 01:34:39,750
Yeah.

1415
01:34:39,810 --> 01:34:44,870
I've heard you use the analogy of a movie for this basically round of

1416
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:45,370
civilization,

1417
01:34:45,890 --> 01:34:51,250
that if you take the timeline and say 2000 year chunks,

1418
01:34:51,650 --> 01:34:52,030
well,

1419
01:34:52,170 --> 01:34:56,990
we have just been engaged with the movie and now we're in the credits.

1420
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:58,090
And what are the credits?

1421
01:34:58,210 --> 01:35:00,710
It's where you learn who made the movie.

1422
01:35:01,010 --> 01:35:02,890
You learn who the director was,

1423
01:35:02,950 --> 01:35:04,310
who the key grip was,

1424
01:35:04,370 --> 01:35:05,470
who the producers were.

1425
01:35:05,930 --> 01:35:07,590
So in a sense,

1426
01:35:07,670 --> 01:35:11,910
it's very adjacent to what people say about an apocalypse.

1427
01:35:12,090 --> 01:35:14,110
An apocalypse is a great revealing,

1428
01:35:14,110 --> 01:35:15,190
a revealing of what?

1429
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:15,570
Well,

1430
01:35:15,770 --> 01:35:20,130
that we're run by secret societies and a cabal that doesn't care about you and

1431
01:35:20,130 --> 01:35:21,450
they've manipulated everything.

1432
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:28,450
And it comes intertwined with the collapse of civilization because it's all

1433
01:35:28,450 --> 01:35:30,270
built on their scaffolding.

1434
01:35:30,670 --> 01:35:34,690
So that's the part people tend to focus on is the destruction of everything,

1435
01:35:35,250 --> 01:35:37,910
but it's through the process of revealing,

1436
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:39,770
which is what the credits would be.

1437
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:40,910
So I like that analogy.

1438
01:35:41,510 --> 01:35:41,790
Yes.

1439
01:35:41,950 --> 01:35:42,510
Thank you.

1440
01:35:43,170 --> 01:35:46,770
And it's also the way I do it is a two-hour film.

1441
01:35:46,890 --> 01:35:51,090
You just buy two hours of film or two hours and 10 minutes because you need

1442
01:35:51,090 --> 01:35:52,750
credits in the end just for the audience.

1443
01:35:53,250 --> 01:35:55,050
And what's interesting about the credits portion,

1444
01:35:55,530 --> 01:35:57,750
it's very different from when the film is running.

1445
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:59,650
If you stand up and make a disturbance,

1446
01:35:59,770 --> 01:36:02,290
everyone tells you to shut up and sit down during the film.

1447
01:36:03,070 --> 01:36:04,650
So prior to 1998,

1448
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:05,590
around there,

1449
01:36:05,770 --> 01:36:08,430
if there was not a lot of big public,

1450
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:09,170
let's say,

1451
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:12,970
to-do about a lot of the things that are being discussed now,

1452
01:36:13,030 --> 01:36:14,450
let's say from the alternative,

1453
01:36:15,150 --> 01:36:16,990
which I don't like to grant them too much,

1454
01:36:17,110 --> 01:36:18,850
but the conspiratorial minded.

1455
01:36:19,730 --> 01:36:20,670
But what's interesting,

1456
01:36:20,830 --> 01:36:21,830
when the credits are rolling,

1457
01:36:22,450 --> 01:36:23,450
basically stand up,

1458
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:24,150
put your coat on,

1459
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:25,890
no one tells you to shut up and sit down.

1460
01:36:26,070 --> 01:36:28,850
So it's a time where disturbances are accepted.

1461
01:36:30,270 --> 01:36:30,470
Yeah,

1462
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:31,130
that's true.

1463
01:36:31,270 --> 01:36:31,850
That's true.

1464
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:32,670
Another good point.

1465
01:36:32,670 --> 01:36:37,730
And so another interesting thing that you've said,

1466
01:36:37,870 --> 01:36:39,710
Greek on a previous podcast,

1467
01:36:40,030 --> 01:36:43,490
is that all of our world leaders are made to get on their hands and

1468
01:36:43,490 --> 01:36:47,270
knees in front of a group of religious people and eat from dog bowls of

1469
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:47,710
feces,

1470
01:36:47,990 --> 01:36:48,850
blood and urine.

1471
01:36:49,090 --> 01:36:53,650
And I don't know how literal you meant that it obviously works in a

1472
01:36:53,650 --> 01:36:54,690
couple of different ways,

1473
01:36:54,730 --> 01:37:00,410
but I've heard plenty to know that the world is generally run by

1474
01:37:00,410 --> 01:37:01,370
blackmail,

1475
01:37:01,490 --> 01:37:05,450
that public figures are compromised with honeypot operations and

1476
01:37:05,450 --> 01:37:06,750
humiliation rituals.

1477
01:37:07,410 --> 01:37:10,570
But this again is just a very specific claim.

1478
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:15,870
How could you know such a thing or who are these religious people

1479
01:37:15,870 --> 01:37:18,290
carrying out such rituals?

1480
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:21,250
Any elaboration would be appreciated on that.

1481
01:37:22,030 --> 01:37:22,390
Sure.

1482
01:37:22,590 --> 01:37:23,630
These are things that have,

1483
01:37:24,210 --> 01:37:27,290
when you look at information that you want to know about,

1484
01:37:27,770 --> 01:37:29,150
you kind of look at the source.

1485
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:33,030
And sometimes certain sources seem more valid than others,

1486
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:35,530
and you might want to carry it forward or, let's say,

1487
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:39,470
not necessarily restore solidity of the information,

1488
01:37:39,610 --> 01:37:41,550
but just transmit it to others, right?

1489
01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:47,370
So what I would suggest the entire scenario about such a, let's say,

1490
01:37:47,490 --> 01:37:49,790
abominable act or something like that,

1491
01:37:50,110 --> 01:37:53,950
what I want to use as analogy is the story of Lord of the Flies,

1492
01:37:54,030 --> 01:37:56,150
how the children are shipwrecked,

1493
01:37:56,150 --> 01:38:00,230
and within a short time they actually commit murder against the fat kid,

1494
01:38:00,330 --> 01:38:00,490
right?

1495
01:38:01,230 --> 01:38:05,250
So here is a group of children sort of forming a pseudo-society or a

1496
01:38:05,250 --> 01:38:06,770
micro-society on their own.

1497
01:38:07,330 --> 01:38:12,310
And if you observe it, sort of like the animal farm story as well,

1498
01:38:12,650 --> 01:38:15,810
combine animal farm with Lord of the Flies,

1499
01:38:15,910 --> 01:38:18,630
and you see a very vicious, very cruel,

1500
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:24,610
almost abominable setting that is kept within those works that I mentioned,

1501
01:38:24,610 --> 01:38:30,050
but not really championed as the model example that we have in society.

1502
01:38:30,190 --> 01:38:31,030
Just like, for example,

1503
01:38:31,290 --> 01:38:37,030
the act that you mentioned that I mentioned is not championed as the pinnacle

1504
01:38:37,030 --> 01:38:39,030
act of our world leaders.

1505
01:38:39,030 --> 01:38:41,310
It's kept in secret, but it is accessible.

1506
01:38:41,710 --> 01:38:44,830
There's plenty of people that have come forward, and how horrible?

1507
01:38:45,710 --> 01:38:46,690
Well, horrible how?

1508
01:38:47,150 --> 01:38:53,050
Based on what we consider to be morally active and morally acceptable is.

1509
01:38:53,050 --> 01:38:57,570
And I would suggest that the fringe element, again, more than the alternative,

1510
01:38:57,810 --> 01:38:59,570
because most of the alternative, by the way,

1511
01:38:59,590 --> 01:39:02,430
in conspiratorial is still very much hinged to the mainstream.

1512
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:07,730
But I'm saying that a lot of the very fringe, meaning all the way to the edge,

1513
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:12,690
should be reviewed and accepted as something one should know.

1514
01:39:13,670 --> 01:39:15,110
Well, that's interesting.

1515
01:39:15,290 --> 01:39:18,350
Let's unpack it a little bit, the fringe versus the alternative.

1516
01:39:18,350 --> 01:39:24,370
I generally, for branding purposes and simplicity, call this a conspiracy show.

1517
01:39:25,130 --> 01:39:28,950
I've kind of grown to get away from that term, I suppose,

1518
01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:30,970
when I started the shows in my early 20s.

1519
01:39:31,050 --> 01:39:33,730
Now I'm in my late 30s.

1520
01:39:33,870 --> 01:39:39,110
So, you know, things we think are good descriptions at one point, maybe not later,

1521
01:39:39,250 --> 01:39:41,430
but, you know, you got to do it for consistency's sake.

1522
01:39:41,830 --> 01:39:47,250
But I think it is more the fringe sources of material that I'm more attracted to,

1523
01:39:47,250 --> 01:39:50,070
but it just doesn't have the same ring to it, let's say.

1524
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:54,350
But how would you define the difference between fringe and alternative?

1525
01:39:54,550 --> 01:39:57,310
What do you mean by the fringe is tied to the mainstream,

1526
01:39:58,470 --> 01:40:00,990
and how can we find more fringe sources?

1527
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:04,110
Well, the alternative is tied to the mainstream.

1528
01:40:04,790 --> 01:40:05,510
Give an example.

1529
01:40:05,610 --> 01:40:08,410
Let's say there is a mainstream hoop to do on the Internet,

1530
01:40:08,950 --> 01:40:12,210
and you have bookmarked some alternative media sources.

1531
01:40:12,350 --> 01:40:15,470
You go to the alternative media sources that update daily or whatever.

1532
01:40:15,470 --> 01:40:17,610
Guess what stories they're talking about?

1533
01:40:17,710 --> 01:40:19,390
The same stuff the mainstream is, right?

1534
01:40:19,630 --> 01:40:19,950
Fair.

1535
01:40:20,630 --> 01:40:23,310
Where the fringe would be all the way to the edge,

1536
01:40:23,510 --> 01:40:26,130
and it's something that is just as relevant today,

1537
01:40:26,250 --> 01:40:28,190
that instead of being a mainstream news story,

1538
01:40:28,610 --> 01:40:30,690
was something that was brought out in the 60s,

1539
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:33,750
or something that was brought out in the 70s, 80s,

1540
01:40:33,770 --> 01:40:36,030
or even just 10 years ago, or even recently.

1541
01:40:36,090 --> 01:40:42,430
But it just sits there as someone's account or recount of something that is pertinent

1542
01:40:42,430 --> 01:40:45,850
to what's going on in the world, but not really touched or reviewed

1543
01:40:45,850 --> 01:40:49,350
by definitely not the mainstream or alternative,

1544
01:40:49,850 --> 01:40:51,230
is what I would define as the fringe.

1545
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:55,830
And I think you might have even had, from your history of doing what you do,

1546
01:40:56,050 --> 01:41:00,070
several people that would be more on the fringe than the alternative that you've interviewed.

1547
01:41:00,910 --> 01:41:02,230
I'd probably say so.

1548
01:41:02,290 --> 01:41:05,890
And, of course, there has to be a show every week so we get who we get.

1549
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:10,290
But I think if I were to think about the ones that stick out in my mind the most

1550
01:41:10,290 --> 01:41:14,790
or the ones that excite me the most, it would probably be the ones in the fringe category.

1551
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:20,750
But do you have any sources on the fringe that you consider to be of high value?

1552
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:22,330
Oh, gosh.

1553
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:27,250
This is, again, an inversion, if one hears what I'm going to say.

1554
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:32,530
The most fringe information one can readily get, and when I say one,

1555
01:41:32,570 --> 01:41:35,410
I mean in a lawful sense, I mean it's so accessible to everyone,

1556
01:41:35,410 --> 01:41:43,670
is basically federal registries, old encyclopedias, reference books,

1557
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:49,290
things that were, let's say, meant to be in the public but no one really knows that they exist.

1558
01:41:50,110 --> 01:41:53,610
For example, organizations, certain organizations, many organizations,

1559
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:57,810
have what's called a newsletter, basically put out what's going on,

1560
01:41:58,010 --> 01:42:00,470
various categories every so often in time.

1561
01:42:00,970 --> 01:42:04,690
There's something called the Federal Registry that the American federal government has

1562
01:42:04,690 --> 01:42:07,290
that used to be monthly, I think, and now it's every three months.

1563
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:12,650
And just go look at it, and you'll see some really shocking things that are mentioned

1564
01:42:12,650 --> 01:42:16,110
that are never covered by the mainstream media or the alternative.

1565
01:42:17,310 --> 01:42:21,370
Like, for example, states of emergency, financial situations, things like that.

1566
01:42:22,710 --> 01:42:23,670
Old encyclopedias.

1567
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:27,070
When I say encyclopedia, you're not going to get in depth,

1568
01:42:28,010 --> 01:42:32,150
but you mentioned someone earlier, Charles Hoyt Ford.

1569
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:37,610
He's wonderful to look at because his stuff applies today.

1570
01:42:37,770 --> 01:42:42,870
I like how he makes fun of the scientists in terms of how their things don't make any sense.

1571
01:42:43,170 --> 01:42:44,250
I'll give an example.

1572
01:42:44,830 --> 01:42:46,970
I'm pretty harsh on lawyers and doctors.

1573
01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:49,090
There are no more lawyers anymore, there are attorneys.

1574
01:42:50,050 --> 01:42:53,250
And the reason I say there are no lawyers anymore is because we're not in law,

1575
01:42:53,330 --> 01:42:54,350
we're in a legal system.

1576
01:42:55,310 --> 01:42:57,850
When the country, let's say, I mentioned the Federal Registry,

1577
01:42:58,550 --> 01:43:00,350
people know the Fourth of July.

1578
01:43:00,470 --> 01:43:01,430
Do you know the Fourth of July?

1579
01:43:01,430 --> 01:43:03,590
Yeah, that's just the day after July 3rd, right?

1580
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:06,870
Well, you know, they revere that as an important day.

1581
01:43:06,970 --> 01:43:12,410
But if you bring up, let's say, when it was the – if you look up the history of someone,

1582
01:43:12,470 --> 01:43:14,330
when they were born and when they died, right?

1583
01:43:14,630 --> 01:43:16,670
When they were born, it would be July 4th.

1584
01:43:17,090 --> 01:43:20,850
But people have never heard of March the 9th, 1933, have they?

1585
01:43:20,970 --> 01:43:24,530
You bring up – what significance does March the 9th, 1933 have?

1586
01:43:25,070 --> 01:43:29,070
Well, that's when what's called the United States of America died.

1587
01:43:29,070 --> 01:43:31,510
And it doesn't mean you're buried.

1588
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:33,470
When someone dies, it doesn't mean you're buried.

1589
01:43:33,730 --> 01:43:37,450
They usually put you in a morgue for a few days until you have what's called a funeral

1590
01:43:37,450 --> 01:43:38,330
and a burial, right?

1591
01:43:39,370 --> 01:43:41,010
And anyone could look up that day.

1592
01:43:41,130 --> 01:43:43,510
It's not very censored, what happened on that day.

1593
01:43:43,570 --> 01:43:44,410
It's a very short thing.

1594
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:47,810
It's the Emergency Banking Act, and if you understand the words being used there.

1595
01:43:48,590 --> 01:43:50,570
That's why I mentioned there are no more lawyers.

1596
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:51,870
Basically, there are attorneys.

1597
01:43:52,090 --> 01:43:57,690
And when this happened around 1933, anyone trying to practice law was really in trouble.

1598
01:43:57,690 --> 01:44:04,110
That's why if you remember watching any old black-and-white films that had sort of a prison setting,

1599
01:44:04,210 --> 01:44:06,610
there was always a lawyer and a doctor in the prison.

1600
01:44:07,330 --> 01:44:09,210
They always referred to someone, hey, doc, right?

1601
01:44:09,690 --> 01:44:17,190
Because they also went after the medical people to pretty much reinforce the allopathic medicine.

1602
01:44:17,970 --> 01:44:23,630
I know this is a little bit off of topic, but if you look at the woes of what we were mentioning,

1603
01:44:23,790 --> 01:44:27,270
the health woes of people, and they rely, for example, on the medical industry,

1604
01:44:27,270 --> 01:44:32,930
they are very clearly professing to be allopathic, which means only treating symptoms, right?

1605
01:44:33,010 --> 01:44:34,690
No cures, no healing, none of that.

1606
01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:40,810
And the rest of it is propaganda when we think of going to hospital or a doctor.

1607
01:44:41,770 --> 01:44:46,650
So all of these things, if you want to go to the fringe, actually,

1608
01:44:48,030 --> 01:44:50,810
it's memorialized in most of your reference manuals.

1609
01:44:51,930 --> 01:44:56,290
Another example of fringe would be if you go to an old university

1610
01:44:56,290 --> 01:45:01,090
and study what works they have in their library on any subject

1611
01:45:01,090 --> 01:45:06,130
and then compare that to the current textbooks, you'll see there's very little relevancy.

1612
01:45:06,330 --> 01:45:07,530
They're very, very different.

1613
01:45:09,230 --> 01:45:11,990
You'll have situations, especially here where I am,

1614
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:15,950
I think it was one of the Carnegies bequeathed his personal library here.

1615
01:45:15,950 --> 01:45:21,810
There is an incredible treasure trove of not necessarily looking at old university textbooks,

1616
01:45:22,090 --> 01:45:24,190
but books that have been bequeathed, you know,

1617
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:28,110
people that donated their own personal collections of things written in the 19th century.

1618
01:45:29,010 --> 01:45:34,610
Another thing that I suggest about fringe is that I'm going to make a statement that might shock people,

1619
01:45:34,710 --> 01:45:38,830
but once they take what I'm saying and research it, they'll find most of it to be true,

1620
01:45:39,330 --> 01:45:40,890
because we're not living in that time,

1621
01:45:40,890 --> 01:45:45,990
but everything that could have been known was known about anything by the late 1800s.

1622
01:45:47,610 --> 01:45:48,490
Quite interesting.

1623
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:50,950
Now, I've mentioned this to someone who says,

1624
01:45:51,030 --> 01:45:52,930
well, you know, we have 13-year-olds with smartphones.

1625
01:45:54,070 --> 01:45:58,490
And I'm like, well, if you look at all of the technology that's in a smartphone,

1626
01:45:58,950 --> 01:46:04,030
what makes it technologically advanced to you is that everything is miniaturized,

1627
01:46:04,350 --> 01:46:09,810
but the concepts of all the circuit paths and all the materials in there were around in the late 1800s.

1628
01:46:11,030 --> 01:46:20,970
And all of the technology that people are marveled by today is simply applying extreme aspects of miniaturization.

1629
01:46:21,590 --> 01:46:25,970
Now, if you're impressed by that, I know the ladies are not impressed by miniaturization,

1630
01:46:26,890 --> 01:46:30,930
but anyway, I just wanted to throw in a lascivious comment, but you see what I mean?

1631
01:46:31,150 --> 01:46:33,610
Yes, and this is the place for lascivious comments.

1632
01:46:33,950 --> 01:46:34,190
Okay.

1633
01:46:34,530 --> 01:46:38,490
And yeah, I think that's a good way to look at the world.

1634
01:46:38,490 --> 01:46:45,730
It comes up time and time again that in the 1800s, a lot of the people of real value that I look to,

1635
01:46:46,290 --> 01:46:49,950
you know, the Rudolf Steiners, the Victor Schaubergers, the Charles Forts,

1636
01:46:50,050 --> 01:46:53,850
I mean, they were late 1800s, early 1900s.

1637
01:46:53,870 --> 01:46:59,210
Then by 1930, the robber barons have everything, and it's just been manipulation ever since.

1638
01:46:59,890 --> 01:47:00,810
Yes, pretty much.

1639
01:47:01,610 --> 01:47:03,510
Another thing is the education system.

1640
01:47:03,510 --> 01:47:05,650
There was something called Victorian Grammar School,

1641
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:11,610
which was if you look at the bio of men like that that you mentioned and others,

1642
01:47:12,030 --> 01:47:15,210
the bio usually has when they were born and when they were teaching at Oxford.

1643
01:47:15,490 --> 01:47:19,250
And if you do the math, they're 18 years old teaching at Oxford with a professorship.

1644
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:20,210
How is that possible?

1645
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:21,290
Or 20?

1646
01:47:22,030 --> 01:47:26,930
Because you started your education about seven years old and you finished by 13 or 14.

1647
01:47:27,010 --> 01:47:28,730
Then you went on to further studies.

1648
01:47:29,630 --> 01:47:29,990
Interesting.

1649
01:47:29,990 --> 01:47:34,990
So pretty much the education system at this point, you know,

1650
01:47:35,110 --> 01:47:39,370
from kindergarten or first grade to 12th grade, that's about 1,000 hours a year.

1651
01:47:39,450 --> 01:47:43,110
So 12,000 hours of education to finish up high school.

1652
01:47:43,390 --> 01:47:50,390
And I used to humbly brag that I can reduce all of that to less than 400 hours from 12,000 hours.

1653
01:47:51,110 --> 01:47:52,050
Imagine that.

1654
01:47:52,390 --> 01:47:54,470
So it's very easy to take someone.

1655
01:47:54,790 --> 01:47:56,750
And from the Rudolf Steiner perspective,

1656
01:47:56,750 --> 01:48:02,710
you don't want to teach a lot of the critical technical things for memory until after someone is seven

1657
01:48:02,710 --> 01:48:06,250
or eight years old until they get their final set of adult teeth.

1658
01:48:06,450 --> 01:48:12,130
Because if you know the concept of memory being held in minerals and things like that,

1659
01:48:12,630 --> 01:48:17,470
how crystalline forms retain information, once you get your adult teeth,

1660
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:23,730
you have an aspect of crystalline form that retains your being instead of shedding them.

1661
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:26,230
And it doesn't mean because you lose your teeth you lose your mind.

1662
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:28,990
You can if you try to eat certain things.

1663
01:48:29,490 --> 01:48:32,830
But there are many aspects of these men, of course, Victor Schauberger.

1664
01:48:32,990 --> 01:48:33,990
You didn't mention Tesla.

1665
01:48:34,810 --> 01:48:37,850
But Tesla, I think, has gotten more credit than he deserves,

1666
01:48:37,910 --> 01:48:41,650
even though he's been absconded from the academic record pretty much.

1667
01:48:42,190 --> 01:48:49,690
Because Tesla was part of an entire movement of men where I would suggest that Charles Ford was pretty much like a stand-alone guy,

1668
01:48:49,770 --> 01:48:51,110
and so was Victor Schauberger.

1669
01:48:51,810 --> 01:48:55,750
So, again, there were movements of people doing what they did,

1670
01:48:55,830 --> 01:49:02,250
and then there were some quite unique individuals that were sort of like messiahs of the subject of their time,

1671
01:49:02,330 --> 01:49:04,910
meaning they were true saviors within that subject.

1672
01:49:05,350 --> 01:49:06,330
Yes, yes.

1673
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:09,850
And I was going to ask you about that, because in your sonic events,

1674
01:49:09,850 --> 01:49:14,610
you've mentioned names like Eric Dollard, who I've had the pleasure of interviewing a couple of times,

1675
01:49:14,790 --> 01:49:17,730
but, of course, also Tesla, Victor Schauberger,

1676
01:49:17,730 --> 01:49:24,790
and then a few that I hadn't heard of, like Louis Caveron and Rudolf Goschka.

1677
01:49:25,090 --> 01:49:26,790
Goschka? Rudolf Goschka?

1678
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:29,250
Oh, Hoschka, yes, the vitamin guy.

1679
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:29,990
Hoschka.

1680
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:33,830
That's some of my favorite stuff, is to learn about these people,

1681
01:49:33,910 --> 01:49:36,730
because it's always the same couple that are highlighted.

1682
01:49:36,990 --> 01:49:39,230
You've got your Wilhelm Reichs in there, too.

1683
01:49:39,650 --> 01:49:42,370
And there's a lot of research on some of these figures,

1684
01:49:42,570 --> 01:49:46,310
but when I learn about a new one, I'm really jazzed up.

1685
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:52,210
Are there other bright minds and influences of the past that would kind of fit this archetype?

1686
01:49:52,390 --> 01:49:57,390
I guess alive or dead, but most likely dead, because as we've said, they aren't around much anymore.

1687
01:49:57,610 --> 01:50:02,590
But who are some of the other people that we don't often hear about that you think should be researched?

1688
01:50:03,310 --> 01:50:07,510
Oh, gosh, you know, you've almost just got me here, drawing a blank,

1689
01:50:07,630 --> 01:50:09,570
but I can give you a direct example.

1690
01:50:09,570 --> 01:50:15,750
Living here near Tucson, back in the early 2000s, I met a man named Joe Blankenship.

1691
01:50:16,030 --> 01:50:19,450
I think there's a YouTube video of him being interviewed for about four hours,

1692
01:50:19,590 --> 01:50:20,970
and he was quite an interesting guy.

1693
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:25,630
He was Wilhelm Reich's chauffeur when Wilhelm Reich did work here,

1694
01:50:26,350 --> 01:50:29,890
and I got a lot about Wilhelm Reich that you won't find anywhere else,

1695
01:50:29,990 --> 01:50:33,870
you know, actually him being his personal chauffeur, or driver, I should say.

1696
01:50:34,690 --> 01:50:39,390
Joe Blankenship's mom had a small diner that Howard Hughes would visit,

1697
01:50:40,190 --> 01:50:46,130
and he would go to the diner a half hour before his lunch and pay for the amount of business they would have

1698
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:48,850
in a half hour and ask them to empty out the entire restaurant,

1699
01:50:49,010 --> 01:50:53,650
and he would send a crew in there to wipe things down, and he was one guy who was a flycatcher.

1700
01:50:54,270 --> 01:50:55,790
A lot of interesting stories.

1701
01:50:56,450 --> 01:51:01,630
Giving an example with Joe Blankenship, I was at the ranch one day in his shop,

1702
01:51:01,630 --> 01:51:05,850
and he had this rickety plywood box, and I touched it, and it was shaky.

1703
01:51:06,010 --> 01:51:07,490
I said, you know, I could reinforce that.

1704
01:51:07,570 --> 01:51:08,910
You know, it's kind of shaky. What is it?

1705
01:51:08,930 --> 01:51:10,230
And he says, that's an orgone box.

1706
01:51:10,230 --> 01:51:12,730
And I said, well, why don't I just reinforce it?

1707
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:13,430
It's kind of rickety.

1708
01:51:13,550 --> 01:51:17,050
He says, no, I want to leave it like that, because that's the one that Wilhelm Reich built himself.

1709
01:51:17,790 --> 01:51:18,090
You see?

1710
01:51:18,570 --> 01:51:19,750
So I was like, oh, really?

1711
01:51:19,790 --> 01:51:20,710
Who's Wilhelm Reich?

1712
01:51:22,150 --> 01:51:22,630
You see?

1713
01:51:22,710 --> 01:51:26,490
So I was pretty much enlightened, quote-unquote, by this man.

1714
01:51:26,550 --> 01:51:30,730
He's passed away since for a while, but others like him would come through

1715
01:51:30,730 --> 01:51:32,470
because he was a very interesting individual.

1716
01:51:33,290 --> 01:51:36,490
So that question, I kind of drew a blank, but my suggestion is,

1717
01:51:37,050 --> 01:51:39,010
there are interesting people everywhere.

1718
01:51:39,690 --> 01:51:42,810
It's just that they don't have websites, right?

1719
01:51:43,070 --> 01:51:44,630
They haven't written books.

1720
01:51:45,270 --> 01:51:50,690
You'll find them if you are ready, like the old adage, when the student is ready, right?

1721
01:51:50,890 --> 01:51:52,230
The teacher will appear.

1722
01:51:52,490 --> 01:51:56,710
So I think that these people are sparse and rare in society,

1723
01:51:56,710 --> 01:52:03,250
but when one deems themselves ready for an experience with someone who is interesting like that,

1724
01:52:03,870 --> 01:52:05,350
hate to say it, they will appear.

1725
01:52:05,630 --> 01:52:06,870
But don't plan it.

1726
01:52:07,210 --> 01:52:07,890
Yeah, don't plan it.

1727
01:52:07,930 --> 01:52:08,730
It will just happen.

1728
01:52:08,970 --> 01:52:09,490
Fair enough.

1729
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:14,510
Well, those are my favorite people to try to run into and get on this show,

1730
01:52:14,630 --> 01:52:16,150
whether anonymous or otherwise.

1731
01:52:16,410 --> 01:52:17,490
I mean, we're doing it right now.

1732
01:52:19,070 --> 01:52:22,530
And so as we're really nearing the end of this thing,

1733
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:29,530
I wanted to ask you about just the way that some of the terms are phrased on the website about what you do.

1734
01:52:29,610 --> 01:52:32,310
You say that you don't seek approval, you just seek the truth.

1735
01:52:32,490 --> 01:52:36,290
Sometimes that offends in a culture that is as backwards as this one.

1736
01:52:36,810 --> 01:52:42,550
Well, as we're coming to the end, other lines you have on the website say, for example,

1737
01:52:43,590 --> 01:52:46,230
when I tell people that society is in a bad position,

1738
01:52:46,390 --> 01:52:49,350
they just imagine the current situation being in a worse state.

1739
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:50,230
But that's not it.

1740
01:52:50,230 --> 01:52:55,250
Things are worse than you imagine because of things you don't know anything about.

1741
01:52:55,590 --> 01:53:02,450
Or the contrast to what people think is going on and what's really going on is so huge that you can't talk about it publicly.

1742
01:53:02,890 --> 01:53:12,390
Well, I am interested in the rawest of truths, the deepest of rabbit holes, the most taboo truths available.

1743
01:53:12,830 --> 01:53:19,450
What would you consider to be the most taboo topic that you could speak truth on?

1744
01:53:19,450 --> 01:53:24,670
What are the truths that sometimes seem to even make other truth seekers get a bit queasy?

1745
01:53:26,010 --> 01:53:27,850
Okay, that's a really good question.

1746
01:53:28,150 --> 01:53:33,010
It doesn't need to be pondered much, basically because of the tools we have.

1747
01:53:33,130 --> 01:53:40,210
When I say basic tools, most people have access to what I call the stupid rectangle and the devices that they use.

1748
01:53:40,710 --> 01:53:45,130
One of the things that I tell people when this is brought up is,

1749
01:53:45,130 --> 01:53:51,990
if you go and look on the Internet for the weirdest, most outlandish conspiracy theory,

1750
01:53:52,230 --> 01:53:59,490
whether it's like Dulce, the underground base, or spiders on Mars, or cloning, or anything like that,

1751
01:54:00,190 --> 01:54:02,410
the reality is even worse than that.

1752
01:54:02,470 --> 01:54:04,030
It's even more extreme than that.

1753
01:54:04,150 --> 01:54:09,770
So the most extreme stuff on the Internet is probably closer to the truth than you know.

1754
01:54:09,770 --> 01:54:14,070
Well, I like it, broadly speaking.

1755
01:54:14,290 --> 01:54:19,870
Yeah, I mean, it's hard to know exactly what that means, but I generally agree.

1756
01:54:20,790 --> 01:54:23,830
Yeah, and the thing is to not take it where it drives you insane,

1757
01:54:23,950 --> 01:54:29,550
and don't be prepared to do a public recitation or dissertation on it, because it's not going to be accepted.

1758
01:54:29,670 --> 01:54:33,330
When I say public, it could be just people within five feet reach of you.

1759
01:54:33,650 --> 01:54:35,270
But just take in the information.

1760
01:54:36,230 --> 01:54:40,890
I always say, from a cosmic perspective, information is just that.

1761
01:54:41,290 --> 01:54:43,250
It's not whether you think it's true or not.

1762
01:54:43,310 --> 01:54:44,430
It's, did you get the picture?

1763
01:54:44,570 --> 01:54:45,570
Do you have the notion?

1764
01:54:46,710 --> 01:54:51,530
So later on, very often I tell people certain things that can be accessed,

1765
01:54:52,150 --> 01:54:54,290
and I don't like explaining them.

1766
01:54:54,450 --> 01:54:57,430
Like, for example, the word nice, if you look it up in an etymology,

1767
01:54:58,030 --> 01:55:00,210
it means foolish, stupid, and senseless.

1768
01:55:00,210 --> 01:55:06,050
But I found that if you tell them, they kind of brush it off or give you a chuckle.

1769
01:55:06,170 --> 01:55:12,310
But if you ask them to look it up themselves, it packs like 75% more punch, right?

1770
01:55:12,770 --> 01:55:19,030
So actually giving a laundry list of what I think is outlandish would be not as impactful

1771
01:55:19,030 --> 01:55:23,430
as if people looked up what they tend to have a tendency to look up on their own.

1772
01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:29,370
And I'm suggesting that the weirdest, strangest, most fringe stuff that they could find on the Internet

1773
01:55:29,370 --> 01:55:32,510
is still mild in comparison to what's really going on, possibly.

1774
01:55:33,170 --> 01:55:37,430
Yes, well, that sounds like I'm going to have a job doing this for quite some time,

1775
01:55:37,510 --> 01:55:40,310
which is going to make the wife and kids happy, yes.

1776
01:55:40,810 --> 01:55:42,270
Job security for sure, yeah.

1777
01:55:42,590 --> 01:55:42,970
Indeed.

1778
01:55:43,450 --> 01:55:46,330
Well, this has been really interesting and insightful.

1779
01:55:46,590 --> 01:55:49,230
I appreciate the Archon for getting us together.

1780
01:55:49,490 --> 01:55:53,550
You guys ended your 10th episode saying you'd be working on a new website

1781
01:55:53,550 --> 01:55:56,870
for things that people might consider esoteric now,

1782
01:55:56,870 --> 01:55:59,930
but will be more familiar as time goes on.

1783
01:56:00,010 --> 01:56:03,610
Is that still the plan, and what sorts of things are you referring to, guys?

1784
01:56:04,370 --> 01:56:09,870
Well, yeah, that website has actually also come to fruition and has been concluded.

1785
01:56:10,410 --> 01:56:12,210
It's called Godspeak.com.

1786
01:56:12,410 --> 01:56:12,930
Oh.

1787
01:56:13,390 --> 01:56:17,770
I try to be creative with my names, but they invariably fall into the same template.

1788
01:56:18,370 --> 01:56:24,530
So Godspeak, also with two E's, God, S-P-E-E-K, and there's another podcast on there.

1789
01:56:25,050 --> 01:56:27,290
It didn't progress as far as the Greek-speak.

1790
01:56:28,230 --> 01:56:32,050
It's a sister site simply because, well, of different things.

1791
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:36,310
The so-called pandemic came along, and a lot of my time was taken up with other things.

1792
01:56:36,370 --> 01:56:37,630
So we did get to Episode 8.

1793
01:56:37,870 --> 01:56:41,950
That should be good enough for most people, though we might conclude it at some point in the future.

1794
01:56:42,950 --> 01:56:45,570
Also, a few articles on there, not as many as Greek-speak.

1795
01:56:46,270 --> 01:56:49,490
Now that people are starting slowly but surely to take notice of it,

1796
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:52,570
I may return to actually completing some of those things.

1797
01:56:52,570 --> 01:56:54,350
But it's on there for anybody to explore.

1798
01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:55,570
Oh, man.

1799
01:56:55,630 --> 01:57:02,050
It's so bittersweet because it's very rare that I miss a whole aspect of a person's work,

1800
01:57:02,150 --> 01:57:04,230
but these sites aren't necessarily connected.

1801
01:57:04,670 --> 01:57:12,730
But now I'm seeing you've got the ancient world, spirits and soul, the gods, Judaism, Christianity, Islam,

1802
01:57:13,230 --> 01:57:16,730
Eastern religions, very intriguing stuff.

1803
01:57:16,870 --> 01:57:21,570
I mean, maybe we'll get to it in a future interview, but that is great.

1804
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:26,710
I like the formatting of the websites, the presentation of the material.

1805
01:57:27,470 --> 01:57:28,290
Good stuff, guys.

1806
01:57:28,370 --> 01:57:32,730
I think what you do is worth people checking out.

1807
01:57:32,970 --> 01:57:37,830
So Greek-speak, S-P-E-E-K, is the initial website.

1808
01:57:38,170 --> 01:57:42,350
Godspeak, same spelling, is the newer one.

1809
01:57:42,750 --> 01:57:47,610
Any other links or parting information to give people if they want to dive deeper into what you guys have done?

1810
01:57:48,290 --> 01:57:48,930
Yeah.

1811
01:57:49,190 --> 01:57:55,750
I'm also doing a current project, Current Sonics, running with – you can find it at ocelli.com.

1812
01:57:56,430 --> 01:57:57,970
It's a current project.

1813
01:57:58,830 --> 01:58:04,110
You go to ocelli.com, spells just like it sounds, and it's a subproject.

1814
01:58:04,270 --> 01:58:05,650
It's a subscription only.

1815
01:58:06,350 --> 01:58:12,330
It's not open to the public, and it's called Rated Y, The Unculting of Humanity.

1816
01:58:12,890 --> 01:58:13,250
Huh.

1817
01:58:13,350 --> 01:58:14,550
I like it.

1818
01:58:15,050 --> 01:58:15,830
Right on.

1819
01:58:15,830 --> 01:58:18,470
Well, again, thank you so much.

1820
01:58:18,630 --> 01:58:21,310
You know a lot about a lot, and thanks for doing this.

1821
01:58:21,430 --> 01:58:22,710
Take care out there, both of you.

1822
01:58:23,510 --> 01:58:23,950
Thanks.

1823
01:58:24,510 --> 01:58:25,050
Thank you.

1824
01:58:27,310 --> 01:58:32,630
Secret Sciences, Cosmic Censorship, Supernatural Beings, and the Biological Vacuum.

1825
01:58:32,850 --> 01:58:33,370
Oh, my.

1826
01:58:34,890 --> 01:58:39,550
Definitely had to be unexpected guests, which I always like to surprise people with.

1827
01:58:39,970 --> 01:58:41,010
I like their pseudonyms.

1828
01:58:41,590 --> 01:58:43,870
I like the cadence with which they speak.

1829
01:58:44,430 --> 01:58:52,350
I'd say they make a great team, and they pride themselves on trying to talk about raw truth in a whole host of areas at a high level.

1830
01:58:52,830 --> 01:58:55,830
I think that's something we got a lot of respect for around here, right?

1831
01:58:56,470 --> 01:59:01,490
Of the subjects they cover, we could have done more on law, government, or military,

1832
01:59:02,270 --> 01:59:10,690
but it's the secret sciences and hidden physics stuff that I like a lot because thinking about common things in new ways is exciting,

1833
01:59:10,690 --> 01:59:19,190
and you really can let your imagination run wild in terms of the reality we could be living in if the blockage could be lifted.

1834
01:59:20,310 --> 01:59:27,230
I like hearing new names of bright minds we can put up alongside Victor Schauberger, Wilhelm Reich, and some of the others.

1835
01:59:28,030 --> 01:59:34,870
Today, that was Louis Keveron and Rudolf Hoschka, I think is how he pronounced it.

1836
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:44,370
But Rudolf Hoschka's work is interesting because he was studying how vitamins work and exposing simple life forms to various things,

1837
01:59:44,450 --> 01:59:49,470
and ultimately found that just proximity was enough to cause an effect or reaction,

1838
01:59:49,830 --> 01:59:53,310
which might say something about that health and resonance idea.

1839
01:59:54,230 --> 01:59:59,070
I also like alchemy talk when we can get it, and funny enough, I got off this call,

1840
01:59:59,070 --> 02:00:07,110
and I saw a post about this guy, Stefanovich Rabenikoff, by someone who was highlighting it because it was this guy's birthday.

1841
02:00:08,030 --> 02:00:09,990
He's dead now, but in honor, you know?

1842
02:00:10,890 --> 02:00:18,710
And Rabenikoff was like Schauberger in that he just studied nature and tried to replicate it or create technology based on it.

1843
02:00:19,270 --> 02:00:25,110
The gist of his story is that he was laying in a field admiring the beauty of nature, and he started to feel ill.

1844
02:00:25,690 --> 02:00:32,310
And then he realized he was resting over the top of a hive of a type of bee that makes their hives in the ground.

1845
02:00:33,170 --> 02:00:38,550
I can't remember if he dug up the hive or just looked at it and made a structure that mimicked it,

1846
02:00:38,690 --> 02:00:45,570
but in the lab, he would notice the same thing if he waved his hand over this artificial hive.

1847
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:51,770
He had some other people do it, and some said waving their hand over it felt warm, some said cold,

1848
02:00:51,770 --> 02:00:54,950
but clearly there was some kind of field effect going on.

1849
02:00:55,290 --> 02:00:58,710
He ended up calling it the cavity structure effect.

1850
02:00:59,090 --> 02:01:06,570
He also did see some magnetic effects and then ended up building these lattice structures into a box, kind of like a suitcase.

1851
02:01:07,530 --> 02:01:11,570
And he ended up realizing that you could not set things on this box.

1852
02:01:11,670 --> 02:01:19,110
It repelled them, basically shot them up into the air, just like if you had a briefcase with negatively charged magnetic plates

1853
02:01:19,110 --> 02:01:22,110
and then tried to slide another one on top of it.

1854
02:01:22,150 --> 02:01:25,470
It would repel it up into the air and down onto the floor.

1855
02:01:26,150 --> 02:01:29,430
And this is crazy because there is plenty of video footage of it.

1856
02:01:29,550 --> 02:01:31,270
That's what I found so damn interesting.

1857
02:01:32,130 --> 02:01:34,930
Then he made a type of platform with a handle.

1858
02:01:35,070 --> 02:01:42,010
You could actually ride a little hoverboard thing using the same basic lattice structure that he mimicked from the beehive.

1859
02:01:42,870 --> 02:01:47,710
Then this video, which was from the Universe Inside You channel, great channel,

1860
02:01:48,370 --> 02:01:54,350
made some points about scientists saying that the flying physics of several types of beetles don't add up,

1861
02:01:54,530 --> 02:01:59,910
and the conventional speculation is that they are hovering rather than flying somehow.

1862
02:02:01,070 --> 02:02:06,310
And of course, if you look at the cross section of their wings, they share a similar pattern to the hive.

1863
02:02:07,070 --> 02:02:11,770
And then you think about the ancient world and the Egyptian motifs of the scarab beetle,

1864
02:02:12,430 --> 02:02:19,050
and you wonder if maybe they respected the beetles so much because that's how they learned this secret of nature.

1865
02:02:20,670 --> 02:02:25,730
Really wild stuff. Check out Universe Within You on YouTube and you can see the whole video.

1866
02:02:26,750 --> 02:02:30,450
But these are the kind of guys I find most interesting.

1867
02:02:30,690 --> 02:02:34,190
Probably the most interesting kind of person ever.

1868
02:02:35,150 --> 02:02:39,310
And so few in the mainstream ever hear about them or their discoveries.

1869
02:02:40,230 --> 02:02:45,070
So, fun episode overall. I appreciate their time and the work they do.

1870
02:02:45,230 --> 02:02:50,150
Check out Greek Speak or God Speak if you want to hear them go deeper without me getting in the way.

1871
02:02:50,710 --> 02:02:55,670
As always, the first hour of the show is good, but the second hour is even better.

1872
02:02:56,490 --> 02:03:00,910
In this one we talked about lost technology and the importance of procedure,

1873
02:03:01,790 --> 02:03:05,550
lawful timekeeping and the effects of the Pope's work schedule,

1874
02:03:05,910 --> 02:03:12,030
the deeper effects of rulership by artificial time, the importance and effects of seasonal diets.

1875
02:03:12,610 --> 02:03:18,370
The Greek gave us his Discernment Guide to Life and talked about the 180 inversion principle.

1876
02:03:19,370 --> 02:03:25,210
We got into aliens and the dog-headed people, Project Looking Glass, ancient relics and E.T. gifts,

1877
02:03:25,550 --> 02:03:28,830
what it means to say that we're now in the credits of the movie.

1878
02:03:29,850 --> 02:03:36,370
The Greek talked to us about the dog-bowl humiliation ritual that all politicians must partake in.

1879
02:03:36,830 --> 02:03:40,250
And we talked about the difference between the fringe and the alternative.

1880
02:03:41,570 --> 02:03:46,430
So, go ahead, upgrade to plus, get the full show and keep the Carl Wood train on the tracks.

1881
02:03:46,630 --> 02:03:51,030
Eight bucks a month, five new shows a month and one hell of a big archive.

1882
02:03:52,210 --> 02:03:55,210
And higher side news, well, when it rains, it pours.

1883
02:03:55,210 --> 02:04:01,270
If my life wasn't hectic enough right now, one of the two main systems we use to run the Plus membership infrastructure

1884
02:04:01,930 --> 02:04:06,610
had an update that broke compatibility with the other system.

1885
02:04:07,070 --> 02:04:13,490
They've already released a bug fix, but anyone who had a transaction process in that 48-hour period

1886
02:04:13,490 --> 02:04:16,470
shows up as inactive in the system.

1887
02:04:17,430 --> 02:04:22,770
Obviously, support tickets have flooded in and my guy Mike is not only working to answer all those,

1888
02:04:22,770 --> 02:04:25,970
but also wrote a script to correct the rest of the accounts.

1889
02:04:26,890 --> 02:04:31,670
Most likely before many of you noticed, I think it's like 5% of people were affected,

1890
02:04:32,410 --> 02:04:33,830
locked out for a day or two.

1891
02:04:34,310 --> 02:04:39,090
But it should be all fixed now or it will be fixed very, very soon.

1892
02:04:40,370 --> 02:04:46,090
These things happen from time to time, but we use good systems and I hope nobody was greatly inconvenienced.

1893
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:51,850
But that said, I think we are going to get all five shows out this month, this one being number four.

1894
02:04:52,490 --> 02:04:56,190
I got two more recorded from a hotel room over the last few days,

1895
02:04:56,250 --> 02:05:00,570
so I should have at least a one-show buffer while I try to get the rest of my life in order

1896
02:05:01,290 --> 02:05:03,070
and get everything set up at home.

1897
02:05:04,090 --> 02:05:06,010
And with that, let's go to the Meetup calendar.

1898
02:05:07,510 --> 02:05:14,930
April 29th, today, we have the Sin City Conspiracy Enthusiasts hanging out in Las Vegas, Nevada.

1899
02:05:14,930 --> 02:05:18,450
Tomorrow, April 30th, Asheville, North Carolina.

1900
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:20,590
May 6th, Dublin, Ireland.

1901
02:05:21,390 --> 02:05:24,010
Also May 6th, Sedona, Arizona.

1902
02:05:25,090 --> 02:05:29,990
Also May 6th, High Springs, Florida at the High Springs Brewing Company.

1903
02:05:30,610 --> 02:05:36,950
And May 13th at the 7018 Brewery in Elko, Nevada.

1904
02:05:37,690 --> 02:05:38,710
And we'll leave it there.

1905
02:05:39,410 --> 02:05:43,010
I like it. Sounds like people are getting together as we speak.

1906
02:05:43,010 --> 02:05:48,170
Go on in at highersidemeetups.com and find the other THC fans near you,

1907
02:05:48,710 --> 02:05:51,870
because it is your inoculation from indoctrination.

1908
02:05:52,030 --> 02:05:53,910
Networks are important and all that.

1909
02:05:54,550 --> 02:05:55,670
You already know.

1910
02:05:55,810 --> 02:05:57,230
But that is all she wrote, guys.

1911
02:05:57,370 --> 02:06:00,550
Thanks again to the Archon and the Greek, and to you for listening.

1912
02:06:01,330 --> 02:06:02,430
I've done my part.

1913
02:06:03,010 --> 02:06:08,990
Your move, secret science secret keepers, cosmic censorship servants, and consensus-centric thinkers.

1914
02:06:08,990 --> 02:06:12,570
Your fucking move.

1915
02:06:39,070 --> 02:06:42,110
How fun I find.

1916
02:06:42,430 --> 02:06:45,090
And I don't fix it all wrong.

1917
02:06:46,950 --> 02:06:50,130
And I don't have to face it.

1918
02:06:50,290 --> 02:06:51,390
That's right.

1919
02:06:52,110 --> 02:06:54,310
And you're wrong.

1920
02:06:56,050 --> 02:06:56,850
Wrong.

1921
02:07:03,190 --> 02:07:07,050
I'm an addiction to the digital technology.

1922
02:07:07,970 --> 02:07:12,010
And every now and then I try to quit and leave it be.

1923
02:07:12,010 --> 02:07:15,210
But it's too hard to turn it off.

1924
02:07:15,290 --> 02:07:19,310
It's getting worse and yet it's learning.

1925
02:07:20,190 --> 02:07:21,790
It's learning.

1926
02:07:22,210 --> 02:07:28,010
I see discipline is no fun.

1927
02:07:28,770 --> 02:07:33,530
I find denial makes it all wrong.

1928
02:07:36,450 --> 02:07:38,270
Face it.

1929
02:07:38,390 --> 02:07:39,050
That's right.

1930
02:07:58,990 --> 02:08:02,830
Don't tell me why.

1931
02:08:04,070 --> 02:08:07,210
Discipline is no fun.

1932
02:08:07,230 --> 02:08:15,370
I find denial makes it all wrong.

1933
02:08:15,370 --> 02:08:16,710
Face it.

1934
02:08:16,810 --> 02:08:17,930
That's right.

1935
02:08:19,870 --> 02:08:23,970
So many arms expanding off the big conspiracy.

1936
02:08:24,730 --> 02:08:29,230
And every one of them has got a couple hooks into me.

1937
02:08:29,230 --> 02:08:34,030
I try to forget and I ignore but I'm just out of luck.

1938
02:08:34,970 --> 02:08:37,490
But I don't have to tell you that.
