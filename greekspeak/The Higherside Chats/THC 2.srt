1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,820
The planet's puppet masters almost surely have a plan.

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,040
There's clearly maybe something there beyond the realm of man.

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,400
And until you've thoroughly tested every last course just in view,

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,860
I'd find the more you think you know, the less you really do.

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,560
That's true, Dr. Seuss.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,440
Very well.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,260
Where would we be without THC?

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,640
Cause we know they're lying to us, just don't know to what degree.

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,060
Yeah, where would we be without THC?

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,780
The highest side chat show, Greg Carlwood Company.

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,740
So say we all.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,040
From the Sunshine State, I'm Greg Carlwood,

13
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,560
and there is very little that has shaped the human story

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,980
more than the propagation of the three Abrahamic religions.

15
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,940
Wars, inquisitions, infidels, tyrannical rule, cultural divides,

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,260
oppressive teachings on how to live, disdain for the other,

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,160
and yes, mass mind control.

18
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:07,640
And yet the atheistic era has taken us down a path of hopelessness,

19
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,760
anxiety, and misplaced worship of science to fill the hole.

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,780
And between the extremes and the manipulated mental cul-de-sacs

21
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,300
is room for a more accurate model of some sort of relationship

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,560
between gods and man, as well as an acknowledgement of

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,640
spiritual forces and dimensions that do have a role to play

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,620
in this weird reality.

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,080
But the planetary puppet masters of the Capstone Cabal

26
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,160
have made sure that we never really have the proper context

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,140
for any of this, and thus many people are left grabbing

28
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,940
for parts of the elephant in the great cosmic darkness.

29
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,740
Well, here to set the record straight and undo the damage done

30
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,660
is returning guests the Archon and the Greek,

31
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,680
the anonymous one-two punch of propaganda-busting insight

32
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,340
and the bright minds behind both Greekspeak.com and Godspeak.com,

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,680
which both contain a series of interesting sonic events

34
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,720
that give one more than enough to think about.

35
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,580
In their last visit to THC, we focused mainly on the content

36
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,700
in their Greekspeak series, but today they're coming back around

37
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,580
to dive deep into the spiritual insights and godly knowledge

38
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,680
contained in their Godspeak series.

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,140
And I'm here for it.

40
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,500
The spiritual knowledge seeders, religious propaganda parsers,

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,740
and true relationship between gods and men revealers,

42
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,740
the Archon and the Greek, the Greek and the Archon.

43
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,900
Welcome back, fellas.

44
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:23,760
Thank you.

45
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:24,560
Greetings.

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,940
Yes, I am psyched to do this.

47
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,520
You make a great team.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,200
Last time was a lot of fun.

49
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,680
We talked about cosmic censorship, lawful timekeeping,

50
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,880
the Pope's work schedule, the biological vacuum,

51
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,200
proper discernment, power, and just a ton of interesting topics.

52
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,760
And today we're going a lot more spiritual,

53
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,300
but there is a ton of great stuff in the Godspeak series,

54
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,580
so I expect this one to be just as insightful.

55
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,840
But how are you guys doing?

56
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,700
How are you feeling about the state of the world?

57
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,000
It's only been three months since we last talked,

58
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,460
but it seems like the credits of the movie are still running,

59
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,620
as the Greek might say.

60
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,520
Okay, the state of the world or the world state, right?

61
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,280
It sounds like a play on words, but I would just say,

62
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,060
how do I feel about the world state as such?

63
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,480
And you could take that politically governmental as deep state

64
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,220
or underlying powers.

65
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,460
Same old shit, man.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,260
It's not going to change until it changes,

67
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,060
until it comes crashing down, and that's just how it goes.

68
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,820
And it will crash down, it will implode,

69
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,680
both from internal and external, mostly external influences,

70
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,960
and that's how I would sum up that question,

71
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,460
without getting too verbose.

72
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,200
Archon, how do you feel about things?

73
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,500
Well, I feel much like the Greek,

74
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,020
that we're in a sort of set trajectory towards a certain destination

75
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,740
with human society, which, at least in the short term,

76
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,940
is not going to be very pleasant.

77
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,100
I don't think that people are successively making more sense of the world,

78
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,340
I think they're making less sense.

79
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,200
And so, inevitably, that has to come to a boiling point

80
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,300
where things sort of tip over,

81
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,180
and presumably that won't be too far in the future.

82
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,700
Yeah, it's scary, because you don't want to experience

83
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,500
a true collapse of everything,

84
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,560
but there's a lot of folks out there that feel like

85
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,860
the only way to get the utopia,

86
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,440
or the closer-to-utopia model on the other side,

87
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,020
is for everything to fall apart,

88
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,980
and we just have to cross our fingers

89
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,660
and hope we can survive through that gap, apparently.

90
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,260
It's an intense thing to think about,

91
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,060
but philosophically, so many people think

92
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,660
that we need to go through the darkness

93
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,180
to come back out to the light.

94
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,100
Yeah, Greg, just before we really get into the meat of things,

95
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,840
I don't endorse this person I'm going to mention.

96
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,360
He has been a guest, but he is a worthy mention

97
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,240
to look at his work, Jason Brashears of Archaics.

98
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,980
I've been talking a lot about eschatology,

99
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,840
and he's come up with some things that could pretty much combine

100
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,260
with what I've been saying through Greek-speak and God-speak.

101
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,500
And again, I don't endorse him directly.

102
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,040
You have to always listen to everything with discernment,

103
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,020
but it's some of the best stuff that I've heard out there

104
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,060
regarding chronology.

105
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,020
So I would put that in quotes for chronology,

106
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,020
and I think you've had him as a guest as well.

107
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,000
This is not about self-promotion or anything.

108
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,100
This is really about objectifying and getting stuff out to the listener.

109
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,860
So I just wanted to say that before we start.

110
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,820
Yeah, fair enough, fair enough.

111
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,660
So estimates vary pretty wildly when you look up these kind of things,

112
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,320
but it seems as though 3.5 billion people

113
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,700
follow one of the three major religions,

114
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,740
and there's no doubt they've had a huge impact

115
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,780
on human behavior and human history.

116
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,680
But what would you say about the creation of them

117
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,000
as a way to control people,

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,140
which seems to be the core function that they have?

119
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:51,500
Exactly.

120
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,860
All right, so we're done.

121
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,020
We don't need to do any more.

122
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,480
That's it.

123
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,400
The entire session here, the sonic event, is about that.

124
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,240
And if you just manage what you just said about being a control issue,

125
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,660
we're pretty much done on the talk

126
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,800
because everything else is going to be supporting that.

127
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,720
It's simple, right?

128
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,040
It is, it is.

129
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,220
And to drill down on, say, one thing like the King James Bible,

130
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,000
it's always frustrating when I have a guest who's here

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,460
because they wrote a great book

132
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,900
or they're very clued in on one specific topic,

133
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,200
but peppered throughout the two-hour interview.

134
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,960
They just keep going back to the well of Bible quotes

135
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,980
or talking about Jesus,

136
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,980
and I just roll my eyes

137
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,020
because I don't want to go off track and derail the whole interview

138
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,860
to dissect their religious paradigm.

139
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,000
But you should.

140
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,980
You should dissect it because they call it KJV syndrome.

141
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:44,840
It's contagious.

142
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,040
So you should stop them when they start with that.

143
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,020
Fair enough, fair enough.

144
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,300
Well, what would you say about the King James Bible?

145
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,740
You've said in the God Speak series

146
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,020
it was created to drive a wedge through society

147
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,940
and it was intentionally seated as a false paradigm.

148
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,220
Talk to us about that for people who maybe don't see it that way yet.

149
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,500
Very simple.

150
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,380
The concept of political tools done by administrative bodies

151
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,700
and any heads of state.

152
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,700
King James, was he a king?

153
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,060
Loosely, yes, but he was a regent from Scotland

154
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,780
to fill in a void in the monarchy,

155
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,800
and he knew that the monarchy was deified by the common people.

156
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:31,260
So if he made a cheap, easily accessible, more accessible, non-Latin version

157
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,260
of what's called the scriptures that people revered that god, let's say,

158
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,000
and the stories in there, and gave it to the public,

159
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,320
it would drive a wedge between the people's idea

160
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,300
that the king or queen are gods, or deified,

161
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,920
and show that there's a way to access information on other deities, let's say.

162
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,420
And I'm saying that loosely.

163
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,600
All the way back to the king's right to rule from God and all that,

164
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,300
but the common people just viewed royalty as deities.

165
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,520
So he drove that in there by actually providing a cheap,

166
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,900
secondary, let's say, story, or whatever you might call the KJV.

167
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,080
Fair enough.

168
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,060
And if we're going to fully deconstruct before we reconstruct,

169
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,860
I guess we should back it up to Judaism too,

170
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,980
because that's said to be the original monotheistic paradigm,

171
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,220
the first of the Abrahamic religions,

172
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,800
and obviously half the Bible is just a recycled version of the Hebrew Bible,

173
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,900
but what do you consider some of the deeper insights into its origins

174
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,600
and the uniqueness of its place in the Big Three?

175
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:33,840
Many levels of it.

176
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,700
Before we get into that,

177
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,260
more people might be familiar with the reconstruction of Catholicism

178
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,220
as it goes through time, and there was a big one in the 1960s,

179
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,880
and at the turn of the century,

180
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,220
there's a reconstruction or redoing,

181
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,320
even like with the country we live in.

182
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,960
It used to be a republic, then it became a democracy, right?

183
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,480
And it sounds like it's just words, but it's very radical in terms of change.

184
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,460
Monotheism would be kind of a far stretch.

185
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,300
It's a very simple label to put on it,

186
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,720
but actually if you do read what's called the Old Testament,

187
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,340
the whole thing was about getting the people to get away from worshiping other gods.

188
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,020
So when were they really monotheistic? I don't know.

189
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,000
They were always worshiping, right?

190
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,060
If you go to the stories, you know, the Baal Peor,

191
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,760
you know, the lord of the opening,

192
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,380
and the opening would be the female genitalia they were worshiping.

193
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,680
Then you had the Ashtarte and other Baals,

194
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:33,220
and the whole entire story is about getting them to worship one god,

195
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,920
where apparently they had a hard time doing that.

196
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,200
Yeah, I mean, I remember growing up hearing the Golden Calf story,

197
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,240
and of course one of the commandments is

198
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,260
you should have no other idols before me.

199
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,900
It's like, well, I thought there were no other idols.

200
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,720
What are you talking about?

201
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,680
This should be kind of obvious if it's a situation where there's only one apex god,

202
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,160
as the religion I was brought up in taught.

203
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,700
So yeah, that's a curious thing.

204
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,760
And you mentioned the deity's royalty overlap.

205
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,740
That's another thing.

206
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,940
When we go far down chain in the history,

207
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,500
it seems like there is a big connection between those two things,

208
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,940
and oftentimes that's put in the context of the fallen angel story,

209
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,280
as if there was a time when angelic beings came down here,

210
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,500
mated with humans, and made offspring,

211
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,120
which became the pharaohs and the Sumerian kings.

212
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,840
Is there truth to that story,

213
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,880
or is that just, again, state propaganda of its time?

214
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,040
Okay, let's backtrack.

215
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,440
If we lost connection right now,

216
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,400
if you're on a cell phone, your battery's low,

217
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,540
and you've got to give some information,

218
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,740
just give the important information first, right?

219
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,300
And this is the information.

220
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,820
Let's say we were to end this right now.

221
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,960
I'd say the gods are people.

222
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,100
Are they normal, regular humans, you know, as we are?

223
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,620
Let's say we, you know, the various races,

224
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,600
which, by the way, in terms of race,

225
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,680
I consider man and woman, male and female,

226
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,840
to be the major two races, by the way,

227
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,060
in terms of distinction, not by color or ethnicity and nationality.

228
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,700
So I would say the gods are people,

229
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,380
and they've pretty much put a story on us as such.

230
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,820
Just like you mentioned, you know, they've gotten—

231
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:15,040
they were an advanced society that very simply weave in entertainment.

232
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,080
We call them stars, right?

233
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,000
They're like the gods, like Elvis was the god of rock,

234
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,520
let's say, back in the—right?

235
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,940
We call them stars, right?

236
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,380
So we—okay, the corporate we has a tendency

237
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,240
to create various levels and hierarchies,

238
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,140
and the highest hierarchy for anyone would be a god, wouldn't it?

239
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,500
So if we were to end this right now,

240
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,620
I'd say the gods are people.

241
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,260
They're people, too, but they're just very different.

242
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,840
Let's say the gods that you mentioned from the Sumerian stories or so,

243
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,060
they would be people that lived with a certain genetic proclivity

244
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,980
that grew 9 to 10 feet tall,

245
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,560
which skeletons are being found all over the world,

246
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,120
red hair, blue eyes, right?

247
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,020
Kind of idea.

248
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,920
So is it proper to just say the gods are simply giant humans?

249
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,540
No, but I'm just giving one characteristic.

250
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:03,740
Mm-hmm.

251
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,620
Well, let's go into the characteristics.

252
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,780
If the gods are people,

253
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,120
what else makes up their characteristics

254
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,080
that are different from us?

255
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,260
They're not from here, right?

256
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,670
I mean, they're from another dimension,

257
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,580
a spiritual plane, right?

258
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,920
I recently did on a private thing that I have,

259
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,120
a sign-up only—this might sound like a diversion,

260
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,320
but I want to tie it back.

261
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,780
People say, hey, Greek, I want you to speak to this person.

262
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,520
They're very spiritual.

263
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,720
I mean, spiritual how?

264
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,800
Like what?

265
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,980
You know, like spiritual is supposed to mean good.

266
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,200
I think I might have defined the spirit as being the mind

267
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
and the personality,

268
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,320
and the soul as the metabolism,

269
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,040
and the body as the carne, right?

270
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,620
So if you were to walk into a room with thousands of beds

271
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,560
and people either sleeping or in a coma,

272
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,180
there is nothing spiritual there.

273
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,180
The moment they start exhibiting behavior, speech, thought,

274
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,380
interacting with each other, that is all spiritual.

275
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,660
It's of the mind, you see?

276
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,280
So the word spiritual has been misused in a way,

277
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,740
technically as well.

278
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,740
It uses the Greek prefix, the PSY,

279
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,600
where you get psychology, psychotic, psychiatry.

280
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,820
That is the mind.

281
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,340
It's the spirit is the same.

282
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,620
And they've reversed that.

283
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,620
When you look it up, they tell you the spirit is the soul.

284
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,440
But I just want to go back to,

285
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,120
when you speak of a spiritual discussion,

286
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,640
it is something that is animated by beings who are animating

287
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,320
a certain personality or a thought form.

288
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,780
It's basically rational animation,

289
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,880
which you won't find that much anymore.

290
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,880
But that would be the definition and the crux

291
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,940
of what people think of being spiritual

292
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,640
and how I would define it.

293
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,680
Fair.

294
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:45,160
Well, when we're thinking about our interactions with the gods,

295
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,880
if we're going to say there are many,

296
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,380
like the further you go back,

297
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,900
sometimes people say the more truthful things seem to be.

298
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,220
So if you go back beyond the Abrahamic religions,

299
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,480
it seems like people knew there were gods

300
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,620
for every little thing you might want.

301
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,900
That you could call upon.

302
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,800
Was this superstition or is this closer to the real dynamics

303
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,140
of the way the world works?

304
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,460
Both.

305
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,500
When you say people, again, let's go back earlier.

306
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,660
I said the gods are people.

307
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,740
I would be more concerned of who the gods think the gods are.

308
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,340
I'll say this.

309
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,220
Everybody just cover your ears for a moment.

310
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,000
Most people are too simplistic to contemplate these things.

311
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,780
A good example would be water is H2O, right?

312
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,040
Everybody goes there and they show this molecule.

313
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,940
You know, no one's ever seen that molecule

314
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,380
and it actually doesn't exist.

315
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,760
You don't even need elaborate scientific equipment

316
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,520
to prove water is not H2O.

317
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,640
Just because you put electrical plates in water

318
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,160
and you get hydrogen off of one side and oxygen on the other,

319
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,660
doesn't mean it's H2O.

320
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,420
Because no one's reduced the body of water to hydrogen and oxygen.

321
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,400
The process stops when it gets down to a certain volume.

322
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,900
So it's something that exhibits a trait of that

323
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,800
and everyone takes it on.

324
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,020
I believe and I've seen through history and intuition

325
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,100
that people are too simple to contemplate

326
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,860
something as high order as this.

327
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:05,320
And when I say people, I'm talking about 99.9999999% of society.

328
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,160
Fair. Well, we got to try to help them out.

329
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,740
If we were to try to picture the true dynamics

330
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:19,160
between multiple dimensions or how forces play on the material plane

331
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,220
or the relationship between these people we call gods and humanity,

332
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,240
help flush that out a little bit for us.

333
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,140
Rephrase the question.

334
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,000
How can we get a proper orientation in our minds

335
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,580
of the dynamics between the gods and man?

336
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,560
Okay, simple.

337
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,780
What I've always used as a basis for that

338
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,300
is your law comes from your god,

339
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,420
from listening to the god speak and other things

340
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,300
that you might have recalled that.

341
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,100
And what I mean by your law,

342
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,840
it's not traffic law or taxes or what the legal system says.

343
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,500
Your law is basically your operating system

344
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,880
and the programs that you run.

345
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,060
In other words, what you eat, what you wear,

346
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,000
how you do business, how you raise a family,

347
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,660
how you keep time, all of these things,

348
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,320
it was really the purpose of getting information from the gods,

349
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,020
which also does a twofold thing.

350
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,660
There's a discernment there.

351
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,880
So when someone says I follow a certain god,

352
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,520
I'm like what body of knowledge has that god, let's say,

353
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,540
transmitted to you?

354
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,340
So when you hear of these gods, they're like,

355
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,740
oh, you can do anything you want.

356
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,780
I've dealt that before.

357
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,540
It's like, well, how do I know?

358
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,660
We need guidance.

359
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,180
Again, what to eat, what to wear, how to do business,

360
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,900
how to raise a family, how to keep time,

361
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,640
how to manage our environment.

362
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,220
That is the critical point of, let's say,

363
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,260
the godlike transmittal back to humanity.

364
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,120
Again, if you go back to the entertainment industry,

365
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,780
those that perform the best are considered stars

366
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,240
and even above that, gods, right,

367
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,440
because it's the best performance.

368
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,880
So if you're going to pick a god,

369
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,960
look at what they're transmitting towards, you know,

370
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,460
the society or you in terms of proper behavior

371
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,180
or what I call lawful living.

372
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,599
That would be the main connection.

373
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,640
So it is cognitive.

374
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,700
It is knowledge-based.

375
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,000
And by the way, even if you read the version of the King James,

376
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,819
it does tell you it's about knowledge, right?

377
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:18,359
Well, do you see the gods having an effect

378
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:22,700
on the material plane in terms of things like weather

379
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:28,820
or our luck or our tragedies, famine, abundance, illness?

380
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,080
Are these things coming from a source of the gods,

381
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,880
an unseen source that in modern days

382
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,360
really isn't acknowledged at all?

383
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,320
Yes, I would say so.

384
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,240
From a technological point of view, absolutely.

385
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,500
And when we say technology, it's a matter of, let's just say,

386
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,500
you've probably heard most people are familiar with the term

387
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,600
that if one advanced society, technologically advanced,

388
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,260
meets a more primitive one,

389
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,680
the more primitive one considers the advanced society's technology

390
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,880
to be magic, right?

391
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,100
I can give a short story about a river plane

392
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,460
that flew into the Amazon about 75 years ago

393
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,620
and the explorers disembarked

394
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,620
and they met one of the native river tribes

395
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,940
and he pulls out a Zippo lighter and he lights it

396
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,780
and everyone bows down.

397
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
The translator said, why are you bowing down?

398
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,460
He says, wow, you make fire come out of your hand.

399
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,580
That's amazing, right?

400
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,740
So he says, tell them to show up at the river tomorrow

401
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,580
and we'll show them something else.

402
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,740
At this point, they had trekked into where the inhabitants were living

403
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,140
and what he planned on showing them the next day

404
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,420
is to actually fly the river plane in, right?

405
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,040
So he can impress them.

406
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,200
Well, they do that.

407
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,700
They fly the river plane in

408
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,520
and all of the natives and the chief are standing by the river

409
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,140
and the moment they saw the plane land on the river,

410
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,920
they just shrugged their shoulders and walked away.

411
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,780
And the explorer went to the translator and said, hey, what's wrong?

412
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,240
They bowed down when I lit the Zippo

413
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,640
and they see the plane and they just shrugged their shoulders.

414
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,300
So the translator went and asked the chief.

415
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,100
The chief said to him basically,

416
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,000
well, if anyone can make fire come out of their hands,

417
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,260
of course they can fly.

418
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,980
It's no big deal, right?

419
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,000
So in other words, we consider them to be primitive,

420
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,840
but their form of logic and reasoning is so advanced, right?

421
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,140
You just have to impress them once

422
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,340
and they associate the entire rest of all your behavior as being normal.

423
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,980
Unfortunately, I think the people in this society now

424
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,780
want to be continuously impressed with tricks.

425
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,140
They're not as advanced as this primitive river tribe.

426
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,840
You see, they created a form of logic that created a terminus

427
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,460
that made them go back to their lives.

428
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,540
Where the current society is constantly looking for new razzle-dazzle, right?

429
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,540
That's why you have all these major events that aren't so.

430
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:40,560
You know what I mean?

431
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,180
To keep people on edge.

432
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,900
So I just wanted to give that analogy, food for thought or thought for food.

433
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:46,760
Right.

434
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,640
Well, I mean, now we might have found a really interesting thread

435
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,900
because when I asked about the influence of the gods

436
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,520
in these different categories of life events,

437
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,800
you said from a technological point of view, that could be true.

438
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,800
I mean, are we saying, this might be why you cited archaics

439
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,660
and Jason Breshears.

440
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,200
Are we saying that the gods really are like literally people

441
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,540
that are just a breakaway civilization

442
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,460
that is using technology to affect our lives?

443
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,540
Yes.

444
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,080
I would suggest that the main group that we know about

445
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,440
is here with us in this reality.

446
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,080
There are probably other realities and say probably.

447
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,280
It's super hypothetical.

448
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,500
Just like I always bring up, sometimes people ask,

449
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,040
well, what do you mean?

450
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,160
What kind of technology?

451
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,300
Very simple.

452
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,780
There's a crowd of people and you ask them what they want.

453
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,800
And they all yell out, we want a time machine.

454
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,220
And then you ask them, when do you want it?

455
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,940
And they all yell out, irrelevant.

456
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,500
Does it matter when a time machine is invented?

457
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:48,540
No.

458
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,500
Let's say it's invented a trillion years from now, right?

459
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,740
A billion, trillion, whatever.

460
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,900
Is it possible that someone with that technology

461
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,460
can come back and affect this world line, right?

462
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,640
Doesn't matter when it was invented.

463
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,620
And if they affect it, do they have the ability

464
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,360
to appear and disappear and change events?

465
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,680
And the answer to that is obvious.

466
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,780
That's just one example.

467
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,760
Well, let's assume if they are living in this reality,

468
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,140
where might they be living?

469
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,560
Where might their civilization be?

470
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,740
I'll give a short antidote to this.

471
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,180
I was invited to go to a very special school

472
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,280
about almost 40 years ago now.

473
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,820
It's above Ivy League.

474
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,980
It's in New York City.

475
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,500
And there are 5,000 applicants to only take 100.

476
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,520
And it's tuition free.

477
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,260
I'm not going to mention its name.

478
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,580
Very few people have heard of it.

479
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,560
And they do very esoteric design work.

480
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,980
I decided not to go there.

481
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And someone who did stayed in touch with me.

482
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,260
And I said, so how's it going?

483
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,980
He says, it's really crazy, man.

484
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,680
We're designing airports that hover in the sky.

485
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,600
And I'm like, what?

486
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,140
I've never seen that.

487
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,580
Well, they're really high up.

488
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,080
I'm like, cool.

489
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,200
This is 40 years ago.

490
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,920
So I'll leave it at that.

491
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,740
Use your imagination.

492
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,380
I think I brought up the cosmic universal law of information

493
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,900
is getting a piece of information to you,

494
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,380
however you classify it, is your idea.

495
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,620
The thing is, did you get the idea, the information?

496
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,040
What I mean by that is when science fiction

497
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,620
is shown to you, no matter what label you put on it,

498
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,620
fiction or fact, true or not, did you get the information, right?

499
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,540
Let's take Star Wars, for example.

500
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,720
Are people aware of something known

501
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,400
or someone known as a Darth Vader or a Death Star?

502
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,280
Yes, many people are.

503
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,460
Now, whether you classify that as fact or fiction

504
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,440
is irrelevant in cosmic information knowledge base.

505
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,800
You know about something like that now, don't you?

506
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,420
Even something like Mickey Mouse.

507
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,300
Are you familiar with that?

508
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:50,560
Yes.

509
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,840
Is it fact or fiction?

510
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,680
Is it irrelevant?

511
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,020
Did you get the information?

512
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,680
That's how the information on the universal concept works.

513
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,920
Yeah, I had Diana Walsh Pasulka here

514
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,540
who wrote the book American Cosmic

515
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:07,160
and was kind of trying to drill into the overlap

516
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:12,160
between religion and the sci-fi UFO aliens narrative

517
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,740
and finds that there's actually way more connective tissue

518
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,140
than one would think.

519
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,580
But when I asked her about her conclusions

520
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:22,920
and trying to actually put them in some kind of box,

521
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,320
she basically said, well, when you watch a movie,

522
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,440
the internals of your brain are functioning

523
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,160
as if what you're watching is actually happening

524
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,280
rather than some kind of fiction.

525
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,380
So your brain does not distinguish

526
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,880
between fiction and nonfiction.

527
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,280
So that was her answer to what UFOs are.

528
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,640
It was a little bit strange,

529
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,300
but Jacques Vallée has said that he thinks

530
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,100
that we're looking at a display from something else.

531
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,720
The UFO is not the thing.

532
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,880
The UFO is a projection, a display,

533
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,320
from something else that's more core.

534
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:04,820
And I guess you're kind of wading into that realm too.

535
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:05,900
Yeah.

536
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,260
There's an old saying that if you have a problem,

537
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,780
it's because you're following the rules, right?

538
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,900
For example, just an interjection,

539
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,560
and I work on some strange devices,

540
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,040
and when I'm told and critiqued

541
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,700
that goes against the laws of physics,

542
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,420
I said, well, I never heard of those laws,

543
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,840
so it's outside of my jurisdiction,

544
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,540
so I actually can do it.

545
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,400
You know, like the idea of jurisdiction, right?

546
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,060
So there's all this stuff that we actually put a clamp

547
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,920
and parentheses and mental parentheses

548
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,980
that lock you in to tell you that this is not possible.

549
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,800
Well, just to say that something is not possible

550
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,800
is not possible.

551
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,640
And to say that there are no absolutes,

552
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,740
wait a second, that could be an absolute in itself.

553
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,820
So are these paradoxes?

554
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,060
In a sense, but if you learn to work with them

555
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,460
and juggle these paradoxes

556
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,560
and these little mind clamps, I call them,

557
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,800
what does a clamp do, right?

558
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,380
It holds something together very tightly,

559
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,560
not just holding it together,

560
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,340
but when you say clamping,

561
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,380
that actually puts a lot of pressure,

562
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,280
inward pressure, when you use that term.

563
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,180
So not only do we have boundaries put on us

564
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:10,700
from whatever culture you were raised or education you have,

565
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,420
that boundary is actually more like a clamp.

566
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,160
It squeezes and squeezes and squeezes,

567
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,400
preventing expansion.

568
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,980
So is it wrong to say that atheism is mostly correct

569
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,480
if the thing we interpret as gods

570
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,980
or interpreted as gods at a previous age,

571
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,360
like the Egyptians or the Sumerians or the Greeks,

572
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,740
if they're just people,

573
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,920
is there no real, true spiritual force

574
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,200
in the way most people would think of a spiritual force?

575
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,940
I believe there is one.

576
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,160
I think it's really intangible.

577
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,760
Like for example, let's just use fish as an analogy.

578
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,300
Fish are so used to being in their environment.

579
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,240
You get this really crazy fish once in a while.

580
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,040
He comes around and he says,

581
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,720
hey, you know what?

582
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,680
I think we're all submerged in water.

583
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,680
I think we're all underwater.

584
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,840
He says, what are you talking about?

585
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,100
Describe this water thing.

586
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:02,840
Well, it's wet.

587
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,560
What do you mean it's wet?

588
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,060
I don't know.

589
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:05,940
What are you talking about?

590
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:06,840
But you know what?

591
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,500
What might be interesting

592
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,120
is the last thing a fish realizes right before he dies

593
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,740
is that he's in water.

594
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,800
And I'm using that analogy, you see,

595
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:20,520
about the idea of the spiritual nature

596
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,400
of how it relates to the environment

597
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,340
that we're in right now.

598
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,840
Atheism, by the way, is extremely oversimplified.

599
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,080
Gustave Le Bon wrote a book called The Crowd,

600
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,480
and the crux of that book is

601
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,980
when you have an idea and you want to,

602
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,940
let's say, transmit it to a large group of people,

603
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,720
you have to really simplify that idea, right,

604
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,580
when you're speaking to a large mass.

605
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,040
But what typically happens

606
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,940
is that idea becomes so oversimplified

607
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,260
that it no longer resembles its original concept.

608
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,980
That's why, like with 9-11, they say,

609
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,560
well, okay, the official story is

610
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,900
19 Arab hijackers with box cutters

611
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,420
vaporized the World Trade Center.

612
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,160
Oh, how could they vaporize the World Trade Center?

613
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,720
That's not what it says.

614
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,020
Well, tell me the official story.

615
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,360
That makes even more sense.

616
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:02,940
You know, it doesn't.

617
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,740
So anything you hear put out to the public

618
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,180
is so oversimplified that it no longer

619
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,580
resembles any initial concept.

620
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:10,820
Right on.

621
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,940
So if we're going to talk more about these gods

622
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,200
and who or what they are,

623
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,900
how did they get into their position?

624
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,400
Because you're kind of saying that

625
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,160
the right paradigm is to think of the gods

626
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,880
as essentially like the same paradigm as a cargo cult

627
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,440
and this kind of Wizard of Oz motif

628
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,680
that there's this razzle-dazzle display,

629
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,420
but there's really just a guy back there.

630
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,500
And if that's true,

631
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,820
how did they get to this exalted level

632
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,460
in the human story?

633
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,880
If we take it back to a time like the Sumerians

634
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,680
who thought they were gods,

635
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,420
how did they get to this exalted state

636
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,220
to even play the role of gods?

637
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,760
Again, I can oversimplify it.

638
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,320
You could see a rapper that's got 15 Lamborghinis

639
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,320
and a hundred million in cash behind him

640
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,600
in a video and someone in the ghetto watching that.

641
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,640
You get my point?

642
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,340
I don't like the contrast.

643
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,300
It's just contrast.

644
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I think that we are at a point now

645
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,480
where many millennia,

646
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,580
many at least 5,000 or 6,000,

647
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,320
that we have been subject to genetic manipulation

648
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,300
by these other societies,

649
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,760
that that genetic manipulation

650
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,260
also affected our minds.

651
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,540
Were we a lower species?

652
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,580
To some idea.

653
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,960
You have all this stuff about human rights

654
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,000
and how everyone is equal,

655
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,420
but you know how it goes.

656
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,040
Some people are more equal than others.

657
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,760
There are still pygmy people in Asia

658
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,600
and the continent of Africa.

659
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,800
We're talking about people

660
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,820
that are four foot zero and shorter.

661
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,900
If you bring them into this society,

662
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,920
they'll be very hard for them to integrate totally.

663
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,560
There'll always be a group around them shielding them.

664
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,940
Many people would also realize,

665
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,500
not just because of their size,

666
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,980
but because of internal functioning to a degree,

667
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,300
their thinking is very different as well.

668
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,380
This is how I would put early man just a few millennia ago,

669
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,300
and we are all products of this genetic manipulation,

670
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,420
which is very easy to do.

671
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,060
By the way, when I say genetic manipulation,

672
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,480
you don't have to be too esoteric about it.

673
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,500
Just break out some films from the 1930s,

674
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,000
black and white films of just people,

675
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,220
actors or not,

676
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,240
and start watching stuff from the 20s and 30s

677
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,100
and look at the people's noses,

678
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,180
the shape of their faces,

679
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,520
the size of their ears,

680
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,480
the way they walk,

681
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,620
the way they behaved,

682
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,640
and look at now a film of current people.

683
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,600
There's actually physical distinctions that are different.

684
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,520
Just the influx of chemical influences,

685
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,280
you'll notice, okay, what does he mean by that?

686
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,640
The ears are much smaller.

687
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,540
The ear in Asian medicine represents the constitution of someone,

688
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,480
so someone with bigger ears has a stronger constitution.

689
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,240
They can tolerate more adversity, physical adversity.

690
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,840
Now, if you look at everyone's ears,

691
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,020
they're really, really small,

692
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,720
because the ear represents the entire body, for example.

693
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,400
This is just a very small,

694
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,040
let's say, from a macrobiotic perspective.

695
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,220
These are all fine details,

696
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,480
but what is not about fine details, right?

697
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,780
We want good audio quality when we record this, right?

698
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,900
It doesn't matter, does it?

699
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,660
Of course it matters.

700
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,800
Every fine detail adds up, and it's cumulative.

701
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,300
So the cumulative addition of a group of people

702
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,260
living on the surface,

703
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,560
met by another technologically and also physically impressive,

704
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,300
would categorize them so differently

705
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,180
that it would be very easy to call them gods.

706
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,340
And by the way, the term gods or dogs or whatever backwards

707
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,000
is something that we use in English.

708
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,700
If you actually look at the ancient texts,

709
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,340
they were not actually directly called gods.

710
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,460
They were called by their race,

711
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,320
like in the Hebrew would be the Elohim, right?

712
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,180
In the Greek, the Thei, right?

713
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,380
Or the Anu, or the Apkallu, which were the hybrids.

714
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:40,000
That word god doesn't really directly translate.

715
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,460
The word god comes from an Old Teutonic word

716
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,960
meaning the sun, which is where the word good comes from.

717
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,720
Gut, you know, gut and god.

718
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,580
So it's an Old Teutonic word

719
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,480
that was just chosen to represent such a thing.

720
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:59,780
So for the so-called gods, for these beings in this class,

721
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,200
to be able to pull this trick off,

722
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,540
they had to have technology that was advanced for its day.

723
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,640
And so might we take this back to Atlantis?

724
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,540
Were they Atlanteans or something else?

725
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,500
Before Atlantis, I believe, yeah.

726
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,700
I've also at some point espoused, you know,

727
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,020
the stuff you normally hear

728
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,560
about the very, very old Atlantis,

729
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,780
which is actually can be shown

730
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,440
to be more of the Sea Peoples now.

731
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,440
I believe that technology is not something

732
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,660
that has ever developed.

733
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,920
It's just rediscovered.

734
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,220
Everything has always existed.

735
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,020
It's just its acknowledgement

736
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,540
is what we consider discovery or invention.

737
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,540
You see what I mean?

738
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:44,820
Yeah, and we could use the example of the weather.

739
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,880
In the Sumerians' day,

740
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,500
they might try to appease certain gods

741
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,380
to get advantageous weather

742
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,220
or to avoid storms that obviously relates

743
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,640
to their food production.

744
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,560
But today we know the elite have the ability

745
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,020
to steer storms and create storms

746
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,340
and do that kind of thing.

747
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,780
So it seems like they're tiptoeing

748
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:11,180
into the realm of the gods or the technology of the gods.

749
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,220
But how does that work in an ancient sense

750
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,840
of appeasing the gods?

751
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,320
Like if the gods are just people

752
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,740
with an advanced technology,

753
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,920
how do you make your case?

754
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,300
I mean, typically that's done through prayer or effigies.

755
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,820
But would the gods be aware of this even?

756
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:30,480
Sure they would.

757
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,200
It's called monitoring.

758
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,420
For example, right now,

759
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,040
if you have devices like stupid rectangles

760
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,960
around where you live

761
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,120
and you start having talk about getting a new couch,

762
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,400
I bet you very high percentage rate of success.

763
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,960
You'll go to your stupid rectangle

764
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,460
and there'll be an ad for your couch.

765
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,620
Is that just pure randomness

766
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,480
or are you being listened to?

767
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,340
Right.

768
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,500
And I'm sure you know that.

769
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,840
So this is interesting.

770
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,720
If I were to set up an altar

771
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:01,100
and pray to my own personal pantheon of gods,

772
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:01,560
I suppose,

773
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:06,480
that might be pegged to something like fertility,

774
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,960
basically the reason I might get a result,

775
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,500
you're saying,

776
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,280
is because they just have intense monitoring

777
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,540
throughout this reality

778
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,920
and they can acknowledge,

779
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,520
oh, that guy is doing his little primitive ritual

780
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,700
to try to appease me

781
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,080
and I can grant him his wish or not.

782
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,520
Great, Greg.

783
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,840
I could say right now

784
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,520
you're one of the people that actually got it.

785
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:30,840
Yep.

786
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,420
It's so simple.

787
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,380
And we went back to the elite with the weather.

788
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,360
Thank you very much.

789
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,100
I do weather control all the time

790
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,760
and I actually have a media portfolio.

791
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,120
You can go to rents.com.

792
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,260
Just do a search on the rains come to earth

793
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,180
and one of the reporters there said,

794
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,500
I heard you do weather work.

795
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,080
It's Tuesday.

796
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,460
Can you make it rain in LA on Thursday?

797
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,860
It's the middle of the dry season.

798
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,000
And I said, sure.

799
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,020
How much do you want?

800
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,720
There's no rain at all in the forecast.

801
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,280
I said, okay, we'll drop an inch or so.

802
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,080
Well, Thursday comes and he says,

803
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,060
and the rains come to earth

804
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,500
is the name of the second article.

805
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,720
He says, well, I called this guy

806
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,380
and he says he could do raining.

807
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,179
Obviously he did.

808
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:08,360
Look, it's raining like crazy

809
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,239
and I've done demonstrations over and over and over

810
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,940
in the beginning when I was working on this.

811
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,120
I had about a hundred mile radius.

812
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,400
Now I have about a two or 3000 mile radius of effect

813
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,360
and I've done hurricane abatement,

814
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,400
made hurricanes disappear,

815
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,139
super typhoon Lekima in Japan.

816
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,080
There was two of them.

817
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,699
If you go to Dutch sense,

818
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,620
he does a lot of weird anomalous stuff

819
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,000
and he says he has a video,

820
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,659
super typhoon Lekima.

821
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,179
And he says, look,

822
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:39,320
last night there were two hurricanes approaching Japan

823
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,440
and something very strange.

824
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,000
They're both disappeared by this morning.

825
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,940
So what I'm just saying, this is so simple

826
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,960
and I'm being modest about this.

827
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,199
It's not a big deal in terms of weather design.

828
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:53,500
I also work on technology where I have a pipe

829
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,280
and you run basically a section of pipe,

830
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,760
especially designed just to pipe.

831
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,880
You could see right through it before it's finished.

832
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,820
You run dirty water on one side

833
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,340
and clean water comes out on the other.

834
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,460
What the hell is that work?

835
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,740
I mean, that's magic, isn't it?

836
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,240
So I'm working on these things

837
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,700
and very successfully at the moment

838
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,420
and I'm just not doing websites.

839
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,640
I'm not bragging about it.

840
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,540
I'm trying to be humble

841
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,140
and I keep it to myself

842
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,940
and I share it with others who need it.

843
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,640
And I'm not a God,

844
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,380
but the gods are on an order of thousands

845
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,680
or millions of times higher

846
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,000
than what I'm saying, let's say.

847
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:26,880
Like, for example,

848
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,400
we might have someone in society

849
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,420
that's got a nice piece,

850
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,040
like the British say, a nice piece of kit,

851
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,380
nice piece of high tech something, right?

852
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,820
I assure you there's some military group

853
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,800
or black ops group

854
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,520
that's got something way beyond that.

855
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,580
For example,

856
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,900
the stupid rectangles we use right now.

857
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,920
What's a stupid rectangle anyway?

858
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,500
Those devices, all that stuff,

859
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,520
that's 40, 50 year old technology.

860
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,740
It was a little bulkier also.

861
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,880
The technology that we have,

862
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:55,020
none of it has really been developed

863
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,360
since the 1890s

864
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,180
and that sounds like a crazy statement, right?

865
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,580
What you call development is miniaturization.

866
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,280
They've been able to miniaturize all this stuff

867
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,300
and I'm not impressed by miniaturization.

868
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,740
I don't think the ladies are impressed

869
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,200
by miniaturization anyway.

870
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:10,960
Anyway.

871
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,040
I like it.

872
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,760
So when I asked where these people

873
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,460
we think our gods might be,

874
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,520
you mentioned that you were read in

875
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,960
on this situation

876
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,840
where they're building airports in the sky

877
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,720
and there's a possibility they're in the sky.

878
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,980
I've read Passport to Magonia,

879
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,720
which talks about the Magonians in the sky.

880
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,920
People seeing skyships up there of some kind

881
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,900
at certain periods of history.

882
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,080
Well, another far out idea I have liked

883
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,780
is when it's been suggested that Freemasons,

884
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,960
they're all about angles and certain numbers

885
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,400
and when you look at the Freemasonic artwork,

886
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,380
the symbols,

887
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,840
there'll be like a ladder to the sky

888
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,220
with the sun on one side,

889
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,440
the moon on the other side

890
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,760
and a window in the sky that this ladder reaches.

891
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:07,340
Almost suggesting rips in reality

892
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,980
that there could be places

893
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,740
that you can't actually access

894
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,760
dimensional rips or something.

895
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,160
A guy named Jacob dealt with one, right?

896
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:18,960
Yeah, yeah.

897
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,040
Is this where they might be located?

898
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,500
Yes, and above and below.

899
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,040
Also underground.

900
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,800
There's a lot of stuff.

901
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,140
If someone could look up

902
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,200
whether you believe it or not,

903
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,260
take in the information,

904
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,780
Busaj Mountains in Romania,

905
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,760
they found underground alien bases supposedly

906
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,060
and they connect to Egypt, Iraq

907
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,380
and other places in the world.

908
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,100
When you say underground,

909
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,220
it's like, oh, this dingy whatever, right?

910
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,920
No, I would suggest

911
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,380
if you've ever seen pictures of the Mall of America

912
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,180
or an elaborate shopping mall,

913
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,940
what that looks like,

914
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,040
look at the robust structure of a shopping mall

915
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,820
like the ones in Dubai, let's say,

916
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,100
if you want to get really elaborate.

917
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,920
Why couldn't that be built a mile down?

918
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,680
It very well could be.

919
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,220
I mean, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,

920
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,940
he and just one of his interviews

921
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,760
going on his speaking tour

922
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,720
for his presidential bid,

923
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:14,160
he casually dropped that when he was a kid,

924
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,660
he was taken to one of these places

925
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,560
because he's in one of the privileged families

926
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,640
and he was really impressed

927
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,720
that this underground bunker

928
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,580
was actually more like an underground city

929
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,580
that had its own McDonald's

930
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,420
and all the things of the surface world

931
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,820
and his mind was blown.

932
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,180
But now he just drops that

933
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,720
as if everybody knows it

934
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,740
and it was like, wait a second.

935
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,580
Oh, no, he was in hell if there was a McDonald's.

936
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,260
No, I'm just joking.

937
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,600
Okay, that was more of a Dante-ism.

938
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,940
Yeah, here's one thing that I don't know for sure

939
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,920
but I could suppose

940
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,760
and it would be very strongly accurate

941
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,140
that once you build something underground

942
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,520
that goes above 300 meters or 900 feet,

943
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,720
guess what happens?

944
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,320
It starts to develop its own weather system.

945
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:58,680
So all you have to do

946
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,140
is paint the ceiling blue, right?

947
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,560
And you actually have

948
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,380
a small weather system accruing.

949
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,880
So if you're born in a situation like that,

950
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,520
well, you wouldn't know the difference, right?

951
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,860
You'd brought someone up from there

952
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,040
and you described weather on the surface

953
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,800
and they'd say, yeah,

954
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,180
we have weather there as well.

955
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,600
By the way, I want to suggest something.

956
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,960
Whether you believe it in the planets or not

957
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,680
or the shape of the earth or not,

958
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,780
I think I might have mentioned this.

959
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,400
When you look at the planets

960
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,780
and they're barren on the surface

961
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,940
and let's say in the solar system

962
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,060
or computer graphics that they show us,

963
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,780
that is a mark that 90% inhabited

964
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,860
by super advanced civilization.

965
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,200
And the analogy I give is this.

966
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,880
Greg, I just built a new house

967
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,540
and for the new house,

968
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,200
I'm going to have new furniture delivered.

969
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,300
Oh, Greg, here comes the furniture truck.

970
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,140
Guess what?

971
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,220
I'm going to have all the furniture on the roof

972
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,760
because I'm going to live on the roof, right?

973
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,080
No way.

974
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,200
What do you think will happen?

975
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,660
All neighbors say, look at that dumbass

976
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,340
living on the roof subject to weather, sun,

977
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,220
all this other stuff.

978
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,920
Furniture goes inside, dummy.

979
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:01,940
When you have an advanced civilization,

980
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,380
they go inside the planet, inside,

981
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,780
under protection, you see?

982
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,700
So now there's a flyby to the earth.

983
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,900
Let's say you're a round ball globist.

984
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,620
A flyby on the earth and they're like,

985
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,320
no, no, no, no, don't go there, don't go.

986
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,360
These are really dumb people.

987
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:16,740
They're on the surface.

988
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,520
Don't go there, right?

989
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,260
Do you see how simple this is?

990
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,380
Right, yeah.

991
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,300
I've heard this argument made before

992
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,060
and I think it has merit, but it's also like

993
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,320
the joys of being outside would be denied

994
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,800
to an inner earth civilization.

995
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,360
We know vitamin D is very important.

996
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,200
That comes from sunlight.

997
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,280
You mentioned an ecosystem forming below,

998
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,480
but they're not going to get their own sun.

999
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,040
Believe it or not, yes, you can.

1000
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,440
For example, there was a grow room back in the days

1001
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,640
when grow rooms were not, you're a naughty boy

1002
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,580
if you did one, right?

1003
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:49,980
Let's see.

1004
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,620
And they wanted to bring the energy inside of the sun

1005
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,400
without, because one of the things is

1006
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,160
if your electric bill quadruples,

1007
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,820
that's what they look for, right?

1008
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,420
So how do you do it without a massive electric bill?

1009
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,580
I said, great, just put some metal plates on the roof

1010
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:07,100
with a certain wire with metal plates on the ceiling inside

1011
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,320
and the plants will get the energy

1012
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,400
from the sun transmitted.

1013
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,680
And it's true.

1014
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,680
Even though it was almost pitch black,

1015
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,000
the plants were moving in the direction

1016
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,360
of the metal plates.

1017
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,040
So you can actually bring the sun.

1018
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,280
Here's an example.

1019
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,640
We only see a tiny percentage of the visible light

1020
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,960
and energy with our sense perceptions.

1021
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,140
Most of it goes unnoticed by us, 99%.

1022
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,540
Or if you want to be, let's say, more conservative,

1023
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,800
80% of all the energy around us goes unseen

1024
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,840
and unnoticed by us.

1025
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:38,040
So 80% of the sun's energy is unnoticed by us.

1026
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,460
So if you could take that 80% and bring it into an area

1027
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,620
where there is no visible light and have the same effect,

1028
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,020
there's your, you want to talk about vitamin D?

1029
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,980
By the way, this is provable.

1030
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,800
I've done it, so.

1031
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,160
Fair enough.

1032
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,740
So when we look at cultures who have talked

1033
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:58,040
about the Elohim or the Naga or these races

1034
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,920
that they consider to be gods,

1035
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,440
have some of these died out?

1036
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,840
Are they all still active?

1037
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,960
Who is the most active group today

1038
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,880
that we might consider in that godlike status?

1039
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,100
Good point.

1040
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,660
Have you ever heard of the story,

1041
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,600
Elvis is still alive in the tabloids, right?

1042
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,160
Very much.

1043
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,560
Any society has that.

1044
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,800
You'll have a popular figure that suddenly becomes unpopular

1045
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:23,900
because of something they did or said.

1046
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,040
Now guess what they are called?

1047
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,000
They're called a demon.

1048
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,220
Oh, yeah.

1049
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,820
They're bad now, right?

1050
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,840
And then you have popular figures

1051
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,080
that are just tired of the attention and they die,

1052
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,140
but they're not really dead, right?

1053
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,580
So in other words, what I'm trying to say

1054
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:42,320
is the trivial machinations of human society

1055
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,500
are just echoes of what the gods are doing too.

1056
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,600
Hey, have you ever heard of someone on the surface society

1057
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,500
going to prison and being in jail and dying in jail?

1058
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,300
Hey, guess what?

1059
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,480
The gods do the same thing, right?

1060
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,260
Have you ever heard of someone faking their death?

1061
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:56,580
Yes.

1062
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,200
Have you ever heard of a ritual sacrifice,

1063
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,900
Kobe Bryant helicopter?

1064
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,800
Did I just say Kobe Bryant helicopter?

1065
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,180
I'm not supposed to say that, right?

1066
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,620
They do the same stuff.

1067
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,200
He was chopped up in many pieces and put back together,

1068
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,460
but the penis was missing.

1069
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:11,960
So, I mean, come on.

1070
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,080
It's the same story, just on an elevated hierarchy.

1071
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,860
Well, that is interesting to bring up mythology.

1072
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,840
Is there a better context to think about mythology

1073
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,860
rather than fiction or primitive people

1074
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,340
trying to make sense of their world?

1075
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,680
Is that really just the biography of the gods,

1076
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,860
the history of the gods?

1077
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:34,580
Yes.

1078
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,040
But again, the Gustave Le Bon, the crowd,

1079
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:40,160
when you want to transmit a certain information

1080
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,440
to the masses, you have to simplify it.

1081
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,440
But unfortunately, the oversimplification

1082
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,720
changes the story.

1083
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,580
For example, even with academics, I've done this,

1084
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,080
talked about Greek mythology,

1085
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,020
and they'll say this and this and that.

1086
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,180
I said, well, actually, if you actually read the story,

1087
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,460
it was not so.

1088
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,960
Just like in the biblical story,

1089
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,940
the thing I like to bring up,

1090
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,260
I don't know what part of the segment we're in here,

1091
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:05,060
is if you're Christian, they bring up the Christ

1092
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,060
and the image they show is a crucifixion.

1093
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,080
Well, if you've read the story and it's cumulative,

1094
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,520
there is no crucifixion, no matter how many times

1095
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,960
they use that word, right?

1096
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,240
And the same with all of the ancient Greek philosophy.

1097
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,680
Oh, if you see Medusa, you turn to stone.

1098
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:19,660
No.

1099
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,440
If you read the story, it's your heart turns to stone.

1100
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,100
Big difference, right?

1101
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,640
It's like saying, hey, Greg, put the clothes in the dryer

1102
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,940
or put the clothes on the dryer.

1103
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,620
If you put the clothes on the dryer,

1104
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,900
but it sounds the same.

1105
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,120
You can't say that, Greek.

1106
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,080
It's the same thing.

1107
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:38,940
No, it's not.

1108
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:40,440
No, words matter.

1109
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,540
Yeah, you gotta be specific.

1110
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,680
So let me bring the archon in here for a minute.

1111
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,540
You have gone through all this with the Greek before.

1112
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,360
I'm still wrapping my head around things

1113
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,900
in real time as we're going.

1114
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:58,620
But how has the Greeks' work or knowledge in this area

1115
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,480
affected your spiritual beliefs

1116
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,560
or how you configure all this in your head?

1117
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,800
Well, it's been very useful for being able to objectify

1118
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,540
any topic or subject matter pertaining to the supernatural

1119
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:12,280
or the spiritual.

1120
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,600
I, like many people, came up in an environment

1121
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,440
where certain things were foisted upon me

1122
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,440
as far as knowledge and religions

1123
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,060
and thankfully was able to unpack that a little better

1124
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,760
thanks to the conversations having been had with the Greek

1125
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,620
and also the work that we've done on the Godspeak front.

1126
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,480
So yeah, it's been very helpful from that perspective.

1127
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,480
There's still a lot of work to be done

1128
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,700
because I think that ultimately these things can't be

1129
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,400
completely unpacked until they are shown to you

1130
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,660
or given to you, let's say,

1131
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,880
by people that have a higher vantage point.

1132
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,920
There's only so much that you can come to

1133
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,080
by way of your own rationale

1134
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,500
because I think that kind of pertaining

1135
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,660
to what we were saying earlier,

1136
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,440
the influence of the gods has always been present in society

1137
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,860
and it continues to be.

1138
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,620
But what they do is that they block knowledge of themselves

1139
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,180
as has been done through things like mainstream religion

1140
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:04,160
so that their presence is covert rather than overt

1141
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,080
but that doesn't mean that they're not there.

1142
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,720
We can't say that society is secular

1143
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,320
when so many of our institutions and cultural artifacts

1144
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,840
are named after ancient gods like Nike or Mazda or whatnot.

1145
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,700
So, you know, that's fairly obvious

1146
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,620
but the only reason that some people know anything about the gods

1147
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,700
is because the gods wanted it to be known

1148
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,640
or required them to know in the first place.

1149
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,540
So it can be a conundrum to uncover things on your own

1150
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:29,640
that are concrete outside of mainstream religion

1151
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,380
because it's revealed selectively.

1152
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:35,140
So I have to sort of wade through that process

1153
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,980
even though getting access to this information through the Greek

1154
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:39,460
has expedited some of that.

1155
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,260
Fair. It seems like, yeah,

1156
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,920
when you mention terms like supernatural or spiritual or paranormal

1157
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,160
there is none of that.

1158
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:51,280
It's just all essentially technological

1159
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,520
and they just fool us into putting it in these other categories.

1160
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,540
And when you say that it has to be given to you

1161
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:03,220
like using the Wizard of Oz analogy

1162
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:07,260
you can speculate that this thing you're seeing

1163
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:12,100
might be manipulated or more stagecraft than reality

1164
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,280
but you got to pull back that curtain to really verify it.

1165
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:18,860
Is there a way that people out there listening

1166
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,300
that think this makes sense

1167
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,480
is there a way they can pull back the curtain?

1168
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,600
Do they have that ability?

1169
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,660
Is there a place to go or a thing to do

1170
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:29,580
where they can validate these

1171
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:32,080
what to them right now might be speculations?

1172
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:34,620
I think it's a challenge.

1173
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:38,220
Sometimes what stands in the way of people's enlightenment

1174
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,380
is their own hubris and their own folly

1175
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,560
and that's something that's really not addressed or talked about enough.

1176
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,360
As they say, you can lead a horse to water but not make them drink.

1177
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,520
You can show people the answers.

1178
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,560
That doesn't mean that they'll understand anything you're telling them.

1179
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,340
And I think when it comes to the gods

1180
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:55,580
people discount the knowledge base about the gods

1181
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:58,740
because they'd rather believe in themselves as self-determined humans.

1182
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,100
And then even when they do acknowledge the supernatural

1183
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,540
they still make it all about them

1184
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:04,680
and how they can channel esoteric powers

1185
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,460
or talk to demons or superhero movie stuff.

1186
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,820
So I think the Greek has mentioned before

1187
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:14,200
we know as much about the gods as we do about bears, right?

1188
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,900
Sure, we can describe the habits of a bear or the characteristics

1189
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,060
they're all observable so we can confirm their existence

1190
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,340
but that's about it.

1191
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,320
If you want to know what a bear really is

1192
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,420
you actually have to be one

1193
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,640
which is a way of just saying that

1194
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,360
again, these things have to be given to you

1195
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:31,540
in a very tangible way to understand.

1196
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,320
It's not just by virtue of your own cognitive reasoning

1197
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,780
that you're going to come to understand what the gods are about

1198
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,380
hence what you see people doing with secret societies.

1199
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,660
They find a way to immerse themselves in that sphere

1200
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:44,680
whether it's through evil doings

1201
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,820
or dealing with malevolent entities

1202
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:49,800
that sort of make parts of that world accessible to them.

1203
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,140
It's your own choice how you want to go about it

1204
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,520
but you have to have some type of contact point

1205
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:56,600
to really get the tangible understanding.

1206
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,760
Right, that was going to be one of my questions

1207
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,560
was about secret societies and occultists.

1208
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,420
Do they have a contact point?

1209
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,200
Are these little cults and organizations

1210
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,240
and mystery school societies built around a point of contact?

1211
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,500
It would seem to be so to some extent

1212
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,860
although it's hard to verify from the outside

1213
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,980
what's legitimate and what's not.

1214
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:21,080
People talk about the Freemasons endlessly

1215
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,600
but when you look at at least their public-facing ceremonies

1216
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,620
it always seems somewhat ridiculous

1217
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:28,480
the way that they congregate.

1218
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,840
You can go up to these people at their events

1219
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,100
and talk to them about what they're doing

1220
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:36,800
and they'll usually say something blase or sort of generic

1221
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:40,220
which goes to show that even in that world there's tears

1222
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,720
and ancient older literature will talk about

1223
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,000
33rd degree Freemason, etc.

1224
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,620
I can't say personally what that means.

1225
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,420
I would assume that there is a tear somewhere

1226
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:54,080
where things do get into the more tangibly supernatural

1227
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,760
but it's just hard to say from the outside looking in.

1228
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,180
It's about armies also.

1229
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,380
That's why the Catholics for example

1230
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,760
no abortion, no birth control, no suicide.

1231
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,220
The more people you have enlisted in your club

1232
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,500
the more power you have.

1233
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:11,080
Why do you think there are millions of government employees?

1234
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,100
J.P. Morgan, they asked him back in the day

1235
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,000
what do you prepare to do when the people find out

1236
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,680
the money system is based on fiction?

1237
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:20,440
Oh, easy.

1238
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,200
I'll just draft a bunch of checks and pay half the people

1239
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,580
to kill the other half of the people.

1240
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,740
That's one way to go about it.

1241
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,780
Yeah, most governments want to increase

1242
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:31,340
how many government employees they have

1243
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,920
because if you're depending on quote-unquote a paycheck

1244
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:35,520
you're not going to rebel.

1245
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,020
The goal of any government is to get

1246
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,660
more than 50% of the population on their payroll.

1247
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:44,220
It's the same thing with religion and clubs

1248
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,560
and secret societies.

1249
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,720
Right, well let me ask you about that whole concept

1250
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:54,720
that the real proof, the knowledge to really be shown

1251
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,540
I mean we can make the claim all day

1252
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:58,700
but to be shown it really has to be given

1253
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,460
from this upper plane

1254
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:03,980
because there's no way for us to elevate ourselves

1255
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:06,520
to a state where we can prove these things.

1256
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:08,520
They have to be willing to pull back the curtain

1257
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,520
a little bit themselves.

1258
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,500
Is there a way to invoke such a thing?

1259
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,520
You can do it subtly.

1260
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:18,640
Here's a simple experiment that I do all the time

1261
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,140
and I demonstrate it to other people.

1262
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:22,140
There's something called Craigslist, right?

1263
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,940
They have a free section.

1264
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,600
So just think of something you want

1265
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,020
and act as if you have it

1266
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,120
and then go in the next two or three days

1267
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,380
to Craigslist free and someone is giving it away.

1268
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,560
It's bizarre.

1269
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,920
It works at about a rate of 70%.

1270
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,240
Very specific things will show up free on Craigslist

1271
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,600
and you'll go find the ad

1272
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,080
and it was just put five minutes ago

1273
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:44,680
and you call and say,

1274
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,900
hey, for example, I needed a small shed

1275
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,220
of a certain variety.

1276
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,000
I needed some pallets.

1277
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:50,680
I needed this.

1278
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:51,600
I needed a water pump.

1279
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,460
It shows up and I call and it's like,

1280
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:55,120
oh, I guess if you're coming now

1281
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,460
I'll just take the ad down and I go and pick it up.

1282
00:51:58,620 --> 00:51:58,980
Manifestation.

1283
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,400
This has nothing to do with law of attraction and all that

1284
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:02,960
but you can manifest things.

1285
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,440
I was going to say manifestation.

1286
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,500
So you're saying that the gods are the mechanism

1287
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,340
of manifestation.

1288
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,580
They just decide to grant a wish.

1289
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,220
Think about you have a wagon,

1290
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,220
a motorized engine driven wagon.

1291
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,160
I don't call it an automobile

1292
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,660
because it's not autonomous, right?

1293
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,440
You have to put fuel in it, the ones we have.

1294
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:21,340
But you don't have any roads.

1295
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:24,800
So you can have as many, let's say, automobiles, right,

1296
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,780
as you want.

1297
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,160
But if you don't have any roads,

1298
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,420
you're kind of landlocked, right?

1299
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,080
What the gods are simply doing is providing the roads.

1300
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:32,940
They're like road maintenance.

1301
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:35,620
They're building the roads and connectivity, freeways, highways,

1302
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,260
small back streets, alleyways.

1303
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,680
Does that make any sense for an analogy?

1304
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:41,640
It does make sense as an analogy

1305
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,800
but I wonder why they would do that.

1306
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,380
Why they would care if I get the trailer

1307
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:53,180
that I want to get through a free ad on Craigslist.

1308
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,740
They should be so high above me

1309
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,420
that they don't give a fuck about what I want

1310
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,580
or how I get it or anything about my life.

1311
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,820
Yeah, you made a really good point.

1312
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,480
Go down to Beverly Hills and ask people for money

1313
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,220
because they're wealthy.

1314
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,580
They should be loose with it, right?

1315
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,460
Most people will say, go screw yourself.

1316
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:11,620
But guess what?

1317
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:12,620
What would you say?

1318
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,040
One out of 10, one out of 20 might say,

1319
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,340
sure, I have some for you.

1320
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,380
Very similar to humans.

1321
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:24,640
On the Godspeak website, towards the top,

1322
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:29,280
you have a scrolling rolodex of quotes

1323
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,180
that come up through the sonic events

1324
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:37,580
and one of them mentions that the gods want our attention.

1325
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,440
The question is like, well, what do they want with us?

1326
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:43,200
Well, if you have everything and access to everything,

1327
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,660
what would you want other than attention?

1328
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:49,080
But even that seems like if they are just people

1329
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,560
at a greatly advanced level,

1330
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,500
I don't see why they would be motivated

1331
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,140
by getting our attention.

1332
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,960
Okay, you phrased that very well.

1333
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:02,680
You don't see, but maybe they do.

1334
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,180
I'm not being an asshole.

1335
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,780
I'm just saying you don't see it, but maybe they do.

1336
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,140
And I'm suggesting that based on just contemplation.

1337
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,860
I was invited to a birthday party for a billionaire once

1338
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,260
and he's a billionaire, right, with a B.

1339
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:17,760
So what do you bring them?

1340
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,540
I don't do those things, but out of respect, I went.

1341
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,960
So what do you give someone that already has everything?

1342
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:25,780
I mean, well, a billionaire doesn't have everything,

1343
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,520
but, you know, what do you bring them?

1344
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,180
You know, a stupid tie.

1345
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,180
What do you get them?

1346
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:31,820
So you have to get them something unusual.

1347
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,640
So I got a letter opener made from a raccoon penis bone.

1348
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:36,880
Hello.

1349
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,660
That was like, who would ever think of something like that, right?

1350
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,280
So you see, it has to be something unusual that they still,

1351
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:48,500
but you notice it's a letter opener, right?

1352
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,940
It still ties into something tangible that they can use.

1353
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,480
So what do the gods use?

1354
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,760
If they focus more on the energetic,

1355
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,860
well, here, let's go back to the universal concept of information.

1356
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:01,200
Have you ever seen a sci-fi film where these beings are so advanced,

1357
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,740
they're just basically, they don't need to eat,

1358
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,040
they don't need to do much,

1359
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:09,040
but they interact with the characters that are human by thought?

1360
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,300
Yeah, definitely.

1361
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,500
Okay, is that so hard to contemplate?

1362
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,140
That they would communicate through thought?

1363
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,620
Yeah, they don't have the physical needs we do,

1364
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,880
but because they only exist as thought forms now.

1365
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,620
There's an old Star Trek that where they found a society so advanced,

1366
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:27,080
there were these luminous globes,

1367
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:30,900
and they just wanted to go back into a human body to experience it temporarily.

1368
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:34,360
So occasionally, have you ever heard of gods wanting to,

1369
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:39,180
or spiritual beings wanting to go and take control of a human body for a short time?

1370
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:40,640
Exorcist, hello, the movie.

1371
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,780
Remember, demons are gods that fell out of favor, right?

1372
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:47,040
We had a president that is demonized.

1373
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:49,920
He's a demon, right, to some, and he's a god to others.

1374
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,740
Oh, wait a second.

1375
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,500
Aren't there secret societies that are called Satan worshipers?

1376
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,720
To them, is that a negative entity?

1377
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:56,160
No.

1378
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,800
Yes, and when I went through the Godspeak series,

1379
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,000
and when I was preparing for this,

1380
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:07,880
I thought we were going to be putting the gods in a context of thought forms,

1381
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:12,300
that they are on a spiritual, non-physical plane,

1382
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:14,400
and they sometimes interact with us.

1383
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,820
Maybe they pull the strings from this place,

1384
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,780
but you took me down this whole other path

1385
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:23,540
that they're actually just using some kind of technology to do such a thing,

1386
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:25,720
and so now I'm a little confused.

1387
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:29,360
It almost seems like atheism is the right paradigm

1388
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,820
because there is no spiritual plane.

1389
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,380
Is that what we're saying?

1390
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,140
No, there is.

1391
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,720
It's just the variety is so great.

1392
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,720
Look at all the animal species on the,

1393
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,700
if I told you there's half a million species of insects,

1394
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:45,100
not half a million insects, half a million species,

1395
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:47,400
and there's millions and billions of each one of those.

1396
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:51,460
There is a veritable plurality in existence, especially here on Earth.

1397
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,780
The spiritual aspect of it is of the mind,

1398
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,940
and again, when you go to atheism, this is my answer to atheists.

1399
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,340
Okay, you're an atheist, so you don't believe in God, right?

1400
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,060
I don't like that term, God, but they usually answer yes.

1401
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:08,120
I said, okay, then do you believe in the laws of the state?

1402
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:09,740
And they say, yes.

1403
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,360
Well, then the state is your God, and April 1st is your holiday.

1404
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:16,840
In other words, it's a default back to the purpose of the gods is to what?

1405
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:20,460
Disseminate, transmit information on how to be, how to live.

1406
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:24,260
It's ontological, you know, the nature of being, right?

1407
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,940
And then it goes to eschatology, which is how things end up.

1408
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:28,300
It's very simple.

1409
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:33,400
So the atheist is basically telling you they get their law from the state,

1410
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,560
and that's their God.

1411
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:35,320
It's a default thing.

1412
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,120
And by the way, when you look at all the state buildings,

1413
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,940
don't they have a statue of a God or something on top of the dome

1414
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,800
of some kind of goddess or something?

1415
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:44,120
They know what's going on.

1416
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,380
People are very simple, but there's two types of simple.

1417
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,480
There's simple and good, and there's simple and not good.

1418
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:52,480
I didn't say bad.

1419
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,120
Like recently I was having a discussion with a corporate person,

1420
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,820
and they want to do this type of banking.

1421
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:58,900
I said, no, no, I don't do that.

1422
00:57:58,940 --> 00:57:59,980
I redeem lawful money.

1423
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,580
And I said, you know, listen, all this,

1424
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,880
I noticed you're getting heated on this discussion about finances.

1425
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,260
It doesn't make you bad that you want to be corporate,

1426
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:12,000
but I'll tell you what, it definitely doesn't make you good either.

1427
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:13,700
So what does that mean?

1428
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,180
Is that a gray area?

1429
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:15,960
Not exactly.

1430
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:19,380
But can someone not be bad and also not be good?

1431
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:21,820
And that's the point here with the gods as well.

1432
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:26,720
By the way, there is a lot of writing about that the God of the Bible

1433
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:31,060
is responsible for more people dying than any other cause or dictator.

1434
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:32,620
I'm sure you've heard that, right?

1435
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,200
Yeah, yeah.

1436
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:38,820
Well, you bring up a great point about state houses, courthouses,

1437
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:40,320
all this stuff.

1438
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:45,460
There's always some kind of effigy or idol out front.

1439
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:48,420
Even there's one at Rockefeller Center.

1440
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:54,060
And you could say that the Statue of Liberty might be a veiled idol

1441
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,500
of some kind, some say the goddess Columbia.

1442
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:59,700
And that's a big part of shows like this,

1443
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:04,340
trying to unpack the secret religion of the elite is how it's usually framed,

1444
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:07,160
that they aren't Jewish or Christian.

1445
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,740
They have a whole different paradigm.

1446
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:15,140
They might be worshiping Mithras or something weird like that,

1447
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,840
something more ancient and archaic.

1448
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:23,200
Is that a paradigm that you think is somewhat on the right track?

1449
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:25,500
Or are they having more of a relationship like this,

1450
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:29,260
like it is just a couple of people that have a relationship?

1451
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:34,880
Very simple is when you ask someone that is doing something,

1452
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,060
why you're doing it, and they don't have an answer,

1453
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,920
just because, right?

1454
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,560
Is that good enough for you?

1455
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,460
And if that's good enough for you, everything's right.

1456
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:49,400
But if it's not good enough for you, then everything is not right.

1457
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:50,660
Notice I didn't say wrong.

1458
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,120
Yeah, it wouldn't be good enough for me.

1459
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,500
I would want more details as to what motivates a certain person,

1460
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:01,240
especially if we're talking about the level of having a statue

1461
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,180
and certain symbols everywhere they go.

1462
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:07,780
There seems to be some kind of power in the symbol,

1463
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:12,940
some kind of power in the references to what they call the gods.

1464
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:15,540
All power is direction of movement.

1465
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:19,580
For example, if you have a Ferrari and it's just parked on the side of the road,

1466
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:23,540
well, some sports cars like that look like they're going 100 miles an hour

1467
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,300
standing still.

1468
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,880
You really don't know until you drive it.

1469
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,020
And when you drive it, are you driving it forward

1470
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,740
or are you driving it in reverse?

1471
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,560
But it's still direction.

1472
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:35,980
So power, when let's say someone pulls the lever

1473
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:40,200
and pulls the pin out of a grenade and counts to 5 or 10 and it goes off,

1474
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:43,440
the direction of force is from the center of the grenade outward,

1475
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,380
very power, right?

1476
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:50,000
Power is an exhibit of direction and how fast that direction is moving.

1477
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:53,040
For example, explosives are measured in feet per second.

1478
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,300
So if I say this thing, when it goes off,

1479
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,500
high-speed chemistry is what people in the trade call it,

1480
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,460
goes off at 200 feet per second, okay.

1481
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,340
This one goes off at 7,000 feet per second.

1482
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:08,020
Ooh, you want to stay away from that one, right?

1483
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,600
So power is about direction.

1484
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:15,420
So when you see an idol, isn't that a form of direction?

1485
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,260
Well, it's caught your view, right?

1486
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:19,680
And then it has an effect on the mind.

1487
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,000
So whatever you're thinking about when someone –

1488
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,880
most people look at things and don't acknowledge it.

1489
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,300
But if you were to point that out to someone who –

1490
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,840
what's that on top of the building there?

1491
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,080
Oh, yeah, I've seen that before.

1492
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:32,140
I don't really know what it is.

1493
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:34,440
But the moment they figure out what it is,

1494
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,140
now their thought direction has changed.

1495
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:39,480
And that's where the power is, you see.

1496
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:43,040
But there's also in ritual, it's having masses of people.

1497
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,480
Super Bowl halftime, by the way.

1498
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,440
It doesn't matter if they know what's going on,

1499
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,300
as long as they partake.

1500
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:51,080
But here's the thing.

1501
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:54,080
One person partaking that knows what's going on,

1502
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,760
you're going to need 1,000 people partaking

1503
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,720
if they don't know what's going on,

1504
01:01:58,720 --> 01:01:59,980
to have the same amount of power.

1505
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:02,880
Hence, the secret society rituals.

1506
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,860
Secret society rituals are done with a group, by the way.

1507
01:02:05,980 --> 01:02:08,400
It's a milieu of people, two or more.

1508
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,360
Sometimes it could be dozens.

1509
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,000
And those dozen people, let's say,

1510
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:15,980
offering to some ancient deity, let's say,

1511
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,960
have a lot more power than everyone watching the Super Bowl

1512
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:21,180
because they know what's going on.

1513
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:22,620
So again, it's direction.

1514
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:25,160
Is it the 200 feet per second chemical reaction

1515
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,120
or the 7,000 feet per second chemical reaction?

1516
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:29,900
Sure, sure.

1517
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:31,320
It's all about direction.

1518
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:33,100
I think that makes sense.

1519
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:36,280
And when we think about gods as thought forms,

1520
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,960
I can understand why they would want attention.

1521
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,940
Attention could be a form of currency

1522
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:46,460
in the mental space or energy or food to a degree.

1523
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,100
But that's different than saying

1524
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:51,160
that they're people manipulating us technologically.

1525
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,660
There could be both categories going on.

1526
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:58,020
But thought forms would have just entirely different dynamics

1527
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:01,740
as to what they value and how they feed

1528
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:04,120
or what they're interested in.

1529
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:06,520
Yes, yes.

1530
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:09,460
Again, there are so many varieties.

1531
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,620
Again, the whole purpose of the Godspeak

1532
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:16,100
was to be contemplative and put forward rational discussion

1533
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:18,860
on basically what's been memorialized through history.

1534
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,980
By the way, what's been memorialized through history?

1535
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:24,680
Whenever you see an old book or an old text that you find,

1536
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,740
you have to ask yourself,

1537
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,720
why do we have this on the surface?

1538
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,620
Why are they allowing us to see this?

1539
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:34,460
Because I will bet dollars to donuts,

1540
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,980
as they say back in New York,

1541
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,260
that if you go underground,

1542
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,960
they'll pull out a manuscript of some sort,

1543
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,980
and it'll look like it's decades old,

1544
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,840
and it's 4,000 or 5,000 years old.

1545
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,740
That's how well all knowledge has been preserved.

1546
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:49,120
Library of Alexandria was emptied out

1547
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,980
before it was burned twice.

1548
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,400
All the gold in the World Trade Center

1549
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,540
was emptied out using yellow Ryder vans.

1550
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,820
The yellow Ryder vans always show up, by the way, Oklahoma.

1551
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:01,080
Anyway, so all these things are cleared up

1552
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,700
before the disasters take place,

1553
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,880
and the disaster that we have on the surface right now

1554
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:06,840
is called Ignorance, with a capital G.

1555
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,080
I would just jump in real quick to say

1556
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,100
that if one loosely defines gods

1557
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:20,200
as the primary dynamic influence on this physical world,

1558
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,180
wherever that comes from,

1559
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:23,320
I don't think it's contradictory to say

1560
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,580
that there's an invisible spirit realm

1561
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,320
where some of those entities habitate,

1562
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:29,720
and there's also a breakaway civilization

1563
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:32,200
made up of anthropomorphic beings on this side

1564
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,020
that can mask their presence and do things like time travel.

1565
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:37,460
Because I think going back to what the Greeks said about

1566
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:40,520
when truths are revealed to you through things,

1567
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:41,800
whether it's movies or comics,

1568
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,440
that still counts as a reveal,

1569
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:46,940
and we've seen endlessly in various intellectual properties

1570
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:48,660
this notion of the hybrid,

1571
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:50,480
what comes to mind for me,

1572
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,880
something like Dragon Ball Z, the hybrid Saiyan.

1573
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:56,420
So these two things can exist in parallel,

1574
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:59,140
that you have the thought forms or the thought world,

1575
01:04:59,780 --> 01:05:02,340
and then you have some kind of embodiment on this side

1576
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:03,440
that interacts with that,

1577
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:07,280
and people going through forms like the occult

1578
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,220
to try to access that on their own.

1579
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,500
And yeah, I mean, I've also heard the Greeks say in the past

1580
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,620
that when it comes to the occult,

1581
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,100
when you ask them,

1582
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,160
what are the gods behind your secret societies,

1583
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,440
ultimately what you come away with

1584
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,000
is understanding that whatever those gods are,

1585
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,700
they're there to compete for the people's attention

1586
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:25,500
and their allegiance.

1587
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,880
It's more that than anything else.

1588
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,240
It's not necessarily you become a Freemason or a Jesuit

1589
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,240
and then you conquer the world.

1590
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,840
It's more of you get absorbed into that system,

1591
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,440
and that's what takes up your energy and your time.

1592
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,600
So rather than focusing on whatever,

1593
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,280
let's say, the supreme deity might be,

1594
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,840
you've got your head buried in the Kabbalah

1595
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,160
trying to uncover something.

1596
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:47,920
I think that's the real reveal, I think, of secret societies.

1597
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,360
Because wherever the highest truth is,

1598
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:52,000
I wouldn't say it's in those groups.

1599
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:54,220
But by getting involved in those groups,

1600
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:55,920
it becomes almost like a time suck.

1601
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,240
Or you could listen to God speak.

1602
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,120
By the way, I just wanted to mention,

1603
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,640
this is very important because these terms come up

1604
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,320
when you have a discussion like this one.

1605
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,960
The opposite of love is not hate.

1606
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:10,240
It's not an opposite because it takes a lot of energy to hate,

1607
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,660
almost as much as love.

1608
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,880
It is on a different frequency.

1609
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,200
I would suggest the opposite of love is indifference.

1610
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:18,660
If you were to walk into a room,

1611
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,880
and there's four people there,

1612
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:21,900
but they only count three,

1613
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:22,940
and you're totally ignored,

1614
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,480
you would much rather have someone hate on you.

1615
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,200
Yeah, it's indifference.

1616
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,540
So the indifference to the gods is really their,

1617
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:31,700
how would you say,

1618
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,760
what they don't like, I would suggest.

1619
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,040
Tie that into the worship,

1620
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:37,220
tie that into the attention.

1621
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:39,920
Indifference and apathy, ignoring them,

1622
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:42,320
is really the cutting off the food.

1623
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,000
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

1624
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,120
People talk about the overlap

1625
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:48,920
between pain and pleasure,

1626
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,260
that it kind of comes full circle sometimes.

1627
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,220
The Venn diagram of those two

1628
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:55,320
can overlap quite greatly,

1629
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,580
but you could say

1630
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:59,180
pain and pleasure being one thing

1631
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:00,940
and the opposite is truly like

1632
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:02,420
numbness or no feeling.

1633
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:05,120
That's right. People say I'm bored,

1634
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:07,340
and I consider when someone says they're bored

1635
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:09,160
as boredom as being a form of anger.

1636
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,700
How can you be bored?

1637
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:12,540
I mean, bored of what?

1638
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:14,600
Everything is amazing. You're breathing, aren't you?

1639
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:16,660
Look, one of the

1640
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:18,320
healing arts is breathing,

1641
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:20,540
right? So if you feel bored,

1642
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:21,880
why don't you focus on your breathing?

1643
01:07:21,980 --> 01:07:23,040
It's actually a healing art.

1644
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:25,940
There are many cases of people healing diseases

1645
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:27,780
by changing the way they breathe.

1646
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,420
How can you be bored?

1647
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:32,640
Well, you know, when we had this last

1648
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,320
conversation, and even this one,

1649
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:36,340
I find the most interesting

1650
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:38,560
parts to be these little anecdotes

1651
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,500
from your life,

1652
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,560
Greek, and it's difficult

1653
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,520
for me as an interviewer because I don't

1654
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,600
even know what to ask because I have no

1655
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,840
context for

1656
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:50,700
these random experiences

1657
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,380
in your life. The seeing

1658
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,620
of ancient books that aren't supposed to

1659
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:55,900
be, the

1660
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,420
finding out of knowledge or

1661
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:00,460
technologies that people think aren't

1662
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:02,400
supposed to be, what are

1663
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,580
some of those things that have happened in your life

1664
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,540
that really flips

1665
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:08,440
the way you think about things compared to

1666
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:09,520
a conventional person?

1667
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:12,520
Interesting. You know, I'm glad you

1668
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,600
asked this. I had a discussion about this

1669
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,479
recently with someone, rather

1670
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:18,580
a long discussion, and one thing

1671
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:20,380
is to anticipate new things

1672
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:22,460
and things that you never even thought

1673
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:24,540
of were possible, to anticipate them

1674
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:26,439
even though you don't know exactly what they might be

1675
01:08:26,439 --> 01:08:27,819
in context or subject matter.

1676
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:30,520
What that does is it opens the door,

1677
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,340
right? This is not law of

1678
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:34,340
attraction. This is very different, and it

1679
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:36,399
keeps your mind open. Then before you know it,

1680
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:38,279
you find yourself in situations meeting

1681
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:40,220
people that you never thought you'd meet

1682
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:42,020
and seeing things that you never

1683
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:44,439
think you'd ever see, but you have to have

1684
01:08:44,439 --> 01:08:46,520
an open mind, and I'm saying

1685
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,760
that in the truest sense.

1686
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:50,220
Open meaning not

1687
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:52,399
closed. See, because there is no such

1688
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:54,420
thing as a closed mind. It's like a clamp.

1689
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:56,520
When the mind is closed, it just doesn't

1690
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,300
keep things from going in or

1691
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,399
coming out. It actually starts compressing

1692
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:02,439
and making it smaller and

1693
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:04,439
smaller and smaller. Leave a piece of

1694
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:05,760
fruit on the windowsill.

1695
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:08,640
What happens after time? It starts to

1696
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,880
shrink and die.

1697
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:12,680
When something dies, it shrinks, condenses,

1698
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:13,939
decomposes.

1699
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:16,160
There's this aspect of life

1700
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,479
that you tag yourself

1701
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:20,520
with. You remember every morning you get up

1702
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,120
and you hang a label on yourself,

1703
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,620
a label that says, you know, I'm open to

1704
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:26,100
new things every day,

1705
01:09:26,439 --> 01:09:28,240
and then watch what happens.

1706
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:29,760
You also have to do the work.

1707
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:32,260
For example, someone like myself

1708
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:34,200
who says, let's say, I work with

1709
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,399
water or work with weather or work with energy,

1710
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,120
I have to be able to back that up.

1711
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:40,140
That's where the work

1712
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:42,260
comes in. You have to do it with authentic,

1713
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,479
creative, intuitive information,

1714
01:09:44,899 --> 01:09:46,180
not just because you read a bunch of

1715
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:48,300
textbooks. By the way,

1716
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:50,160
when you have a textbook, put that down. You don't

1717
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:51,000
know where that's been.

1718
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,200
Yes. You mentioned going

1719
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,240
to a billionaire's

1720
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,220
birthday party.

1721
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:00,340
That's very adjacent to

1722
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:02,700
something like a breakaway civilization.

1723
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,420
The next level up might be

1724
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:06,180
that. It might be just one degree

1725
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:08,560
below. Have you had experiences

1726
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:10,560
with people that

1727
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:12,600
would be classified

1728
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,660
as members of a breakaway

1729
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:16,620
civilization? Not in a way

1730
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:18,700
that would shock anyone on the surface

1731
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:19,360
world.

1732
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,420
Believe it or not, there's a lot of filters

1733
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:24,480
in place for that. It's not like

1734
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,440
you just meet someone that's, let's say,

1735
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,480
a secret elitist, quote-unquote, Illuminati,

1736
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,420
whatever. Two days

1737
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:32,540
later, you're doing their stuff. It takes

1738
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:34,460
years and years and years. One

1739
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:36,420
of the things that I always say within

1740
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,480
knowing the Greek for even just

1741
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,480
a few hours, I bring up, hey, I'm an

1742
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:41,560
Old Testament kind of guy.

1743
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:44,540
In other words, when I go to a restaurant, I'm like, do you have anything

1744
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,340
without pork? They're like,

1745
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,380
are you Jewish? I'm like, no, I'm not Jewish.

1746
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:49,860
I just don't dig on swine.

1747
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,480
I put

1748
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,260
this air of not righteousness,

1749
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,120
but I have my limits.

1750
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,240
If you want to know what they are, just go read that.

1751
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:00,220
I'm not

1752
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:02,120
necessarily a shallow individual, but

1753
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,060
if you want to know what I think about you, listen

1754
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,380
to what I'm saying. I don't speak behind people

1755
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:08,240
in a way that would surprise anyone.

1756
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:10,060
The other thing is, I subscribe

1757
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:11,900
to this body of law

1758
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:14,140
and morality. If you want to know what

1759
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:16,300
it is, just go read it. It's the Old Testament,

1760
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:18,000
for example. I actually

1761
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,540
mentioned to someone, this was in academics,

1762
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:22,080
you're an Old Testament kind of guy. That means you want to

1763
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,980
go around killing people? I'm like,

1764
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:24,400
what?

1765
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,180
Where'd you get that from? There's a heavy

1766
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:29,940
distortion. Again, Gustave Le Bon,

1767
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,160
if you mention the Old

1768
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:33,940
Testament, that's a wrathful God.

1769
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,180
It's all about killing and maiming.

1770
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:38,240
Then we have this new God that's all about

1771
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:40,180
love and whatever. No, I don't know.

1772
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:42,320
That's been so oversimplified. It no longer

1773
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,240
resembles the truth.

1774
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,040
Going back to what you said about

1775
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,320
your laws come from

1776
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,200
your God,

1777
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:52,220
what does that say about people today

1778
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:54,260
who seem mainly

1779
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:56,400
godless? Do they have

1780
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,280
some God that they're just

1781
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,440
not necessarily conscious of, or

1782
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,000
not so much?

1783
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,020
Absolutely. It's called the state.

1784
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,380
They signed

1785
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:08,320
this new bill today. Oh my gosh,

1786
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:10,360
now we have to wear a blue hat on Mondays

1787
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,040
otherwise the IRS will fine us

1788
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:12,540
$500.

1789
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:16,340
They get all worked up with all these new

1790
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:18,180
laws. I actually look at

1791
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:20,360
all of the new laws, even the draconian ones,

1792
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,280
not to mention laws

1793
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,980
like the Patriot Act and other things like that.

1794
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,080
I think they're

1795
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,120
wonderful in a sense that they're just disclosing

1796
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:30,120
what was put in place over 100

1797
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,280
years ago. Trading with the Enemies Act,

1798
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:33,960
1933 Banking Act,

1799
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,180
they're just disclosing more of what

1800
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:37,540
was already set in place

1801
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:40,180
a long time ago. People are

1802
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:41,400
riled up like it's something new.

1803
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:44,200
Do you think

1804
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,320
there's value in trying

1805
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,160
to form a relationship

1806
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,000
with a god? How do we

1807
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
even know what gods

1808
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,080
could be available to us?

1809
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:56,080
Too big of a

1810
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:56,900
question to answer.

1811
01:12:57,660 --> 01:13:00,140
The smaller part of that question, I would say,

1812
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:00,840
is by doing.

1813
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,060
What is it? Walk your talk, talk your

1814
01:13:04,060 --> 01:13:06,040
walk? Again, I'm an Old Testament

1815
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:08,080
kind of guy. One of the things there

1816
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,040
is the quote-unquote food laws.

1817
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,280
They're not restrictions. There are laws

1818
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:14,080
better ways. For example, when you

1819
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,980
buy a car and it says put a certain motor oil

1820
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:17,380
in it, guess what?

1821
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:19,700
You should do that for that car, right?

1822
01:13:20,240 --> 01:13:22,140
Use a certain soap in your washing machine

1823
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,560
is a thing that I've noticed.

1824
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:25,700
What happens if you don't?

1825
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:27,840
There's also stuff about

1826
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,080
when you wear clothing, don't wear mixed fibers.

1827
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,040
There's how to

1828
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,740
keep time. Well, it's very indirect,

1829
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:36,080
but it'll tell you by what it's not

1830
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:37,160
telling you how to keep time.

1831
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:39,460
Many aspects. How to do business.

1832
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:42,120
The Regulation Z in business,

1833
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,340
the 72-hour

1834
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,440
right to refuse

1835
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,020
a contract or something like that,

1836
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:48,820
that comes out of the Old Testament, right?

1837
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,080
When you sign a bank loan or something,

1838
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,360
they usually wait 72

1839
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:55,300
hours for it to close because in

1840
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:57,160
that time, you could renege on the whole thing

1841
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,320
or whatever, right? It's funny when you send back

1842
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,320
a traffic ticket within 72 hours

1843
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,120
to the police station and to the court,

1844
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,040
what they do? They freak out. They start

1845
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,680
changing dates and things on there.

1846
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:09,160
Regulation Z, they call it in the

1847
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,160
commercial world. Actually, here's the thing.

1848
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:13,180
I'd like to see anyone

1849
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:15,180
come up with some old maxims of law

1850
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:17,180
or things that are written in law that didn't

1851
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:19,200
come from the Old Testament. Show me something

1852
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,460
that hasn't come from there.

1853
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:22,340
For example, taxation.

1854
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:25,120
The foreigner is taxed. So if you

1855
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,900
are being taxed by your government,

1856
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,720
well, your government is a foreign government.

1857
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:30,760
Is that possible?

1858
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:32,960
Is it possible that...

1859
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,900
Does it have to be like the CCP?

1860
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,880
China has to come over here and take over

1861
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,880
Washington, D.C. for it to look foreign

1862
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:40,800
because they look foreign?

1863
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:42,860
No. It could be

1864
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:44,620
foreign government and just be your own people.

1865
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,120
When you read in old stories

1866
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,120
about, let's say, the New Testament,

1867
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:50,820
the Roman soldiers, right? The Romans

1868
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,000
did all this stuff, right? You hear it and you see

1869
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,920
it in the movies. Very few

1870
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:56,900
of those guys were actually from Rome

1871
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,800
or a place known as Italy. They were

1872
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,480
actually hires from Syria

1873
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,840
and Lebanon and places all around.

1874
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:05,160
For example, look at a photograph

1875
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,040
of people in the U.S. Army.

1876
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,340
I'd say about a third of them

1877
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:11,240
are over there because they want to get a green card.

1878
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:13,100
They're not from here.

1879
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,320
So, yeah.

1880
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:16,540
There's a mix here.

1881
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:19,300
You really stepped

1882
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,160
in it, Greg, with this and the other interview

1883
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,980
because these are subjects that require

1884
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,780
days of talk, right?

1885
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,420
It's really hard to compress.

1886
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:29,240
Yeah. And a lot of people won't even

1887
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:31,060
do two-hour interviews because they only

1888
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:32,180
have one hour in them.

1889
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:35,480
Oh, my gosh. We could just barely scratch it.

1890
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:37,260
That's how I feel. That's how I feel.

1891
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,120
That's the value of two hours, I think.

1892
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,380
So, if you talk to a

1893
01:15:41,380 --> 01:15:43,480
chaos magician, they tend

1894
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:45,200
to go to the

1895
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,880
historical books about

1896
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,340
various gods. They comb

1897
01:15:49,340 --> 01:15:51,580
through different pantheons.

1898
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:53,660
They look at grimoires

1899
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:55,340
and they find

1900
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:57,180
gods that are supposed to represent

1901
01:15:57,180 --> 01:15:59,060
things they might want,

1902
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:01,480
like wealth or increased luck

1903
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:03,480
or vitality

1904
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:04,560
or fertility,

1905
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,520
and they might try to

1906
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:09,420
incorporate those gods into

1907
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:11,420
their prayers, into their altar.

1908
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:13,600
Do you see that as

1909
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,800
a paradigm that has any value?

1910
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:17,360
Can you dig into the

1911
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,420
historical literature about gods

1912
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:21,700
and, in our modern day,

1913
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,460
actually incorporate

1914
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,080
them into your thoughts

1915
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:27,100
and have an effect?

1916
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:29,580
Exactly. We're being

1917
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:31,460
monitored, as you could see

1918
01:16:31,460 --> 01:16:33,460
back then. You could read any ancient

1919
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:35,500
text. And we heard the prayers of so-and-so,

1920
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:37,460
right? So, I'm here with

1921
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,560
my wife all day talking about getting a new couch.

1922
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,320
I pick up a stupid rectangle and there's

1923
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,780
advertisements for a new couch.

1924
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:44,300
Simple.

1925
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,480
So, in what degree?

1926
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:49,440
Could it be possible, in the future, that

1927
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,500
okay, we're speaking of getting a new

1928
01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:53,360
couch here, and not

1929
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,260
only does it show up on the stupid rectangle...

1930
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:56,940
By the way, should I define stupid rectangle?

1931
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:59,400
We know. It's the black mirror. It's the screen.

1932
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,380
Yeah. All the devices. Okay.

1933
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:03,660
Now, let's say...

1934
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:04,840
Take this hypothetically.

1935
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,800
Not only am I speaking about

1936
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,120
the couch, and not only does it show up

1937
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,100
in ads, but if there's a knock on the door,

1938
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,360
you just won the digital sweepstakes.

1939
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,500
Here's your new couch.

1940
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,320
Is that possible?

1941
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:19,360
It is. Yeah. We haven't seen

1942
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,360
it yet. By the way, let's copyright

1943
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,340
that right away.

1944
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,260
This is copyrighted on Greg Carlwood, so if they

1945
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:26,880
try to do that, you get it. Anyway.

1946
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,640
I like it. Well, how do we

1947
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,500
increase the

1948
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:32,720
potency, or the

1949
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,760
frequency, of those experiences in

1950
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,680
our lives? How can people listening

1951
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:38,720
actually improve their

1952
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,280
lives with this knowledge

1953
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:42,580
about the gods? Oh,

1954
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:44,660
great. Gustave Le Bon again,

1955
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,660
if you have a simplified notion

1956
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:48,460
of something religious, or

1957
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:50,500
spiritual, or whatever, put that

1958
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,540
down. You don't know where it's been. Go back and

1959
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:54,680
see if you could find where it came from

1960
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:55,880
and read it for yourself.

1961
01:17:56,500 --> 01:17:58,720
Just like Medusa. Yeah, you look at Medusa, you turn to

1962
01:17:58,720 --> 01:17:59,820
stone. No.

1963
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,360
If you go and read it a little more accurately,

1964
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,600
your heart turns to stone. Big difference.

1965
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,680
Go look at the big

1966
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,160
differences, what is

1967
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,600
memorialized. By the way, a lot of

1968
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,580
people that are religious, especially in the Christian,

1969
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,580
say, well, the Bible cannot be understood.

1970
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,480
Okay. So the gods

1971
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,300
put out something that cannot be understood,

1972
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,320
so that is an act of futility.

1973
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:22,680
So the gods act in futility. Is that

1974
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:24,740
what you're trying to say, or did they actually

1975
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,640
write it so it could be comprehended and

1976
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,480
understood? It would be the latter.

1977
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:30,980
So go and see what's been memorialized.

1978
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:32,640
See, we've been taught that all the

1979
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,720
people that came before us were dummies, because they didn't have

1980
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,760
stupid rectangles, and cars, and planes, right?

1981
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:38,680
They were not. And the reason you

1982
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,400
write something down and preserve it

1983
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,180
is so people in the future

1984
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,700
get it, because you have

1985
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:46,720
a sense of responsibility. One thing I

1986
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:48,460
harp on old people, when I

1987
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:50,500
bring up some eschatological point that

1988
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,560
society is going to go a certain way, which is

1989
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,620
usually negative to old people, you know what they usually say

1990
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:56,560
to me? I don't care. I'm not

1991
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,620
going to be here. Oh my gosh,

1992
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,520
so you don't mind just shitting on everybody else

1993
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,580
that's younger than you. No wonder they

1994
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:04,620
throw you in nursing homes and throw diapers

1995
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:06,520
on you and pump you up with drugs. You have no

1996
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,780
value. How about a society

1997
01:19:08,780 --> 01:19:10,600
where the older people say

1998
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,500
this is what I found out through my life. You need to

1999
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,460
preserve this and carry this on to the others.

2000
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:16,500
Very few these days like that. I

2001
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,600
have no sympathy for throwing them in nursing homes,

2002
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:20,640
strapping a diaper on their old ass

2003
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,640
and pumping them up with drugs, if they have

2004
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,680
such an attitude. And on one

2005
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,640
of the comments, someone said, wait until

2006
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,560
the Greek hits 50. Oh, I'm 10 years older

2007
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,820
than the 50. Ha ha ha.

2008
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,500
So the whole thing is, can you be objective?

2009
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:34,740
Right. I've heard

2010
01:19:34,740 --> 01:19:36,900
the baby boomers described as

2011
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:38,580
a plague of locusts.

2012
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:40,700
They took, took, took and

2013
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:42,700
didn't really steward

2014
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,480
much and didn't give back much.

2015
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,440
And that is kind of a version

2016
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:48,200
of what you're talking about. Yes.

2017
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,520
In this case, it's even worse because they

2018
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:52,160
don't care about the future at all

2019
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:54,480
of those that come after them. So when you look

2020
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,600
at older things that have been memorialized

2021
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,500
and again, you have to ask, why are they allowing this on

2022
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,280
the surface? You know, the FBI has a

2023
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,060
book seizure list still.

2024
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:04,500
If something shows up in a public library,

2025
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:06,460
university library, it's on the list to be

2026
01:20:06,460 --> 01:20:08,660
seized. It's not talked about.

2027
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:10,440
I believe that. Yeah.

2028
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:11,900
There are many things like that.

2029
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,480
There are many old books that I've seen that I

2030
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:16,600
have told people the title and the author and they look

2031
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:17,780
at, I can't find it online.

2032
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:20,680
So how did we forget

2033
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:22,640
about all this? If the

2034
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:24,540
ancient people of

2035
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:26,760
Sumeria, Greece,

2036
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:28,460
Egypt

2037
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,560
had it right that there is this

2038
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,080
relationship, this dynamic

2039
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,300
between them and the gods,

2040
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,500
how did it go away? Because wouldn't it

2041
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:38,600
be something potent

2042
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,480
that you could actually feel? You could get

2043
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,460
a result. So that's a verification

2044
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:43,880
that's hard to shake.

2045
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:46,540
There's an intuitive sense to that

2046
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:48,420
and I don't think they really had it right because

2047
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:50,520
some of the overt control mechanisms

2048
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:51,640
that were in place

2049
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:53,940
were very harsh.

2050
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,380
So those that had the overt

2051
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:58,640
control over the society really controlled

2052
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:00,180
what was right or what was wrong.

2053
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,180
We might see certain things

2054
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:03,860
right, like for example,

2055
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:06,280
in ancient Egypt, if you kept a cat,

2056
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:08,780
there was an official municipality

2057
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,340
administrative body that went

2058
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:11,960
and inspected that you were not

2059
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:14,180
maltreating the cat, and you were

2060
01:21:14,180 --> 01:21:16,180
fined if you did. You see

2061
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:18,220
the cat statues and things from ancient Egypt,

2062
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:20,100
right? That kind of exists today,

2063
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,040
animal control, right? They'll fine you if you

2064
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,620
beat your dog or whatever, right?

2065
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:26,120
So there's certain things you might consider right, but they

2066
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:28,140
also had many other things like remedies where

2067
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:30,280
they mixed cat urine and bat's

2068
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,900
blood to cure menstrual cramps.

2069
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:33,900
We wouldn't view that as being right.

2070
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,040
No, no. So it's a

2071
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:38,160
mixed bag. So if you were to put it on

2072
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,900
the scale and this society was

2073
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:42,240
30% right and 70% wrong,

2074
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:44,280
you looked at the ancients,

2075
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,320
their society would also be 30%

2076
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:48,220
right, 70% wrong.

2077
01:21:48,440 --> 01:21:50,280
But the things that would weigh on the scale

2078
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:50,900
would be different.

2079
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:54,220
Okay. Do you think there is

2080
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:56,260
a society or a

2081
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:57,580
culture or an empire

2082
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,060
that had it mostly right? I mean,

2083
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,100
who would you put at the apex of

2084
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:04,280
their accuracy when it comes

2085
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,340
to the dynamics of the world

2086
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:08,520
and the relationship with the gods

2087
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,600
and just all these things that

2088
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:11,380
factor in?

2089
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:14,520
I may not like to say this,

2090
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:16,560
but the only thing I could come across is

2091
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:18,400
in the Old Testament there was a period of about

2092
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,240
56 or so years under

2093
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:22,320
certain rulership where, quote unquote,

2094
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,440
according to the story, Israel was doing

2095
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:25,020
the right thing.

2096
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,340
So a very short time,

2097
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:30,500
56 years in a span of

2098
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,600
over 6,000, it's

2099
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,540
yeah, right? 10% would

2100
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:36,440
be 600, so it's less than that.

2101
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,500
And what makes you say that?

2102
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:40,180
What defines the right thing?

2103
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,260
Just by reading the text.

2104
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:44,300
In other words, they were in harmony

2105
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:46,540
with their chief god, Yahweh, and he protected

2106
01:22:46,540 --> 01:22:48,240
them and gave them everything they needed.

2107
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:49,680
Needed, not wanted.

2108
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,620
So if you want to get from point A to point B,

2109
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,500
you don't get a Ferrari, you might get a free ride

2110
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,140
on a bus.

2111
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:58,720
It's a big difference there. People think

2112
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:00,360
a lot of the wealthy

2113
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:02,140
people are actually better off

2114
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,300
in this society, and I'm telling you

2115
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:06,320
they're not. When Jeff Bozo

2116
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,220
is told to go public

2117
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:10,140
and make a speech about doing something, and he

2118
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:12,240
refuses to do that, the next time he goes and

2119
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,960
checks his bank balance, it's at zero.

2120
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:16,300
And they know he just checked his

2121
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,100
bank balance, and he gets a call

2122
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,580
and he says, do you want to reconsider?

2123
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:21,820
By the way, Jeff Bozo

2124
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:24,000
went on recently, and he said

2125
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,820
he's going to give all his money away.

2126
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:27,880
Do you remember that, about a year ago?

2127
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:30,200
I don't. After his divorce?

2128
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,260
He says he wants to give all the money away,

2129
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:33,560
$150 billion. Why?

2130
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,220
There's an artist known as Prince.

2131
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:37,740
He tried to get away

2132
01:23:37,740 --> 01:23:40,140
by buying some stuff in a

2133
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,120
backpack and survival gear in some island

2134
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,920
and got a phone call. Hey, what do you think you're doing?

2135
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,040
Where are you going? No, no, no.

2136
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,280
So, you know, it's just

2137
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:49,940
a keystroke. There is no money, folks.

2138
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:51,240
It's all private credit.

2139
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:54,260
You're really screwed in that

2140
01:23:54,260 --> 01:23:56,100
department, in other words, the control. You can

2141
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,200
control people through religion, but it's easier to

2142
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,860
control them through money, because they'll never notice.

2143
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,040
I think we've talked a little bit about how

2144
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,860
the banking system works.

2145
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:06,200
About how can the government, being

2146
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:08,360
$30 trillion in debt, check for a dollar?

2147
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,040
Can't. It's coming from

2148
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,140
somewhere else. And people

2149
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:14,260
call the money system a fraud. It's not a fraud.

2150
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:16,280
Because if you ask someone who's wealthy,

2151
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:18,100
how can it be a fraud? Look at all this wonderful stuff

2152
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:19,560
I've gotten. No, it's a fiction.

2153
01:24:20,380 --> 01:24:22,140
Guess what? All your religions are

2154
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,260
fiction. All of them.

2155
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:25,880
The mainstream ones. For sure.

2156
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:27,620
So you mentioned

2157
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:30,100
they had it mostly right at this time period

2158
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:31,740
because they were in right relation

2159
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:33,140
with their chief god.

2160
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:35,960
A short period. Fair. How do we

2161
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:37,780
get into right relation with

2162
01:24:37,780 --> 01:24:40,040
our chief god? Is our chief god

2163
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,960
something we can even

2164
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:43,840
choose? Or is it

2165
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,980
assigned to us? Is it geographic?

2166
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,400
Is it genetic?

2167
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:50,320
How is a chief god

2168
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:51,940
assigned to

2169
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:53,140
a person, let's say?

2170
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,380
Where I've seen it's a matter

2171
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:57,400
of choice. Like, for example, in the story

2172
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,280
of Abraham, he did not want

2173
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:01,180
anything to do with the gods of his parents

2174
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:02,840
and his geography.

2175
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:04,780
The short story is

2176
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,620
paraphrasing. So he left.

2177
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,260
I can't answer that directly,

2178
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:11,260
Greg. What I can say

2179
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:12,220
is it's a matter of choice.

2180
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,120
But can you be chosen? Yes.

2181
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:17,540
Okay. Do you have a chief god?

2182
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:19,280
Yes. It would be Yahweh.

2183
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:21,080
It would be Yahweh.

2184
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:22,580
Like it or not,

2185
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:23,980
he's got a lot of haters.

2186
01:25:24,780 --> 01:25:26,320
He does have a lot of haters.

2187
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,080
People might say that's

2188
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,940
part of the Abrahamic

2189
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:32,060
religions, right?

2190
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:35,020
Sort of. I don't like the term

2191
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:37,120
Abrahamic religions because it sounds like

2192
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:38,960
Abraham created these religions and he

2193
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,920
really didn't. There's a

2194
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:42,000
whole section,

2195
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:44,960
many sections to

2196
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:46,960
these religions. As a matter of fact, if you

2197
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:48,960
look at Christianity, it's

2198
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:50,620
Smithism down to the core.

2199
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:52,700
So how is that Abrahamic?

2200
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:54,940
Right? The Kabbalistic

2201
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:56,420
practices in the Judaism,

2202
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:58,560
how is that Abrahamic?

2203
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:00,460
And Islam is,

2204
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:02,820
you know what's interesting about Islam in the Quran,

2205
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:04,980
I used to name the Syrias, I think Mandela

2206
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:06,520
effect changed. It used to be Syria 26.

2207
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:08,680
It says that if you're

2208
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:11,040
interested in the laws of God,

2209
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,820
I'm paraphrasing here, you need to go read what

2210
01:26:12,820 --> 01:26:14,740
Moses was given. So how many Muslims

2211
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:16,780
put down the Quran and go read the laws

2212
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:18,300
that are in the Old Testament?

2213
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:20,920
If you said none, I think you said none,

2214
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,360
right? Yeah.

2215
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:24,700
You see how

2216
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:26,220
twisted and bizarre this is?

2217
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:28,520
Right. There's a lot of,

2218
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:31,020
I guess, misinformation about

2219
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:32,780
Yahweh, perhaps. Some people

2220
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:34,800
think Yahweh is Lucifer. Some people

2221
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,600
think Yahweh is the Christian

2222
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,600
God. I just stopped paying

2223
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:40,960
attention at a certain point because it's so

2224
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:43,000
tied up in a crazy Gordian knot

2225
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,920
and religion got enough of my attention

2226
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:46,540
growing up when it was foisted

2227
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:49,020
upon me. But why did

2228
01:26:49,020 --> 01:26:50,220
you choose Yahweh

2229
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,700
as your chief God?

2230
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:54,860
Simple. I went

2231
01:26:54,860 --> 01:26:56,800
to a seminar about how mortgages

2232
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,600
and the money system work, you know, on the

2233
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,940
opposing side. And I said,

2234
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,880
well, how do they get the right to do all these

2235
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,940
contracts and things? So it comes out

2236
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:06,840
of the Bible. This is over 30 years ago

2237
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:08,780
or three decades ago, 20 some odd years ago.

2238
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:11,000
I said, the Bible? What are you talking

2239
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,320
about? That was written by Shakespeare.

2240
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:13,840
You know,

2241
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:16,400
so I said, wait a second. I just

2242
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,420
said something that I shouldn't have said. How can

2243
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:19,940
I knock it if I've never read it?

2244
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,480
So I just went and started reading the lawful

2245
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,280
parts of the Bible and said, you know what?

2246
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:25,980
I didn't know this was in here.

2247
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,380
And the things that are in here are

2248
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:29,560
not what people are saying.

2249
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:31,680
There's a big contrast here.

2250
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,960
No one ever mentioned any of this stuff in here.

2251
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:36,180
So I had to make a decision and say, okay,

2252
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:38,020
do I kind of like follow what

2253
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:40,120
this thing says to do in a simplistic way

2254
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:42,240
or do I listen to what everyone else is telling

2255
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:44,080
me to do? You know, what's the

2256
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,040
template for society, including the

2257
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:47,980
religions? And I opted for just

2258
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:49,580
taking a literal sense.

2259
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:52,140
And when I say literal sense, I mean it's

2260
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:54,040
pretty simple. When it

2261
01:27:54,040 --> 01:27:56,220
tells you basically you have three days to change

2262
01:27:56,220 --> 01:27:57,760
your mind, you know,

2263
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,980
when you should eat these things and why

2264
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:02,040
you should wear these things and why

2265
01:28:02,040 --> 01:28:04,040
you should do these things on certain days,

2266
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:05,580
it's really, really simple.

2267
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:07,840
And there's 613 laws in there.

2268
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,780
A third of them are only for the

2269
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:11,720
priests and the other third are for other

2270
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,800
specific events. So it really boils down to

2271
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,800
a handful of 50 or 60 things to

2272
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:17,620
learn how to operate with.

2273
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:19,900
There's actually some pretty advanced

2274
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:21,740
science in there, things that they knew

2275
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:23,780
about the human body that are not, just

2276
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:25,180
even recently have been discovered.

2277
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:27,600
And are you talking about

2278
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:29,660
the King James Bible? Because we

2279
01:28:29,660 --> 01:28:31,600
started this talking about how it was

2280
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:33,340
a false paradigm

2281
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:35,880
derivative of the state and

2282
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:37,980
they want to control the minds

2283
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:38,480
of men.

2284
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:42,000
The term God and Lord is not in

2285
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,120
there. You have the Elohim and Yahweh,

2286
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,340
right? You have a lot of changes

2287
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:48,020
where the

2288
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:49,960
concept of the Messiah has been left

2289
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:51,960
out, where the Messiah defined himself as

2290
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,940
the Aleph-Tav or the Alpha and the Omega.

2291
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:55,820
That's omitted about

2292
01:28:55,820 --> 01:28:57,880
3,000 times. So for

2293
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,920
example, there are so many mistakes in the

2294
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,580
translation. Okay, let's look at it this way.

2295
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:03,700
You and I write a book, we take it to the printer

2296
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:05,600
and he goes through it and he says, you got

2297
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:07,640
five mistakes, so before I print it, what do you

2298
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:09,820
want to do? Well, let's correct them.

2299
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:11,700
King James was like, we have

2300
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:13,780
4,000 mistakes, what do you want to do? Oh, print

2301
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:15,640
that shit right now. Hurry up, print it.

2302
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,760
I can't respect that, sorry.

2303
01:29:18,540 --> 01:29:19,660
There's a type of mindset

2304
01:29:20,240 --> 01:29:21,800
that goes after the King James.

2305
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:23,580
You know, if I mention the

2306
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:25,600
Apostles, you know the time of

2307
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,580
1st century AD, right? And King James

2308
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:29,380
was 1611, right?

2309
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,480
About 1,500 years later. I went to a Bible

2310
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,500
study once and I kind of brought up the errors in the

2311
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:35,440
King James Bible and a woman, I'll try to do

2312
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:37,780
the accent right, King James Bible?

2313
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:39,340
That was good enough for the

2314
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:41,260
Apostle Paul, it was good enough for me.

2315
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:43,080
Oh my gosh.

2316
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:44,640
Oh my gosh.

2317
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:47,400
You can't deal with that. I can't deal

2318
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:49,420
with that. Maybe you can, I can't. I gotta

2319
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:51,660
leave the room. Yeah, I left

2320
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:53,000
Missouri as soon as I could.

2321
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,320
Yeah, well, I don't know if it was Missouri.

2322
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:57,420
I'm here in Arizona, but that's what I got. And I was

2323
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:59,380
like, okay, I'm running. I'm running away and I'm not

2324
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:01,440
turning back. But it doesn't mean I'm

2325
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,320
going to tell you it's okay if you believe in it. It's

2326
01:30:03,320 --> 01:30:04,560
not okay what they're doing.

2327
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:07,200
U.S. Constitution is another one.

2328
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,600
Not okay. Not okay.

2329
01:30:11,060 --> 01:30:11,420
Yeah,

2330
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,360
you read that thing. You know, they did the U.S.

2331
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:15,500
Constitution, by the way, it took about 10 years.

2332
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:17,480
By the way, it was written and sent to the Vatican,

2333
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:19,480
came back five years later to be signed.

2334
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:20,880
What does that mean?

2335
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:23,140
Oh, and the Bill of Rights

2336
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:25,200
was done almost a decade later.

2337
01:30:25,400 --> 01:30:27,340
Because if they didn't do the Bill of Rights, guess what

2338
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:28,960
they would have had? Another what?

2339
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:30,120
Revolution.

2340
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:31,600
Anyway.

2341
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:35,720
Well, if we look back at history

2342
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,260
and we try to

2343
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:39,740
fold in this context

2344
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:41,340
of the gods, how would you

2345
01:30:41,340 --> 01:30:43,380
look at our

2346
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:45,760
historical narrative of the rise

2347
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,540
and fall of various

2348
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:49,460
empires and

2349
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:51,600
the context of their relationship

2350
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:52,780
with their gods?

2351
01:30:53,380 --> 01:30:55,540
That's a big one. I think that one

2352
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:57,440
that would console with the Phoenix

2353
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:58,900
phenomenon from archaics.

2354
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:01,640
That reset that happens every 138

2355
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:03,220
years or 592

2356
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:05,440
or 552

2357
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,320
or 792 years, there's these

2358
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,280
objects in the sky that come and just wreak

2359
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:10,920
havoc on the planet, would be one.

2360
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:13,060
The other one would be internal

2361
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:14,740
fighting, takeover.

2362
01:31:15,060 --> 01:31:17,300
People don't understand. More and more people

2363
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:19,280
are. For example, when you

2364
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,340
say United States of

2365
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:23,160
America, Washington, D.C. is the capital,

2366
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:25,360
Washington, D.C. is not part of this country.

2367
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,360
It's a foreign enclave. Just like

2368
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,320
in Mexico, the capital

2369
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:31,220
is called district federal.

2370
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:33,340
All the federal districts are

2371
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:35,340
foreign to the countries that they're a part of.

2372
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,320
Now, if that's not the beginning of the

2373
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,480
demise of nationalism,

2374
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:41,300
I don't know what is. Does it have to be

2375
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:43,380
like little green men from Mars setting up

2376
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:45,580
an enclave on your capital to be obvious

2377
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:46,640
that it's foreign?

2378
01:31:48,380 --> 01:31:49,340
So, one

2379
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:51,140
of the precursors to destruction

2380
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:53,260
of a nation or culture

2381
01:31:53,260 --> 01:31:55,140
is being controlled by

2382
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:57,260
a foreigner, whether it's

2383
01:31:57,260 --> 01:31:58,600
terrestrial or non-terrestrial.

2384
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,020
And archaic

2385
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:03,120
phoenix phenomenon is quite

2386
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:05,160
interesting, just the notion that

2387
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,080
there is some wipe

2388
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:09,120
of the slate that happens every

2389
01:32:09,120 --> 01:32:10,280
so often from

2390
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,980
some higher plane, whether it's

2391
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:14,340
technological or not.

2392
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,820
I assure you it's technological.

2393
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:18,420
I assure you it is.

2394
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:20,100
Just like magic,

2395
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:22,260
I assure you magic is technological.

2396
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:24,140
All magic, not some of it.

2397
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,140
So, is this reality itself

2398
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:28,660
some kind of container, Truman show,

2399
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:30,280
terrarium for humanity?

2400
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,520
Absolutely, and you will witness

2401
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:34,580
that if you just look at the cross-section

2402
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:35,620
of a human body.

2403
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:38,580
If the intestines, they tell you food is absorbed,

2404
01:32:38,680 --> 01:32:40,320
nutrition is absorbed through the intestines,

2405
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:41,840
look at a cross-section. How?

2406
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,460
Do a cross-section of a firestone

2407
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:45,440
steel-belted radial.

2408
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,680
The intestines and the steel-belted

2409
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,360
radial tire are both designed so there is no

2410
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:51,620
interaction between what's inside and outside.

2411
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:53,420
So how are you getting

2412
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:55,060
nutrition out of food? By induction.

2413
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:56,500
What is induction?

2414
01:32:57,180 --> 01:32:59,460
Right? Like Wi-Fi, right?

2415
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,260
Induction stove. So everything is

2416
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:03,420
energetic transfer. It goes from

2417
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:05,380
energy to matter. And it goes

2418
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:07,400
from energy, let's say, to a gas, to a liquid,

2419
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,420
to a solid. And then backwards.

2420
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:10,440
The solid becomes

2421
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:12,920
liquid to a gas to energy.

2422
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:15,060
So when you have food in your intestine,

2423
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:17,160
the solid food goes to

2424
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:19,340
liquid, which goes to a gas,

2425
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:21,000
which goes to energy through the intestine.

2426
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:23,140
Well, by induction, it appears on the other side

2427
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:25,260
inside the body. It's amazing.

2428
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:26,960
So it's all energetic.

2429
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Right? If you were watching

2430
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,540
a film, a two-hour movie that was 100%

2431
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:32,560
computer-generated,

2432
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:35,080
and it was the top, top-notch computer

2433
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:37,220
generation, it looks pretty

2434
01:33:37,220 --> 01:33:39,180
real to you, doesn't it? But it's all

2435
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:40,720
been generated from what? Just

2436
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:42,100
code.

2437
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:44,780
So we're actually functioning on

2438
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:46,560
code. Oh, Philip K. Dick

2439
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:48,760
did a speech in France in 1977.

2440
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,760
Almost very similar to this.

2441
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:52,780
I don't know if you're familiar with it.

2442
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,160
Philip K. Dick, the author.

2443
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:56,780
I'm aware of Philip K. Dick, but I'm not

2444
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:58,740
sure of which piece of his you're referencing.

2445
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:00,420
There's a 1977

2446
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:01,860
interview he did in France.

2447
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:04,580
Talks about how we're living in code,

2448
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:06,760
and you ever walk into a room

2449
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:08,700
and think the light switch is here, and suddenly it's on

2450
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:10,420
the other side of the wall? How did that happen?

2451
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:12,620
Mandela effect kind of idea.

2452
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:14,720
In the code, there's an arch

2453
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:16,760
designer, and then he has

2454
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:18,180
someone that is contrary,

2455
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:20,040
sort of like the Matrix.

2456
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:22,560
Charles Ford said something similar.

2457
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:24,780
Charles Ford would say that we are

2458
01:34:24,780 --> 01:34:26,740
property of something of a

2459
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:28,740
higher nature that we

2460
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:30,760
barely even understand, we rarely even

2461
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,900
see. Yes. In order for something

2462
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:34,740
to be property, only the creator can

2463
01:34:34,740 --> 01:34:36,820
call it property unless he transfers that

2464
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:37,200
right.

2465
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:40,800
When you say something is yours, you can

2466
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,800
transfer that right. You actually do

2467
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:44,900
when you have children with a birth certificate, but anyway.

2468
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:46,780
You can transfer

2469
01:34:46,780 --> 01:34:48,800
that right. If you don't transfer that right, you hold on

2470
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,580
to it, it's a property of the creator.

2471
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:52,280
When you create something, it's yours.

2472
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:55,000
Unless you transfer it through a sale.

2473
01:34:55,120 --> 01:34:56,760
That's why I keep saying the universe is

2474
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:58,840
commercial. You ever hear of something

2475
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:00,640
called redemption in religion?

2476
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:02,660
That's a commercial term.

2477
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:06,180
The 30 pieces of silver,

2478
01:35:06,180 --> 01:35:07,200
right?

2479
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:09,820
Anyway, it's all commercial.

2480
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,420
How do we find the edges

2481
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:14,080
of the container?

2482
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:16,200
Going back to that Freemasonic

2483
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:18,220
idea of the ladder to

2484
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:20,120
the window in the sky,

2485
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:22,220
which is kind of like a way to represent

2486
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:24,060
getting outside of the

2487
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:26,360
artificial construct. Is there

2488
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:28,340
a mechanism or a way to

2489
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:30,380
get beyond it or at least see

2490
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:32,060
beyond it or project our conscious

2491
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:33,260
awareness beyond it?

2492
01:35:33,260 --> 01:35:35,100
I think the latter can

2493
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:36,960
happen, but now you want to be like the

2494
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,080
crazy fish that's trying to tell all the other fish

2495
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:41,080
that all the fish are really in water and they don't

2496
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:41,460
see it.

2497
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:45,020
We might get outside of it and then cease

2498
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:45,720
to exist.

2499
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,780
It'll be so rough that

2500
01:35:48,780 --> 01:35:50,820
I've spoken to people that have gone

2501
01:35:50,820 --> 01:35:53,000
high altitude, halo, high altitude, low

2502
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,020
orbit, and they're like

2503
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:56,880
no, it's nothing like you've been shown.

2504
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:59,040
That's interesting to me. Do they see

2505
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:00,040
curvature up there?

2506
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:02,040
Yes and no.

2507
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:03,640
You don't see the sun.

2508
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:05,460
You only see it through the atmosphere.

2509
01:36:06,580 --> 01:36:08,140
Things get very, very strange.

2510
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,000
Have you heard about the cosmonauts that were

2511
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:10,700
sent up there?

2512
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:14,240
People who have really gone up there

2513
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:16,160
have to be sequestered for days and days because

2514
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:18,280
of the voices in their heads and all the dead people

2515
01:36:18,820 --> 01:36:19,920
that they met up there.

2516
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:21,360
Have you heard of that?

2517
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:23,900
I've heard the cliff notes, but elaborate

2518
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:26,080
on that for people listening to the parts that you

2519
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:26,780
found interesting.

2520
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:28,420
That's about it.

2521
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,080
The dead people, right?

2522
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:32,440
I don't know much more about it.

2523
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,620
There's a guy named John Rapoport who talked about that

2524
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:35,280
a while back.

2525
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,800
You don't see the sun

2526
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:42,780
when you get beyond the atmosphere.

2527
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,020
That's an interesting concept.

2528
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:46,800
Just like if you have a

2529
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,780
flashlight in the dark, you don't see the beam.

2530
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:50,100
You only see what it shines on.

2531
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,080
The sun is like an induction.

2532
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:54,820
When you have an induction stovetop,

2533
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:56,120
the glass top, the water

2534
01:36:57,180 --> 01:36:58,940
boiling, you move it, you put your hand on there,

2535
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,780
there's nothing, you put the pot back on there,

2536
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:03,080
it starts boiling again. You need the atmosphere.

2537
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:04,900
Do you ever notice how the sun

2538
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:07,000
changes color depending on where it is and size

2539
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:07,920
where it is in the sky?

2540
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:10,720
If you were to remove some of the atmosphere

2541
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:12,780
where the sun is, it would just look black.

2542
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:14,620
You won't see the sun in a vacuum.

2543
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:16,320
It needs a medium.

2544
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:17,880
Exactly.

2545
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,340
The eye is not enough of a medium.

2546
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:22,140
It has to appear outside of the eye.

2547
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:24,640
Eric P. Dollard talked about this

2548
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:25,440
on some of his

2549
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:27,760
decade ago videos.

2550
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,120
We don't know what the sun is, but it definitely

2551
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:31,480
works by induction.

2552
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,160
Eric Dollard is a trip.

2553
01:37:34,280 --> 01:37:36,180
I've had the pleasure of interviewing him a couple

2554
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:38,240
of times. He's quite a character.

2555
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:39,720
Somewhat difficult to interview.

2556
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,320
Sometimes I miss things

2557
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:44,000
that he might have said that are pretty insightful.

2558
01:37:44,620 --> 01:37:46,280
Some of the best interviews should be

2559
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:46,940
difficult, correct?

2560
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:48,400
Fair enough.

2561
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:52,440
I'm really

2562
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:54,580
interested in insights from people

2563
01:37:54,580 --> 01:37:56,660
who've gotten a little bit outside the game.

2564
01:37:56,840 --> 01:37:58,420
When you listen to the

2565
01:37:58,420 --> 01:38:00,480
astronauts talking at the

2566
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:02,600
press conference post-Apollo missions,

2567
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,440
if there even was anything to

2568
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:06,500
that at all, they seem like

2569
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:08,460
they're in a trance. You ask them

2570
01:38:08,460 --> 01:38:10,440
simple questions. What did

2571
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:12,460
the stars look like? They look at

2572
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:14,600
each other like, what am I supposed to say

2573
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:16,440
to this question? It's just a simple question.

2574
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:18,640
What did the stars look like to you

2575
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,700
from the moon? I can't remember

2576
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:22,500
if I saw them. That's an

2577
01:38:22,500 --> 01:38:23,340
odd thing to say.

2578
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:26,460
This recurs over

2579
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:28,240
and over. The Kennedy

2580
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:30,440
assassination, any official

2581
01:38:30,440 --> 01:38:32,120
talking about what happened on

2582
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:34,040
the World Trade Center on 9-11,

2583
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:36,440
same reaction. Just study

2584
01:38:36,440 --> 01:38:37,680
the psychological reactions.

2585
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:40,400
There's something that they know. They don't get

2586
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,320
the whole picture, but this is what they're

2587
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,200
told they should say. You get that same

2588
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,880
reaction that the astronauts did.

2589
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:48,140
They were on a stage with an audience, I believe.

2590
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:49,660
That's what you're referring to, the astronauts.

2591
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:52,160
They all look like their dog and their

2592
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:53,780
mom died and their wife left them.

2593
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:55,340
Really bad news.

2594
01:38:55,820 --> 01:38:58,240
They didn't seem like

2595
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:00,040
they were happy that they

2596
01:39:00,040 --> 01:39:02,160
just did this monumental thing that

2597
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:04,160
you would think would be a major life achievement.

2598
01:39:04,300 --> 01:39:06,180
They looked like they were in the principal's office

2599
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:07,760
being punished.

2600
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:10,340
They were. Yes, exactly like

2601
01:39:10,340 --> 01:39:12,140
that. One of the worst things that

2602
01:39:12,140 --> 01:39:13,920
the elite can have is people develop

2603
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,440
their maturity.

2604
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:17,940
What people mistake is that

2605
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:19,920
when you see someone, you know, adolescent,

2606
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,960
adult, 50s, 60s, or 70s, they think,

2607
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:23,760
oh, they're grown-ups. They call them adults.

2608
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:25,620
I'm telling you, I could prove that

2609
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:27,960
99.9999% of the people that

2610
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:29,820
you'll ever see or meet have not

2611
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:31,840
matured beyond 9 or 12 years old.

2612
01:39:32,600 --> 01:39:33,920
When you gave that principal

2613
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,940
analogy, you can take

2614
01:39:35,940 --> 01:39:37,880
a 75-year-old and talk to him like he's

2615
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:40,080
a 9-year-old and he'll behave just like

2616
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:41,560
a 9-year-old.

2617
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:43,880
Yeah, I believe that.

2618
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:46,000
Watch the news. Watch the mainstream

2619
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,140
news. Are they speaking to adults

2620
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:49,300
or speaking to children?

2621
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:51,940
Yeah, it seems like they're speaking to children

2622
01:39:51,940 --> 01:39:54,300
for sure. The Archon

2623
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:54,960
mentioned

2624
01:39:56,220 --> 01:39:58,180
the relationship, or at least

2625
01:39:58,180 --> 01:39:59,580
looking at corporate

2626
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:01,860
logos and the names of

2627
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:04,440
corporations, and they can often be

2628
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:05,980
esoteric or relate

2629
01:40:05,980 --> 01:40:07,500
to the gods.

2630
01:40:08,180 --> 01:40:09,460
Is there a mechanism

2631
01:40:09,460 --> 01:40:11,540
there where a person, if

2632
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:13,680
they wanted to be an entrepreneur and start

2633
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:15,720
a company, might get some extra

2634
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:17,500
energetic juice by naming

2635
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,660
it after a god? Yeah, definitely.

2636
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:20,420
Ask the Archon.

2637
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:22,420
What do you think, Archon?

2638
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:25,440
I think that these things belong

2639
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,340
to their own secret art that's

2640
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:28,480
hard to parse.

2641
01:40:29,380 --> 01:40:31,320
I would imagine that if you asked the CEO of

2642
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:33,340
Nike why he named his corporation after

2643
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:35,540
a Greek goddess, he would just shrug off

2644
01:40:35,540 --> 01:40:37,360
the notion or just say that he

2645
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:37,960
did it on a whim.

2646
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:41,380
It's either that certain people are

2647
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:43,380
inspired externally from places

2648
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:45,140
that they don't know where

2649
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:47,240
and are just being puppeted into doing certain

2650
01:40:47,240 --> 01:40:49,300
things, because then those

2651
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:50,900
corporations can act as

2652
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:51,860
some type of

2653
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,240
manifestation or testament

2654
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:56,940
to the existence of the supernatural,

2655
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,300
or those people are just plugged

2656
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:00,860
into their own secret societies

2657
01:41:00,860 --> 01:41:03,540
and networks and are acting on the

2658
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:05,260
basis of the imperatives that are given there.

2659
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:06,720
It's hard to say.

2660
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:09,260
I don't think that if I started a corporation

2661
01:41:09,260 --> 01:41:11,280
today and named it after a deity, that

2662
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:13,060
that necessarily gives it juice, because

2663
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:14,680
realistically, I don't serve the deity.

2664
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:17,420
I would imagine

2665
01:41:17,420 --> 01:41:19,200
that either that would come

2666
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:20,680
to a point of failure

2667
01:41:21,540 --> 01:41:23,460
or I would come to a crossroads

2668
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:25,440
where perhaps I would have to make a decision

2669
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,280
whether I want to pledge allegiance to this thing that

2670
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:29,160
I profess or not. Greg,

2671
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:31,260
I'd like to give a handy-dandy tip for all the

2672
01:41:31,260 --> 01:41:33,380
listeners. It'll just take a minute or so

2673
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:34,980
regarding corporates and sigils,

2674
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:37,240
if you would. This is super practical,

2675
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:39,420
right? It's as practical as

2676
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:41,340
if you drive a car, what's the best windshield

2677
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:43,100
wiper, right? Trivial but

2678
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:43,940
practical, okay?

2679
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,160
They have these things called corporate logos, and pretty

2680
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:49,180
much if you go to the shops and buy grocery

2681
01:41:49,180 --> 01:41:51,100
shopping, things you eat, or things you

2682
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:53,020
cleaning products, or whatever,

2683
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:55,240
even labels on cars and devices,

2684
01:41:56,100 --> 01:41:57,200
corporate logos, they all

2685
01:41:57,200 --> 01:41:59,400
try to be distinct to each other. What I'm suggesting

2686
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:01,080
is that these are sigils, like fractals,

2687
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:03,040
antennas that are constantly broadcasting

2688
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:05,040
a mal-intent from these corporations,

2689
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:06,020
like curses.

2690
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:08,820
I've done this experiment several times.

2691
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:11,060
A total NPC person that worked for an

2692
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:13,100
aircraft company that designs weapons

2693
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:15,140
and things, she had no clue. She didn't want to hear

2694
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:17,120
anything about, if it wasn't on CNN or

2695
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:19,220
Fox News or whatever, did not exist,

2696
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:20,620
right? Or if her doctor didn't tell her.

2697
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:23,120
She had all these physical maladies they couldn't

2698
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:25,200
figure out. By the way, when doctors

2699
01:42:25,660 --> 01:42:26,820
can't figure out what's wrong, they say,

2700
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:28,820
you have an unknown virus and they chalk you off with

2701
01:42:29,540 --> 01:42:30,600
painkillers and antibiotics,

2702
01:42:30,940 --> 01:42:32,800
right? So someone said, Greek, why don't you

2703
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,860
go do this experiment with her? So I said to her,

2704
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:36,720
can I go through your house,

2705
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:38,820
everything in your house, if there's anything private

2706
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:40,600
go and remove it right now, otherwise

2707
01:42:40,600 --> 01:42:42,780
give me permission to go through everything in your

2708
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:44,780
house. She says, yes. So what I did

2709
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:46,780
was I had one of those big fat graffiti

2710
01:42:46,780 --> 01:42:48,960
markers, the felt pens, they're about an inch wide,

2711
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,160
right, for tagging.

2712
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:52,680
I went through every product she had,

2713
01:42:52,700 --> 01:42:54,180
everywhere in her house, and I

2714
01:42:54,180 --> 01:42:56,240
struck through the corporate logo,

2715
01:42:56,360 --> 01:42:57,740
Arm & Hammer baking soda,

2716
01:42:58,180 --> 01:43:00,200
soap, everything. The blender,

2717
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:02,260
it said Oster. I just put a line through

2718
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:03,300
it, blocked it out.

2719
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:05,940
Walked into the house. How does it feel?

2720
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:08,160
I don't know, but it does feel

2721
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:10,100
better. Guess what? Within a few days,

2722
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:12,240
her ailments started going away. It doesn't work

2723
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:13,820
with everyone, but it does work.

2724
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:15,940
I've had some very sensitive,

2725
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:18,140
do you hear of sensitives? You know, like, oh, I'm

2726
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:20,040
sensitive, I'm psychic, I'm whatever.

2727
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,780
Done the same thing to their home

2728
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:23,620
and they walked in and

2729
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:25,840
I got a phone call from them. They were crying.

2730
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:27,820
They were like, my house feels so good. People come over.

2731
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:29,720
I don't know. I said, I noticed you put some

2732
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:31,600
marks through the things here. I said, that's

2733
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:33,140
exactly it. I explained it.

2734
01:43:33,740 --> 01:43:35,820
Inside the stupid rectangle, cell phones

2735
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:37,840
and things, you have something called a fractal antenna.

2736
01:43:38,620 --> 01:43:39,960
They're kind of like snowflakes,

2737
01:43:40,060 --> 01:43:41,660
some of them, interesting to look at.

2738
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:43,920
These sigils, what I'm suggesting

2739
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:45,700
and have indirectly proven,

2740
01:43:46,100 --> 01:43:47,760
these corporate logos, now let

2741
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,900
me ask you this. Is design

2742
01:43:49,900 --> 01:43:51,960
of a corporate logo a trivial thing or do you think

2743
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:54,000
a tremendous amount of attention goes into

2744
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,080
it? I think attention goes into it,

2745
01:43:56,120 --> 01:43:57,900
yes. Yeah, yeah. Why? Because it's

2746
01:43:57,900 --> 01:43:59,660
constantly broadcasting curses.

2747
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:01,980
When I say curses, use that

2748
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:04,100
word however you want to use it conservatively

2749
01:44:04,100 --> 01:44:06,080
or loosely. They hate you, in other words.

2750
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:07,980
So, how do they get to

2751
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:10,100
you? The way that you will never figure out.

2752
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:11,940
So, just

2753
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:13,880
go ahead and put a piece

2754
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:15,780
of black electrical tape, felt tip

2755
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:17,960
marker, cut it out, and

2756
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:19,540
notice how the environment changes.

2757
01:44:20,060 --> 01:44:21,940
Yeah. That's the handy dandy tip.

2758
01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:23,940
I'm looking around and I'm

2759
01:44:23,940 --> 01:44:25,960
on an Apple computer

2760
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:28,060
with a Logitech

2761
01:44:28,060 --> 01:44:29,840
webcam. Logi

2762
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:31,840
is like the logos. I'm

2763
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:33,360
talking through an Apollo

2764
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:35,840
twin universal audio interface

2765
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,920
and it's all around us

2766
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:39,520
and I just think like... Yeah, just cover it.

2767
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:41,720
Well, yeah. In this instance,

2768
01:44:41,860 --> 01:44:43,260
I should and could, but

2769
01:44:43,260 --> 01:44:45,400
I think about a person who

2770
01:44:45,400 --> 01:44:47,260
wants to use this to

2771
01:44:47,260 --> 01:44:49,500
their benefit without going evil

2772
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:51,500
necessarily. They don't have to

2773
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:53,560
align themselves with dark gods

2774
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:55,600
as the Archons said

2775
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,440
when you ask a person

2776
01:44:57,440 --> 01:44:59,320
why they named their company Nike, they'd

2777
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:01,020
say, well, it was just arbitrary.

2778
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,480
Well, is that just what they're telling the public

2779
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:05,340
for public consumption or were

2780
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:07,320
they puppeted? And if they were puppeted,

2781
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:09,460
it doesn't seem so bad

2782
01:45:09,460 --> 01:45:11,200
to be puppeted by the right entity

2783
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:13,360
if you can kind of ride

2784
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:15,200
them like a barnacle on a whale to

2785
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:17,460
a successful promised land

2786
01:45:17,460 --> 01:45:19,400
to a good flourishing

2787
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:21,160
life. And I think about

2788
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:23,400
this show, for example. I called

2789
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:25,500
it the Higher Side Chats. What if I had called

2790
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:26,780
it the Apollo Hour?

2791
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:29,220
Where would I be now? Or

2792
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:31,480
there's other people I've spoken to

2793
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:33,340
who would say that the creation

2794
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:35,420
of the show and the generation of energy

2795
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:37,140
creates an egregore out there

2796
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:39,120
and now it is its own thing

2797
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:41,320
and it is a thought form that

2798
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:43,320
people tap into and that you can create

2799
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:45,440
endless thought forms in the abyss.

2800
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:46,800
You don't have to necessarily

2801
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:49,360
name it after something that is already

2802
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:51,580
established. What do you think about the dynamics

2803
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:51,920
there?

2804
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:54,980
I think you've answered it as well as

2805
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:57,280
within the question as a statement, a statement as

2806
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:59,460
a question. I'll give you an example in terms

2807
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:01,380
of nature of reality.

2808
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:03,140
You know, science and scientists cannot

2809
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:05,260
explain when you face two mirrors together why

2810
01:46:05,260 --> 01:46:06,980
you get that infinity image happening.

2811
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:09,520
And you know how you've heard people

2812
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:11,720
in certain Judaic practices, when they

2813
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:13,500
did certain prayers on certain holy days,

2814
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,720
they would cover all the mirrors because they're supposedly

2815
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:16,760
like portals, right?

2816
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:19,540
So you can take these various

2817
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:21,700
simple aspects and move them

2818
01:46:21,700 --> 01:46:23,520
forward however your

2819
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:24,920
imagination allows you.

2820
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:27,600
And your education, by the way, because you must

2821
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:29,640
be educated and that

2822
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:31,140
doesn't mean going to school

2823
01:46:31,140 --> 01:46:32,800
unless you're a fish, of course.

2824
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:34,340
Then you have no choice.

2825
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:37,400
So another thing I think about

2826
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,300
with the elite and the

2827
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:41,000
billionaire class and the CEOs

2828
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,420
and this dynamic with

2829
01:46:43,420 --> 01:46:45,580
the gods and the gods wanting

2830
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:46,260
attention

2831
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:49,360
and the elite secret

2832
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:51,440
religion tends

2833
01:46:51,440 --> 01:46:53,600
to suggest that they get

2834
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,520
benefits in this life

2835
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:57,400
from honoring certain gods

2836
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:59,220
that aren't really even in the

2837
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:01,240
public sphere of consciousness at all.

2838
01:47:01,700 --> 01:47:03,140
If the gods really want

2839
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:05,300
attention, I would almost

2840
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:07,360
think that by their

2841
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:09,180
logic they would punish the elite

2842
01:47:09,180 --> 01:47:11,080
for denying the masses

2843
01:47:12,640 --> 01:47:13,360
knowledge of

2844
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,440
them and thus an energy generation

2845
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:16,440
that could be much greater.

2846
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:19,480
Yes, that does. I believe that happens as well.

2847
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:21,420
Just, I don't know how to

2848
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:23,040
drill this in the mind of everyone,

2849
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:25,120
but there aren't just a few gods.

2850
01:47:26,020 --> 01:47:27,480
There might be more gods

2851
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:29,300
than there are people. I would think

2852
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:31,340
so. I would say, yeah, almost infinite.

2853
01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:32,980
Yeah, so how many

2854
01:47:32,980 --> 01:47:34,860
variety of combinations

2855
01:47:34,860 --> 01:47:36,960
of attitudes and behaviors can you have with all

2856
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:38,160
the people on earth, right?

2857
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:41,060
I know in statistics, if you just have 20

2858
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:43,140
objects, that could be thousands of combinations,

2859
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:45,160
right? So yes,

2860
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:46,880
I think all of that, basically,

2861
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:49,080
the maxim that I use is

2862
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:50,960
the law comes from your god and law doesn't

2863
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:52,980
mean taxes and traffic law. It can mean that

2864
01:47:52,980 --> 01:47:54,420
as well. And

2865
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:57,020
if you want to get into that subject, just like

2866
01:47:57,020 --> 01:47:59,020
any subject, you're going to have to study a little

2867
01:47:59,020 --> 01:48:01,060
bit. I think I

2868
01:48:01,060 --> 01:48:02,980
brought up the analogy recently with

2869
01:48:02,980 --> 01:48:04,020
the plandemic,

2870
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:07,000
what knowledge does. I might

2871
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,640
have given this analogy before.

2872
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:11,120
Nurses set up a table to give people

2873
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:12,900
the shot. And I was with someone who was

2874
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:14,880
one of these anti-vaxxers and was yelling at

2875
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:17,020
the nurses, right? And what did they do,

2876
01:48:17,140 --> 01:48:18,940
the nurses? They laughed at him. You know, you're one

2877
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:20,780
of these crazy loose wingnuts that

2878
01:48:20,780 --> 01:48:22,300
wants people to die from disease.

2879
01:48:22,540 --> 01:48:24,600
Well, I go up to the nurse and I said, well,

2880
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:26,920
before you perform the

2881
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:29,040
injection, do you take in consideration

2882
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:31,280
the age, body weight, and blood type

2883
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,760
of who you're giving it to?

2884
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:34,720
Because that's according to the NIH study.

2885
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:37,140
She looked at me in panic, and the other

2886
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:39,080
nurses, the younger ones, wanted to also make

2887
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:40,680
fun of me. And she says, no, we have to go.

2888
01:48:40,860 --> 01:48:42,580
And they packed up everything and left.

2889
01:48:43,460 --> 01:48:44,920
So which one was more effective,

2890
01:48:45,020 --> 01:48:47,340
the protest or the actual

2891
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:49,140
this is what you're supposed to be

2892
01:48:49,140 --> 01:48:50,780
doing, right?

2893
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:52,020
The latter.

2894
01:48:53,300 --> 01:48:55,120
Any religious quote-unquote person,

2895
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:57,180
this is what I find with most Christians,

2896
01:48:57,180 --> 01:48:59,160
if I show them, let's say, you go by the Bible.

2897
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:01,040
Yeah. So I show them what they're doing is

2898
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:03,020
absolutely contrary. I say, well, I don't need the Bible.

2899
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:05,460
I could believe without that. So where are you getting your information?

2900
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:07,300
Just making it up

2901
01:49:07,300 --> 01:49:07,820
as we go.

2902
01:49:08,780 --> 01:49:09,780
Same with scientists.

2903
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:12,960
Well, this has been really

2904
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:14,940
super fascinating. We're obviously getting

2905
01:49:14,940 --> 01:49:16,780
close to the end of the road.

2906
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:18,980
And I just want to ask again, maybe,

2907
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:21,040
how people who are listening can

2908
01:49:21,040 --> 01:49:22,480
use this information

2909
01:49:23,640 --> 01:49:25,260
if they have this context.

2910
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:26,960
We see a relationship with

2911
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,380
corporations and the elite

2912
01:49:29,380 --> 01:49:30,620
with the gods,

2913
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:33,220
and we know there might be something there,

2914
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:34,680
but yet we haven't really

2915
01:49:35,100 --> 01:49:37,160
been able to identify a certain

2916
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:38,860
god that we think would benefit us.

2917
01:49:38,940 --> 01:49:40,760
Maybe there is really no

2918
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:43,120
sense in doing that because the god

2919
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:45,040
doesn't care, though they do want our attention.

2920
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:47,300
So it starts to get a little hairy

2921
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:48,920
as to how this information

2922
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:51,260
can be used. We can avoid the false

2923
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:53,240
paradigms, but how do we take

2924
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:55,000
advantage of the correct paradigm

2925
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:55,780
for ourselves?

2926
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:59,220
Oh, wow. I can't answer that directly.

2927
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:01,200
I'm not going to confabulate.

2928
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:02,480
I can't answer that directly.

2929
01:50:02,820 --> 01:50:05,020
It's a matter of choice, and it's a matter of what degree

2930
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:07,100
of time and effort you want to

2931
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:09,280
dedicate to educate yourself on any

2932
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:11,420
matter, especially this one.

2933
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:12,840
Fair. Well, you have

2934
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:15,120
found value in Yahweh

2935
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:17,200
and making that your chief god,

2936
01:50:17,380 --> 01:50:19,180
and I'd assume there's a logic

2937
01:50:19,180 --> 01:50:21,100
as to why you did that compared

2938
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:22,740
to others, and you mentioned the laws.

2939
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:25,080
But when a person's trying to make that

2940
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:26,440
decision for themselves,

2941
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:29,120
where would you, I guess, advise them to

2942
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,860
start that

2943
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:32,900
seeking process? Simple.

2944
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:35,060
The value of any god to me is what they're

2945
01:50:35,060 --> 01:50:37,040
transmitting to you in terms of what to do

2946
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:39,020
as a human. I'm oversimplifying that

2947
01:50:39,020 --> 01:50:40,800
statement, paraphrasing that statement.

2948
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:43,300
So I would suggest to do what I did,

2949
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:44,600
not because I did it,

2950
01:50:44,840 --> 01:50:46,820
and being egocentric or anything, but

2951
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:49,020
when I was telling people the Bible was

2952
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:51,080
written by Shakespeare, that was, I don't know,

2953
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:52,560
something I heard and was repeating.

2954
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:55,040
How can I knock a movie I haven't seen, right?

2955
01:50:55,820 --> 01:50:57,000
And I know a bad, if I

2956
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:58,880
can't go more than 15 minutes into a film,

2957
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:00,980
I'm not going to watch the rest. I won't say it's a

2958
01:51:00,980 --> 01:51:02,820
bad film, I'll just say I couldn't watch more than

2959
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:05,020
15 minutes, right? Same thing

2960
01:51:05,020 --> 01:51:07,020
with the Bible. Just go find out

2961
01:51:07,020 --> 01:51:09,000
where the laws, what you could be

2962
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,720
doing, what's considered lawful

2963
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:13,120
or set apart, and

2964
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:15,060
see if that jives with you, because

2965
01:51:15,060 --> 01:51:16,440
there is a certain jive.

2966
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:18,200
People ask,

2967
01:51:18,420 --> 01:51:20,500
what's your favorite color? Does it have

2968
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:22,500
to be blue for everyone? No.

2969
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:23,640
You see?

2970
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:26,440
If it jives with you, guess what?

2971
01:51:27,020 --> 01:51:27,620
Have fun.

2972
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:30,640
I'm having a lot of fun and had a lot of fun with it.

2973
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:32,700
Fair. Well, let me ask the Archon

2974
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:33,820
before we go.

2975
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:36,040
Have you incorporated this

2976
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:38,380
information and distilled it down

2977
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:40,140
into a personal relationship

2978
01:51:40,140 --> 01:51:42,700
with some kind of god or gods

2979
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:44,220
or chief god, or

2980
01:51:44,220 --> 01:51:46,280
just use this in the way that

2981
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:48,160
you've decided to live your life?

2982
01:51:49,340 --> 01:51:50,040
Well, I'm still

2983
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:51,520
in the process of

2984
01:51:52,170 --> 01:51:54,380
coming to the ultimate realization

2985
01:51:54,380 --> 01:51:56,240
of which direction to go in.

2986
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:58,280
I've found that there's

2987
01:51:58,280 --> 01:52:00,280
not much benefit to be had in rushing these

2988
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:02,360
things and trying to adopt

2989
01:52:02,360 --> 01:52:04,240
the nearest truth

2990
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:06,200
to you, because truth

2991
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:08,180
often comes in puzzle pieces anyway.

2992
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:10,280
I would much rather have

2993
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:12,180
a more complete assemblage of pieces

2994
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:14,320
come together so that I can make

2995
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:16,240
those choices with a sort of

2996
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:17,260
calm mind.

2997
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:20,260
I have found that what I've learned through

2998
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:22,300
Godspeak and from speaking with the

2999
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:24,240
Greek largely does

3000
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:26,260
conform to the closest truth

3001
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:28,220
that I have at the moment, but I also know that

3002
01:52:28,220 --> 01:52:30,040
there's levels above that, and

3003
01:52:30,040 --> 01:52:32,180
I'm sort of still doing my own

3004
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:33,660
strivings to get to those places.

3005
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:36,280
But the primacy of the biblical text

3006
01:52:36,280 --> 01:52:38,240
as something that should be studied

3007
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:40,040
and should be contemplated, for me, has

3008
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:41,120
become self-evident.

3009
01:52:41,940 --> 01:52:43,580
I don't think it's a coincidence that

3010
01:52:43,580 --> 01:52:45,980
the Christian religion, even though it's

3011
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:48,300
mostly based on fallacy

3012
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:50,020
and improper translation of the

3013
01:52:50,020 --> 01:52:52,200
source documents, has ultimately ruled

3014
01:52:52,200 --> 01:52:53,980
over the major

3015
01:52:53,980 --> 01:52:56,100
power bases of the world for the last 2,000

3016
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:57,580
years, and I don't think that's by coincidence.

3017
01:52:58,260 --> 01:52:59,720
I also don't think it's a coincidence that

3018
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:01,580
Islam takes a lot of its

3019
01:53:01,580 --> 01:53:03,760
genesis from the Old Testament

3020
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:06,180
and sort of goes in its own direction with it.

3021
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:08,060
And those are obviously the two

3022
01:53:08,060 --> 01:53:09,180
biggest religions, so

3023
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:12,100
there's a lot of anecdotal evidence that speaks for

3024
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:14,300
that being something that people should consider.

3025
01:53:14,580 --> 01:53:16,060
I consider it quite heavily.

3026
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:18,140
But then you also have to build your

3027
01:53:18,140 --> 01:53:19,920
understanding out from that, and

3028
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:20,960
I'm in the process still.

3029
01:53:22,020 --> 01:53:23,980
It's hard to understand the logic and

3030
01:53:23,980 --> 01:53:26,340
all the rules and understand where

3031
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:27,900
the thing might have been

3032
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:30,100
mistranslated and if that's even

3033
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:32,000
what they meant with certain things,

3034
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:34,220
but I agree that there's something

3035
01:53:34,220 --> 01:53:36,380
interesting about its potency

3036
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:38,320
given all the different things

3037
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:40,520
that have been written and all the people who have lived

3038
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:42,180
in the different eras, that it still

3039
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:44,100
has so much

3040
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:46,260
energy behind it.

3041
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:48,240
Yeah, that is in itself interesting

3042
01:53:48,240 --> 01:53:50,520
for sure. And it sounds like

3043
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:52,160
you're still waiting to be courted

3044
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:54,480
for the big dance by some god.

3045
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:56,460
I put myself in that category

3046
01:53:56,460 --> 01:53:58,200
as well, and maybe

3047
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:00,520
we are our own god, some people

3048
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:00,900
say.

3049
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:04,380
Well, I mean, the structure of the human story

3050
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:06,300
regardless of where you go, whether

3051
01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:08,180
it's Mesopotamian traditions or

3052
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:10,160
mainstream religion or whatever, generally

3053
01:54:10,160 --> 01:54:12,280
tends to be the same if you really zoom

3054
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:14,300
out really far, that there was

3055
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:16,560
some type of an ideal situation

3056
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:18,380
at the beginning of so-called

3057
01:54:18,380 --> 01:54:20,300
time, or at least the beginning of some

3058
01:54:20,300 --> 01:54:22,260
chronology, and then some cataclysm occurs

3059
01:54:22,260 --> 01:54:24,400
and people fall into this sort of history

3060
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:26,420
of mortality and suffering and limitation,

3061
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:28,240
but there's a mode of being that will

3062
01:54:28,240 --> 01:54:29,640
eventually come to transcend that.

3063
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:31,820
And then ultimately you have to decide

3064
01:54:31,820 --> 01:54:33,760
what blueprint is the most

3065
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:35,820
accurate for delineating

3066
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:37,800
the details within that story, but

3067
01:54:37,800 --> 01:54:39,700
certainly the biblical text is a good starting place.

3068
01:54:40,260 --> 01:54:41,080
Well said.

3069
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:43,620
Right on. Well, again, really

3070
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:46,100
interesting. I appreciate the insights.

3071
01:54:46,620 --> 01:54:47,460
Lots to ponder.

3072
01:54:48,220 --> 01:54:49,840
Is there a next step for you guys

3073
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,620
or any other topics or categories

3074
01:54:51,620 --> 01:54:53,880
you might tackle with a new website

3075
01:54:53,880 --> 01:54:55,880
or links to give people before we call

3076
01:54:55,880 --> 01:54:57,860
it in? Well, I would say that

3077
01:54:57,860 --> 01:54:59,900
Godspeak, you know, was

3078
01:54:59,900 --> 01:55:01,780
a follow-up effort to the Greekspeak website.

3079
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:03,760
Having concluded the

3080
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:05,980
Greekspeak podcast in 2018, I felt that we

3081
01:55:05,980 --> 01:55:08,080
left certain things unexplored.

3082
01:55:08,640 --> 01:55:09,980
You know, themes around religions,

3083
01:55:10,140 --> 01:55:11,140
the supernatural, etc.

3084
01:55:11,820 --> 01:55:13,900
Greekspeak.com wasn't really the right venue

3085
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:15,840
to discuss that, so we did

3086
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:17,740
the Godspeak podcast covering

3087
01:55:17,740 --> 01:55:19,920
a variety of topics. Unfortunately,

3088
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:22,020
we did fall short of the desired

3089
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:23,780
10 episodes, simply because things

3090
01:55:23,780 --> 01:55:25,920
ran out of steam. But in order to

3091
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:27,800
not leave the entire enterprise

3092
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:29,920
hanging, and especially after our last

3093
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,860
appearance on your show, I

3094
01:55:31,860 --> 01:55:33,780
decided to set up a Patreon to

3095
01:55:33,780 --> 01:55:35,960
make available most of the Greeks' past

3096
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:37,840
recordings, not only with Godspeak and

3097
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:39,260
Greekspeak, but also previous

3098
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:41,760
internet radio shows that he was on.

3099
01:55:42,540 --> 01:55:43,840
And so, for people

3100
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:45,960
that have an interest in hearing things

3101
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:47,560
that the Greek has spoken of in the past

3102
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:49,760
and also want to hear what he's talking

3103
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:51,580
about currently in his solo streams,

3104
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:53,620
you can go to patreon.com

3105
01:55:53,620 --> 01:55:56,260
slash Greekspeak with a G-R-E-E-K.

3106
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:58,340
We have a $25 tier

3107
01:55:58,340 --> 01:56:00,300
there where you can get access to both the past

3108
01:56:00,300 --> 01:56:02,200
stuff and the most current ones if you're interested

3109
01:56:02,200 --> 01:56:03,040
to hear more.

3110
01:56:04,240 --> 01:56:06,280
Right on. I like it. I'm sure there will

3111
01:56:06,280 --> 01:56:08,240
be plenty of people who want to

3112
01:56:08,240 --> 01:56:10,140
dive deeper and will

3113
01:56:10,140 --> 01:56:11,680
hop on the Patreon.

3114
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:14,280
And I appreciate your time,

3115
01:56:14,360 --> 01:56:15,780
guys. Greek, any final words?

3116
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:18,320
Oh, no. I just want to thank you for being a very

3117
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:20,460
intelligent host with great questions.

3118
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:22,640
I try. It's hard.

3119
01:56:22,780 --> 01:56:24,060
It's hard, but I'm holding on.

3120
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:26,080
Yeah, I'm ready to

3121
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:28,200
put it down and give my brain a break.

3122
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:30,060
So, thanks, guys. Enjoy the rest

3123
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:31,100
of your day and take care.

3124
01:56:31,780 --> 01:56:32,780
Oh, thank you. It's been a pleasure.

3125
01:56:35,660 --> 01:56:36,100
Praise

3126
01:56:36,100 --> 01:56:37,960
be to ye higher side chatters,

3127
01:56:38,020 --> 01:56:39,780
the return of the Archon

3128
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:41,900
and the Greek. This was a weird

3129
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:42,740
one for me

3130
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:45,760
because it just seemed a little

3131
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,860
difficult to get on the same

3132
01:56:47,860 --> 01:56:50,060
page. You know, I tend

3133
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:52,140
to dig deep into a body of work

3134
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:54,080
and try to extract the best parts

3135
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:55,360
and bring that to you.

3136
01:56:56,080 --> 01:56:58,100
And when I listened to the Godspeak series,

3137
01:56:58,100 --> 01:57:00,340
there were some interesting things in the episodes

3138
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:02,180
about the big three religions, but

3139
01:57:02,180 --> 01:57:04,200
by far my favorite parts

3140
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:06,260
were in the first episode

3141
01:57:06,260 --> 01:57:07,980
after the introduction titled

3142
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:09,300
The Ancient World,

3143
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:12,040
which is described as a discussion

3144
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:14,420
on matters concerning ancient empires,

3145
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:16,180
lost technology, and

3146
01:57:16,180 --> 01:57:17,000
mystery schools.

3147
01:57:17,580 --> 01:57:20,180
Well, I loved it, and I tried to set

3148
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:22,000
the Greek up to get further into

3149
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,280
that material, but I guess I didn't

3150
01:57:24,280 --> 01:57:26,180
realize how long ago that was

3151
01:57:26,180 --> 01:57:28,200
recorded. The Archon told me that

3152
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:30,220
was years ago. But in it

3153
01:57:30,220 --> 01:57:32,080
they talk about the rise and

3154
01:57:32,080 --> 01:57:34,180
fall of empires being united

3155
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:35,500
by a common god,

3156
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:38,440
these powerful spiritual forces

3157
01:57:38,440 --> 01:57:39,980
welling up energy behind

3158
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:42,140
groups of people that pay homage,

3159
01:57:42,940 --> 01:57:44,140
and it really painted

3160
01:57:44,140 --> 01:57:46,020
the gods as, like, the

3161
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:47,800
directors of the human play.

3162
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:49,820
I would go check that out

3163
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:51,720
if you're looking for a little more after

3164
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:52,700
finishing this.

3165
01:57:53,660 --> 01:57:55,600
But it seems like the Greeks' thoughts

3166
01:57:55,600 --> 01:57:57,780
and positions have evolved a bit

3167
01:57:57,780 --> 01:57:59,560
since then, and granted,

3168
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:01,340
when you come out of the gate citing

3169
01:58:01,340 --> 01:58:03,520
archaics, I know we're going deep,

3170
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,620
but we almost worked backwards

3171
01:58:05,620 --> 01:58:07,960
from a deep and wild and unique

3172
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:10,000
place of the gods just being

3173
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,560
ancient humans manipulating

3174
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:12,980
us with technology

3175
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:16,020
to settling on Yahweh

3176
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:18,280
as the Greeks' chief god,

3177
01:58:18,380 --> 01:58:19,940
which I thought was a little

3178
01:58:20,980 --> 01:58:22,180
unexciting. I mean, we want

3179
01:58:22,180 --> 01:58:24,000
the truth, we want people to be honest,

3180
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:25,900
but I also sometimes want that

3181
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:27,540
truth to be

3182
01:58:28,100 --> 01:58:30,180
unexpected, outside the box,

3183
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:31,620
etc., etc.

3184
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:34,300
So the gods being advanced

3185
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:35,340
humans basically

3186
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:38,180
makes the Abrahamic religions cargo

3187
01:58:38,180 --> 01:58:39,500
cults, and I'm into that.

3188
01:58:40,060 --> 01:58:41,920
It didn't take me long to wrap my head

3189
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:43,920
around that unexpected

3190
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:45,400
perspective and go with it.

3191
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:48,060
It's just not exactly what I had prepared

3192
01:58:48,060 --> 01:58:49,960
for. I wanted to get

3193
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:51,940
deeper into understanding the beings on

3194
01:58:51,940 --> 01:58:54,120
the astral plane and their interactions

3195
01:58:54,120 --> 01:58:55,600
on the physical plane.

3196
01:58:56,160 --> 01:58:57,720
Because as the archon

3197
01:58:57,720 --> 01:58:59,740
finally stepped in to say, it's not

3198
01:58:59,740 --> 01:59:01,840
either or. It seems like we're dealing

3199
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:03,900
with both. And that's

3200
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:05,900
where I would get lost at times in

3201
01:59:05,900 --> 01:59:07,780
this. I wouldn't be sure if the Greek

3202
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:09,760
was speaking of ancient humans

3203
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:11,940
on our plane that are using manipulation

3204
01:59:11,940 --> 01:59:13,880
to seem like something greater

3205
01:59:13,880 --> 01:59:15,680
or the literal

3206
01:59:15,680 --> 01:59:18,100
beings who call the astral plane

3207
01:59:18,100 --> 01:59:20,060
home. We seem

3208
01:59:20,060 --> 01:59:21,980
to be bouncing

3209
01:59:21,980 --> 01:59:23,540
back and forth quite a bit.

3210
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:25,880
So, I don't know. Lots of

3211
01:59:25,880 --> 01:59:28,040
interesting threads woven throughout

3212
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:29,900
this, but not

3213
01:59:29,900 --> 01:59:31,560
so much overall

3214
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:33,200
cohesion, I guess.

3215
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:35,920
If you see the video clips from

3216
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:38,000
this episode, you might notice

3217
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,500
that I don't think I've ever

3218
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:41,700
referenced my outline less

3219
01:59:41,700 --> 01:59:43,540
in an interview. I barely

3220
01:59:43,540 --> 01:59:45,020
looked down at it at all,

3221
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:47,520
because it just quickly became irrelevant

3222
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:49,720
and it was clear the direction of the interview

3223
01:59:49,720 --> 01:59:51,480
was pretty far from the direction of the

3224
01:59:51,480 --> 01:59:53,620
outline that I prepared, and that's fine.

3225
01:59:53,860 --> 01:59:55,520
Like, I want to be well prepared,

3226
01:59:55,640 --> 01:59:57,140
but I'm happy to go with the flow.

3227
01:59:57,940 --> 01:59:59,380
I actually talked to

3228
01:59:59,380 --> 02:00:01,040
the archon a bit afterwards

3229
02:00:01,040 --> 02:00:03,140
and mentioned my disappointment

3230
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:04,880
with the Yahweh conclusion,

3231
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:07,120
and he said that he totally

3232
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:09,140
understands why

3233
02:00:09,140 --> 02:00:11,460
I would feel that way, and it's very bittersweet,

3234
02:00:11,580 --> 02:00:13,100
because there is a lot of

3235
02:00:13,100 --> 02:00:15,360
interesting and compelling information

3236
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:16,760
behind the why

3237
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:18,600
in choosing Yahweh

3238
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:20,420
that we didn't really get to,

3239
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,300
and I agree, that is bittersweet,

3240
02:00:23,420 --> 02:00:25,160
but it's alright. It happens.

3241
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:27,140
Of course, we fit everything

3242
02:00:27,140 --> 02:00:29,140
we could into the first hour, but we went

3243
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:31,020
much deeper in the plus show

3244
02:00:31,020 --> 02:00:33,000
for those who like to get the full interviews

3245
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,900
and like to keep me employed.

3246
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:36,960
You miss a lot when you

3247
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:39,000
only hear the first free hour, and there are

3248
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,160
no breaks to sell you therapy sessions

3249
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:42,920
or athletic greens or any

3250
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:44,940
of that stuff, so I try

3251
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:47,100
to keep it action-packed either way.

3252
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:48,880
And this is a tangent, but

3253
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:50,820
I feel better than ever about the

3254
02:00:50,820 --> 02:00:53,000
no ads decision. There are two

3255
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:54,960
big stories right now about agencies

3256
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:56,900
that have screwed over podcasters

3257
02:00:56,900 --> 02:00:59,180
and just kept the money after they read the ads.

3258
02:00:59,740 --> 02:01:01,320
Plus, a lot of these

3259
02:01:01,780 --> 02:01:02,960
products are turning out

3260
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:05,160
to be pretty lackluster,

3261
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:06,960
and podcasters

3262
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:08,920
will read you any ad as long as they

3263
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:10,860
get paid, and to me, that

3264
02:01:10,860 --> 02:01:12,920
erodes the relationship. I don't want

3265
02:01:12,920 --> 02:01:14,400
to abuse our relationship

3266
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:17,240
by just selling you any old thing

3267
02:01:17,880 --> 02:01:18,980
except more of

3268
02:01:18,980 --> 02:01:20,420
the show that you already like.

3269
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:23,260
Manscaped razors, trash,

3270
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:24,920
the lords and ladies

3271
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:26,860
of Ireland buy a square foot

3272
02:01:26,860 --> 02:01:28,900
of land thing. That was exposed as

3273
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:30,900
a scam. And you can go

3274
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:32,960
watch nutritionalists break

3275
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:34,760
down what's in athletic greens

3276
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:36,920
or Prime. It seems like

3277
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:38,880
their claims are wildly over

3278
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:40,520
exaggerated for what they are.

3279
02:01:40,920 --> 02:01:43,040
Foam mattresses? Not that great either.

3280
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:45,020
Yet these podcasters

3281
02:01:45,020 --> 02:01:46,880
will say, I start

3282
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:48,900
every morning with athletic greens and I've

3283
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:49,820
never felt better.

3284
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:52,720
Or, I got a Satva mattress

3285
02:01:52,720 --> 02:01:54,540
and I'm getting the best sleep of my life.

3286
02:01:55,320 --> 02:01:56,680
And these are just lies.

3287
02:01:57,160 --> 02:01:58,680
And there should be some

3288
02:01:58,680 --> 02:02:00,600
consequences. We just roll our eyes

3289
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:02,000
and let it happen, but

3290
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,760
I'm not into that. Blue chews

3291
02:02:04,760 --> 02:02:06,820
and keeps these hair and dick pills.

3292
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:08,660
Who knows what else they do to

3293
02:02:08,660 --> 02:02:09,840
the body over time.

3294
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:12,740
Has any podcaster even thought to

3295
02:02:12,740 --> 02:02:14,560
ask about long-term studies

3296
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:16,580
or side effects before hawking

3297
02:02:16,580 --> 02:02:18,760
this shit to their audience? Or do they just ask

3298
02:02:18,760 --> 02:02:19,840
how much you're going to pay me?

3299
02:02:20,980 --> 02:02:22,780
It seems like most people,

3300
02:02:23,060 --> 02:02:24,560
podcasters and their audiences

3301
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:25,560
just don't care.

3302
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:27,580
They see it as a

3303
02:02:27,580 --> 02:02:29,520
necessary evil, but I'm trying to

3304
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:30,700
prove it's not necessary.

3305
02:02:31,900 --> 02:02:33,620
And to me, integrity is important.

3306
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:35,700
So I think a second-hour

3307
02:02:35,700 --> 02:02:37,680
subscription is the best

3308
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:39,560
monetization method in

3309
02:02:39,560 --> 02:02:41,660
podcasting for the kind of show

3310
02:02:41,660 --> 02:02:42,440
that I do.

3311
02:02:43,260 --> 02:02:45,500

02:02:45,500 --> 02:02:47,620

3319
02:03:00,380 --> 02:03:01,580
Speaking of Patreon, the

3320
02:03:01,580 --> 02:03:03,540
Archon also wanted me to emphasize that

3321
02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:05,580
they have a lot of great content on their

3322
02:03:05,580 --> 02:03:06,740
Patreon as well.

3323
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:09,460
Many years of the Greek dropping

3324
02:03:09,460 --> 02:03:11,640
knowledge on a whole host of topics.

3325
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:13,480
I find them to be a pretty compelling

3326
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:15,620
speaker, and I've added

3327
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:17,680
a link to that if you want more

3328
02:03:17,680 --> 02:03:19,160
from them as well.

3329
02:03:19,600 --> 02:03:21,640
And that said, I'm still very busy

3330
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:23,500
at home, so I'm going to be quick with this,

3331
02:03:23,580 --> 02:03:25,000
but let's look at the meetup calendar.

3332
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:27,740
September 22nd,

3333
02:03:27,740 --> 02:03:29,640
we got a meetup in

3334
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:31,580
Alamosa, Colorado at the Purple

3335
02:03:31,580 --> 02:03:33,760
Pig. Also September

3336
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:35,280
22nd, a PlayStation

3337
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:36,740
Virtual Meetup.

3338
02:03:37,640 --> 02:03:39,260
Interesting. September

3339
02:03:39,260 --> 02:03:41,760
24th, the Hurricane Club

3340
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:44,040
meeting at Made West Brewing

3341
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:45,520
in Ventura, California.

3342
02:03:46,400 --> 02:03:47,460
September 29th,

3343
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:49,480
Two Pitchers Brewing in Oakland.

3344
02:03:50,580 --> 02:03:51,780
September 30th,

3345
02:03:51,980 --> 02:03:53,480
a New Zealand meetup

3346
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:54,120
in Auckland.

3347
02:03:55,300 --> 02:03:57,380
And also September 30th, the

3348
02:03:57,380 --> 02:03:59,560
Columbia, Missouri Twin Lakes

3349
02:03:59,560 --> 02:04:01,700
meetup in conjunction

3350
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:03,420
with the No Agenda listeners.

3351
02:04:04,260 --> 02:04:05,200
Very cool.

3352
02:04:05,320 --> 02:04:07,360
It is a great way to build your network

3353
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:09,520
on the sort of common ground that will

3354
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:11,180
be important going forward.

3355
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:13,400
Lots of lonely people out there.

3356
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:14,920
Well, do something about it.

3357
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:17,620
Make an event at a fun gathering place

3358
02:04:17,620 --> 02:04:19,760
in your hometown, support a local

3359
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:21,540
business, give them a plug

3360
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:23,560
on the air, and find the others.

3361
02:04:24,160 --> 02:04:25,900
All totally available to you

3362
02:04:25,900 --> 02:04:27,540
