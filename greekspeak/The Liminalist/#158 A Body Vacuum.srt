00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:14,560
This is the Limitless to Podcasts Between. This is Jason Horsley talking to the Greek.

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,280
Jason. Hello. Hello. I figured it's Jason or Jason. How are you, man? I'm good. How are you doing?

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,720
Good. All right. You sound subdued. Are you and relaxed? What's on your mind other than your

4
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:36,500
messages? You seemed enthusiastic and you sent me a pretty lengthy email, which years ago I would

5
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,080
go over and answer your questions point by point, but I just gave you a couple of blanket statements.

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,040
Nonetheless, thanks for the interest, I guess. I'm just saying that to be polite.

7
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,520
I know. Yeah.

8
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,060
There's nothing going on. This is planet Earth. Once you've seen enough,

9
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,920
you've seen it all without seeing it all. Go ahead.

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,800
How interested would you say you are in how what you do affects people?

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,320
Not much anymore because it doesn't affect people.

12
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,300
Well, it's affected me.

13
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,400
Just like movies don't affect...

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,480
I wouldn't be talking to you right now if it hadn't had a... I don't want to use the word

15
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,280
profound because I don't want to go there just yet, but it's had a significant effect, let's say.

16
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,360
Oh, okay. You'll get over it.

17
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,400
It might even be disturbing my sleep. I don't want to give you too much credit.

18
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,020
No, that's an easy way to think about it. One thing I want to just mention,

19
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,760
I did forward the email to Sam and he might have a chat with you as well. And his comment was,

20
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,420
his questions are irrelevant because he's not noticing the obvious. And I said,

21
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,640
well, why don't you discuss it with him? I don't need to...

22
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,740
That sounds like something you would say.

23
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,040
Yeah. And Sam, on the last slide, he's been imploding. I call it implosion

24
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:04,160
versus explosion, which when you look at an implosion and an explosion, they look very

25
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,639
similar, but they're very different. One is an outward, one is inward and then becomes outward

26
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:16,720
because of the tension or the stress of the environment, right? Just like people are under

27
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,460
the misunderstanding that nuclear devices explode. No, they don't. They just do what they do,

28
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:28,140
they short out the dielectric environment, what you call static electricity. When you walk on

29
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,580
carpet and socks and touch a doorknob, that's all it does. And depending on the environment,

30
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,920
whether it's water, air, underground, the reaction that you see that you call an explosion is just

31
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,000
the material in the immediate environment reacting to that stress, you see.

32
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,560
So... Well, I don't really see. I mean, I could...

33
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,540
This is... Yeah, the reason I'm bringing this up is recently I've been having some discussions

34
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:01,700
with people in nuclear physics, and the analogy there would be, let's say you have an automobile

35
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,120
and you bring it to a mechanic for some work, and you give him a list of what you'd like done,

36
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,740
and you give him the keys, and right before you leave, he says, by the way, can you show me what

37
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:14,380
the steering wheel is? Yeah. Yeah, I've heard you.

38
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,640
What's going... Yeah, so they're on auto... Yeah, an airplane on autopilot. And what does that

39
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:29,160
mean? There is a set analog of mechanical movements preset with including the input

40
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,640
of sensors to fly the plane. There is no such thing as an autopilot. It's relying on sensor

41
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:43,220
feedback to an analogous mechanical movement, you call programs, you know, whether it's punch cards

42
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:49,220
or magnetic drives or digital, it's the same thing, right? By the way, I should interrupt. I

43
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:55,280
just forgot to mention I was recording this. Is that okay? Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, so what I

44
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:04,940
would suggest is when you... The only... One of the things in your email was why you're doing this,

45
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,060
and that's very... I've stated several reasons in the past, and one of the main ones is just to

46
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:17,940
balance out the equation. There was a film, Good Will Hunting or something, in the Ivy League

47
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:24,040
American University mathematics section. They would pose these long, abstract mathematical

48
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,960
problems, and the janitor would just fill in the... would solve the problem at night, and professors

49
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:37,500
would come in and they were baffled. You don't have to be... I used to do a lot of this type of

50
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:44,540
rhetoric, if you could call it that, and diatribing and lecturing anonymously to people that would

51
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:50,020
trick a lot. I once had a discussion with someone in industry, and he says,

52
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,800
you wouldn't believe how much of what you've said is being used right now,

53
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:04,820
and no credit, because if you go down to a pig farm and clean out the pigsty, so they're

54
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:11,280
not waist-deep in shit, but just hoof-deep in shit, do you want the pigs to start telling

55
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,760
each other, well, let's give the Greek credit for cleaning it out? No, you did it because

56
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,620
it had to be done. You don't want any credit. You don't even want them to... It doesn't even

57
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:26,980
matter if the acknowledgement is irrelevant. I wish this could be done anonymously, but...

58
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,400
Well, I suppose you could use a voice disguiser, and then you'd be pretty much there at that point,

59
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,580
but then you'd lose a lot, right?

60
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,660
It's a little late for that now, because the content now would identify the source.

61
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,440
And I think... I mean, I was joking, because, I mean, there's something... one of the things you

62
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,200
said recently, or you haven't said it recently, but I picked up on it recently, is about the

63
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,680
quality of the character. And to me, that is the all-essential element. I'm putting a bit too much

64
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,580
emphasis in that, but that's my feeling, that's my sense, that's my experience in what I do.

65
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,840
I only want to talk to people that I can experience the quality of their character by

66
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,180
talking to them. I'm not really that interested in the information. And that's my dilemma with you,

67
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,800
because your information is very provocative, it's very stimulating, it's tantalizing,

68
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,420
it's titillating, it's unreferenced, it's unsourced, I don't know where it's coming from,

69
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,560
I don't know how you know it, I don't have the time to verify or check all this stuff.

70
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,020
I'm interested in you, and where you're coming from, and what your purpose is in doing this.

71
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,280
But if you listen a little more critically, which I'm not suggesting, that you're not

72
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,660
listening critically, right? I'm not suggesting that. Just a little bit more, right? It's like

73
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:47,580
pouring a fine glass of wine. Just because you want more doesn't mean that you're having too

74
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,260
much, right? Or too little. It just should be a little bit more in the glass, let's say,

75
00:06:52,440 --> 00:07:00,120
of critical thinking. What you will see, the reason I do cite sources is one of the last

76
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,460
things that mankind has yet to discover is the obvious. So when I bring up, for example,

77
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,040
the biological vacuum in the body, I also give a minimum of two or three examples of

78
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,060
how you can assess it yourself. I frequently give the analogy when I bring up that if we

79
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:21,480
look at basic anatomy as provided by the academics, which is generally very good,

80
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:29,280
you'll see that there's no absorption in the intestinal lumina, right? There's five impervious

81
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,420
hydrophobic layers. And when you bring this up to the layman, you can provide that as a source,

82
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,160
he'll say, well, I'm not a doctor, I don't know anything about the human body,

83
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,280
but he's spending his whole life in one. So when I bring up, for example, timekeeping,

84
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,200
it's pretty obvious. I don't need to cite sources, which I can bury you in sources.

85
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,880
I used to bring sources in a way that Sam did very academically and almost to the point of pedantics

86
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,740
or pedanticism, if there's such a word. But I noticed that there's no reason for that.

87
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,720
If you're saying that you're bringing forward the obvious, that means that it's self-evident.

88
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,800
You see? So if you've noticed all the points that you listed, one of the things that

89
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:19,140
prompted me to keep a very short answer to your email was when you brought up your opinion.

90
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:27,180
Opinions don't matter. I think opinions made public and to stand as reference material should

91
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:32,580
be faced with a very severe penalty, almost to the point where harm can be brought upon

92
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,140
the individual for doing that. Okay, so then at what point does that become objective,

93
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,799
the difference between one man's opinion and another man's objective statement?

94
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,460
Because an opinion is something you make, and objectivity is something you arrive to.

95
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,960
Okay, but people arrive to opinions too, and their opinion is objective fact. I mean,

96
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,180
the world is full of these people who think that their opinions are facts.

97
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:03,860
That's why we give the analogy, we the collective, we whoever, is free to use that. Your typical

98
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,880
surface dwelling inhabitant has certain characteristics, and they are thus. When I

99
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,560
call people morons or idiots or assholes or whatever, that is not intended to be a pejorative.

100
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,640
I'm using it in a medical sense. I know. I mean, I've heard you say that,

101
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,900
but it still has the same impact as the word. That's fine.

102
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,800
It has the same associations. People still hear it as a pejorative.

103
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,420
Well, it's done. I also try to do it organically, meaning when you say something organic,

104
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,720
it means like you're letting nature take its course, right? You've heard that.

105
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,780
Like, for example, I have a desk, and occasionally it'll be organized,

106
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,260
and when it's organized and filed away with labels, you know, how things are cataloged and

107
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:52,460
organized, I get a sense of disorientation, because when it was not organized, I know

108
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:58,840
everything on the desk was organically placed, meaning the bottom of the pile is much later on

109
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,080
than the top of the pile, which is more recent, right?

110
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,140
Right, yes.

111
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,660
Once it gets sorted by category, now I cannot use time as a reference anymore. I have to use the

112
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,220
category, and it might be something distant, and I might not recall, and the item is lost, you see?

113
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,060
Mm-hmm.

114
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,920
Where I know that if I haven't organized the desk in the three months,

115
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,080
I know the stuff on the bottom was—if I want to know what I was doing three months ago,

116
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,860
all I do is reach at the bottom of the pile, but once it's organized,

117
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,820
I don't know what I was doing three months ago.

118
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:31,080
Okay. Well, what does this have to do with calling people morons?

119
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,700
This has to do with the objectivity, and I do it in a way that's natural and organic. Like,

120
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,340
you were saying this is a similar SOP of a cult.

121
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:40,880
Yeah.

122
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,500
Well, this is the anti-cult, and of course it's going to be recognized as a cult, you know?

123
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,360
And this has been brought up before, and I said, well, there's no other way to do it. I've tried

124
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,620
to coach people who are interested in doing this, so I'm not involved, but they can't.

125
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:56,420
Right.

126
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:02,000
So I do it naturally. In other words, you know, cults are formed—I call the people that form

127
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,640
cults what the cults form around. If you're familiar with Gustave Le Bon, right? I mentioned

128
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:12,560
him. Okay, they're moron magnets, and I don't want to be a moron magnet, and the way magnets

129
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,780
work is what people call attraction and repulsion, even though that's not really what's going on.

130
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:22,780
So I'd rather repel the people from what they're used—you know, and have them just

131
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:30,280
objectify. See, if I tell you my opinion of you as a moron—this is just hypothetically—but

132
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,760
here I have some really good information, you're going to leave the conversation saying,

133
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,760
this was not a good interaction, but I got a good information, where if you like someone,

134
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,940
there's a concept of enamoring, there's a concept of kinship, there's a concept of affection.

135
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:45,680
But cults—

136
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,500
You tend to overlook that. Like parents do a lot of damage.

137
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,880
Cults don't only form around people-pleasers, you know, but there's this sort of Stockholm

138
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,160
cult syndrome, which is people like to be called morons, they like to be belittled.

139
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:04,840
Well, yeah, the state. The state uses that all the time. They say they're here to benefit you,

140
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,200
but at the same time, they have people in uniform and agencies that take your property

141
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:16,940
and quote-unquote abuse your rights, and people love it, right? I call it schizophrenia mixed

142
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:27,100
with amnesia. But the Stockholm syndrome, again, that is someone who is based on

143
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,640
lack of resolving things objectively.

144
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,480
Giving an example, years ago, I had dated—more than almost 30 years ago now—I dated a

145
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,860
psychiatrist who was teaching at university. She was young and had just gotten her certification

146
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:49,600
to teach. It was her first or second year teaching at university. And you would think that this is

147
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,020
an upstanding individual that's got a pretty good grip on the field of psychiatry, right,

148
00:12:54,060 --> 00:13:00,940
meaning what's proper mental health. And more than once, we would be taking a cab from where

149
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,060
she was living to a restaurant in New York, and she would tell the cab driver to go down to the

150
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:11,340
lower west side on a meatpacking district, and it was an S&M club, a sadomasochist club, where you

151
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,780
take off all your clothes in a locker, and you choose to put on leather, whips, spikes, and all

152
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:20,780
this, right? And of course, I didn't partake, but when I told her I wasn't partaking, she goes,

153
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,080
well, I'll see you tomorrow or the next day. I'll call you. I'm staying.

154
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,920
This sounds like something out of your sci-fi movies, right, where you have the duel, you know.

155
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:39,580
So, and then she was complaining. Let me give you—this is just an example of opinion and

156
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:45,520
objectivity, right, because this can be objectified. She was complaining about something going on in

157
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:52,780
the teacher's area. They have a teacher's area in the university, a lounge, and later on, she brought

158
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,180
that up again. We were—I was dating her for a couple of weeks on and off, but she brought this

159
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:01,700
up a couple of weeks later that the apprehended—the person that was the cause of what was

160
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:07,640
upsetting all the women at the faculty, right? And I said, well, tell me about it. She goes, well,

161
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:13,120
this man, one of the faculty, another psychiatrist teacher, was ejaculating in women's shoes,

162
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,320
and women would go put on their shoes if they had a change of shoes, and there would be this,

163
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,940
you know, semen in there, right? It was very, you know—and this is, again, these are the people

164
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:27,180
that you're sending your children to to be educated, right? So, I thought her instance

165
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:34,800
was very unique, but it turns out that the whole group was fucked up in one way or another, right?

166
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:41,300
So, you see what I mean about the organic cleaning out the pigsty and all of this other stuff?

167
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,800
Now, I want to go back to some of the email stuff. I'm not in front of the computer right now,

168
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,000
but I will—I could be. I didn't say any of that stuff that you put in there, you know,

169
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:56,680
like, for example, dreams or implants. I never said that, that discussing dreams

170
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,900
is way down the line of comprehending that we're subject to external input.

171
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:06,600
Yeah, well, it's the blog, even. I mean, it might not be the word implant. It might be

172
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,080
plug-ins or something like that. Plug-in as a metaphorical, yeah. There's no hardware involved

173
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,700
other than you having a body, because once you're disembodied, you're not capable of dreaming.

174
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,140
You'll be in another realm when it wouldn't be called a dream anymore. Now, you're in that realm,

175
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:29,200
you know. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so, but these things are—are you familiar with the metaphors I've

176
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,540
brought up with Jack Fresco? No, I'm not familiar with Fresco.

177
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:39,920
If we—if we were to visit a society of headhunters, and we went to one of their

178
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:46,120
homes and said to—to them, does it upset you that you have five shrunken heads? And he'd say,

179
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,260
yes, it does. My brother has 20. Mm-hmm, yeah.

180
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:55,280
Is that man doing anything wrong or believing or desiring anything improper for his culture? No.

181
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,760
Mm-hmm. Back in the days in the Colosseum,

182
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,340
in the Roman Colosseums, which were built for entertainment for everyone, if you had traffic

183
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:10,780
infractions, didn't pay taxes, or didn't sacrifice an animal to Hercules on what they call Sunday,

184
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,780
they would—they would imprison you and throw you to the lions for everyone to watch,

185
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,160
and the lions would tear you apart, right? Mm-hmm.

186
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,760
And the whole—it wasn't Christians, because Christianity didn't come around a few hundred

187
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,100
years later, so don't believe when people tell you they threw Christians to the lions. That's

188
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:30,880
like saying Christopher Columbus discovered America with an iPhone GPS. It's—it sounds

189
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,540
plausible to the young, but to those that know history, it sounds absolutely ridiculous, right?

190
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:44,160
So, if you were to visit the Colosseum when the crowds were let out of the stands,

191
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,320
you would see a family with children, and the little boy would ask the daddy—he'd say, daddy,

192
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,940
can we come next week to see the people thrown to the lions?

193
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,940
And the father would say, raising his hand to the child, only if you behave yourself.

194
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,380
Is there anything wrong with them?

195
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:11,200
So, how does this relate to dreams? Because, I mean, I was—I thought we were getting to dreams.

196
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:15,740
This is the—yeah, the dreams. Comprehending of that, if you were being bombarded, mentally

197
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:21,200
modeled, anything you interact with, you—even if it's seemingly new information, you will never

198
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,960
be able to learn it unless you can attach some part of it to something you've learned before.

199
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,420
Right. I understand that.

200
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,620
So, you've been told—see, in paganism, dreams are very important. Even the most—right? They

201
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,340
say, oh, what are the dreams? And they have dream interpretation and all this,

202
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,100
but they negate the source. And then in folk—people think that the dreams are their own.

203
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,970
So, how does that differ from how we're—

204
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:52,570
So, is there anything wrong with that? No. So, when you hear me saying it's all external input,

205
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,790
and way down the line—like, external input would be the 101, if you're familiar with university

206
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,850
classes, the way they're structured. Dream discussion would be a 302 class,

207
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,710
40-something class, much further down the line.

208
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,930
Well, what I heard, beside your blog, was you talking to a woman, I think it was,

209
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:17,590
about how—about dreams coming from demons, and you've just got to tell the demon, no,

210
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:20,950
we don't—close the door on the demon, because you don't want these dreams. Now,

211
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,730
I presume you're allowing, also, they come from angels, if you're in that model,

212
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:30,070
because there's sometimes visionary dreams. But that's what I'm referring to, this notion that

213
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,310
they're implanted from us— Spiritual beings.

214
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:38,370
—by entities, rather than, at least some of the time, generated internally by our own

215
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:46,630
consciousness. So, my question is this, how do you draw a line between that interpretation

216
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:51,170
and our waking consciousness? Because, like many people, I'm sure—

217
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,150
Same. Okay, so you don't draw a line.

218
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:58,990
No, it's all right now, you and I are having a discussion, using the computer analogy. You think

219
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:02,710
that you're thinking of what you're going to say, and respond to what I'm going to say now,

220
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:08,210
in your head, because that's what you're used to. And it's just like if I told you to stand up,

221
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,510
if you're sitting and walk across the room, you can do it without thinking about it. You take it

222
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:17,490
for granted, right? There's a very small impulse to make you stand up. There's the impulses that

223
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,010
you're using for thought. What you are not realizing is that nothing is happening in your head.

224
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:28,210
You're broadcasting and receiving to another place in counter-space. And by the way,

225
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,190
counter-space is the bigger you are in counter-space, the smaller you are here.

226
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:39,090
Like the—what was the doctor who that telephoned the police booth he had?

227
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:40,610
The TARDIS.

228
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:46,470
The TARDIS, yeah. So while you're thinking that, you're so used to it being in your head

229
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:51,710
that you think it's really going on there. So, for example, when I'm speaking to you now,

230
00:19:51,730 --> 00:20:01,170
I'm taking it from another place, receiving it and projecting it from the psyche to the

231
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:06,330
meaning there's no material because we're speaking in that in person, right? That's spiritual.

232
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,940
So this is something that you know theoretically or that you're experiencing?

233
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:23,460
It's both, both. And it's also been known from a Platonic Eastern philosophic

234
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:30,260
metaphysics from ancient times, and it's also been discussed in modern scientific circles,

235
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,440
and it's not on the internet, that there's nothing going on in the brain. They do know

236
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,120
during brain surgery, if they poke certain parts, they have a psychophysical reaction,

237
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,580
but they cannot view any pure psycho reactions in the brain. None, not even memory.

238
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:52,240
So, let me just give you a hypothetical thing. Hypothetically, if we weren't so

239
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,460
technologically primitive, you and I could communicate by connecting, networking the

240
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,200
cloud where we're both getting it from, from there, or asking them to do it, connect us up

241
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,100
there. Have you ever heard of people saying, I feel connected with them, no matter where they

242
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,820
are, I don't have to speak to them? Yeah. Yeah, that's because they're at the cloud. Imagine the

243
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,000
cloud, you know, if you, you know how cloud servers work, there's an actual building that

244
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,900
they're operating. There's people running around in lab coats or whatever they're wearing flip-flops

245
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,620
or whatever. And they're operating the servers and the servers have been pre-programmed like

246
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:29,220
autopilot to work, you know, on cloud servers, right? So, we all have a dedicated space on a

247
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,100
cloud server. I know it sounds kind of bizarre and it sounds like a Greek's opinion on this,

248
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,420
but I don't want to stress any of this because it's simply not time yet.

249
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:43,160
Yeah. Well, it also sounds pretty familiar in terms of new age stuff and collective unconscious

250
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,700
and so on. Yeah, but unconscious, but there's a problem with definitions. Let me give you an

251
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,600
example. A lot of people complain about what they call the justice system. I think you've

252
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,640
heard me explain that has nothing to do with law. It's a revived goddess religion. And all

253
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,240
through history, man gets his order and his law from his priesthood. So, that's all it is.

254
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,760
But to make a long story short, anybody who's ever looking at whatever dealings they're having

255
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,840
with state attorneys or other attorneys, the laws sometimes seem conflicting and conflating,

256
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,960
but all you have to do is go back and look at definitions. So, if you have no definitions,

257
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,300
like if you're on a construction site and some of the crew is using metrics and some is using

258
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:29,380
English standard imperial inches, you can still work because you have what's called conversion.

259
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:35,840
I know 25.4 millimeters to an inch and so on, 454 grams to a pound. You can do that. But

260
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:42,240
what I'm talking about lack of definition is if each tape measure, a millimeter was different than

261
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,500
the next millimeter on the other tape measure, now you're fucked. And I'm using that as a medical

262
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:57,140
term, right? So, this is what I see. One, engineers, when they speak, they first establish

263
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:03,840
that they're defining the terms the same way when they say inch, mile, pound, right? A particular

264
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:14,240
steel alloy, if you say a 643V titanium alloy, it's six parts aluminum, vanadium. They know that.

265
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,620
They know that if someone says, I'm going to send you a 643V alloy, when they receive it on the

266
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:26,620
other end, they'll measure it. It'll be that. It won't be a 1269, you see. So, all I see is people

267
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:32,700
using different definitions and all that. By the way, that is done by code. In battle,

268
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,580
if you're familiar with Sun Tzu, you win without fighting.

269
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,180
When you have an army, which is a collective that requires coherence and cohesiveness through

270
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:48,240
communication, you don't have to go after the physical part or the psychophysical. You go through

271
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,120
the psychophysical, meaning cycle first, meaning prevent them from communicating or confuse them,

272
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,160
and then the physical will not manifest, right? What they're supposed to be doing.

273
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:01,780
So, I see that the cosmic enemies, which is fine, they have a lease. You understand,

274
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:06,480
if you have an empty building, as a landlord, you can lease it to a drug dealer. You could

275
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,420
lease it to an office. You can lease it to a medical. You could lease it to a legal firm,

276
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:17,120
right? Usually, when you lease it to someone who's a drug dealer or a human trafficker,

277
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,260
they're not going to put up a sign outside saying that they do that, right?

278
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,280
They're going to say, we distribute toys from Asia or something.

279
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,560
So, you're going to have to do some forensic investigation on these things as well,

280
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,400
and you'll see that nothing is as they're told. But if you're interested in dreams, supposedly,

281
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:41,980
and when you say collective unconscious, when you're unconscious, there is no dreams.

282
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,920
What dreams are is an animation, partial animation of your consciousness.

283
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:54,120
Unconsciousness is being asleep or dead. There's no sensory, there is no cognitive,

284
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:01,380
anything quantifiable or qualifiable, right? It's just void. It's negative space,

285
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:08,200
negative consciousness is unconsciousness. When you have a dream, instead of waking up fully,

286
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:13,000
where you realize where you are and what you have, your daily routine kicks in or whatever,

287
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,280
the dream is not that. Dream is even prior to that. It's a very, very small, faint

288
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,860
level of consciousness. Once you hear unconscious, that just means asleep or dead.

289
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:31,100
So, a dream is a very minimal, it's a drop. If you had a glass of water, is your consciousness

290
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:38,180
full or half full? The dream would be just the moisture left after you drink the glass up,

291
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,260
just a little bit. Compared to when you're awake?

292
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,680
When you're awake, when you're conscious, right? See, everyone is fully conscious when they're

293
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,500
awake. They're not aware. This doesn't speak to my experience though, because there's many times

294
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:55,360
where I've had dreams that I've experienced myself as more fully conscious than while I was awake.

295
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,820
No, you're more, you're reading your senses more. You're re-operating, okay.

296
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,040
Give me an example. In the New Age movement, you hear, like, these people are not conscious,

297
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,900
or they need to awake, right? They need to wake up. Well, if you go to bed stupid,

298
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,800
you're going to wake up stupid. Well, not necessarily, but yeah.

299
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:20,280
So, what the hell do you want to do with a 7 billion stupid, you know, awake or asleep,

300
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,140
it doesn't matter, you know, stupid, better off than being asleep, because stupid people

301
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:30,680
tend to be dangerous. You want to inform them and give them the tools. Give them the tools,

302
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:35,740
don't sell them the tools, you see the difference? Or don't create a scarcity of tools,

303
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:41,000
give them the tools in abundance to use that knowledge.

304
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:47,260
Well, what about the training for the tools, though? I mean, if they can't even recognize

305
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:53,920
that the tool is a tool, then... That's right. That's right. That's why you

306
00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:00,900
have to train them, yeah. And the way that you don't do, and the training is done properly.

307
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,520
I'll give you an example. When you said you got some information and you got rid of a

308
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:10,060
multiple fiber, mixed fiber, and you hope you get a reward from the gods. I've never said that.

309
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:14,520
It was a joke. Oh, I know. But still, it's a matter of

310
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,920
it's doing the right thing. You don't do the right thing to get a reward.

311
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,960
I know. Yeah. You do the right thing because,

312
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,920
guess what? It's the right thing to do. Yeah. Well, it's logical, really, to be in

313
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:33,980
harmony with one's environment. But it's also logical to want more shrunken heads if you live

314
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,260
in a society of headhunters. Okay. Well, it's not only logical,

315
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:44,500
but there is a logic to it also, which I find is a pretty good compass for me. My trajectory,

316
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:51,460
Greek, has been from... Briefly, it's from atheist, just a regular guy seeking satisfaction

317
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:57,060
in the social realm, to a very disillusioned human being who went on the occult path,

318
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,560
and went way too far on that, and went into these huge apocalyptic belief systems and narratives,

319
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:07,700
and sorcerous practices, and all the rest of it, to a kind of threshold,

320
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,540
lingering on the threshold of Orthodox Christianity, because that seemed like an

321
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:17,660
antidote to the left-hand path of occultism, which was the point that I came across you.

322
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:23,260
Not coincidentally, I'm sure. But the point of all this is that for me to hear you spin

323
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:28,380
these grand cosmic narratives, a lot of which resonate with me at, I would say,

324
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,020
deep visceral level, but I can't necessarily extricate that from psychological patterns,

325
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,500
you know, neuroses that want to believe in these narratives. Like, when I hear you talk

326
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,560
about the Antichrist, and the gods, and the kill shots, and the end times, that stuff makes me feel

327
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,940
really, really good. It doesn't make me feel despairing or afraid, right?

328
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:52,660
You can call it end times. I don't use that term. Very rarely have I ever said that. I might bring

329
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:59,500
it up as a criticism of the end times, but I don't use it. I talk about those things the same way I

330
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:06,640
speak. In the early 80s, I found out that computers were getting, there were more companies

331
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:13,280
making smaller, more accessible computer technology, because I was used, I was trained in

332
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,580
punch card, Fortran, kobold, and all that, right? You understand this is back in the days.

333
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,180
And I had a suggestion that it should be used to do real-time inventory. In other words,

334
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,380
the cash register should be the computer, because I knew people, and they had shoe shops,

335
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,540
and they had to dedicate quite a few man hours doing inventory on how many shoes were sold.

336
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:41,180
They didn't know. But if you had the cash register that subtracted the shoes that were sold in real

337
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,920
time, you could actually, at any point of the day, knew you had to reorder instead of waiting at the

338
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:51,660
week when inventory is done. So I kept telling people that this computer thing is going to be

339
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:58,380
very important in commerce. I never said you're going to have an information age, because obviously

340
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,880
the people are not going to be, this is not an informational-based society no matter what they

341
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:09,600
tell you, because people don't care about that. That's food, clothing, and shelter.

342
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:17,840
So I've run into people much later who say, oh, you were prophetic about the computer age. I said,

343
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:23,880
I never said that. I never said computer age. Never. It's ridiculous. It's just another tool.

344
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:28,880
And I actually met with Wozniak, one of the people from Apple, back in the day and all that,

345
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:35,620
regarding that. And he showed me this little image of a thing, a recycle bin of a garbage can,

346
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:39,760
and I said, oh, how cute. But that's not where it's going to be going. And I was wrong about that,

347
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:48,760
because it obviously did. People want the little icons, right? So essentially, when I speak about

348
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:58,240
the end times, and also like stirring the shit pot and all that, or whatever, it's already happened.

349
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:04,320
Practically, you don't have a beginning and an end as such. If you were to shoot a two-hour film,

350
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,220
you don't get two hours of film. You get two hours and 10 minutes, because you need 10 minutes

351
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:13,220
of credits. It's the right thing to do. You're in the credits portion. Time already ended almost

352
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:18,080
21 years ago. Well, you're not waiting for the end. You're waiting for the mop, the cleanup.

353
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,620
Dropping a glass of milk on the floor with broken glass and milk is not the end.

354
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,500
It is the end of the glass of milk. You're not going to... You could still sop up some milk

355
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,580
like a dog, but now the next thing is what? The cleanup.

356
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:36,620
But in that, I mean, that metaphor is kind of contradictory, because

357
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,380
credits are in a movie, and the movie's all about the narrative, and you're talking about

358
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:47,460
this Antichrist, and that's the climax, right? Within the narrative frame, the Antichrist is

359
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:52,660
the climax. It's not the credits. No, the climax is that man reaching

360
00:31:53,580 --> 00:32:00,840
after time ends, all of the things that man has to be given so he's without excuse later.

361
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,400
See, because if they came and mopped it up now, people, when they're reanimated,

362
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:12,100
resurrected, reincarnated, however you want us all accurately to say that,

363
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:20,240
they're going to say, we never had a chance to employ policies that would make things better,

364
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,420
you see. So you're saying the information's in the credits, but the credits, it's already

365
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:28,340
over when the credits are running, so how are they supposed to act on it at that point?

366
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,760
That's why I keep saying, why bother food, clothing, and shelter, and just watch the show?

367
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,800
People don't even want to watch credits anymore. I remember

368
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:40,300
when I worked in film a little bit, I was very interested in the credits.

369
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,980
Okay, so yeah, you're finding out what's going on, who's behind the scenes, I guess.

370
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,120
Oh, it could be really interesting. You might think the thing was shot in New York,

371
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:56,520
it was really shot in New Zealand or Canada, right? You might think this XYZ and it ends up

372
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:03,320
being ABC. And you might say, well, I don't trust those credits, I think they're a lie also.

373
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,420
That's fine, but you need to still be aware of the information that's put out.

374
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:12,120
That's why people tell me this, that, and the other about, how do you know this is good?

375
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,720
I said, I don't, I just look at all the information, I try to create a hierarchy like

376
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,560
military intelligence. When they spy on people, they categorize it.

377
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,740
If the guy's favorite color is red,

378
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:29,220
that's much lower than the guy just got a $50,000 bank transfer from some Saudi.

379
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,400
That's a higher bit of information to discuss, you see. You see what I mean?

380
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,840
Well, so the reason people don't stay for the credits is because

381
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,280
the show's over. They were there to suspend disbelief and get lost in the story,

382
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,640
and the credits are just basically telling them that it was just a movie.

383
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:53,320
People know the show is over. I did this when I was young, dumb, and full of cum years ago.

384
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,600
I went down to these things called shopping malls, and they have food courts, and that's the most

385
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:04,060
active general place where the egress and entry into the building is at the food court, right?

386
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,820
I stood there with a clipboard looking very handsome with a tie and dress shoes,

387
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,719
looking very smart with someone else, right? And so we're conducting a survey. It's very

388
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,340
simple. I'm not going to take much of your time. Do you believe we're in the end times, and why?

389
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:23,440
And 99% of people says, yes, I do believe we're in the end times, but zero or 1% said why?

390
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:28,920
When I was growing up, you had milk strikes, truck strikes, sanitation strikes,

391
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,780
strikes of every kind, right? You don't have that anymore because it doesn't matter,

392
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:41,340
you see. There's no more negotiating now. Now it's just tell us what you want,

393
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,020
and maybe we'll do it. If we don't feel like doing it, we just won't.

394
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:45,800
Sorry, who's saying that?

395
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:48,300
This is the collective, the headhunters.

396
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:57,130
So why are you spinning this narrative then about the Antichrist in the end times?

397
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:00,070
I never said the Antichrist. There's a world leader.

398
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:01,630
You did say the Antichrist.

399
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:07,070
Well, I do. Well, I bring that up to attach what I'm saying, so I'm not being cryptic,

400
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:12,570
because people have been mentally modeled to that figure, right? But you're going to have,

401
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:17,950
really, the term is instead of Christ, instead of an anointed one. Anointed one is like a king,

402
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:23,270
by the way, a leader that has divine rule. The Asians will tell you all about that in the

403
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:30,430
Shoah traditions and that, right? And also in England and Europe, the king's divine right to

404
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:38,490
rule. That's what I mean by that. And let me put it this way. There's so many memes developed around

405
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:43,510
that when it happens. If it's the understanding that people have, they're going to cry foul.

406
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:47,090
But I'm telling you, it's all going to happen in secret. It'll be right in front of you,

407
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:52,830
you see. It's not going to be just a, quote-unquote, Antichrist figure or a young leader.

408
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:58,190
It's going to be surrounded by a group of older people that are going to seem very,

409
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:04,370
very spiritually aware and awake, and will also have command of enough of the environment to

410
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:08,850
suggest that there will be, more than suggest, that there will be supernatural paranormal

411
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:13,790
activity surrounding this group. Okay. So, I mean, this is all fascinating stuff,

412
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:20,670
but why is it relevant if it's just the credits? Oh, it's relevant for the sake of efficiency.

413
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:26,230
Years ago, I worked as under, I would consider him a mentor from this man who had a company

414
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:33,710
called Hi-E Engineering. It was H-I hyphen E. And he wanted me to take over the company. We were

415
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:38,910
doing some very esoteric machining, esoteric materials. I was there for four months, and like

416
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:43,170
a fool, I said, Harlan, why do you call the company Hi-E? That would be like one of the first things

417
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:50,570
you'd ask, right? But it never occurred to me to ask, because the logo was H-I hyphen E. And I said,

418
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:54,550
what does that mean? And he says, well, E stands for efficiency, and Hi means a lot of it.

419
00:36:54,550 --> 00:37:03,690
Right? He was a southern man from Tennessee, right? So, it's about efficiency. So, when people

420
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:08,250
say, oh, the world's going to end here with a nuclear war, World War III in September, whatever,

421
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:15,970
never mind. Ain't going to happen that way. Efficiency for what? I mean, efficiency in what?

422
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:23,350
Putting your energy into all the mindfulness that people put into the bullshit geopolitical and

423
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:28,310
social movements that you're going to see and have been seeing. Y2K 2012.

424
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:30,730
Okay, but I'm not that. I mean, I'm your listener.

425
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:31,370
No, I know you're not.

426
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,350
So, none of that has any interest to me.

427
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:39,290
That's fine. I try not to be specific to the individual, and I try to give very little of

428
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:43,210
my own personal aspect. I try to be as general and universal as possible.

429
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:46,910
Why wouldn't you want to be specific to the individual, though? I mean, particularly now

430
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,550
that you're talking to us.

431
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:52,730
Well, Sam brought that up in the last... Because we're not down that road yet, and you'd have to

432
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:57,570
send me your contact information so I could send you a bill so you could reciprocate the value of it.

433
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:02,350
Well, that's assuming it's not a mutually reciprocative dialogue, right?

434
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:07,610
That's right. I used to have Skype conversations, and one guy would sit and be really quiet,

435
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,930
and I said, well, who are you? Why are you here? I thought, you know, you actually spoke very

436
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:15,970
negatively. I said, the Greek is an asshole. But you do... I don't take that personally. I just

437
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:19,930
say that the perception that you have of the Greek is an asshole. If you said the Greek has

438
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:26,470
an asshole, that would be more accurate, right? But nonetheless, he says, well, because I don't

439
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:31,350
have to go see my psychotherapist anymore. It saves me $150 a week because I get more out of

440
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:36,250
listening to you. And I said, well, fuck, man, give me your contact information so I could send

441
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:41,150
you a bill for half of that, at least. It should be twice because it's twice as effective. Do you

442
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:41,650
see my point?

443
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:46,270
Well, yeah, except right at the start of this conversation, you said you weren't that interested

444
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:52,110
in how you affected people, what effect you were having, and that's anti-therapeutic.

445
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:58,470
The therapeutic process involves an awareness of transference and all the rest of it.

446
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:02,710
Well, the thing is, because when you do something, you know, even scripture says,

447
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:07,510
when you give, you should give anonymously. If you were to give, you know, don't get a

448
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:13,510
plaque or, you know, just give anonymously. People misunderstand that. It's anonymously

449
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:19,390
when you give to the temple, let's say, you know, or the hierarchy, you know, as tribute,

450
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:23,550
you do it, yeah? You do it anonymously. It doesn't say you have to give anonymously when

451
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:28,490
you give to individuals. The reason I said that it doesn't matter how I affect people is because

452
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:33,590
you can't be bothered if it's a one-size-fits-all. If you're selling T-shirts, I'm not selling,

453
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:37,650
but an example, if you're giving out T-shirts or hats and it says one-size-fits-all,

454
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:43,290
you're not going to stop and think too much about what if it doesn't fit this little baby or this

455
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:49,770
really big fat man. You see, it's general enough that most people will put it on and it'll serve

456
00:39:49,770 --> 00:40:08,110
its purpose. Well, okay, so that's a stumbling block for me because I don't believe in a

457
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:14,210
one-size-fits-all formula, I don't suppose. I don't either, but it does exist. If you go to

458
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:18,490
headhunters and you don't have to discuss the color of wallpaper in their kitchen, you could

459
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:23,950
just discuss perhaps what they all have in common, which is the aspect of being referred to as a

460
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:28,950
society of headhunters. They each have different colored wallpaper in their kitchen and they each

461
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:33,750
have different colored cars, let's say, right? So, I want to address that, but what I do,

462
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:40,730
for example, when I work with industry, if I work with an oil company or an electronics company or

463
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:46,670
an automotive company or whatever, they're all the same, right, because they all go under the

464
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:50,550
blanket of industry, but yet they're all very specific and even more specific of the different

465
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:54,490
fields that they cover. They're approaching me not only for the general field like automotive

466
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:59,530
stuff, electronic stuff or oil stuff, they're approaching me for a very, very, very narrowly

467
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:08,110
focused specific thing within that field, you see, and that's one aspect also that can be done.

468
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:11,530
I think with you, it would be dreams. You brought up dreams several times.

469
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:17,490
I mean, that's just a way in, really, and it's really just one example.

470
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:24,990
I'm interested in the source of information as far as...

471
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:25,690
You are the source.

472
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,710
Right, okay, so...

473
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:31,590
Very often when I say to people to be lawful, so who makes up the law? I said, you do.

474
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:37,810
You make it up. You do it, but you can't just make it up because there's a penalty for

475
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:44,930
fiction, right? What you do is you find out how you're wired and you get it from your god or

476
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:50,110
you get it from what you call a super-ultra-dynamic ultimate being. That's why most atheists,

477
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:54,210
you know, I ask, do you believe in the laws? So you don't believe in any gods. He says,

478
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:58,150
no, I don't. Well, do you believe in the laws of the state? Sure, I do. I said, well, then,

479
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:03,530
you know, the state is your god. They provide one for you, and April 1st is your holiday.

480
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,690
So you can't escape it.

481
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:12,070
So just like you cannot escape Apple protocols in an Apple computer or, you know, our Linux has

482
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:17,510
other protocols. It's to escape, to get, you know, food, clothing, and shelter. You cannot

483
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:20,150
escape breathing air, can you? So...

484
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:24,110
Well, let's bring it back to this one-size-fits-all thing for a moment because you

485
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:30,630
agreed on that, but at the same time you had disqualifier and you said you're speaking to

486
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:37,390
a collective. You didn't say that, but that was the inference that I got. And as if everybody was

487
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,230
the same, and... Yes.

488
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:43,610
Okay, so my impression of what you're doing is that you're speaking to everyone as if they were

489
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:48,090
morons, right? And you're saying repeatedly... Sure, for several reasons.

490
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:54,270
Well, I'll just complete that. You're constantly asserting the fact that there's nothing out there

491
00:42:54,270 --> 00:43:01,790
that's true, that has any value. It's 100% bullshit, except what you're saying. So how

492
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:09,770
does that, how do you square that? Because, like... No, that's, no, what you're saying could be

493
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:14,690
woven into seeming accurate, but this is what I'm basically saying.

494
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:23,470
You... There is something that, again, back to the individual that has a mental model, right?

495
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:27,890
You're brought up believing things the way things are. I'm telling you, none of that is the way that

496
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:32,330
it is, and it's not because of some occulted knowledge or it takes a special individual

497
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:39,490
to discover this. All you have to do is the things that you tend to believe in or interact with,

498
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:45,510
can you define them? And how do you find how they're defined? Because they're probably done

499
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:49,990
in the past, and if you're creating something in situ on the spot, you can define it as you're

500
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:55,630
but most things are not that way. Look up what these things really mean. I used to press on

501
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:59,810
etymology versus dictionaries. Look at what words mean, and then you'll...

502
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:05,990
So this is very language-centered, then. Language and practical. You know, like, for example,

503
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:11,050
if you take any field, which the most important thing I suggest to people is the human body,

504
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:16,070
because if you eliminate that, you simply won't be here, you'll cease to exist, as you do now.

505
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:21,030
So you better find out how your own body works, right? If you're told that you're a filter bag,

506
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:25,530
you know, you absorb things and secrete things, and you're full of pressure,

507
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:32,810
that's about as much bullshit as anything can handle. The bullshit meter is off the scale on

508
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:38,150
that. Right. But I mean, there's such a sea of information and disinformation out there,

509
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:45,690
and as you say, we have a body to refer to, so our body can presumably tell us what's going on.

510
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:51,470
Wouldn't that be possible independent of information and definition and etymology and

511
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:56,850
all that stuff? Sure, but also you can do it from this. There's always, when you have a

512
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:01,770
quote-unquote group of people, not like the Gustave Le Bon crowd, which he calls morons as well,

513
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:06,070
but there's always going to be someone in the group, whether it's, you know,

514
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:10,390
when I say group three or more, because two would be a couple, so three or more people,

515
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:14,250
there's always going to be, when a situation is presented to a group, there's going to be

516
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:20,270
always someone, if not all, let's say, that will rise up to one aspect of the situation more than

517
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:25,250
another, right? You know, like the taller person will reach out a little higher than the shorter

518
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:29,810
person, but the shorter person might have better skills in math. So you tend to find what people

519
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:34,750
are good at, and you work them all together. So when it comes to the human body, if we want to

520
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:39,870
define it, well, a lot of grunt work, you know, physical labor has been done in what's called

521
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:45,650
anatomy. I don't suggest people start doing cadaver research. As a matter of fact, when

522
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:51,530
something dies, it is radically different than when it's alive, right? So if you start looking

523
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:56,490
at anatomy, and it is glaringly obvious that when you look at the lumina of the intestine,

524
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:00,510
that nothing goes through there. It's built like a steel-belted truck tire.

525
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:02,010
So what do you mean when you look at it?

526
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:08,110
Well, through anatomy, you know, what's been illustrations like Gray's Anatomy, for example.

527
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:11,330
So you trust that particular source?

528
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:18,350
Well, if you want to validate it or verify it, you can happen to associate yourself with someone

529
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:22,930
who is about to do cadaver research with the appropriate equipment and ask them to validate

530
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:28,730
that. In other words, when they have not performed the research yet, but when they do perform it,

531
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:32,990
can they please return to you to substantiate what's been put out?

532
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:34,030
Did you do that?

533
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:38,450
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I've done it. Yeah. And also, see, I've grown up at a time where

534
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:45,330
in biology class, it was not unusual for them to present you with a frog that you dissected.

535
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:48,150
I don't know you. I don't think you're that old. Are you?

536
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:54,430
Actually, I am. Yeah. And I couldn't do any of the sciences. I was so bad at them and so

537
00:46:54,430 --> 00:46:58,890
bored by them that they let me actually quit that aspect of my schooling.

538
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:03,170
Well, that's good. Unless I tell anyone who's got more than eighth grade education,

539
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:07,050
has done irreparable damage, probably you'll never recover from it. It doesn't mean you

540
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:11,450
can't compensate for it. Well, I didn't pay attention, really. So

541
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:18,010
I don't know how true that is. But anyway. Yeah. It's all bullshit to conform to the

542
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:22,750
mental model. The reason why politicians and entertainment and religions are so bad is

543
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:27,890
because they're accommodating the mindset of the people. If everything that you know is

544
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:32,510
a lie, let's say, you can only resonate with a lie. The truth will be dissonant to you.

545
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:36,950
It's out of frequency. Right. So where does the buck stop?

546
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:40,590
Because the people were created by the gods. So, I mean, it's all just...

547
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:41,490
Yes. Right? So...

548
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:45,070
Because the building that's known as the people and the world has been leased out to the drug

549
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,350
dealers and the human traffickers. Who were created by the gods, too.

550
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:51,450
Who were created by the gods, too. And if you don't like that, you're going to have plenty

551
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:55,630
of time to deal with the gods later and say, why did you put us through this?

552
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:59,530
So, I mean, how necessary are these demarcations? Because you're saying that even waking

553
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:04,570
consciousness is externally sourced because we're part of this continuum. The gods, presumably,

554
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:09,910
are part of a continuum, even though you talk about them as individuals, like this multiplicity.

555
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:16,550
But is there a distinction between the gods' existence and their function? Probably not.

556
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:19,650
And between our existence as a function of their existence?

557
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:21,330
Yes. Right?

558
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:27,710
So how necessary is this sort of demarcation, which creates this grand narrative with figures

559
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:34,850
of fascination? That's one of the things that I wrestle with, because that's where my already

560
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:41,010
installed mental model, that's what it converts all of this information into, is just a more

561
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:46,290
epic, more obsessive kind of narrative to be living, which isn't helpful.

562
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:51,170
Not to air philosophical, but would you believe me if I told you there is more to the universe

563
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:56,930
in existence that is unseen than seen? And a very simple example is that you have billions

564
00:48:56,930 --> 00:49:02,890
upon billions of cells in the body, but you don't see it as such. And I'm not talking about

565
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:09,110
that, but that's just a quantifiable way. There is a qualitative and quantitative existence that

566
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:16,370
we are not aware of. Like the human eye, we only see things based on the structure of the eyeball,

567
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:21,750
that fleshy, watery sphere in our eye. If you're a spirit being and you don't have that fleshy

568
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:26,050
eyeball, you don't see colors and things the way we do. Doesn't mean you don't see them at all,

569
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:35,290
you see. So now we have the primary, through primacy and dynamicism, more dynamics,

570
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:39,170
superior beings that don't see things the way we see them.

571
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:47,050
Okay, yes, theoretically. I mean, it doesn't seem to address my question.

572
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:54,450
It's a hypothesis and a theory. In other words, the conclusion will be after all of the measuring

573
00:49:54,450 --> 00:50:01,050
is finished, right? And how can you measure quality? Very difficult. Exactly. You know,

574
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:04,770
certain quantities of certain things will affect the quality, if you have bacteria in water,

575
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:10,090
for example. I mean, is there a value, is there a merit in measuring quality and quantifying quality

576
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:15,050
as opposed to just embodying it? That, unfortunately, the quality measurement

577
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:19,010
comes from being fit and proper, doing the right thing, the concept of law.

578
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:24,850
It comes from a concept. Yes, it's a concept, because in other words,

579
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:29,770
it's dictated through the psyche, through the mind. So you're saying that if you don't understand

580
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:32,310
this and if you haven't defined it, you can't embody it?

581
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:38,930
No, of course not. That's why, but there is an innate primitive…

582
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:41,130
Why not? I mean, if animals can, why wouldn't humans?

583
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:46,390
Well, animals are very different. They come pre-downloaded. It's like buying a computer

584
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:52,490
and everything's pre-uploaded or downloaded to it already. You've heard the analogy, if you have a

585
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:57,850
small puppy, a month old, raised by gorillas to maturity, if you were to adopt that dog,

586
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:01,410
you wouldn't know it was raised by gorillas. It would act like a dog. But if you had an adult

587
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:06,910
human that was raised by gorillas from three months old, he would sit on your kitchen table

588
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:12,990
and throw a poop right there and grunt at you. You see? Because humans, we don't have any

589
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:19,270
downloads. Very little, if not any, basically, to mention that defines what we call being human,

590
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:24,550
other than the anthropomorphic form. What about a genetic, whatever, you know,

591
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:28,470
the DNA? That is a field that is so spurious and so

592
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:34,290
erroneous, it's bizarre. I try to avoid that. I like to use the word hereditary and genetics

593
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:40,830
also, perhaps, but the DNA is not something that's being accurately portrayed in the public

594
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:46,290
mind, just like money is not portrayed, just like many of the physical sciences are misinterpreted.

595
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:49,750
You know, the physical body, medicine, is completely misinterpreted to the people.

596
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:56,890
And what about our ancestral line, like the connection to that, that's in the present,

597
00:51:57,110 --> 00:52:03,270
like you and I, our ancestors, are speaking now as much as you and I, the individuals, maybe.

598
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:07,750
Right, in other words, further down the line, yeah.

599
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:11,630
Yeah, so the line is all present here in this one.

600
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:16,750
But our ancestors are dead, and the gods do provide a disconnection from them,

601
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:20,790
because there is a lineage, you know, like in certain countries, if a family has a debt,

602
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:25,890
the parents that incurred that debt, when they die, the children are still resolved to settle it,

603
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:31,050
right? And we're talking about when there were substance-based money. I hope you understand

604
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:37,090
that there is no, it's an impossibility of law to be in debt in this modern society unless you

605
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:44,830
agree to it, right? No one can prove any, anyway. I've had various discussions on money, but I tend

606
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:50,350
to not discuss it, because people nod their heads. I've had many discussions with high-level

607
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:53,970
engineers in various industries, and they're all agreeing, and then after the meeting, I say,

608
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:57,690
well, can you please just summarize a few things? And they'll say, well, it sounded good. I'd never

609
00:52:57,690 --> 00:53:02,970
heard it before, but that's all I can say. And I thought he was joking. But, and I said,

610
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:07,410
let me look at your notes, and he just had some, you know, stuff. He took notes on it,

611
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:09,710
what does that mean? He says, you know, I wrote that, and I don't understand it.

612
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:16,030
Then I said, holy shit, this is cosmic, this is, they're being censored. You see what I mean?

613
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:21,470
Yeah, so you're comparing this to the ancestral line, that we can say no to it, or what?

614
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:27,310
Yes, of course. It's actually something that I suggest people do constantly, because

615
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:33,270
isn't something trying to get resolved through our lives, ancestrally?

616
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:38,810
There's several, no, there, yes, there is. Because, see, the gods are a great number counter,

617
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:44,090
they're bean counters, you know, accountants. And in their realm, they have a concept of debt

618
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:47,230
based on our behavior, and they carry that over several generations.

619
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:51,230
So wait a minute, that's, surely that's not a concept. If we're talking about the gods,

620
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:55,870
it's not a conceptual thing, it's simply the reality, not simply, but the reality

621
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:58,910
they have established through their own beings.

622
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:02,670
Yes, and they communicate it. Just like you have two neighboring societies,

623
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:07,430
you may not be living in either one, but you know that they know enough about each other

624
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:11,930
that they're very different, or they're, in other words, if you have two parallel societies,

625
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:16,670
usually even on earth, they do know a little bit about each other, about what makes them

626
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:22,490
similar and what makes them different, right? You can imagine, yeah? You know, like a communist

627
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:26,210
in a capitalist country, they'll say, well, here is communism, we do this, but we still

628
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:35,010
have to eat like you do, see? No, the thing is, it's very interesting. I would like to bow out of

629
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:41,550
discussing, I would like to, part of, most of myself would just like to be completely, you know,

630
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:46,730
shut everything down, as if, you know, and I'm not going to deny I ever said any of this, or

631
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:51,850
provide any more, whatever, but part of me is saying that might be the best thing to do

632
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:56,890
if you do contemplate and consider the state of humanity, not just now, but how it's been.

633
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:03,570
But on the other hand, there's a sense of personal responsibility that one might have,

634
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:07,530
not to bring out something that is completely unique, because it might be unique if you

635
00:55:07,530 --> 00:55:14,410
haven't noticed it yet, but once you notice it, how unique is it? Especially if it's obvious.

636
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:22,110
So, there's a level of importance to certain things. Here, I'll give you an example. If you,

637
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:31,910
well, actually, that's too long, make it short. It's a scenario. But essentially,

638
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:42,510
if people are not noticing what is obvious, meaning obvious are things that within your

639
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:48,650
perception, because you tend to interact with them on a daily basis, right? On a daily. And if

640
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:52,970
you can't define those things, or don't know why you're doing them, or the history of those things,

641
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:56,970
or the effect of the way you're doing them, because you don't know how they're defined,

642
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:04,310
or the history of those things, that is something that screams out to be discussed or brought

643
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:09,350
forward. And that's the only reason why I'm speaking. You know, you've heard of the term

644
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:20,970
free energy. These things exist, right? And it's not a theory. They exist, right? Why don't you

645
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:31,630
have them? Any doctor you run into will tell you that digestion occurs because of electrical

646
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:38,970
impulses in the body. Okay? All of them will do. Gastrointernalists, all of them say that.

647
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:46,850
So where is their electromedicine? Doesn't exist, right? You want to talk about any of the physical

648
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:54,430
scientists. Ask a scientist to define a field. He'll tell you it's a wave. Well, I mean, isn't

649
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:59,370
there a way... A wave is not what something is. A wave is what something does. It just seems as

650
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:04,650
though it's like, you know, in those myths where you have to sort the seas and there's just an

651
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:11,670
impossible number. It seems as though you're addressing mankind's delusion or sleeping state

652
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:19,770
on a point-by-point basis by looking at the endless sea of errors that we're swimming in,

653
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:24,210
as if you could just correct all those errors and accumulatively lead man to awakening,

654
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:29,990
as opposed to why not just lead man directly to awakening by getting him to see what's actually

655
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:36,090
in front of his face. They're misconceptions, because if you go to the medical references

656
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:40,250
or the physics references or all these other references, you will find the truth in the

657
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:45,690
references, but they're not producing that. It just seems to me that, for me anyway, part of

658
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:49,350
the problem is that we're lost in the sea of definitions, not just because they're false

659
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:55,230
definitions, but because we're so compulsively trying to define everything and pursue concepts,

660
00:57:55,310 --> 00:58:01,710
rather than simply just land in the moment. It's a dummy load. If you had a plan to go

661
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:06,550
somewhere and develop a group of beings that need 6,000 years in their own screwed-up,

662
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:15,530
fucked-up ways, which is normal, and for 6,000 years they have to stay put. If you had, you know,

663
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:20,590
7 billion children in a place center, they had to be there for 6 hours, no matter what,

664
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:24,590
you're going to make sure they have enough toys and chocolate pudding and all this stuff to keep

665
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:31,030
them busy. I suppose we're not mad if it's bad for their health. Yeah, but the thing is, I've been

666
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:34,630
saying lately more, the gods don't care about your health. They don't care about your physical.

667
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:40,450
They care about you being a spiritual placeholder. I mean, see, that to me, that's an example of an

668
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:46,370
unnecessary or an arbitrary dis-categorization, like that the gods don't care about us physically.

669
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:50,870
I don't believe that. I mean, maybe they don't perceive us as being limited to physical,

670
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:56,190
so maybe they don't care about what we think we want and need. Fine. But if they're gods,

671
00:58:56,290 --> 00:59:01,330
they're going to have a holistic view of the whole of existence and perceive that in order

672
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:06,450
to lead us or whatever they're doing towards our potential as gods, they've got to consider

673
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:11,510
every element of our experience. They do consider it. And when I say they don't care,

674
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:16,550
what I'm doing is saying it in a poignant way to address the people that usually say,

675
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:21,190
well, if God exists, why does he allow so much suffering, death and all this other stuff?

676
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:25,270
I said, well, it's obvious. But that's a pretty low bar. I mean, considering the level of

677
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:29,830
awareness that you seem to be at. It's all low bar. Why are you low-balling so much?

678
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:36,010
Well, I'll tell you why. Because what happens is, for example, when I discuss scripture,

679
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:41,390
people say, well, what should I read? I said, read all of it. Because even if you understand

680
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:46,810
the languages of preservation and more of a source document, most of the people you're going to be

681
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:51,530
interacting with are going to be familiar with the crap you're trying to resolve. So you have

682
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:57,030
to know the crap also. Yeah, well, that makes sense. But you're not. I mean, you're talking,

683
00:59:57,210 --> 01:00:01,090
you're doing these streams and you're addressing. I mean, you could address any level that you

684
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:04,910
wanted to address because they're not there. I mean, you're talking to me now, so that's

685
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:11,590
different. I do. I do. In industry, when I do work and people do approach me for very specific

686
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:19,370
things or we're operating on a level where we have reciprocation. In other words, they're asking me to

687
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:24,910
provide source materials, experimentation and further thought. That's going to take me two

688
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:32,570
weeks. I said, well, I have to eat and clothing and shelter for that. And by the way, you have a

689
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:38,490
faculty of 70 engineers that cost you about 18 million a year. And what I'm going to do is going

690
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:44,130
to best everything they're doing. So what is that worth? And it's I'm not just doing it for money.

691
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:49,290
As a matter of fact, some guy says, oh, we we paid the Greek the equivalent of $13,000 an hour.

692
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:55,380
And he says he's doing it for money. I just gave it all away. But I don't want to start talking

693
01:00:55,380 --> 01:01:04,260
about myself on anything. So the thing is, no. Have you ever heard the term, if it's free, it

694
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:09,340
can't be good. If it's expensive, it must be good or better. Yeah. Yeah. The headhunters. Yeah.

695
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:14,040
If you want to impress a headhunter, do you bring him a box of chocolates or some shrunken heads?

696
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,620
Although it be a distasteful, I'm telling you, can you be objective enough to see

697
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:23,520
that the shrunken heads are more proper in that situation?

698
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:29,420
So in other words, that's why I bring up the distasteful nature like of when people ask,

699
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:34,920
why do the gods allow this and that? If you look at the ancient Ritz, for example,

700
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:40,980
gods have no problem putting 85000 Assyrians to sleep, meaning that they're never going to wake

701
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:47,600
up right permanently. It doesn't say, well, too bad we had to do that. Right. You see,

702
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:53,140
there's other places in there where the Christ is asked, well, why did the Romans kill all these men?

703
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,660
What did they do? What sin did they commit? You know, what misdeed or

704
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:01,240
misgivingness? So and all. And he says, there's no reason at all. He says, well,

705
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:04,280
why did the tower fall and kill all these men? We don't need a reason to do that.

706
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:11,120
Wow. And I started meditating on this. And I'm like, where was there ever remorse?

707
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:19,880
There are passages in the King James Version where God expresses remorse for what he's done.

708
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:24,060
Oh, really? Yeah. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I'd like to see that one day. I'm not saying right now,

709
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:28,320
and I'm not putting your feet to the fire. But if you read that carefully, you're going to find out

710
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:34,360
that what they're interested in is who we are. And, you know, our bodies and other things are

711
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:39,080
interchangeable. You've heard of organ transplants and things like that. But who we are, our spirit,

712
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:44,260
our personality, what makes us us, what makes you you, is extremely unique, so unique,

713
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,520
that it trumps what they call DNA, right? Because when you look at DNA, there are 111 comparisons,

714
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:55,940
68 have to be, you know, considered, if you're familiar with the RNA, DNA analysis.

715
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:02,980
And they do play that against the people's ignorance, you know, like, in legal circles,

716
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,920
they'll say we did DNA testing. And if you look, they didn't at all, they just

717
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:13,540
lie about it. Because, you know, if you do more than 111 or 111 group comparison with any human

718
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,820
DNA, the only thing they're going to come back and tell you for sure is that you all have the

719
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:21,880
same mother, came from the same motherly genetic, that's all, doesn't matter what race, color,

720
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:25,660
creed, or whoever you are, that's what they're going to tell you generally, right? Right.

721
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:32,500
So how come this is not discussed? Also, do you know that there are cells, various types of cells

722
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:38,620
where the DNA was removed and they replicated just fine, right? This is not discussed either,

723
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:42,960
of course. You know, I like using 911 as an example, you know, they say blame it all on

724
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:47,400
the Arabs and Osama Bin Laden, do you know that those people were never listed on any of the

725
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:52,040
government agency websites as being wanted for anything? That's all done on television,

726
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:59,740
it's a media stunt. A man was suing Fox News for libel, and the federal court ruled that you can't

727
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:07,060
sue them for libel because they're an entertainment industry, but yet people are relying on them to

728
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:12,780
run their daily lives. Now I'm telling you that what they teach in university has to conform to

729
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:20,580
what's in entertainment. That I can believe, in the broad stroke, but again, I mean...

730
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:24,360
As a matter of fact, I've seen recent textbooks cite things in the entertainment industry,

731
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:30,600
just like in the alternative media, they like citing things like the Matrix. It's bizarre.

732
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:38,400
I would suggest that you're coming upon a time where the knowledge of the gods will be increased

733
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:43,260
for a short time, by the way, objective, not religious. And well, actually, when you get

734
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:47,740
knowledge of the gods, you will see the religions of what they are. It's a subculture.

735
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:56,290
Right, well, that's the end of the first part of this conversation in Greek, which was 3 hours and

736
01:04:56,290 --> 01:05:04,110
20 minutes, and then there's another conversation I had with him on his own stream. If you're hearing

737
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:11,490
this, it's because I decided to air it. I've been consulting and reflecting and ruminating

738
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:17,390
on my experience as a Greek, and the knowledge, or the information, or the quasi-information that

739
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:25,970
he provides, and I haven't reached any firm conclusion. But as I say, if you're listening

740
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:32,270
to this, then I did reach the conclusion to air it, which I'm not entirely sure about at this

741
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:38,370
moment in time. I'm just creating the podcast, and then I will decide once I've listened to it

742
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:46,070
with some others. But the reason is, I think it's probably, hopefully, clear through the course of

743
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:52,430
my dialogue with the Greek, my reasons, my misgivings about bringing attention to what he's

744
01:05:52,430 --> 01:06:03,030
doing. I haven't linked to his domain in the show notes for this same reason. Good luck finding the

745
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:10,290
Greek online by searching for him. If you're diligent enough, you will. Particularly, I think

746
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:14,110
there's one reference towards the end of this conversation that will help you.

747
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:21,730
But I think I should make it as hard as possible, because as I said, the conversation with

748
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:30,490
one of the Greek's regular participants, I feel that he's dealing in nitroglycerin,

749
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:33,730
and I'm not sure that he's handling it very well. I certainly don't think he's

750
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:41,110
providing the necessary tools for those he's handing it to, to know how to handle it.

751
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:48,430
And for those who consider, as one person anyway, that my interest in the Greek is

752
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:55,530
somewhat regressive, as in a return to old fascinations with occult knowledge and

753
01:06:56,450 --> 01:07:00,030
power and stuff like that, and I think that they're not entirely wrong.

754
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:06,130
I think that my sojourn into Greek land, Greek speak,

755
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:16,890
relates not only to my, I might say, flirting with Christianity of lay or orthodox

756
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:25,810
theism, but also to my attempt to complete the Lucifer Unworking and to de-install

757
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:34,690
that program from all those years ago. Much of what the Greek talks about, I'd say,

758
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:42,490
belongs to that same program, certainly the belief system that I had back then.

759
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:49,310
And so this is a way for me to test just how susceptible I still am to the

760
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:57,050
the sort of power intoxication of dangerous or occult knowledge.

761
01:07:57,850 --> 01:08:03,930
So anyway, I'll leave it to the listener to decide and discern how much stock to put in the Greek's

762
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:12,850
apocalypse plan, and let me know what you think in the comments. Otherwise,

763
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:21,790
as far as whether I go any deeper into this material or into dialoguing with the Greek,

764
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:32,029
at the moment I feel fairly neutral about it, about him. He's a very fascinating, charismatic

765
01:08:32,029 --> 01:08:42,370
chap, but I don't feel that he's really embodying the sort of principles that I consider this

766
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:54,170
podcast to be dedicated to embodying. Those of wholeness, health, compassion, humanity,

767
01:08:54,410 --> 01:09:06,080
humanization, grounded values, and so on. I suppose I'd like to try and lay out the value set

768
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:15,620
that the liminalist represents or tries to adhere to. Of course it's liminal so it's always changing,

769
01:09:16,939 --> 01:09:24,180
but certainly it's about mind and heart over body. Wait, I know that wrong, but certainly it's about

770
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:31,120
body and soul and heart over mind stuff. That was a very Freudian slip, I'll have to leave it in.

771
01:09:31,979 --> 01:09:36,740
Right, well, you can listen, if you did hear this one, then you'll probably get to listen to

772
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:45,140
the following parts next midweek and then next week and then I suspect the week after that.

773
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:50,020
This is the Liminalist Podcast. Thanks for listening and thanks to recent donators

774
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,540
who I shall name Vikstrom, Dave and Simon.
