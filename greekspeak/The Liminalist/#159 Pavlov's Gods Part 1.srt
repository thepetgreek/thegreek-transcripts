00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:13,170
This is the Liminalist, the podcast between C.C. and Horsley with part 3 of my conversation

2
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,590
with the Greek.

3
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,310
It's a bit crunchy. Keep talking.

4
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,130
All right, it's still crunchy?

5
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,690
No, I think it's back. I think it's good.

6
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:35,750
Okay, so instead of telling people to conserve water, make it so they have to. When the bathroom

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,750
sink, the water comes out of the bathroom sink. It shouldn't come out of a round spout.

8
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:44,370
It should come out like a thin, wide ribbon. It takes the soap off the hands four times

9
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,890
faster and the waste water from the bathroom sink goes into the toilet tank.

10
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:50,270
Right.

11
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,690
Don't tell people to conserve water. Make it so they have to. When you have a sign on

12
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:00,210
the road that says, slippery when wet, why don't you bond an abrasive to the road so

13
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,630
it's not slippery when wet and then take the sign down. Do you see?

14
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,270
Yeah. This is a personal question, so you might not want to answer it, but do you get

15
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,070
stressed out? Do you feel stress around people's ignorance and all the knowledge that you have

16
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,290
that is not being received?

17
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,970
Well, here's the thing. When you take an average person and say, we're being threatened

18
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,090
as a society, grab a gun and protect yourself from the enemy, is he going to be stressed?

19
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:35,130
Yes. If you grab someone who is a trained special forces combat and he's at home and

20
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,950
you say, hey, we're being attacked, take a gun, is he going to have the same level of

21
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:44,350
stress? No. To him, it's going to be going on a turkey shoot. The other guy, he's going

22
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,790
to be afraid for his life because he doesn't know what he's doing.

23
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,310
If you know what you're doing, the people don't stress you. What I do with people is

24
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,250
I try to leave them off better than I found them. I see what their concerns are. I don't

25
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,670
need much to know what they're concerned about. I can tell if I go to the hardware

26
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,390
store and I see a woman at the cashier, I know she's only one paycheck away from being

27
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,770
homeless with her children because she's a single mom. She doesn't have to tell me

28
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:16,930
that. I could read that accurately. This is the kind of stuff I do. Years ago, there were

29
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,630
people of high net worth that would send me their sons, 18, 19, to live with me, not live

30
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,790
with me, but they would report in the morning and spend the whole day with me, as if they

31
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:31,770
were going to work for about six months so I could mentor them, if that makes any sense.

32
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:41,730
I'm not going to talk about this publicly. You mean that you don't want people to know

33
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,350
or you just don't want to get into it?

34
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,370
Yeah, it's irrelevant. It's irrelevant to say, oh, we've got to listen to this guy.

35
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:53,070
He mentors the sons of this blah, blah, blah. I'm not going to say. You have to listen

36
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,950
because of that. I don't know what he's saying, but I like it.

37
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:02,830
Yeah, but it still begs the question of how you know what's relevant to your listener

38
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,550
unless you know your listener.

39
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:11,650
I'm broadcasting. In farming, the plane flies over with seeds and it drops it on the field.

40
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,130
It's called broadcasting or fertilizer.

41
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:18,990
Yeah, I know, I know. So you're deciding what's relevant, but based on your own criteria.

42
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,810
I do one-on-one all the time. Right now, I'm waiting for a shipment in the next hour

43
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,750
or two for something that I'm going to hopefully be able to ship out tomorrow, what they call

44
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,290
Monday, because the post will receive. I know they work on Sunday, but they receive Saturday

45
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:38,670
and Monday to get it out. That's a one-on-one, very specific. Can this project that I'm talking

46
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,810
about in real time benefit someone in the audience? Oh, heck yeah. Am I going to bring

47
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:52,870
up what it is? Heck no, because it's irrelevant to the general broadcast, you see, whoever's

48
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,510
picking it up.

49
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,150
Oh, here he's talking. I've even had Sam, for example, oh, when you talk about food

50
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,350
and clothing, I don't want to know or time, I turn it off. I don't want to hear about

51
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:00,630
that.

52
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,610
Who says that?

53
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,590
Sam and other people. I'm just bringing it up because you might have a communication

54
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,670
with them. I don't care about the food or the time. No, that's not what I'm interested

55
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,950
in.

56
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,590
Oh, really?

57
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:16,269
Yeah, I only want to listen to this or that. Many people say, oh, I don't want to hear

58
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,329
about this and that. I'm Christian, I don't want to hear this. I just want to hear about

59
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:20,769
the food.

60
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,690
That's interesting, because I don't find that listening to you. I find that it's all of

61
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,750
a piece, really. It's kind of you that I'm listening to as much as the information. Your

62
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:34,910
level of interest doesn't seem to vary much. You know what I mean? You put as much energy

63
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:43,070
into whatever you're talking about. I'm hearing that as much as anything. I mean, yeah, you

64
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,190
repeat yourself a lot.

65
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,850
Everything is interesting, if you find it so.

66
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:54,050
I'm more concerned with how you're framing or the context you're putting the information

67
00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:00,330
in, which, as I put in my email, it has the similarities with the SOP of cult leaders,

68
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,130
which, again, I'm not saying that you're aspiring to that or that you want to be, but...

69
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:05,750
Quite the opposite.

70
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,330
Quite the opposite, right? But you know that we often become the thing that we most don't

71
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,310
want to become, right?

72
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,090
No, but I never said I most don't want to become. What I said is irrelevant to me.

73
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,990
Okay. Well, it's not irrelevant to me, because I've studied this stuff a lot, and as I say,

74
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:28,030
I've fallen into those mouse traps, those guru mouse traps quite a few times in my life.

75
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:33,010
It doesn't have to be a guru. For example, if you look at Scientologists, do they talk

76
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,730
about L. Ron Hubbard or do they talk about the Scientology?

77
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,510
Well, this is the context...

78
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,690
When you go to physics school, university, they talk about the cult of bumping particles.

79
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,930
Well, they would if they were being honest. They would. I mean, it is a cult, right?

80
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,710
Yeah, the medicine, the legal system, it's all a cult.

81
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,930
It's all a cult. It's culture, right? And the context in which I came to you was somebody

82
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,950
who's your follower, and I guess she does look to you in a kind of guru-like way. So,

83
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:07,930
that has framed my experience of you, I guess. That's a relevant detail.

84
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,410
But then again, that's the personal side that I would like to disconnect from, because if

85
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,690
she was listening objectively, she wouldn't recommend me to you, because she would listen

86
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:23,050
to you and say, well, you guys couldn't be more different. Basically, you're doing the

87
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,890
bullshit that everyone likes to hear, and this Greek is doing the stuff that people

88
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,530
don't want to hear. I would never recommend him to you. But anyway, I'm not saying that

89
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:33,250
you are doing the bullshit, but I'm presuming you are.

90
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,710
You're presuming it, right?

91
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,050
It's a safe presumption.

92
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,430
Well, it's...

93
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,130
It's not a put-down. Okay, when you say bullshit, it doesn't mean bovine excrement.

94
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:50,870
No, no, no. But it's not a safe assumption. I mean, it isn't for you. I don't have to

95
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:56,430
get offended by it, because I know you think this way about everyone, and you're just talking

96
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:01,690
technically, but it's not a safe assumption, right? There's no point in me saying I'm not

97
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:08,130
doing bullshit, but the context of this conversation, the context that I'm trying to keep drawing

98
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:14,350
us back to is that dissemination of information isn't enough. So yeah, if I was just disseminating

99
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:19,750
information for its own sake, I would agree. I'm just, you know, piling on the bullshit,

100
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:21,570
but I'm not doing that.

101
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:26,310
Information is not the key. If you... a computer, you have to have an operating system, then

102
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,470
you have a program, same with people, and then you have information. If you bought a

103
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:35,530
brand new computer out of the box, just blinking, you can't download files without a program,

104
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,590
and you can't put a program without an operating system. I talk about the operating system,

105
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:46,310
the programs, and then the files are last. How to make perfect rice is in the file. How,

106
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,730
you know, many of the things, when I talk about a moron, I said that's the file label,

107
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:56,290
right? They're a moron because their programs are moronic, and their operating system is

108
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:57,790
deceptive and malevolent.

109
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,030
Right. Well, you know the expression, to a hammer everything looks like a nail?

110
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,070
Correct.

111
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,870
Right? So if you assume that everyone's a moron, then obviously everyone you encounter

112
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,730
you're going to see as being moronic, or you're going to increase the chances that

113
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,910
you won't see the aspects of them that aren't moronic.

114
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:15,550
No, they are not.

115
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:20,150
The evidence that they're not actually, they don't fit into your categorization system.

116
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,630
I don't have any categorization. I'm talking about their categories.

117
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:28,770
Well, yeah, you do, because you say a moron is a medical term, and it relates to development

118
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,750
and so on and so forth.

119
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,070
Yeah, lack of development.

120
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,330
They don't have a mental age over the age of nine, right?

121
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,730
Right, later nine or 12 maximum.

122
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:39,049
So maybe that's true in my case, and maybe it isn't. I don't know, but you sure as hell

123
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:43,850
don't know, unless you're enlightened or something or beyond that, right? Maybe you do know.

124
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:44,970
Maybe you're the god. I don't know.

125
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,390
Let's go back. And I'm speaking statistically.

126
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,050
Yeah.

127
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:56,790
Not everyone exactly fits the moron profile, but if you were to go to a planet, this planet

128
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,090
from another world, and say that these people are moronic, that would be so...

129
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,650
You wouldn't be wrong, yeah, absolutely.

130
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:07,730
Yeah, you heard me give the analogy about the Kevlar underwear is the largest industry

131
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:12,730
because these people have a custom of placing a thumbtack on their seat before they sit.

132
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:18,050
It's their custom and tradition. So the largest industry on that planet is Kevlar underwear.

133
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:23,850
Now, a logical, rational person would say, well, why don't they just stop placing thumbtacks?

134
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,910
They don't need the Kevlar underwear.

135
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:30,590
But if you start promoting that they stop doing that, the people that control the Kevlar underwear

136
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,330
have so much power that they will... you see?

137
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:34,970
Yeah.

138
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,590
Does that sound like a metaphor?

139
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,890
Yeah, you've abstracted again into metaphors. It's like you like to take refuge in these abstractions.

140
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:44,890
No, not refuge. I try to illustrate it.

141
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,070
Well, it seems like it, because we were talking about your listener, who I won't name in case

142
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:55,970
this goes public, but who drew my attention to you and how that's a frame of reference

143
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,530
in which I'm approaching your material, and you made the assumption that she made an error

144
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,910
simply because I don't see...

145
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,730
Not an error. Not an error. Not enough objectivity.

146
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,690
You did say that, because you said if she had known that I was just, you know, another brush

147
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,090
If she were more objective.

148
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:13,730
Yeah, which is a big if and not a sub. But the assumption there is that she did make a

149
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:18,610
mistake, rather than that there is a reason for you and I to talk, and that she sees

150
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,750
something that you don't see about you and about me, I see something about her, about

151
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,270
you, that you don't see, that we have pieces of the puzzle that we can share and actually

152
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,130
put together and we will see more than we saw before.

153
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,710
Sure. Every elephant is different. I'm not looking at, you know, looking at an elephant

154
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,270
too close syndrome. I'm looking back saying, this is an elephant.

155
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:39,450
Mm-hmm.

156
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,890
You know, one might have some...

157
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,730
Yeah, you don't want to get your hands dirty.

158
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:48,770
Yeah, here's the thing. It's ultimately about being efficient. Like I said earlier,

159
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,750
if you... most of the people now, because of the rectangle, are affected by geopolitical

160
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:58,610
and national things regarding health and politics and things, you know, economics.

161
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:05,750
And I'm telling you, don't get caught up in those upwinded and downwinded realities,

162
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:07,870
meaning they just pass, right?

163
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,670
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

164
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:15,470
Because what is coming, what really matters, that when you start seeing these things, A,

165
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:20,170
B, C, D, or 1, 2, 3, 4, down to 400, these are the things that are going to lead to this.

166
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,390
Then pay attention to that. That you should be concerned about.

167
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:31,190
Yeah, but getting caught up in the Middle Eastern Union and the rise of a world leader who's going to...

168
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,950
That's much later.

169
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:36,370
Yeah, I know, but it's definitely something that people can get caught up in.

170
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,530
If they get caught up in financial crises and environmental threats,

171
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:46,870
they're certainly going to get caught up in grand narratives about the Antichrist and the gods.

172
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,130
So how is that better?

173
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:48,510
Yes.

174
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,410
How is that better?

175
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,910
But it's a much higher... What hierarchy are you working on?

176
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,070
Well, it's more fascinating as well. It's more easy to get caught up in it.

177
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,490
To some. To some they don't care.

178
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,610
I've actually... I don't care about the gods. I don't believe it and I don't want to know anything about it.

179
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,070
Okay, bye.

180
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,210
Yeah, yeah.

181
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,470
But I do want to know about rice.

182
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,410
Yeah, yeah.

183
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,130
I want to know about cooking rice, though.

184
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,290
Okay.

185
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,750
So I have the, yeah, the cooking rice and all the way down to...

186
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,170
I don't get into many of the industry things.

187
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,450
Once I was working with some consulting and the person said,

188
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:28,530
I heard you do radio. We don't want to work with you because you might speak on some of the things that we are doing.

189
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,810
And I said, I won't.

190
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,370
I said, well, it's too late. You're already public so we don't want to work with you.

191
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:38,590
So it has cost me quite a bit from opportunity cost, you know what I mean?

192
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,750
Maybe they did want to work with me and it wouldn't have worked out anyway, but you see.

193
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,110
How do they know you do radio if you do it under a pseudonym?

194
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,220
Oh, it's someone in the groups that he does. You should listen to him on radio.

195
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,600
Hmm, I see.

196
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,300
Someone I'd already known.

197
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,240
Someone that introduced me was friendly and he says, well, what do you do?

198
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,380
I said, I talk to people.

199
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,580
Well, why don't you do something? Why don't you do a radio on the internet?

200
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,780
I said, I already do that.

201
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,220
Oh, really?

202
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,120
And then that just kind of stuck there and they brought it up. Do you see what I mean?

203
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,520
Right, yeah, yeah.

204
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,520
Does that make sense?

205
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,480
No, it's just a detail.

206
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:22,760
Yeah, in other words, people that do work together also have non-work related conversations and it will come out.

207
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,140
And now will I hide it from anyone?

208
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,420
You know, if they ask me, is there anything else you do? What is your personal life? What hobbies do you have?

209
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,940
Whatever. I said, well, I have a website named Forbio.

210
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:35,100
Okay, fine. I'm going to supply it if they ask.

211
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,860
But I'm not going to say, hi, yeah, I'll help you with your ignition system and I do on Common Radio.

212
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,680
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

213
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,300
I'm not going to, but if they ask me what other hobbies, they do ask that, by the way.

214
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,880
If you've ever seen like, quote, unquote, this is not a job, what other hobbies do you have, you know,

215
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:54,300
or what else do you do on your free time when you're not designing ignition systems, let's say.

216
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:54,860
Right.

217
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,200
Right? Simple.

218
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:10,500
I had some born again Christians wanting me to do some water processing stuff and I declined right off the bat.

219
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,340
No, I'm not going to work with them.

220
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:19,120
You know, because they were so, they even have the crucifixes on their water website kind of thing.

221
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,640
And I said, well, these people are going to find out eventually that I'm doing radio.

222
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,840
You know, this is a one year thing they want me to get involved in, you know.

223
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,660
And they're not going to, it's not that I don't want to work with them.

224
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,500
It's that they're not going to understand what I'm saying, you see.

225
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,580
Mm-hmm.

226
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:38,580
Right?

227
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,580
You've heard me say that there's no Christian that knows the Bible and there's no Muslim that knows the Koran.

228
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,300
Yeah, yeah.

229
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,900
There's no Jewish person that knows that.

230
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,860
And there's no Buddhist that knows any of the Prakrit or Sanskrit scriptures, none of them do.

231
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,900
Because once they read it, it'll condemn everything they're doing.

232
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,760
So, okay.

233
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,320
You see, scientists, there's no scientist that knows the works of who came before them.

234
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,540
See, this blanket statement, this is what I mean by the context in which you provide your information.

235
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,700
Part of it is the context that nobody knows anything.

236
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,620
No, no, no, they do.

237
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,280
They do know what's based on keep maintaining their food, clothing and shelter.

238
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,020
I've heard of several people in, let's say, law enforcement and others say,

239
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:34,060
well, I'm going to wait until I get my retirement, then I'm going to bust this whole thing open that's happening in this town.

240
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,000
Mm-hmm.

241
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,220
Wow, so you're putting money over it.

242
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:40,300
Right?

243
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:41,680
You see?

244
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:47,980
Okay, but my point is that when you overstate your case, you undermine it, at least for me.

245
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:57,180
Because it's not credible that no Christian interpretation or no religious interpretation of the scripture

246
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,400
has anything in common with the scripture, that it's all completely wrong.

247
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,280
Oh, no, I'd never said that either.

248
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:09,420
In order to make something counterfeit, you have to look very close and keep people ignorant of the detail.

249
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,340
Right, so like disinformation being 90% true, you mean.

250
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,940
Yes, and there are Christians right now, as we speak, that are studying the Bible and they're in a neutral zone.

251
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,040
They're like, holy shit, this is really bad.

252
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,040
And then they make an exit strategy, and they get out of it, and they renounce it.

253
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:34,000
And then there are Christians that know that it's wrong, but they do it anyway because it keeps them going.

254
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:35,280
Right.

255
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:41,620
Just like doctors that get the quarter of a million a year because they're prescribing this drug.

256
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,940
They know it kills people.

257
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,180
Mm-hmm.

258
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:44,640
Right?

259
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,100
Right.

260
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:57,260
Just like the police that know their chief of police in this is dealing drugs and spiriting children from child services to another, you see, to be sold.

261
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,320
They know that.

262
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:58,940
Yeah.

263
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,120
You see.

264
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,600
So you have the ignorant.

265
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,220
The majority are ignorant.

266
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:09,300
You have the mid-zone, the people that are looking for an exit strategy because they've noticed they stepped in shit, basically,

267
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,180
or they're doing what they've been told they believed they realized isn't good.

268
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:17,260
And then you have the ones that are evil that will keep going along.

269
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,440
They know what's going on, you see.

270
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,420
Yeah, I understand.

271
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,099
So like when you were talking about giving money to charity, that was what I was thinking of.

272
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,099
It's not necessarily a good deed.

273
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,680
If you're acting unconsciously or acting for self-interest or whatever it is,

274
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,940
and you're not in tune with the reality of the present moment,

275
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:42,840
then the chances are very, very high that your good deed will not only be punished,

276
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,700
but deservedly punished because you will end up complicit with some fucked-up system, right?

277
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,160
So information and knowledge is like that, as I see it.

278
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:56,740
Like 90% truth, 10% lies means that actually it's kind of 100% lies

279
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:02,240
because that 10% influences the context in which you understand the other 90%, right?

280
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,480
So then it all becomes bullshit.

281
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,540
That's how I understand what you're saying,

282
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,620
but in which case the question is why do you think that you're exempt from that?

283
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,520
How can you believe that your stuff isn't becoming bullshit by taint of association?

284
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,360
That's irrelevant. It's whoever is listening to it.

285
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,340
Right, which is back to my initial point.

286
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,080
They ask Sarah Vaughan what makes a great jazz musician.

287
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,500
She says it's the audience that makes you great.

288
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:36,920
It's the audience that knows whether what I'm saying is the truth or bullshit.

289
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,900
Well, that contradicts what you positioned earlier though,

290
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,720
which is that you're just too into the culture,

291
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,740
that you don't care about how you affect the listener,

292
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,000
and that you don't have an audience.

293
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,740
No, no. If you present to a common person something that looks as thin as a human hair

294
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,540
and say this holds a thousand tons,

295
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,300
they're going to say, oh, no way, you're full of shit.

296
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,480
But if you approach an engineer with that,

297
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,920
they'll say, okay, what material is it from?

298
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,460
What alloy is it? Can I do a stress test on it?

299
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,960
What's its thermal coefficient of expansion?

300
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,740
You see the difference in language?

301
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,360
Most people will say, oh, this guy's talking about religion.

302
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,100
That's all bullshit. No, I'm not talking about religion.

303
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,120
Or the opposite. They will drink it down.

304
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,880
Or the Pope's work schedule. I don't know about that.

305
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
I calendar when it's Friday, it's Friday.

306
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,440
You see? I've heard that too before.

307
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,480
I don't know what you're talking about, Greek.

308
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,600
When it's Friday, it's Friday.

309
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,120
Someone else will say, wow, no wonder.

310
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,240
I knew there was something wrong with this.

311
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:37,640
Right.

312
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,540
It's up to you. It's up to them.

313
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,900
But do you care? Never mind that people reject it.

314
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:49,880
Do you care if people ingest it without understanding it and misapply it?

315
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,240
If they make it conform to their own mental models

316
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,160
in such a way that your apparent truth becomes their bullshit that they believe in.

317
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,260
I don't have an apparent truth.

318
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,400
What I'm doing is just bringing up the obvious that anyone can see.

319
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,740
Yeah, but that's part of the cult leader dynamic thing again.

320
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,380
No, it's not. There is no cult that brings up anything obvious.

321
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,840
No, but they tell their followers that they are, that this is obvious, this is true.

322
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,080
I never say that this is true.

323
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,440
No, you say that you will find out that this is true, which is equivalent.

324
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,040
That's even more kind of…

325
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,340
Yeah, I don't promote myself as a truther or having the truth like that.

326
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,200
I don't promote that at all.

327
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,500
You will find these things to be true if A, B and C, of course.

328
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,100
If you're mentally modeled.

329
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,020
Not all mental modeling is bad.

330
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,220
How is that not saying that they're true, though,

331
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,640
by saying you will find these things to be true at some point?

332
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,900
Yeah, or you might have found it to be in the past, and here's a little more on that.

333
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,060
Not all mental modeling is bad, by the way.

334
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,580
If you don't know a particular language and you're operating what they call an engine-driven wagon,

335
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:02,400
and you come to an intersection and you see a red octagon with some scribble language you don't understand,

336
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,760
the mental model is that that's a stop sign in any country, you see.

337
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,440
You see what I mean? That's okay, isn't it?

338
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,240
I suppose, but it's within the context of the whole culture, so is anything okay?

339
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,360
No, it's the context within the driving culture.

340
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,840
If you're behind the wheel of a car, which is basically a moving weapon,

341
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:28,140
if you don't think a car is a moving weapon, you're watching misfortunate things that happen with them.

342
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,900
No, I know that painfully from experience.

343
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,880
No matter where you are in the world, the car being a moving weapon is agreed upon,

344
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,560
even though it's not discussed, right?

345
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,220
No matter where you are in the world.

346
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,740
People will get out of the way of a car, regardless of what race, creed, color or age you are,

347
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,100
so that's understood.

348
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,160
You don't need to see it happen.

349
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:49,360
No.

350
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:56,100
So in this case, what I'm saying is that you are being run over with doubt,

351
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:02,920
with things that are doubtful, like the Pope's work schedule, that you're a filter bag with pressure.

352
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,120
You want to go on and on and on, eating seasonally, by the way.

353
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,840
I don't know if you've ever heard me describe that.

354
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,700
Yeah, I have.

355
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,440
Very important.

356
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,380
It cannot be proven in a lab, by the way.

357
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:21,760
It can be, if it's done relatively so, but not under a microscope.

358
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:30,020
So these things that people consider – see, again, if your physical body is in shambles,

359
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,020
you're not going to be concerned about anything else.

360
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,280
That's why torture is effective, right?

361
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,980
That's why they use torture, you see, because they know that they can overcome the being

362
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,620
if they submit them to trauma and pain.

363
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,420
So you need to be comfortable.

364
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,640
You need to be in a comfort zone and healthy.

365
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,100
Relaxed.

366
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,420
Consider, yes, or actually excited.

367
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,300
For example, in sports, you're very excited if you're playing the sport

368
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,640
and understanding a higher level of the gameplay while you're under tension.

369
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,920
You ask a footballer or someone, is he relaxed?

370
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,600
Hell no, when he's running for the line.

371
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:14,560
If he took a class on how to be a better runner, he's going to try to recall those things then under stress.

372
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,520
Like, for example, the police never talk to the police.

373
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,500
I mean, you just be polite.

374
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:27,400
You never interact with them on a level that, you see, is that stressful or relaxed?

375
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:32,440
Well, it's stressful, but you seek being relaxed because they're trained to sense tension.

376
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,560
So every situation is different.

377
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,920
That's why I bring up the things that I do and the modalities that I do in a shotgun.

378
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,520
What do you call it when one thing gets hit after another?

379
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,800
Shotgun style or buckshot, you know, when it's just…

380
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,680
Spray and pray.

381
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,440
Whatever, yeah.

382
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:54,160
I bring that up just to show that none of these things can be compartmentalized exactly,

383
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,240
with exactness in reality.

384
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,880
But, again, if anyone wants to do the effort, again, I do reports and put things together,

385
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,480
and I know how much work it takes.

386
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,960
When I mentioned to you when you sent the email, someone had actually done a 24-page with a table of contents critique.

387
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,100
I'd say about maybe 100 words were accurate, and the rest was what he heard, not listened to.

388
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:23,380
But you know what it's like to write 24 pages, finally edit it, and create a table of context?

389
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,180
Even a professional writer, that's more than a day or two's worth of work.

390
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,620
And an amateur could take a week or a month.

391
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:30,980
I don't know.

392
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:40,860
So I didn't really poo-poo the person because of their accuracy, but I actually admired the effort behind it.

393
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:44,740
This person actually could have been doing something else with that much energy.

394
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,620
How much energy?

395
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:53,860
So that means that this really affected this person enough to dedicate that.

396
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,600
And I was impressed by that, you see.

397
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,740
The email's rubbish.

398
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,140
Well, is it, though?

399
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,980
Because they may have misunderstood, but nonetheless, you communicated that to them.

400
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:22,880
Technically speaking, you can, but it might not be the best idea to just put it down to their impaired faculties for understanding.

401
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,780
You see what I mean?

402
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,040
Whatever the person hears is what we have communicated.

403
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:35,740
So if everyone that was listening to your stream came up with the version that this person echoed back at you, you would want to know that.

404
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,680
If everyone did, I would apologize for being alive.

405
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:47,120
I would actually get my vocal cords torn out so I never sound the same.

406
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,760
Years ago, I had some friends, acquaintances that were police.

407
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,860
And the uncle had a retirement party, and they invited me over.

408
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,480
And they said, Greek, when are you going to have a son?

409
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,700
So we'll take care of him.

410
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,800
We'll bring him into the force.

411
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,740
We'll make sure he's a cop.

412
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:14,180
And I said, if I had a son and he grew up and told me he wanted to be a cop, I would cut my nuts off and donate them to science for them to tell me what went wrong.

413
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,900
And they all just looked at me, and some of them smiled.

414
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,120
Now, did I mean that to offend them?

415
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,520
Mostly, yes.

416
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:30,660
I didn't mean to offend, but I was so taken aback by the thought of that, you see.

417
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,180
Sure.

418
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:38,520
But somebody else might have said that they would have kicked his ass, right, like they say, right?

419
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,400
I don't know.

420
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,120
I don't know.

421
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:47,260
But I know for sure there's about a half a dozen people out there that are able to implement what I'm saying to their benefit.

422
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,140
Right.

423
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:49,900
Right?

424
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,000
Okay.

425
00:26:51,480 --> 00:27:02,290
So I think I've given the example with the fishermen and others with cooking and healing modalities.

426
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:08,470
Once you understand the body is under a biological vacuum, you can do a thought experiment.

427
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:15,430
You're familiar with synthesized materials that appear to be, like, organic, like carbon fiber could be bone.

428
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:20,770
A sheet of silicone of a certain durometer rating could be like skin.

429
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:28,290
Certain silicone tubes could represent arteries, and certain silicone with fibrous material could represent muscle.

430
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:33,190
And certain warm liquids with 40 percent solids could represent blood.

431
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:40,570
Go ahead and assemble a figure of a human and put all those together with a pressurized pump in the middle.

432
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:42,250
You know what it's going to look like?

433
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,630
It's a massive mess.

434
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,090
It will not function.

435
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:51,490
Now, if you put a vacuum on it, yes, it will appear more like you see.

436
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:56,810
Are they applying this with their synthetic sex robots, do you think?

437
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,810
No, those are just the skin, I'm presuming.

438
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,290
No, they don't.

439
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:05,490
These people, you know, I've heard someone ask, what about artificial intelligence?

440
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,670
They don't even have natural intelligence.

441
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,030
You're concerned about their artificial?

442
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,770
It's a malevolent tool.

443
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:18,230
Just like they have lasers that if you put it on a human, it senses the temperature.

444
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,790
You pull the trigger, and it shoots.

445
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:24,250
But if your laser is not on the human, it senses the temperature.

446
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:26,110
You pull the trigger, no bullet comes out.

447
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,850
That's so you don't waste bullets.

448
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:28,470
Right.

449
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,170
Oh, that's so smart, is it?

450
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,990
What benefit is that technology to what?

451
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,490
Save bullets to kill more people?

452
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,030
You're sick people.

453
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:39,710
You see?

454
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:44,870
How about putting that same sensing technology in all your cars, so there are no more car accidents?

455
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,930
Even if you want to go ram the car into another car sideways, the car will not allow you to do it.

456
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:50,510
Right.

457
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,870
What about that?

458
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:52,650
You ever think of that?

459
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:53,070
Yeah.

460
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:53,430
No.

461
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:54,490
Why?

462
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,310
You're sick.

463
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,070
Sick society.

464
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:02,910
So how would you define benefit, then, in context of what you're doing?

465
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:03,530
Like, what benefits?

466
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:06,010
I hated eating rice.

467
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,530
I never even thought of cooking it.

468
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:07,990
I heard it.

469
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:08,410
I tried it.

470
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,030
Now I love it.

471
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:13,850
Not examples, but a definition of what you hope to achieve.

472
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:20,310
Living a life with more efficiency and with less pain, suffering, and ignorance.

473
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:24,370
Because, like, what's the benefit of that?

474
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:29,170
Do you remember I mentioned earlier, some people eat at a restaurant and they don't feel good

475
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,250
because you find out that the cook has an anger problem?

476
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:32,850
Yeah.

477
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:37,530
Well, you can't show proof scientifically that an angry cook will make food that will make you sick, can you?

478
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:37,810
No.

479
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:39,370
No.

480
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:40,810
Okay.

481
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:47,890
If you know a certain knowledge, if you know that you can't keep time with the Pope's work schedule,

482
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:53,430
then the plants, the bees, the whales, everything, the bacteria, nothing works on that,

483
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:57,210
and you are working in that field, this is an example again, perhaps,

484
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:02,470
you need to start recording moon movements to understand how these plants are going to repeat on their cycles.

485
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,750
You had no clue about that.

486
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,850
Yes, you had a clue about the moon and you had a clue about time, but you didn't know how to put it together.

487
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:10,490
You know what it's like?

488
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,650
It's like the Rubik's Cube.

489
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,290
Do you remember that?

490
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,610
Yeah, I remember that.

491
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:19,270
How about I gave you a methodology that no matter what position it's in, you solve it in less than 30 seconds every time?

492
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:19,910
Mm-hmm.

493
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,870
You could probably make some money as a teenager.

494
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,010
Not even that.

495
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,690
In other words, does that seem like a problem to you?

496
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,330
No, never.

497
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:32,910
In other words, people buy it because it keeps them busy for a long time.

498
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:33,730
Look, I did it.

499
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,390
Got you.

500
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,730
Or look, look what I could do.

501
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,890
I could do it faster than you.

502
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,830
After a while, it just becomes, let's move to the next thing.

503
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:40,950
Mm-hmm.

504
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:45,690
You know, if you've got a sore throat when the winter comes or the weather is changing,

505
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:50,390
do you have that little think bulb with a question mark like they do in the cartoons over here,

506
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,690
or do you have to say, I better stop eating tropical foods right now?

507
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,750
Okay, you kind of lost me with the thread because of the tune there.

508
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:03,190
Bringing benefit, bringing harmony, peace and harmony to the planet.

509
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:03,790
It sounded like...

510
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,710
No, the planet doesn't want you here.

511
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:06,270
That's the thing.

512
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,930
You're an unwanted guest at this point.

513
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:11,310
Not because you're drilling and toxifying the planet and all this.

514
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,910
It's because of the way you deal with each other.

515
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,110
I don't think you've...

516
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,190
I haven't talked about that.

517
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,430
This is more of the spiritual side in the years ago.

518
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:24,990
The reason why the earth is the way it is negatively is because of the way people treat each other.

519
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,250
Not because you're drilling oil and polluting.

520
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,710
The earth can transmute that.

521
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:34,670
If you're a real evil society, the earth will create pollution even if you never lit a campfire.

522
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,210
The earth is a sentient being.

523
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,950
I'm not going to get into that right now.

524
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,550
That's too evolved.

525
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:46,870
I'm not saying that you can't handle it, but you have to give background from scripture on that.

526
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:52,150
You know there are scriptures that address the earth and the moon and the sun and do not address you?

527
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:53,830
The scripture is for them?

528
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:54,750
No.

529
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:59,990
Why would you write a poem to a doorknob if the doorknob couldn't understand it?

530
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,450
Yeah, I don't have a problem with the earth as a sentient being,

531
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:07,630
but neither do millions of people that you would scorn as new age morons, probably rightly.

532
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,750
See what I'm saying?

533
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,130
It's not exactly radical.

534
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,650
It can become radical in the right context.

535
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:22,950
Not that I'm in favor of radicalism either, but this was all about a harmonious existence.

536
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:30,710
It sounds as though what you want to help bring about is a harmonious existence for human beings,

537
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,290
like you said, a reduction of suffering.

538
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:37,130
So you're certainly not going to find any argument from me with that.

539
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:43,490
The way you help is by first stopping them from complaining and taking control with knowledge.

540
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:50,630
Why does this car not start in the morning when I want to go to work?

541
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,110
Well, maybe because the spark plugs need to be changed.

542
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:56,130
Okay, practical knowledge, but at what point does practical knowledge...

543
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:57,990
It's all practical.

544
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,670
Well, knowledge of the gods is not practical for most people.

545
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:02,790
It's too bad.

546
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,370
There's an overlap there, for sure.

547
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,910
Obviously, you're talking out, you're pointing out with the scripture,

548
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:14,190
but if you give people knowledge about how to cook rice, they can apply.

549
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,110
It's very simple.

550
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:19,870
It doesn't become this big identity thing of I'm the guy who cooks rice properly.

551
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,450
It's just a thing, right?

552
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,450
Same with the car and all the rest of it.

553
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:27,190
But if you give people knowledge about the gods, the lateral realm of the gods,

554
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,750
the end times, the Middle East,

555
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:33,570
that's definitely something for the identity to hook into and invest in

556
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:36,730
and spin a whole narrative that makes their sense of who they are

557
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:40,350
much more exciting and meaningful, illegitimately, I would say.

558
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,730
Maybe I'm one of the chosen few.

559
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,590
I know that you try and counter those delusions,

560
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:49,250
but you may be feeding them with one hand

561
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:53,570
and then trying to take away that with the other hand, is what I'm suggesting.

562
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:58,930
Back in the days of Florsheim Shoes, when I walked in New York,

563
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,210
we had a meeting with some of the corporate.

564
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:04,130
They said, we're never going to replace our inventory boys with a real-time computer.

565
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,389
I know it sounds ridiculous, right?

566
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:08,969
Yeah.

567
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:14,330
So your point being that knowledge of the gods is not something to be skeptical about.

568
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,290
It's going to happen anyway.

569
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:21,409
The CEOs of that shoe company said we're never going to fire the 2,500 people

570
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:24,210
whose task is to do inventory, to replace it with a machine.

571
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:24,770
But did they?

572
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:29,110
Yeah, but that came about through people applying themselves and creating the hardware.

573
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:33,290
The Middle East Union will come about by people applying themselves to it, yes.

574
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:33,969
Right.

575
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:39,429
And the intervention of the gods is going to come about regardless,

576
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,469
regardless of what we do, I presume.

577
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:41,989
That's right.

578
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:42,469
Right.

579
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,290
So why do we need to know about it?

580
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:45,590
I don't know.

581
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:48,810
That's a personal problem or a personal interest.

582
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,150
Well, I mean, I'm very interested in it.

583
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,469
Like I said, I love this stuff.

584
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:54,409
I'm like a pig in shit in this stuff, right?

585
00:34:55,030 --> 00:35:00,890
It's not hard for me to believe and even try and live that belief, but I question the value.

586
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,870
You know what belief is?

587
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:02,390
Yeah.

588
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,350
Belief is based on knowledge, yeah.

589
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:05,210
And action.

590
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,450
Yes, if it doesn't take place, that was not a good belief.

591
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,490
If it does take place, that was a good belief.

592
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:14,710
Okay, well this actually points to one of the questions in my email,

593
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,450
which whether you considered it relevant, I don't know.

594
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,090
We'll find out.

595
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:25,530
But about prophecy and how you said that prophecy is the way to confirm the reality or the validity of the scripture.

596
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:29,510
And I asked, well, how do you know the difference between, you know,

597
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:33,330
the gods predicting the future and human beings believing in the scripture

598
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,330
and therefore bringing about the prophecy?

599
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,290
Oh, easy.

600
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,250
Easy.

601
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,490
And I've said that before.

602
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:41,470
It's because the human beings don't understand the scriptures.

603
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:42,690
Well, what if they do, then?

604
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:43,870
How do you know that they don't?

605
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,090
Yeah, that's a what if.

606
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,250
What if pigs would fly?

607
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:46,890
They don't.

608
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:47,510
No.

609
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:48,930
You can't answer that.

610
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,070
You can't answer it in that way.

611
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,510
They don't understand the scriptures.

612
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:52,630
How do you know that?

613
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:52,810
That's clear.

614
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:58,170
How do you know that there aren't social engineering groups that have done the work that you've done and applied it?

615
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:58,770
They don't know.

616
00:35:59,050 --> 00:35:59,830
They're not out there.

617
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:00,370
They don't.

618
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,370
It's very simple.

619
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,230
Okay, explain it.

620
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:06,790
Because what you do, Sherlock Holmes, is you go, you hear about the condition.

621
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:12,750
Let's say the condition is the humans are using it as a blueprint, I believe is the terminology used for memory.

622
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:13,410
Yeah.

623
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,270
Then let's start investigating.

624
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,910
Let's start calling these groups.

625
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,890
And who do you know that might be able to get you information on that?

626
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,170
How would you know who the groups were, though?

627
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:28,510
And after about five years of researching that, I found out that they don't know anything about scripture.

628
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,810
But you're assuming that all the groups are public and they're in the phone book.

629
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,290
No, I didn't.

630
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,170
No, not at all.

631
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:36,910
What do you mean?

632
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:38,850
They're actually quite easy to contact.

633
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:43,310
Yeah, but what about the possibility of groups and individuals who are not?

634
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,210
Public knowledge, who are operating secretly.

635
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:48,250
They don't know.

636
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:54,150
In other words, the people that are captains of industry and the different various levels of government you have,

637
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:59,190
you know, the public one and the private one and then the very deep one that's heavily occulted,

638
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:03,630
that's been continuous for thousands of years, they don't know scripture either.

639
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,890
How do you know that?

640
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:09,030
Well, let me just say I'm going to keep those cards close to my chest until the future.

641
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:14,430
And how about if I say if we get to know each other a little bit better,

642
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,710
I'll share some of that validatable information with you.

643
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:19,690
That's a big carrot.

644
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:26,510
Yeah, it's a big carrot, but let's just say even if we're not in touch, you will find out on your own.

645
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,570
I mean, why take that position at all?

646
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:36,710
I guess you could say, being honest, if you actually know this, this is a conundrum with a lot of your stuff.

647
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:39,130
Well, what I will tell you, this is what I have discovered.

648
00:37:39,350 --> 00:37:41,870
Let me just give a little bit on this.

649
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:46,050
What they do know is that the gods do exist and they have primacy, they are in control.

650
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:52,670
But they do not know anything about the gods in terms of what's going to be happening in prophecy.

651
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:57,410
And the ones that do know are ignored and it's viewed as a pet.

652
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:01,470
Oh, pat you on the back, that sounds good, we'll consider it and it goes off to the side.

653
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:07,570
So do you see a problem in presenting knowledge of this kind and then basically falling back on,

654
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,930
I know and you don't, but eventually you'll find out.

655
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,650
Or if we know each other well enough, I'll tell you how I know.

656
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:12,810
Never.

657
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,830
You don't see that that presents a problem?

658
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:18,630
No, like for example, some of the things that I'm speaking on now,

659
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,150
I would have never spoken about five years ago, or three years ago.

660
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:22,770
Right.

661
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:23,690
Ever, at all.

662
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:24,770
But in the meantime.

663
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:29,850
And if I am speaking in the future, I will say things that I would not say right now.

664
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:34,250
But where does that leave me, for example, in the meantime?

665
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:38,250
Like either I trust you, slash believe you, or I don't.

666
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:39,490
Yeah, that's fine.

667
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,570
There isn't much in between, right?

668
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,770
That's the same thing when you go to these big movie cineplexes.

669
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,430
Which movie do you go and sit down?

670
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:48,750
The one that you like and trust will give you a good time.

671
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:49,910
Okay.

672
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,530
I mean, you're talking about why do I need to convince someone

673
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:58,810
whether their personal preferences are viable or valid to them.

674
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,330
That's irrelevant.

675
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,850
No, why you feel the need to assert that you know something,

676
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:08,290
and then withhold any kind of explanation about how you could know it.

677
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,310
No, I'm not withholding it.

678
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,810
You could actually look and see the scripture itself.

679
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,670
Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.

680
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:19,850
No, no, because you're talking about actually being in touch with the Illuminati.

681
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,390
What you do is you glean from it.

682
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,410
Like I have them in my cell phone.

683
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,430
There is no such thing as Illuminati by the way.

684
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,130
Yeah, I know.

685
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:31,190
I was being ironic.

686
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,150
There is no such thing as Freemasons.

687
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:37,030
A bunch of people like to take pictures with an apron and eat pork at a banquet.

688
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:43,290
Did you grow up in an environment of social engineering,

689
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,530
let's say aristocratic social engineering or anything of that kind?

690
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,510
I'm neither going to confirm or deny that.

691
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:49,850
Okay.

692
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,710
Well, I did.

693
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,030
I mean, I'm public about it.

694
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,510
I grew up in a Fabian environment.

695
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,430
I didn't know it.

696
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,090
It was all kind of under the radar.

697
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,810
But eventually I found it out.

698
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,610
Yeah, and they don't know much.

699
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,190
They know enough about their traditions.

700
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,330
But if you ask them what their traditions are based on,

701
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,490
it falls apart very quickly like a cheap sweater.

702
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,210
You know a cheap sweater, if you find one thread,

703
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:13,570
you keep pulling on it, the whole sweater disappears, right?

704
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:13,870
Okay.

705
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,370
Well, I don't know.

706
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,610
I don't know how much they knew.

707
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:21,210
My impression is that they were just drunken, traumatized, dysfunctional human beings,

708
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:23,050
basically groping their way through.

709
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:25,370
So now there is specialized information.

710
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:25,970
There you go.

711
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:34,990
Yeah, but that does tell me that the mainstream alternate media narratives about Illuminati

712
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:38,010
and all the rest of it are both bogus and true.

713
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,670
Those are traditions now.

714
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:44,330
A lot of the data points are accurate, Tavistock and so on and so forth.

715
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,430
I've more or less confirmed them myself.

716
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:49,710
But the actual narrative is bogus, right?

717
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,190
Yeah, but hold on.

718
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:54,250
Let me interject while this thought just came up from the ether.

719
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:56,470
Go online and put in on YouTube.

720
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,490
I call it YouTube University sometimes.

721
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,650
The New Order of Barbarians.

722
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:07,190
Dr. Day did a speech in 1968 to a group of pediatricians in Pittsburgh,

723
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:11,950
and it was very prophetic because he was discussing about what the future of this culture will be like,

724
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:16,130
and he's mentioning things like videotapes, which didn't exist to the public at that time,

725
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:18,070
and various things that you see happening now.

726
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,670
And he didn't want to state the people.

727
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,650
And these are basically industrialists, right?

728
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:30,290
In other words, homosexuality was going to be used as a method of population control.

729
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:35,290
Food was going to be used as a method of population control.

730
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:43,090
Human rights, diminishing certain things and accentuating others, right?

731
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:50,110
So in other words, if you want to do population control, you promote sexuality, not diminish it.

732
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:50,890
Yeah, I understand.

733
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:56,830
This is part of the Fabian thing, and that was my family business, was the food industry.

734
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:01,610
So anyway, yeah, he's definitely talking about stuff that's relevant to me.

735
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:05,150
Listen to The New Order of Barbarians, 1968,

736
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:10,070
and you'll see these are things that have been happening in the past decade that did not exist in 1968.

737
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:12,230
So there is a group behind the scenes.

738
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,190
Yeah, okay.

739
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:16,650
And they're very efficient in terms of social engineering, let's say.

740
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,050
Not very efficient.

741
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,610
But they do get the job done.

742
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:22,390
Well, okay, so what's the difference?

743
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:23,170
Oh, I see.

744
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:28,190
The difference is your car is broken down, it barely got you to work, it's overheating and all that.

745
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,630
It got you to work inefficiently, not like a new...

746
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,390
It took you twice as long.

747
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:32,990
Okay.

748
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:35,330
It's taking them twice as long to get it done.

749
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,010
But they're getting it done.

750
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:40,890
It's like beating a nail with the heel of a thick shoe instead of a hammer.

751
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:46,670
By the standards of the average person about what is possible in terms of social engineering,

752
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:51,850
they're unbelievably efficient, hence you have these exaggerated narratives of the Illuminati

753
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:54,990
who micromanage every aspect of society, right?

754
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,150
They're not micromanaging it.

755
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,350
That's what I'm saying.

756
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:59,630
That's what I'm saying.

757
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:05,590
But they understand certain levers in the human psyche and the crowd psyche by which you push the levers.

758
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:13,130
Eventually you get this result, like you said, about promoting sexuality as a way to have a counterintuitive result.

759
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:17,230
If you can push it for long enough, then you'll see the results.

760
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:20,910
Yes, because in certain cultures you had sex to procreate.

761
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:27,730
Now they wanted more sex, but distract them from the concept of procreation by making other things more available.

762
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:40,090
Also, if you were to consider, let's say, how efficient is it being done, it's not going to be done, whether it's inefficient or efficient,

763
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:47,670
to disturb what I've been laying out about the coming Middle East Union and the arrival of what I call the mop-up crew, right?

764
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:48,710
No.

765
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,270
It's not going to affect that.

766
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:55,730
Have you ever heard me say when you go out in public and say you're doing this to make the world a better place,

767
00:43:55,730 --> 00:44:00,650
you have both the malevolent entities against you and the benevolent against you?

768
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:07,430
The malevolent because they never want to see it, but the benevolent because they know it's time to wrap it up and shut this guy up anyway.

769
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:08,810
You see?

770
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:09,310
Yes.

771
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:13,050
So that's being objective. That's neither here nor there.

772
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:18,670
And that's something that people can only contemplate and cannot promote as forming a group or anything around that,

773
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:21,990
because it sounds irrational to an irrational group.

774
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:29,210
See, when you go to a group that's irrational, not capable of rational thinking, anything rational will seem irrational to them, right?

775
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:34,330
It has to be irrational for it to resonate, like two tuning forks.

776
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:40,310
A 400 hertz will not resonate a 432, but you see, 432s do.

777
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,950
It still seems there must be an element of faith in your position.

778
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:50,930
There are many faiths, and then there is the faith in what?

779
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:53,310
The faith in what?

780
00:44:53,310 --> 00:45:02,690
The faith in what is that there is a realistic attitude one can take that based on one's relative length of their life, right?

781
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:08,190
That you seem things are a long time, and to an oak tree that's 400 years old, it's not.

782
00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:14,570
Can you transcend your own sensory and temporal limitations by doing what?

783
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:17,890
Considering what's been memorialized from the past.

784
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,670
Consider it first.

785
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:23,550
Scientifically, you must examine without contamination, right?

786
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:26,190
You don't mean by contamination.

787
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:30,970
Bringing in things that will change what it's supposed to be.

788
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:41,370
And the answer is, I'm telling you, very few people and statistically no one is examining what's been memorialized in the past with objectivity.

789
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:48,810
Yes, you could say, well, Greek, there's a lot of history and universities that do teach all that, but I'm telling you, it's all revised and it's bullshit.

790
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:54,510
You know, when you go to university, the real stuff is in the library archive.

791
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,790
The textbooks are bullshit.

792
00:45:55,970 --> 00:46:00,930
They change from season to season and from decade to decade radically.

793
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:13,740
And you know, one of the inspirations of speaking and using the term moron was when I was involved more in the physics side of things about a decade ago.

794
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:21,940
They started hitting all these young students, graduate students, with stuff like muons, leptons, bouons and gluons and all this.

795
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,360
I said, that's for morons. Rhymes with morons.

796
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,840
The cult of bumping particles.

797
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:33,700
I had Bruce recently read the curriculum at MIT nuclear physics.

798
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:41,340
He was kind of all over the place, but if you poignantly look at the graduate program, it's all about that Schrodinger's cat, Schrodinger's equation.

799
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,660
That's like cheap mysticism.

800
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,080
That's like gumball machine level mysticism.

801
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,280
This is your future.

802
00:46:53,400 --> 00:47:04,120
In other words, that the society, yes or no, does it or does it not expect the new crop of university graduates to be the leaders and workers of cognitive thinking and industry?

803
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,340
Yes, they do.

804
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:14,190
Believe it or not, in large industries, especially that are important, they won't hire you unless you have that background.

805
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:22,330
Then once you get into higher level stuff, they spirit you away or whisk you away for training to get all that shit out of your mind and show you how it really works.

806
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:24,570
What really is going on.

807
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:40,130
The other thing I've mentioned is that the common man, the average man, you brought this up, they have their own personal interests, whether they're a mail carrier, a cook, work in a thrift store, whatever.

808
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:48,330
When they want to learn about the solar system, they are trusting that the specialists in that are giving them correct information.

809
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:49,330
I'm telling you they're not.

810
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:56,250
When the average person wants to know about the human body, I'm telling you the medical technicians you're going to do not know.

811
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:58,110
So where do you go then?

812
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:07,530
I go to their stuff. If I want to know about astrophysics, I don't listen to what publications they're putting out in Astrophysics Daily or what they're in the textbook.

813
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:10,290
I want to go back to the archives. Very simple.

814
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:17,610
When you look at the NIH, National Institute of Health, on viruses, they have a very long PDF, almost a thousand pages.

815
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,510
You think if you read that, you'll know everything about viruses.

816
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:24,190
Well, hold on a second. I'll look at the illustrations, then I'll go to the conclusion.

817
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:32,610
If the conclusion states, even after all this research, we still do not know what a virus is, why the hell would you put your faith in that document?

818
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:33,230
Right.

819
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:34,510
You see?

820
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:37,350
I'm not talking from a heuristic point of view.

821
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:47,410
Certain developers, let's say in the early days of rocketry and airplanes, they used to use heuristics to make as many failures as possible, quickly, and document them.

822
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:51,050
So when they're developing, they know not to do those things because it leads to failure, you see?

823
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:51,650
Right.

824
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:57,930
So actually they're being paid to fail, to document what doesn't work, to start narrowing it down to what might.

825
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,440
So is that what the gods are doing now?

826
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,100
So is that what the gods are doing now?

827
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:13,780
Beyond that.

828
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,980
Well, the gods have declared exactly how it's going to go down before they even started.

829
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:20,200
And then they're making adjustments.

830
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:28,340
Just like an airplane going from London to New York knows exactly where they're going and how they're going to get there, but they might have to make some adjustments, you see?

831
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:37,340
Well, because it corresponds with my own... how I look back at my life at 50 is basically a series of failures, like just a string of...

832
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:46,380
If you remember what they were, you'll recognize them if they were to appear in a way that they were effectual, in other words, going to affect you, right?

833
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,780
You're going to compensate, aren't you?

834
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:49,800
Yes.

835
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,280
Course correction, you mean?

836
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:53,100
Yes.

837
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:53,840
Yeah.

838
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:55,140
Yeah.

839
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:06,600
But also there's something to be gained simply from failing and accepting failure, you know, as distinct from regret or remorse or recrimination.

840
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,740
It depends what accepting is.

841
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:19,700
Well, accepting is something that's determining my orientation as much deeper than my conscious decisions, let's say.

842
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:33,200
Have you memorialized enough details about that failure so when, if you were to approach it again, you have enough detail, so now knowledge of the failure is beneficial by avoiding it, you see, versus a general wishy-washy,

843
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:37,340
well, this might lead to failure, I've seen it before, but let's do it anyway, you see what I mean?

844
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:48,120
Yeah. No, I think to testify to that, that's why I can't separate the personal from the not, because my testifying is a lot about my personal.

845
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:55,860
You can never separate the personal, but what I'm saying, what I have, one of the crux of the Greek-speak is that take control of your personal attributes.

846
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,140
How many times have you heard me say that any field you're interested in is wide open?

847
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,640
I've heard you say it.

848
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:08,400
Yeah, and it is. But if you start looking at all the bullshit they're putting in front of you, like in science,

849
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:14,040
oh, you can't do this new thing because it requires a million-dollar laboratory. They're pulling the wool over your eyes.

850
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:20,180
Yeah, but in another sense it's not wide open because it's so tightly controlled in terms of how to actually...

851
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:24,960
Ah, I'm not talking about the social aspect, I'm talking about the field itself. How many times...

852
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,360
Exploring it, you mean, yeah.

853
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:32,340
Where knowledge is its own reward, like a wealthy guy says, Greek, you know, when you, when the Middle East Union comes together,

854
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:38,520
I'll back you up and we'll do a major thing, and he says, by the way, if you're so smart, how come you have no money?

855
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,820
And I said, by the way, you have so much money, how come you're not so smart?

856
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:43,500
Right, that's funny.

857
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:44,520
You see?

858
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:45,300
Touché.

859
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,560
Because knowledge is its own reward.

860
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,060
Yeah.

861
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:56,120
Knowledge, and this is what the ancient Platonics and a lot of the ancient philosophers, if you look at them in proper context,

862
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:05,840
now there is none, by the way. Students and people of philosophy now are idiots, and I could say that proudly, by the way, that they are idiots.

863
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,280
Not to their personal fault, they've been hoodwinked.

864
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,440
Proud of what, though?

865
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,300
Proud to say that these people are morons. In other words, the... your head intellectual...

866
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,260
In other words, anyone can say this once they've researched it.

867
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:24,860
When I say this, it sounds like this is a real cocky guy, and he doesn't know what he's talking about,

868
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:29,800
because we're a modern society, and our intellectuals, philosophers, and top scientists are brilliant.

869
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,880
I'm telling you, they're not.

870
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,060
Mm-hmm.

871
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,700
And I could say that with confidence.

872
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:35,600
Right.

873
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:35,720
You see?

874
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:37,120
Easily.

875
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,320
With yourself as a counterpoint, you mean.

876
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:45,560
Yeah, well, can you... do you remember... well, not only myself, a child can do it with a minimal amount of tools.

877
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:49,380
Have you ever heard of the Emperor Has No Clothes story? Are you familiar with that?

878
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,000
Yes, of course.

879
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,980
It was the... who was it that exposed what was really going on?

880
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:54,280
Yes, it was a child, yeah.

881
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,040
Yes, not the officers and the wise men, was it?

882
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:05,500
Mm-hmm. And I don't think the child was making a big to-do about it either, and thinking how smart he was.

883
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,740
No, but his reward was the given.

884
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,360
What was his reward? I don't remember that.

885
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:15,480
The given. Well, the reward was a self thing that you know that he's naked.

886
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:16,720
You know, yeah.

887
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:17,280
He's naked.

888
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,000
So he would have known that without pointing it out, though.

889
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:23,900
Yeah, where's the reward in going to a restaurant and having a meal that's too salty,

890
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,580
and telling the waitress, you have a new cook that tends to eat too many sweets constantly? Where's the reward in that?

891
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:39,800
Well, you know not to go to that restaurant again, and you know that you have the sensitivity to notice something like that.

892
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,000
That has value. And you've done your civil duty.

893
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,980
Yeah, but the meal was not pleasant, though, was it?

894
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,180
No, but that was a mistake, right?

895
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,500
Well, it was unforeseeable.

896
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,180
Yeah, it was unforeseeable.

897
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,620
Because you didn't know until it was too late.

898
00:53:54,620 --> 00:54:00,460
Just like I used to have a saying, what does Greek-speak and heavy artillery have in common?

899
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,760
Once you hear it, it's too late, right?

900
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:03,820
Mm-hmm.

901
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,380
Okay, anyway.

902
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:13,830
Right, once you hear the guns going off, then you don't have time to, yeah, it's too late.

903
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:21,670
So I give my time generously when I can.

904
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:24,830
If I can't, I let you know I can't speak or I can't be around or whatever.

905
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:31,970
But again, I think what's been put out is whether it's for someone's benefit or not, I cannot be attached to it.

906
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:41,250
And what I can report on is that I have gotten reports back that it has benefited a handful of people.

907
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:45,030
Now, one might even go to the extreme and say, well, those are not real people.

908
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:49,910
That's actually a bot AI computer from NSA playing with you Greek.

909
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:51,010
Mm-hmm.

910
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:51,370
Right?

911
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,170
I suppose, yeah.

912
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:54,130
You suppose, right?

913
00:54:54,250 --> 00:55:00,450
So how much are we going to speculate on and how much are we going to really take as fact?

914
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:06,770
It would still be a response, even if it was a bot.

915
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:12,670
Yeah, so in the meantime, food, clothing, shelter, why bother?

916
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:21,530
Don't get caught up in all of these mass cultish things that if you have the choice.

917
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:27,330
See, what I'm doing also is allowing people to – you know how many times you have so many choices but you really don't have a choice?

918
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:32,590
Like you'll have one food conglomerate that owns many other food, right?

919
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:34,270
And you think you're going to – but it's really the same.

920
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:40,710
What I'm doing is showing people that in a world where you think you have choices where you really don't, you really do.

921
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:41,610
Right.

922
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:45,730
Because now you're operating parallel to it and not in it.

923
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:53,030
There's a big difference between being on one of the lanes in the highway or being on the footpath parallel to the highway.

924
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:53,710
Right.

925
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:58,510
You'll get run over and you see on the other one it's more pleasant.

926
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:01,210
It's still pretty unpleasant, but yeah.

927
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,270
Yeah, because of the pollution, yeah.

928
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:03,930
The noise.

929
00:56:03,930 --> 00:56:08,930
But you know when the rush hour is over, right?

930
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:10,150
It never is.

931
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:12,730
That's right.

932
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:13,730
It's 24-7.

933
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:17,730
Because when you're sleeping someone else is going to work on the other side, let's say, right?

934
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:19,590
And this is a constant.

935
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:20,670
It's trampled on.

936
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,330
The reality is being trampled on.
