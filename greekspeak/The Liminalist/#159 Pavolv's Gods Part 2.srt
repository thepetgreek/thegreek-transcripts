1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,220
This is Jason Horsley with part two of my conversation with the Greek, or the Liminalist, the podcast

2
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:13,760
between.

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,960
I mean, would that, is that a good thing?

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,380
I mean, this is...

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:17,620
Yes.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,440
Back to this point, I keep trying to reiterate, but I'm not sure if you're hearing it, but

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:31,619
the, um, like, like you were saying that in order to define things and, and, and get to

8
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,760
grips with concepts, that's necessary to actually embody them.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,780
And my, my experience is the reverse, is that the definitions and the concepts have actually

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,020
come between myself and an embodiment, a relationship with my embodiment, with my body and my reality.

11
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:52,700
And I would say that goes a thousand times more for the gods, like they don't want, uh,

12
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,980
to interact with me, presumptuous to say what they want, but anyway, through a filter of

13
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,240
my ideas about what they are.

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,800
And, and, and so I don't, I don't see how you can represent the gods through language

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,660
without...

16
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,320
That's fine.

17
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,720
...missing so much out that you're inevitably going to be misrepresenting them.

18
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,220
And I think that you know that, that's my sense, is that you're actually kind of consciously

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,620
misrepresenting truth, knowing that you can't avoid doing that.

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,720
So trying to do it consciously, that, that's my impression thus far.

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,700
Well, the representation, the, what you're discussing is the stuff that romanticism and

22
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,840
art and, uh, uh, human, uh, culture is based on.

23
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,860
That's not what I'm going after.

24
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,760
What I'm going after is, are we looking at what's been memorialized about the gods?

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,440
And when we do look at it, we'll see that it is, it is extreme, it is very detailed

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,420
in many cases, even though the narrative is, is a void of many of the things that we consider

27
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,180
to be important.

28
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,340
You know, you won't find, uh, airplanes, rockets, and iPhones in there.

29
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,540
But, uh, no, what I'm saying is that there is no examination of what has been written

30
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:02,000
in the past or memorialized about them, as if everyone has recreated this environment

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,920
that they're living in.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,160
Like everything sprang into existence a hundred years ago.

33
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,460
No one is going back and examining, they're just trusting what is being said about the

34
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,160
biblical text, about the Mahabharata, about the, uh, Prakrit and Sanskrit.

35
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,840
So there's no accurate evaluation of it.

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,620
There's no accurate evaluation of science.

37
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,780
All of the scientists in the 19th century called magnetics the dielectric field.

38
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,460
Wow!

39
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,720
If you start teaching that to young people who have a scientific mind, they're going

40
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,740
to make progress in magnetics that you would know, you wouldn't know what to do.

41
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,420
It would push society 500 years into the future in less than a decade.

42
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,180
So, but it seems you don't really want people to think about this stuff, because you jump

43
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:51,460
horses so rapidly, you know, even in a single sentence, that it's impossible to really

44
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,400
keep up with all the correlations between what you're describing.

45
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,260
That's fine.

46
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:55,720
You're recording it.

47
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,540
Much less unpack one particular one.

48
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:57,980
Yeah, right.

49
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,140
But, so, um, oh shit, see, now I lost track.

50
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,360
So let's go back to the gods.

51
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,760
Representing the gods, there is no representation of what's been memorialized about them, at

52
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,000
all.

53
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,580
Sorry to say that.

54
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,600
There's no representation of what's been memorialized in the culture.

55
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:13,860
About the gods.

56
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,760
In the culture.

57
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,320
Yes, because the culture...

58
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,220
But you're doing that.

59
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,400
I mean, you're aspiring to do that.

60
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,220
Well, you're...

61
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:19,720
Am I doing it?

62
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:20,580
Apparently.

63
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,420
Because you're saying, this is what's going on with the gods, you know, in their lateral

64
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,240
sphere and all the rest of it, and this is referring to scripture.

65
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,880
But you don't, you don't actually cite the scripture.

66
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,520
Like, for me...

67
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,000
Why should I?

68
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,740
For me, it would be much more helpful if you were to say, this is what I know about the

69
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,560
gods, and this is why, and this is the passage in the scripture that I have extrapolated

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,160
this from.

71
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,600
Oh, but it doesn't work that way, because it's an entire picture.

72
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,660
Just like, for example, it's a jigsaw puzzle.

73
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,520
I understand, yeah.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,720
Various passages.

75
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,500
But at least give us something substantial to work with.

76
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,400
Okay, I understand.

77
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,440
I understand that.

78
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,900
I have done that in the past, but not as much, maybe, recently.

79
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,980
Let me give you an example.

80
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,700
For example, this is called the Christian era, and it's been dubbed so by atheist historians,

81
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,080
so you can't say that it's a religious term, strictly.

82
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,520
This is the Christian era, the past 2,000 years.

83
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,860
Whenever you run into these critters, that species, let's say, they start doing what

84
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,880
I call the McDonald's commercial, two old beef patties, special sauce, semi-semi-bun

85
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,220
on a...

86
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,160
Well, you know what I'm talking about?

87
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,820
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, like some kind of jingle.

88
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:27,120
They start saying, well, Matthew, Mark, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, 24, 15, verse 19, 17, follow and say, you

89
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,740
got to do...

90
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,320
You're a sinner.

91
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:28,940
Yeah.

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,580
I'm like, whoa, I didn't get any of that.

93
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,200
You know what?

94
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,280
As soon as I hear that, I am so turned off, and I don't mean in a sexual sense, but yeah,

95
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:36,960
that too.

96
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,240
If I...

97
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,980
If that would just be death to me, you know, I mean, death to me, cognitively.

98
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,020
Okay, but that's, again, that's pretty low bar, and it's the other end of the spectrum.

99
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,520
It's all low, but it's all low bar.

100
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,120
I was recently in an interview, and someone said, it's low-hanging fruit.

101
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,520
I said, no, there is no low-hanging fruit.

102
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,680
It's all fallen to the ground and rotten at this point.

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,480
Here's an example of looking at, and I say so many things, it doesn't matter if you're

104
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,700
looking at what's been memorialized in the past about any subject, because most people

105
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,980
say, oh, that's old.

106
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,820
They were primitive.

107
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,240
They're...

108
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,860
See, we're much smarter now.

109
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,680
We're modern.

110
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,340
Yeah, yeah.

111
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,720
Yeah, really?

112
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:15,500
Yeah, I know.

113
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,800
I know, but, I mean, we share that dissatisfaction, frustration, and even contempt for our society,

114
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,140
so why address that, you know, if we're already on the same page about that?

115
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,800
Well, because the mindset...

116
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,400
The mindset is very different.

117
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,120
I dare anyone to go look at an eighth grade final exam from 1890s.

118
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,740
A college professor can't get maybe two or three out of the 50 questions.

119
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,420
I dare anyone to go look back.

120
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,940
There are pretty good archives.

121
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,780
Read the newspaper from 150 years ago.

122
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,140
Look at the level of communication that's being illustrated.

123
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,100
Okay, but that's gone.

124
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,140
I mean, it's past, right?

125
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,760
Yes.

126
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,220
This is where we are now.

127
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,700
This is the reality of it.

128
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,080
Yes, but it's the same thing.

129
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,860
Look, you were saying earlier, it's a continuation of the ancestral, right?

130
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,240
So you're addressing the ancestors as well.

131
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,120
No, not really.

132
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,400
That leaves a bad taste in my mouth, because there's something called ancestral worship.

133
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,840
And they're dead and they're done and they're irrelevant at this point.

134
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,900
What's relative is how much of it that you're holding on.

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,580
There's something about, you know, they can't handle meat.

136
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,840
They can only handle milk.

137
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,200
That means like they're still on the mother's teat, you know?

138
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,940
In other words, what they're speaking and spouting is what their parents told them.

139
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,620
You see, versus, right, they're not, yeah, okay.

140
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:40,840
Okay, so looking back is very important, not because of the way, the style, and even

141
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,980
the quality, but also the quantity that you can bring forward.

142
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,640
Because when something is irrelevant or wrong, how much of the quantity do you have that

143
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,760
is relative or right?

144
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,540
It doesn't matter.

145
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,720
If you ordered a truck full of beans and they brought you a truck full of strawberries,

146
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,260
it's still a truck full, but how many beans do you have?

147
00:06:59,300 --> 00:06:59,620
Zero.

148
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,500
That's not what you need.

149
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,360
So you're talking about getting to the root, like addressing the root of the delusion.

150
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,900
It's a delusion, but it's also put on by the gods, because have you heard of the Tower

151
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,480
of Babel?

152
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,200
You know, they were doing something, and they were confused, and their languages changed.

153
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,700
What, they couldn't do hand language and sign language to communicate?

154
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,980
We do it here all the time.

155
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,740
They couldn't develop a method of universal translation, although it put the project back

156
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,400
a week, a month, or a year, and then resume it?

157
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,420
Why not?

158
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,040
Well, they did, I guess.

159
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:40,780
No, they didn't, because it confused their ability to rationalize why they were doing

160
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,540
what they were doing.

161
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,320
Yeah, but we're still building a Tower of Babel, is what I mean.

162
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:45,840
No, we're not.

163
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,960
And it wasn't even really called the Tower of Babel, it was a tower in Babel.

164
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,240
It's just like there is no burning bush.

165
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,860
You know, if you read the text, there was an angel that had fire, and he stood behind

166
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,180
a bush.

167
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,220
It didn't burn the bush.

168
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,100
No, it wasn't even a symbol.

169
00:07:59,500 --> 00:07:59,840
It never happened.

170
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,820
No, the Babel.

171
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,400
But the Tower of Babel is a symbolic language, I mean.

172
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,280
Yes, symbolic language, but then again, when you say apocalypse, it just means to reveal.

173
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,820
When they say Armageddon, that just means Har Megiddo, the mountain of Megiddo.

174
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,120
When you say the word nice, that means foolish, stupid, senseless, the way it's being used.

175
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,400
In some cases, the misappropriation of something might be appropriate.

176
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,800
Like I said before, a poor mechanic blames his tools, but a good mechanic can do a lot

177
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,600
of work with kitchen utensils, right?

178
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,059
I've seen that.

179
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,299
Use a butter knife as a flathead screwdriver, we'll get the job done, as long as it's not

180
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:35,860
too critical.

181
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:42,340
So I'm not saying the misappropriation of the language is essentially the cause of it,

182
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:42,980
it's all of it.

183
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,760
That's why I keep saying, why bother food, clothing, and shelter?

184
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,220
You're not going to be concerned about, you're not going to err philosophical even in the

185
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,240
slightest if you have no food, clothing, and shelter.

186
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,730
Because you're not going to have the luxury, you mean?

187
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:06,150
Well the body, the corpus, the carne, is going to overcome the spirit and the soul to the

188
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:11,010
point where its needs will be primary to the other things, you know.

189
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,090
And that would be awful, you mean?

190
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:19,930
Yeah, you're not going to be thinking, the example is a man that's dying of thirst, walking

191
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:25,410
down a road, he passes a guy standing on a pallet of gold bullion and money, let's say.

192
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,710
He'll keep walking.

193
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,470
And the moment he sees the guy with water, he kills the guy to get the water.

194
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,350
I was going to say, yeah.

195
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,150
It might not be lawful.

196
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,190
And then he goes back and gets the money, right?

197
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,530
So being, yeah.

198
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,630
So it's not really lawful, necessarily, if you're reduced to a primal state.

199
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:47,310
Yeah, but even in a sense, some primal state might say, I'd rather die than kill the man

200
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,950
who's refusing to give me the water.

201
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,630
That's primal also, so, you know.

202
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,330
Yeah, that would be a pretty high.

203
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:59,570
I would rather die than kill the man to, you know, it's not a personal thing, but I'm just

204
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:01,390
saying it as another perspective, right?

205
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,370
As a possibility, yeah.

206
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,890
Yeah, than kill the man for water, yeah, that would, that means that, you know, because

207
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,350
you know, ultimately, have you, in the book of, I'll cite something, in the book of Daniel,

208
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:14,070
there are three characters that are to be thrown into the furnace because they didn't

209
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,890
bow down to an idol, Shadrach, Midrach, and Abed-Dinogh.

210
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:23,230
And they said that our God can prevent us and protect us from your fire, but if he chooses

211
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,910
not to, that's fine with us too.

212
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:25,990
Mm-hmm, yeah.

213
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,170
You see, to me, that's like the ultimate trust in them, you see.

214
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,630
Yeah, but that's a very high aspiration, right?

215
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,090
We don't know until we're starving to death, really, like how surrendered we are to that.

216
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:42,310
You transcended the psychophysical, then, completely, and that's all misunderstood,

217
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:47,170
a lot of the Eastern philosophy about transcension, ascension, that's all, that's actually, when

218
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,890
you read the ancient prakrit and all that, it basically tells you that you are outside

219
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:57,110
of yourself, and don't, I'm not going to tell you where it is exactly, but this is

220
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,050
the concept, and you're not going to find it because most of these gurus and people

221
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,350
that, as sages that talk about it, don't care, they don't know either, right, just like Christian

222
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,970
gurus don't know that the Christ was not crucified, was stoned to death, because they don't read

223
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,370
the text.

224
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,130
But basically, in the ancient prakrit, it says you are outside of yourself, and when

225
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,810
you transcend what you feel, in other words, your feeling and your opinion, and you keep

226
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,930
that as your model, you will see clear enough to understand that when you lose the ability

227
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:26,590
to see everything, it's still okay, because you're always outside of yourself, you see.

228
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:27,690
Anyway.

229
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:33,210
You know, have you ever heard me give the metaphor of the Buddha, what it's about?

230
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:38,270
It's about living a life of integrity, when he was approached by a woman, because he was

231
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:45,410
known as a man of wisdom, the woman wanted the Buddha to speak to her child who was eating

232
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:50,990
too many sweets, and the Buddha said, well, come back in a month, and I'll speak to him

233
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,130
then, and she leaves, and she comes back in a month, and he does speak to the child a

234
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,490
month later, and then she returns to the Buddha and says, why did you tell me to come back

235
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,990
in a month, and you didn't speak to him then?

236
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,730
He says, because when you first came to me, I was traveling and eating too many sweets

237
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:03,330
myself.

238
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,930
You see, in other words, talk your walk and walk your talk.

239
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:12,650
How genuine would he be, even to a child, if he was eating too many sweets himself,

240
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,470
and told the child eating sweets, too many sweets is not good.

241
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,970
That's kind of disingenuous.

242
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,470
Why?

243
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,610
Because the child, you see, would the child know that?

244
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:26,310
No, but you see, there's an air of integrity that goes beyond, that measures what we are

245
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,390
actually doing, is the measurement and the reference of what we are doing.

246
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,990
So I got the impression that you smoke cigarettes, is that right?

247
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,830
Oh yeah, I do enjoy tobacco.

248
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,590
I suck on cigarettes, I don't smoke, but smoking hurts, because where there's smoke, there's

249
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:40,890
fire.

250
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,190
What do you mean?

251
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,170
You don't like them?

252
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:50,530
No, no one is really smoking, let's say, because if you're smoking, it means that you're burning.

253
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:51,250
Yeah.

254
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,470
So I'm sucking on the cigarette.

255
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,170
The cigarette is smoking, I'm sucking.

256
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,030
And then you're flicking a lighter, because I hear a lighter flick from time to time.

257
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:02,650
Years ago, when I would go on an airplane, people would say, smoking or non-smoking?

258
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,590
I'd say, well, the one that flies better, of course.

259
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,610
All right.

260
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,610
Yeah, I enjoy coffee, I enjoy good teas, I enjoy tobacco.

261
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:15,130
But how do you enjoy tobacco, if you're just holding a cigarette?

262
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,570
Oh, a cigarette, yeah, I enjoy the organic variety.

263
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,030
Wait, but you're smoking it, or you're not smoking it?

264
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:25,210
Yeah, well, I'm just baking, I'm being facetious about it, yes, what you call smoking is.

265
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,370
What I call smoking?

266
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:30,890
Well, what is called smoking, but because you're not really, well, in order to be smoking means

267
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,690
you're burning, right?

268
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,650
You yourself, oh, I see, you're being facetious.

269
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,810
You're being facetious, yes, that's all right.

270
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,690
Well, I just brought it up, because...

271
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:43,750
It's like the airplanes, you know, the airplanes, you know, smoking or non-smoking back in

272
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,010
the 70s, they would ask you that.

273
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,570
And the answer to that, you know, most people think is, you know, which one do you smoke,

274
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:48,810
cigarette?

275
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:53,810
And I would say just the one that flies better, of course, because if a plane is smoking,

276
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,490
you know, it's usually a hint that it's mechanically in trouble.

277
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:04,470
But, so how does that square with your philosophy about health and maintenance of the body and

278
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,170
all that stuff?

279
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,950
Well, that's an interesting psychophysical question that might air philosophical.

280
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:19,190
Where does one complicate, negotiate, or compromise their known physical ability for their likes

281
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:19,790
and wants?

282
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,870
Oh, I know it's hurting my health, but I like it enough that I'm willing to put up with

283
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,670
it if it does.

284
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,870
I'll give you a personal example.

285
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,350
If I find that it causes irritation and compromises my health, I stop.

286
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,730
But if I stop completely, would I be much healthier?

287
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,070
Yes and no.

288
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,410
I've spoke to some medical researchers, the kind of research you'll never get, not even

289
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,450
on the stupid rectangle.

290
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,430
You know what I mean about the stupid rectangle, yeah?

291
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:43,830
Yeah.

292
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,070
They did an experiment.

293
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,810
They strapped some tobacco.

294
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:53,250
They subjected various mammals to smoke, and some of them, about 12% came down to what

295
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,650
they call irritation in the lungs and what they call cancerous tissue.

296
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,330
And then they had the ones that didn't ever have that and were sequestered, and they had

297
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,970
less than 0.5%.

298
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,410
So you have 25 times more chance when you smoke.

299
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,030
But the ones that did not smoke the tobacco and they just had it strapped onto them as

300
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:16,210
a harness had an 8% irritation of cancer also.

301
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:22,450
So if you just walked around with a pack of cigarettes on you all day for 10 years, you

302
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,010
have an 8% chance of getting cancer.

303
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,890
That's weird.

304
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,130
Well, because it's by induction.

305
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,430
How is it by induction?

306
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,770
Because the body doesn't absorb anything, according to you.

307
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:34,870
Right.

308
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,330
So it's induction.

309
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,290
No, according to your body, and I'm just the only one speaking on it, sorry.

310
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,250
You say that.

311
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,450
It's pathetic to say that.

312
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,170
Define induction, then.

313
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,850
Have you ever seen an electrician come into a house years ago?

314
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:50,910
If they wanted to probe the wires, they had to open the outlet and stick a probe directly

315
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,390
on the wire.

316
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,810
Now they just have this pocket handheld thing, and they hold a button and they go into proximity

317
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:57,070
and then it starts beeping.

318
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,470
Oh, they have an electrical wire here.

319
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,930
Yeah.

320
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,030
Have you ever seen the...

321
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,230
Now I know the cars and the cell phones, you don't have to plug them in, you just put them

322
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,710
on a pad and it charges the phone.

323
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,930
Or the toothbrushes, the Sonicare toothbrush, you put it in a charging dock and there's

324
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,590
no obvious terminal contact.

325
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:20,490
Two coils work that way, transformers that take high voltage and reduce it to low voltage

326
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,390
work through induction.

327
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:29,430
If you understand the term, if you heard of a man called Rudolf Hoschka, the term vitamins,

328
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:34,830
vitamins that people are touting, he was the father of that research that we know about

329
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:41,130
and he came about it by stating that certain foods prevent certain illnesses like scurvy

330
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,970
and things, you know, like people on ships, we know if they didn't have citric, right?

331
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,470
So he said that certain foods have a certain vitality.

332
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,370
Maybe I can just extract the vitality of that food by making extracts.

333
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:55,330
And he would apply them to certain creatures that had deficiencies and he noticed that

334
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:58,570
the extract, not only the food, was where the vitality was.

335
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,690
And then he noticed that if he didn't even apply it to the creature but just kept it

336
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,410
near, very close by, it almost had the same effect.

337
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:06,750
Right.

338
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,390
Through glass.

339
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:08,690
You see.

340
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:10,530
Right.

341
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:18,069
So that indicates that the body is antipathetic to tobacco or vice versa.

342
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,829
Not only tobacco but to anything.

343
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:25,490
The body, okay, have you ever heard of a blood alcohol level?

344
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,589
Mm-hmm.

345
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,370
That's ridiculous.

346
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,330
That would be what people think about it.

347
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,830
When you drink alcohol, your body recognizes that it's something that it could reproduce

348
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,890
internally and it reproduces it internally and it shows up in the blood.

349
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,410
If it were to go through the intestine or the stomach, you would die from sepsis,

350
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,690
which is sepsisemia, which is a medical condition, internal poisoning, internal bleeding.

351
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:48,710
Mm-hmm.

352
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,870
Right?

353
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:53,870
Okay, and also you would lose your vacuum if it was porous.

354
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:59,930
Just like if you have a porous bicycle tire or car tire, it ceases to function, does it?

355
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,230
Right?

356
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,990
A flat tire is not functioning.

357
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:02,670
Yeah.

358
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:07,410
So the process of the body creating the alcohol is what gets you drunk.

359
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,310
For example, have you ever heard of someone drinking another person under the table?

360
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:14,070
They can handle their alcohol much better than another person.

361
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,030
Mm-hmm.

362
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:21,430
Well, they're biologically the same, pretty much, except for various obvious physical

363
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,770
features and blood types, maybe.

364
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:27,710
But one person is not as susceptible to the effect of the body producing alcohol than

365
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,070
the other.

366
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:33,150
The other person, when his body produces alcohol internally, is highly susceptible to that

367
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,430
reaction, which makes them drunk at a lower alcohol level.

368
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:36,950
Right.

369
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,310
Right.

370
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,630
Native Americans, supposedly.

371
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:40,870
Sure.

372
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:45,010
Just like, for example, if you know this is all electrical function, you can stand in

373
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:50,770
front of a monitor with one of your feet exposed on a particular plate of metal holding onto

374
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:55,490
another piece of metal, and you could actually pulse that monitor with a certain frequency

375
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:00,870
and a little bit of sound, and someone who's never smoked marijuana or cannabis in their

376
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:04,010
lives will show THC in their blood, and they will feel high.

377
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:05,050
Mm-hmm.

378
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:08,730
And also you will see blood alcohol, a very small amount, of course.

379
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,430
You can induce this into the body.

380
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:16,030
Just like you can induce a live band onto magnetic tape.

381
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:16,630
Can you not?

382
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:18,490
Right?

383
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:18,790
Right.

384
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,090
Microphone takes an apparatus.

385
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,650
If I give you the Beatles' White Album, what does that mean?

386
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,450
To a material scientist, he'll look at it and say, I don't understand what you're

387
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:29,910
talking about.

388
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,290
I see a disc of plastic with grooves of this material composition.

389
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,270
I don't understand what you're talking about, if he's just a material scientist.

390
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:36,830
Yes.

391
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:41,950
But you could just take it to any teenagers, put it in the computer if it's a DVD, and

392
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,530
he'll say, yes, this is the Beatles' White Album or something.

393
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:46,410
You see?

394
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:47,310
Mm-hmm.

395
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,050
Because he's not interested in the material.

396
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:54,710
He's interested in what the material is carrying on an intangible level.

397
00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:00,330
If I took the label off of DVDs or on a format and I showed you all these, can you tell me

398
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,970
what songs are on there?

399
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:03,530
No.

400
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,810
Without playing them, you can't.

401
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:11,090
I've seen enough clinical research studies that they actually deny things that they cannot

402
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,510
reproduce or produce in a clinical study in a laboratory.

403
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:21,590
They actually will deny the sky is blue because they cannot reproduce it in the laboratory.

404
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,710
I know this sounds ridiculous to you and I, and if you start studying what's called legal

405
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,670
or the justice system, they have some legal concepts that are quite ridiculous as well.

406
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,450
If you might be familiar with some, maybe not.

407
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,050
It's just like when you go to a physicist to find a field, tells you it's a wave.

408
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:38,510
What's light?

409
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:38,950
It's a wave.

410
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,050
It's a wave.

411
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,430
A wave is not what something is.

412
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,430
A wave is what something does.

413
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,970
If I'm waving at you, what am I doing?

414
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:45,570
I'm waving.

415
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,350
Am I a wave?

416
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:48,210
Mm-hmm.

417
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:55,510
They cannot explain anything because it's against your mental model.

418
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,310
You will not be able to grasp it.

419
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,890
For example, the reason you will not have real education is because no one will go and

420
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,250
will never be recognized as real education.

421
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,930
It will be recognized as something so far and irrelevant to the current mental model, you

422
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,030
see.

423
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:08,910
Mm-hmm.

424
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,890
That's why you can't, that's why I keep saying everything now has gotten to the point of

425
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:15,790
irreparability, unrehabilitatable.

426
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,350
People talk about fixing this, fixing that.

427
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,890
It's gone a little late to fix it now.

428
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,290
It has to be replaced.

429
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:25,650
Mm-hmm.

430
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,250
I'm not saying this.

431
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,770
This is a fair objective evaluation.

432
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,570
I'm not promoting its replacement because no man can do it.

433
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,710
Mm-hmm.

434
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,490
Mm-hmm.

435
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:45,040
But you have talked in such a way that you want to introduce information to people that

436
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,080
they can apply it and improve conditions.

437
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,920
For the sake of efficiency.

438
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,620
If you're inefficient, let me just give you a hypothetical example.

439
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,600
I'll stay very general.

440
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,540
If you're inefficient with something, does that even sound good?

441
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,160
No, it doesn't even sound good.

442
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,320
Inefficient communication, you've seen, we have ditzy blondes back east in New York.

443
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,640
Oh, she's a real ditzy blonde.

444
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,560
She talks and talks.

445
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,380
She doesn't say anything.

446
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,080
Mm-hmm.

447
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,720
You know, right?

448
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,200
It could be any haircut.

449
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,520
And that wasn't that funny.

450
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,780
That's inefficient communication.

451
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,360
She's saying a lot, isn't she?

452
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:15,940
Yeah.

453
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,720
Points like, Ross, can you be inefficient with an automobile?

454
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:19,820
Yes.

455
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,700
Can you be inefficient with the way you prepare things?

456
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,160
Yes.

457
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,060
Yeah.

458
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,680
It's for the sake of efficiency.

459
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,360
Right.

460
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,660
So it seems that was something Sam was trying to address with you in terms of him feeling

461
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:35,140
that you weren't being as efficient as you could be with your streaming, for example.

462
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:41,600
No, not at all, because this is not, albeit how much I disdain the concept of a group

463
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:49,120
in this society, like as illustrated by Gustave Le Bon and being a moron magnet, I have seen,

464
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,060
I have worked in industry where when you're given a task to solve a problem, using simple

465
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,580
terms here, you're given enough support to do so.

466
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,080
Mm-hmm.

467
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,980
And I have no support in this, and I never expected it.

468
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:06,440
Well, even without going there, even without going to the group thing, just in terms of

469
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,120
how much attention, time, and energy you put into...

470
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,720
Hundreds of hours.

471
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,240
...claiming about morons, complaining about morons, and so on and so forth, as opposed

472
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,240
to other things that you could be addressing, how scattershot your presentation is.

473
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,680
It doesn't seem to be streamlined or structured in such a way...

474
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,180
No, it shouldn't be.

475
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,540
...for maximum efficiency, for maximum efficiency.

476
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:26,840
No, it shouldn't.

477
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,020
No, but here's the interesting thing.

478
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:33,720
You could read any scripture, from the Hopi Indian to what they call the Bible, to the

479
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:40,580
Prakrit, to any language, and you will see that it is a redundant, albeit coherent once

480
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,240
you look at it in its totality, but if you take little pieces of it, it keeps changing.

481
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:45,940
Mm-hmm.

482
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,220
And it's, yeah, it's pixels.

483
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,620
You know, if you start looking at something very close, it doesn't make sense.

484
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,180
If you're in front of a monitor and you start looking at pixels...

485
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:54,420
Right.

486
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,520
...you don't see it, yeah?

487
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:02,660
But you cannot deny that a high-definition monitor has more pixels than a less-definition

488
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:08,400
monitor, so I'm putting out a lot of high-definition pixels that you're going to have to put together

489
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,980
and stand back and see the image.

490
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:11,780
Right.

491
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,000
Why would I, though?

492
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,120
Why would I want to?

493
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,060
I don't know.

494
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,400
Maybe it's not for you, then.

495
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,660
It just so happens the way that I'm doing it, because it's just about covering everything.

496
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,620
Well, yeah, but why would people want to?

497
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,500
I mean, this is back...

498
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:23,700
I don't know.

499
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:29,720
...to this point about my comments about cult, which weren't, to be clear, that I wasn't

500
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,820
suggesting that you were trying to create a cult or even that you were in danger of

501
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,420
creating one.

502
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:43,240
I was talking about the way in which what you do affects the individual, like if it

503
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:50,100
actually impacts them in such a way that they begin thinking cultishly, let's say.

504
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,580
I'm oversimplifying now, but...

505
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,040
The control that they have.

506
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:54,440
Yeah.

507
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,720
I have no control over that.

508
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,040
Well, you have control over your expression, though.

509
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:05,100
Well, then we go into what's called neuro-linguistic programming, where you always have to be

510
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,460
correcting what you're saying so it comes through objectively, and then you'll be

511
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,700
garnering another cultish group that likes that, like the Vulcans.

512
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,560
If you have a group of Vulcans, using a Star Trek analogy, if you're always bringing up

513
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,360
logic, eventually you'll open the door and you'll see they'll all be all Vulcans in there,

514
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,160
very few humans.

515
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:22,820
Mm-hmm.

516
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,820
But if you always bring up emotion and altruism and hope, you'll open the door, there'll

517
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,900
be no Vulcans, they'll be full of humans, you see?

518
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,800
So again, why do you want to be a moron magnet?

519
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:43,220
And I'm using moron as a medical term, a technical term, you don't really want to

520
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,800
hear me use pejoratives, right?

521
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,400
And no one does, it doesn't sound good.

522
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,720
Well, let me give you an example.

523
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:55,760
What inspired me to just say things like that is I've been in the company of what you

524
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,080
call chiefs of industry, politicians, leaders, and things like that.

525
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,040
I'm not going to state who, and people, you know, I don't need to prove anything,

526
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,300
I don't even find it distasteful to even say that.

527
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:10,120
Give you an example, here in the American Midwest, I was at someone's house, and

528
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,480
they were having a gathering, and they were using a certain language I didn't

529
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,760
understand, and I asked someone to define those terms.

530
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,640
And they were calling people, they have names for people, you know, the masses,

531
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,220
like we would say, if I say the great unwashed, yeah, you could say that's what

532
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,480
they think of the common people.

533
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,100
But they were using terms that I'm not even going to use, because I needed them

534
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,860
to be defined.

535
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,340
And I said, everything that's coming out of, these are people that are running

536
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:37,560
what you consider to be industry, right, and finance, and things like that.

537
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,960
They think so little of you, and at one point I said, why do they speak that way?

538
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:45,520
They said, oh, when you start, you know, dealing with things that they have to do,

539
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,000
you'll be using the same language.

540
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,340
And I said, no, I won't.

541
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,760
And I haven't.

542
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,840
I'm not.

543
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:59,560
But I do bring across the air that, very similarly that you'll find in scripture

544
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,640
as well, you won't find any scripture that says anything positive about mankind.

545
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,740
There might be some individuals that, through their actions, deeds, and they've

546
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,180
been chosen, have been spoken of as being positive, right?

547
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,080
Besides the part about being made in God's image, at least.

548
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,580
The God's image, plural, yes.

549
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,620
Yeah, yeah.

550
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,580
Right, and I've discussed that also.

551
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,280
That's misunderstood.

552
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:23,740
Okay.

553
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,460
So, but bringing it back to this thing of how you address people, your audience,

554
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,340
and...

555
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,360
I don't have an audience.

556
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:31,800
Sorry.

557
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,720
I don't have an audience.

558
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,100
Well, you do.

559
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:34,840
You do.

560
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,640
I mean, technically.

561
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,320
You've got people who listen to your streams, and then you've got the people

562
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,360
that you're talking to or talking at.

563
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:51,840
Do you factor into this the question of how we address people and how we

564
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,120
interact with them determines how they experience themselves, not just you,

565
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,580
and what you draw out of them.

566
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,100
Like, when we speak to people, like, you're, to some degree, I would say,

567
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:08,300
to less a degree than I would like, you're responding, you're expressing

568
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,240
yourself in different ways than you normally do just because you're talking

569
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,740
to me.

570
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:12,280
Right?

571
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,660
Very, very marginally, but to some degree or whatever, what you're saying

572
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,120
is going to be a response to me, and what I say is a response to you.

573
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,380
So there's a potential within that, that space of dialogue, for the

574
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,440
transmission to get stronger, for the signal to get stronger, and to reduce

575
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,840
the noise, the delusion, the bullshit, the moronic, you know, whatever

576
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:38,300
limitations I have, you know, whatever category you want to put me in.

577
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:42,080
It doesn't help if you address me as a moron, obviously, right?

578
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,980
You've got to factor in that I've got limitations and all the rest of it,

579
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,680
but you also, I would hope, want to speak to the best in me in the hope

580
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,380
that that would actually bring it more out, bring it more to the surface

581
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,260
by bringing it more into my own awareness.

582
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,470
Sure.

583
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:04,710
So what I would suggest on that is if you feel inclined to do that

584
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,890
and invest in it, you should wholeheartedly do that.

585
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,690
Yeah, well, that is what I do. I work in a thrift store,

586
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:17,630
so I have to deal with morons, in your vernacular, every day.

587
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,230
Well, I didn't make up the word moron.

588
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:23,170
I know, I know, but you employ it in a way that I wouldn't.

589
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,350
I would have done when I was 20.

590
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:24,690
That's fine.

591
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:30,130
But now that I'm 50, I've felt that I needed to go in the other direction

592
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,690
and just try and see the value in every individual I speak to

593
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:38,950
or interact with and, well, I don't know, let them know

594
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:43,410
or communicate to them that they have value in some sense.

595
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:43,550
That's fine.

596
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,630
And that's for my own sanity.

597
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:50,350
That's not because I want to be a good guy or a saint or an altruistic person.

598
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,150
That's fine.

599
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:54,850
It's because I've got to get through four hours of shift working in a thrift store

600
00:29:54,850 --> 00:30:00,130
and I can hide behind the laptop and just be like a machine,

601
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:04,190
but I don't know that whoever comes in the store isn't a god in disguise.

602
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:04,830
But that's personal.

603
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,410
I'm not addressing the...

604
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:11,290
You know, if, for example, if we have a truck full of grey marbles

605
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,450
and there's a blue and a green one in there also,

606
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:18,350
I could say that pretty accurately that's a truck full of grey marbles

607
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,210
and it's not pure, it's not reagent grade

608
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,370
because there might be some other colours thrown in there

609
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:27,070
but you can sell it as a truck, for example, as a grey marble.

610
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,590
But if I'm addressing the blue...

611
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,930
If I pick up the blue marble and I hold it up or the red marble

612
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,410
I won't tell someone that it's grey.

613
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,010
It's foolish.

614
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,730
No, I know, but human beings aren't marbles

615
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,670
and human beings aren't just one thing.

616
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,730
But no, human beings are moronic

617
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,050
and there are a very few that are not.

618
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,310
They're traumatised.

619
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,350
That's how I look at it.

620
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,730
They're heavily traumatised.

621
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:47,690
I'm stating a fact.

622
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,150
I'm not going back to their history.

623
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,010
I'm not representing them as their attorney in court.

624
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,190
Yeah, but it's the fact that they're traumatised too

625
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,890
and that's a root fact.

626
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,310
They wouldn't be moronic if they hadn't been traumatised.

627
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,590
Sure, but I do get into the trauma

628
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:05,950
and I do get into the aspect of people's refusal to address it.

629
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,950
Yeah, okay, they have a responsibility.

630
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,230
I'm not denying that.

631
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,310
But when I say they're not marbles

632
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:15,070
I mean that they're not fixed entities that are just one colour.

633
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:19,930
Sure, but those traumas I view as tools.

634
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:22,790
You're familiar with the Pavlovian training.

635
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,370
You ring the bell, you feed the dog.

636
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,110
Of course.

637
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,710
Okay, but are you familiar with the history of that?

638
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,490
That was near a river that overflowed

639
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,910
and the dogs were below level

640
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,090
and they nearly drowned

641
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,550
and they actually had to save the dogs

642
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,490
by putting them underwater and pulling them up.

643
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,110
If you've been around dogs you know how traumatic that could be.

644
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:43,470
And then once they had restored them into another laboratory

645
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,910
they noticed that all of that Pavlovian training was gone.

646
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,610
They'd ring the bell, none of them would salivate.

647
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:50,810
Because when you subject someone to training

648
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,530
or Pavlovian conditioning

649
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:56,030
then to erase that you subject them to a high level of trauma

650
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,010
and it erases all that.

651
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,370
That's why the media does what they do

652
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:01,670
regarding each modality through history.

653
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,270
Say more about that?

654
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,690
Well, for example, if the Americans want to go to war with the Japanese

655
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,070
the American government wants to go to war with the Japanese

656
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,290
and the American people are not having it

657
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,770
you just make some movies showing

658
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,170
Japanese actors raping American women

659
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,250
and all of a sudden the recruitment rate goes up 90%.

660
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:23,230
Right.

661
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,550
Because it's traumatic for an American

662
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,790
who's nationalistic

663
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,990
to see one of his own nationalistic

664
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,150
I mean nationalists being raped

665
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,710
by another extra-national

666
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,310
so that's trauma to them.

667
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,970
Mild level, but yeah.

668
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,710
Yeah, but if you showed them the Japanese were having tea

669
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,010
then that's not trauma

670
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:43,470
they say, oh fine, even more reason not to go to war.

671
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,170
Yeah, yeah.

672
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:47,310
So you can use trauma to manipulate people

673
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,810
Right, that's why they keep showing what they do

674
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:51,550
in media and in church

675
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:54,070
why do they just have a guy nailed to a cross wearing a diaper?

676
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,230
But I'm not sure you can use trauma

677
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,470
to straighten people out

678
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,750
I don't think that's an illusion.

679
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:03,110
No, but I'm saying it's a very real thing

680
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,490
that affects the psyche

681
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:06,410
and it's being used on you

682
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:09,270
Yeah, but that it can be used therapeutically

683
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:09,750
I'm saying

684
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,810
I think is a lie.

685
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,390
Well, therapeutically

686
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,030
a lot of what they call therapeutic

687
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,290
is actually quite destructive

688
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,710
Do you think taking

689
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,790
experimental drugs is therapeutic?

690
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,170
Do you think electric shock

691
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,070
is a lot of the things that it's doing?

692
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:23,810
Yeah, of course not.

693
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,110
You know, I might say

694
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:30,970
someone

695
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,250
in jest again

696
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:35,650
someone says, well Greek, I like listening to your stuff

697
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,250
even though I don't understand it

698
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,910
I say, well then it must have a therapeutic effect then

699
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,610
not a cognitive one, you see.

700
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,550
You know what I mean?

701
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,890
So that's fine too.

702
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,070
I'm still on the fence about that

703
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:48,890
because sometimes

704
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:51,130
it matters to me

705
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,070
where I put my attention

706
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,670
whether it's nourishing me

707
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,590
and enhancing my experience of myself

708
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,270
which is back to my point about

709
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,910
human beings not being marbles

710
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,990
the way we interact with them

711
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,410
the climate that we provide

712
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,070
for them, the psychic climate

713
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:09,449
determines how they experience themselves

714
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,350
and how they are

715
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,469
not in a massive way

716
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,790
They're not marbles, but factually

717
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,310
you're either someone's pet

718
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:18,210
or you're someone's dinner, spiritually

719
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,389
factually

720
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:22,290
the majority of people are someone's dinner

721
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,050
in other words, they're feeding off of you

722
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:24,690
your energy

723
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:27,710
or you're someone's pet

724
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,130
that's what the group or the cult is

725
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,090
you've heard of teacher's pet, right?

726
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,550
the leadership returns

727
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,570
with gratitude for their presence

728
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,889
and their interest

729
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,010
It's still circumstantial, isn't it?

730
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,909
I mean, there's still aspects

731
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:45,010
of the totality

732
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:45,650
of the gods

733
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,810
There's a hundred shades of grey

734
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,290
but let's not forget that grey

735
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:53,170
is a compound of white and black

736
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,690
and if it's dim enough

737
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,550
the grey does look very dark and be black

738
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,990
and if it's bright enough, the grey could appear to be white

739
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,370
so, you know, the ultimate

740
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:06,670
thing

741
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,250
is are you doing the right thing

742
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,250
for example

743
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,890
I've gotten about 900 emails

744
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,330
in the past year and a half

745
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:17,490
800

746
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,430
almost 900

747
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:22,150
all but 2 or 3 have been positive

748
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,210
all of them are positive

749
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:26,410
but what kind of positive is the thing?

750
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:27,570
Oh, I heard

751
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:30,210
I never considered, for example, the body having a vacuum

752
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,370
and I understood that

753
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,570
now it made sense to me when I have a wound

754
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,910
to wrap it really tight

755
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,590
almost critically tight

756
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:39,030
to the point where it's not good

757
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,050
and then release it

758
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,010
and I see the healing happening very quickly

759
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,490
I'd never thought of that

760
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:44,510
Thank you very much

761
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,590
Oh, I never knew how to cook rice before

762
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,610
I was always afraid of it

763
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,170
as a matter of fact

764
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:50,170
I didn't even like rice

765
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,370
and I listened to you talk about

766
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,330
making rice

767
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,570
and now I make the best rice

768
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,730
Even someone from a restaurant

769
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:56,630
said we've improved

770
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:58,650
Timekeeping

771
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:01,230
I do planting or I do fishing

772
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,590
You know, the fish migrate

773
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,470
on a time schedule

774
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,130
that's not the Pope's work schedule

775
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,130
You've heard me say the Pope's work schedule, right?

776
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:10,310
Obviously, yeah

777
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:13,790
And these people, these commercial fishermen

778
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,430
have developed radar to follow these

779
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,730
fish, but they've noticed that within a two-week

780
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,850
spread during the year, they come across there

781
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,710
Is it because your calendar

782
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,890
could be off as much as two weeks in a year

783
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,430
meaning the real day where the

784
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,170
position of the earth is to the sun, to the moon, to the stars

785
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,910
The fish don't care about what you

786
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,610
call a day, but if you record

787
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:33,570
the day that you've encountered that

788
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,570
school of fish

789
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,470
using the moon phases

790
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,050
and the month count

791
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,810
you'll go back there next year, and I had someone report

792
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:43,790
back, they were doing cod fishing

793
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,870
they were going to go out in a few

794
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,850
days because it was approaching that time

795
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,510
and he had heard what I was saying

796
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,450
we're talking about

797
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,750
a 400 foot boat with a crew of 30 people

798
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,770
it costs a million dollars a day

799
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,210
this is not trivial

800
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,870
maybe it is to some

801
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:01,650
a million dollar day operation could be trivial

802
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:02,470
but I don't know

803
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,150
depends who's relative

804
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,330
he says no, tomorrow

805
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:09,250
is the day that we found them

806
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,230
we need to go out right now

807
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,230
and the captain says

808
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,590
you know what, I wanted to speed up

809
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:17,610
this operation in a way to test these new pumps

810
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,870
so let's go out by tomorrow

811
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,430
and guess what

812
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:24,190
they got the front end of the school

813
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,670
not the second or third one

814
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,610
that passed by

815
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,830
and they can tell that by the material

816
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,930
fish have a culture

817
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,430
they have the alpha dog lead

818
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,530
fish also have

819
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:38,050
there are certain fish that go first

820
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:38,630
like tuna

821
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,650
anyway

822
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:44,110
so he emailed me back

823
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:44,710
and he's saying

824
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,370
Greek

825
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:48,210
this is the best catch we've ever had in history

826
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:50,290
thanks to you

827
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,150
and I'm like, thanks to me

828
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,890
let's be real rash

829
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,030
about it and rationale

830
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,610
what am I getting for it

831
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,090
do I get a cut of the catch

832
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,630
oh no, I think if I brought that up

833
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,530
that would never fly

834
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:04,730
yeah, thanks

835
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:06,990
you see

836
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:08,890
oh, are you doing it for money

837
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:09,910
no, how about

838
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,110
when I have a used car

839
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,030
and I get another car

840
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,270
I give it away

841
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:17,350
people say I'm going to sell the old one and offset the cost of the new one

842
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,970
why go through all that hassle

843
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,350
I don't want to start meeting people

844
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,090
and telling me what they like or don't like

845
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,850
about the car and haggling on the price

846
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:27,530
I've gotten 8 years or 9 years use out of it

847
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,350
it's paid for itself to me

848
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:31,190
and recently

849
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,570
I was doing that and a neighbor was laughing at me

850
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,450
he said we got another car

851
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,770
what are you going to do with that one

852
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,130
give it away, ha ha ha

853
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,570
you're really stupid for giving it away

854
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,470
I shouldn't even be saying this

855
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,670
these are personal things

856
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,970
now I'm being mocked

857
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:49,070
by those around me

858
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,570
because I'm giving a car away

859
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,590
who are you going to give it away to

860
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:55,890
someone in need

861
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,410
but someone in need who can care for it

862
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,490
not someone who's broke that's going to run out of gas

863
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:01,610
and leave it on the side of the road

864
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,970
you have to give it away responsibly

865
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,570
to a responsible party as well

866
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:07,010
don't you

867
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,670
yeah

868
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,090
so I have a lot of

869
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:12,670
background

870
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,490
experience in history

871
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:17,870
that I don't bring forward

872
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:20,710
why don't you like to talk about

873
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,350
personal stuff

874
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,530
why should I

875
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,570
why don't you want to

876
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,530
because it's not relevant

877
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,990
I'm addressing

878
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,650
you've heard of like would like

879
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,190
the concept of parody

880
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,710
if you're addressing a culture

881
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,490
you address it on a cultural level

882
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,070
so you're talking to the culture

883
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,650
you're not talking to human beings

884
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,530
no, no, not at all

885
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,150
you're not

886
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,150
it's you and the culture

887
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,770
it sounds pretty lonely

888
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,870
no wonder you're so pissed off

889
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,500
you know some people

890
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,200
I've had some people do pilgrimages

891
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,780
they say I'm in Tucson or whatever

892
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,560
that's close enough

893
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,080
and they fly in from different parts of the world

894
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,020
I'm serious

895
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,180
and I've had four in the past two years

896
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:15,880
and they just call me

897
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,860
I'm at the airport in Tucson

898
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,680
I said what are you doing here

899
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,860
he said I wanted to come and see you

900
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,420
I said why

901
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,100
and I do spend some time with them

902
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,320
they're like you're completely different

903
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,120
you're like so whatever

904
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,260
very different

905
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,640
you're not mad

906
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:30,920
you're very kind

907
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,660
now it sounds like I'm

908
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,380
I get it

909
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,400
I'll throw another thing

910
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,340
it's like wow you've paid for everything

911
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,420
and I send them off with gifts

912
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,080
but why do you address

913
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,880
that baffles me

914
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,020
why do you separate human beings from the culture

915
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,960
or vice versa

916
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,100
you don't separate them

917
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,180
and you do separate them

918
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,740
in other words when you're addressing a culture

919
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,540
of headhunters

920
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,400
if you're going to start addressing that they have

921
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,400
purple polka dot wallpaper in their kitchen

922
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,260
that's only relevant

923
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,300
to those that have that

924
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,180
but if you're addressing shrunken heads

925
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,280
you're addressing all of them

926
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,160
why would you want to talk to shrunken heads

927
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,100
no you're addressing the issue of shrunken heads

928
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,940
to the society of headhunters

929
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,260
the main points

930
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,520
that I bring up

931
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,240
is that your body is not a filter bag

932
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,820
you're on the pope's work schedule

933
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,380
you don't even know how to keep time

934
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,720
you have no money

935
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,020
you're on a credit based economy

936
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,480
because all of your governments are bankrupt

937
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,220
and they have to give you credit to function

938
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,880
but the attorneys have determined

939
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,120
that if they tell you that no one's going to want to work

940
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,480
that's how piss poor

941
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,040
in terms of responsibility

942
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,260
you've been determined to be

943
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,680
whether you are or not

944
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,240
is not the point

945
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,900
those that lead you have determined

946
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,100
that they have to lie to you

947
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,920
you know nothing about your history

948
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,880
you don't want to go back more than 100 years

949
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,160
you don't know how to manage water

950
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,600
you can't even define the weather

951
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,700
birds don't fly

952
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,660
birds are flown

953
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,700
a bird will not fly in a vacuum

954
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:07,980
you put a little gasp air mask

955
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,560
on a bird

956
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,840
he'll flap his wings

957
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,740
he's not going anywhere

958
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,280
and if you leave him in there long enough

959
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,280
he won't even try anymore

960
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,840
this is the list of radical info

961
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,100
that each one is a rabbit hole

962
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,900
unto itself

963
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,620
but from what you've said

964
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,020
the reason you're presenting all this stuff

965
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,200
is basically so that you

966
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,500
have got a clear record

967
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,440
that you can say

968
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,720
I told people so don't blame it on me

969
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,480
yeah that's true

970
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,440
because if you're doing good for selfish reasons

971
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,800
you're still doing good also

972
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:39,740
aren't you?

973
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,560
she gave a million dollars

974
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,940
let's say Canadian or American

975
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:43,820
what they call dollars

976
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,880
to an orphanage

977
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,480
because if you spent a million

978
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,880
on advertising in newspapers

979
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,600
no one would look at it

980
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,060
but if you got the publicity

981
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:51,700
that you gave

982
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:52,720
everyone would consider

983
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,180
you see

984
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,500
the reason the company

985
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,460
gave a million dollars

986
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,140
to the orphanage

987
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,760
is not because they're

988
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,560
charity

989
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,020
it's because they'll get more out of their advertising money

990
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,400
than if they spent a million on front page cover

991
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,440
it's debatable that that's doing good though

992
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,300
it depends on where the money goes

993
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,760
then it depends on the orphanage

994
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,680
we'll pick something else

995
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,880
let's say starving people

996
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,360
let's not call it an orphanage

997
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,940
I'll use our example

998
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,200
we have this thrift store

999
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,760
once a week we buy food

1000
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,520
and we feed it to the hungry and the homeless

1001
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,440
that's a good business policy

1002
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,020
although it makes a lot of people in the town dislike us

1003
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:28,720
but nonetheless

1004
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,560
are we doing it good

1005
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,280
because what are our reasons

1006
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,220
they're all kind of mixed up together

1007
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,460
but the end result

1008
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:39,200
one of them is that people are getting fed

1009
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,780
well the competitors

1010
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,560
will not like it because they didn't pull a stunt like that

1011
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,660
you know the corporation that gave a million to the orphanage

1012
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,400
their marketing people

1013
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,480
didn't determine that

1014
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,000
marketing people wouldn't determine that

1015
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,560
because they can't collect fees for that

1016
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,620
but here's the point

1017
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,200
years ago, more than 15 years ago

1018
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,520
when I was discussing these things

1019
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,500
or about that time

1020
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,360
people would say you need to start telling

1021
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,240
you need to write a book

1022
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,500
I said well in order to write a book

1023
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,020
I have to presume that people can read with comprehension

1024
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,440
writing a book is a good thing

1025
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,200
but when you put that out

1026
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,460
you're presuming that people can read with comprehension

1027
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,880
when you talk and stream

1028
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,000
you're presuming that people will be able to

1029
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,200
flatten this stuff out and apply it in a way

1030
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,720
that is rooted and grounded

1031
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,400
not all people

1032
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,860
very few and very few do

1033
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,160
exactly my point

1034
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,340
that's why for me

1035
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,000
to make an arbitrary distinction

1036
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,620
between personal information

1037
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,660
and impersonal

1038
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:37,900
can be self-sabotaging

1039
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,020
because I actually want to know stuff about you

1040
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:40,800
or get a sense of you

1041
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,900
not because I'm curious

1042
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,900
but because I want the context for this stuff

1043
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,840
that to me

1044
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,500
it roots it

1045
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,560
in something that is real and tangible

1046
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,880
however mundane

1047
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,760
or trivial

1048
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,080
other people see it right away

1049
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,280
other people do some research

1050
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,140
some people want it given to them

1051
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,560
like you're asking

1052
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,560
that's up to you

1053
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,480
well no it isn't

1054
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,340
it's up to you

1055
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,940
how you present it

1056
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,480
and then I'm one of your listeners

1057
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,280
who's saying

1058
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,000
I don't really expect to change what you're doing

1059
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,060
by making any of these suggestions

1060
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,720
but that's how

1061
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,000
I have a dialogue with you

1062
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,320
by sharing my experience of what you're doing

1063
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,600
that's one aspect

1064
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,560
the focus is on you and the information

1065
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,120
and so on and so forth

1066
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,680
there's so much of the latter

1067
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,620
the information that we could

1068
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,580
have a three hour chat

1069
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,680
for a year

1070
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,080
and we wouldn't get through all of these bullet points

1071
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:36,880
that you're presenting

1072
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,220
so then I want to keep bringing the focus back to you

1073
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,160
which ironically is where you don't want it to be

1074
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,260
in a sense

1075
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,760
or at least not the personal you

1076
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,820
it's not like I want personal

1077
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,500
information about you

1078
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,680
I'm not like Yo-Yo Ma the cello player

1079
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,900
who has mastered the cello

1080
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,880
at nine or ten

1081
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,780
you can just put the cello up on stage

1082
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,160
and anyone try to play it

1083
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,040
no one's going to play it like this cello master

1084
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,640
I'm not

1085
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,640
producing anything that is unique to me

1086
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,200
other than the

1087
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:09,640
persona

1088
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,200
I know but it's coming through you

1089
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,320
the other medium and the message in the medium

1090
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,900
are pretty hard to extricate

1091
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,680
I don't think they can be

1092
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,540
I happen to be a point source

1093
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,140
for it at the moment

1094
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,440
a small point source

1095
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:25,800
that emanates a field

1096
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,060
in a more 360

1097
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,560
or 180 degree cone

1098
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,100
or view

1099
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,140
so

1100
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,860
that might be

1101
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,180
and it's unfortunate

1102
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,900
and I'm embarrassed to be human

1103
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,060
because most of the stuff that I mentioned

1104
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,020
you can access immediately

1105
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,260
as a source

1106
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:45,580
say for example timekeeping

1107
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,700
in the Pope's work schedule

1108
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:48,460
some people like it hits them across the head

1109
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:49,240
like a baseball bat

1110
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,660
how come I never saw that before

1111
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,780
so simplistic

1112
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,820
other people want to go and study

1113
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,980
the fine detail of the Papal Bull of 1585

1114
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:58,040
and other people start

1115
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,660
looking at various calendrical systems

1116
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,460
and how it evolved

1117
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,240
and that's fine, that's their prerogative

1118
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,160
but I'm telling you, you don't know how to keep time

1119
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:04,760
period

1120
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,000
other than the subject

1121
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,140
bullshit

1122
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,180
and it is bullshit

1123
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:13,960
not because I say it, because they say it's bullshit

1124
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:15,760
so

1125
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,140
on the example of timekeeping

1126
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,980
that is an area that I'm interested in

1127
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,640
we could talk about that for many hours

1128
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,360
I do want to find out more

1129
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,900
but before I jump down that rabbit hole

1130
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:27,960
or commit to it

1131
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,360
I want to find out more about you

1132
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,880
I have a history of following

1133
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,140
dodgy leaders

1134
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,800
of getting sucked into dodgy information

1135
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,520
matrices

1136
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,740
which you know all about

1137
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,120
and whether you like it or not

1138
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,460
you're participating in that

1139
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,460
this is a leader list

1140
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:47,980
and that should be obvious

1141
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,840
you're on the internet

1142
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,780
you're disseminating on the internet

1143
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,100
so when you say everything on the internet is bullshit

1144
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,840
you have to include yourself

1145
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,160
it's not as though there's a dividing line

1146
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,600
you've been on the Freeman show

1147
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,440
for fuck's sake, pardon my French

1148
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:04,120
but that's about as moronic

1149
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,520
alternative media

1150
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,860
as I could think of

1151
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,540
so you chose not to bad mouth anyone

1152
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,600
I don't personally like to do that

1153
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,280
but seeing as you do

1154
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,760
talk about that a lot

1155
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,800
why don't you walk your talk

1156
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,300
why would you do the Freeman show

1157
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,060
when you must know that that's

1158
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,860
just as big a bullshit matrix

1159
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,580
as any of the other ones

1160
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:27,080
that you're not naming

1161
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:29,720
well because why

1162
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,740
then I'd have to get into what was going on

1163
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,300
before to get me on the Freeman show

1164
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:33,940
and

1165
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:37,720
what makes you think

1166
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,720
that I didn't tell Freeman that it's all bullshit

1167
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,080
and he agreed to it anyway

1168
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,080
but you didn't tell him on the show

1169
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,280
well

1170
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,140
maybe it was edited out

1171
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,680
that's possible

1172
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,600
but he invited you back

1173
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,880
and he's not airing anymore

1174
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,400
he has more interviews

1175
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,260
because it's not conducive to

1176
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:00,900
accommodating the audience

1177
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,040
and it shouldn't be

1178
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:04,860
but the reason why I say

1179
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,160
it's just like I say

1180
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,000
I'm taking a cross section

1181
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,640
of it right now

1182
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,180
of the internet

1183
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,040
why I'm on the internet

1184
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,760
because it's efficient

1185
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,320
I would rather not be

1186
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,160
but it is the most efficient way to do it

1187
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,540
in terms of doing it in print

1188
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,020
and sending it out

1189
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:22,440
and publishing it on pulp

1190
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,720
physical pulp paper

1191
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:28,360
this seems to be the convention

1192
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,260
just like for example

1193
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:30,940
money is now electronic convention

1194
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,320
versus paper convention

1195
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,920
or substance before that

1196
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,600
so

1197
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,420
what I do say is

1198
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:40,020
it is all crap right now

1199
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,500
just like this is a truck

1200
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:44,320
of grey marbles

1201
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,880
there might be some others

1202
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,340
in there whatever tolerance

1203
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:49,800
based on the tolerance that if you were to put

1204
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,160
a wide brush statistically

1205
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,980
if you ask someone

1206
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:56,040
to count all the grains of sand in the beach

1207
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,740
they're going to give you a statistical count

1208
00:49:57,740 --> 00:49:59,180
because if you give it accurate

1209
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:00,680
to the grain

1210
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,300
what if you're challenged

1211
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,660
and you have to go recount it

1212
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,060
so you have to say statistically

1213
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,800
I've been saying for years statistically

1214
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:08,560
it's all bullshit

1215
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,500
there's some exceptions

1216
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,940
but the exceptions are so minimal

1217
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:15,040
if you said all of it statistically

1218
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,340
it's very accurate from a statistician's

1219
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,520
point of view

1220
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,880
you see

1221
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,900
and that is a fact

1222
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,560
what the internet is good for

1223
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,880
it's a hybrid of the telephone book

1224
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,280
a reference manual

1225
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,260
years ago I used to carry a little blue reference

1226
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,980
manual that had conversions and charts

1227
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,900
and things right if you work in engineering

1228
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:34,760
or whatever you know

1229
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,720
melting points of metals hardnesses

1230
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,780
now you do it on the rectangle

1231
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:42,020
the phone right it's a convention has changed

1232
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:42,580
from paper

1233
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:45,060
what the internet is really

1234
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,780
I've mentioned also it's a microphone test

1235
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,160
before the show goes on

1236
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,440
the crew comes up and says microphone test

1237
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,500
that's all you've gotten on the internet

1238
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,240
the purpose of the internet

1239
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,920
is to evolve audio and video communication

1240
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,360
cheaply and instantly

1241
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,360
so in the future

1242
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,620
anyone and everyone in the planet

1243
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,560
will have access to events happening

1244
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,280
anywhere in the world almost with immediacy

1245
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,060
that's the purpose of the internet

1246
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,820
it's not the information age

1247
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:12,520
right

1248
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,140
that's bullshit

1249
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:15,620
just like the space age

1250
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,300
how many of you went into space

1251
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,920
that's a whole side track

1252
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,740
how many of you are being informed

1253
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:23,980
you're describing the internet as a platform

1254
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,500
for a grand deception

1255
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,400
is that right

1256
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,940
no a grand deception and a grand evidentiary

1257
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,320
no one can say

1258
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,360
I didn't see or hear about this event

1259
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,240
in the future

1260
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,640
remember the last thing the gods want

1261
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,260
after reincarnation or resurrection

1262
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,640
is a bunch of sniveling humans saying

1263
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,760
you came and mopped us up

1264
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,760
with great force and destruction

1265
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,680
you didn't give us a chance

1266
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:49,460
you see

1267
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,140
that's a metaphor

1268
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,440
it's a powerful one

1269
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,800
whether it's powerful or not

1270
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,540
I'm sticking to it

1271
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,900
so you're applying that to your own function

1272
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:00,340
or whatever

1273
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,680
as in if you're going to disseminate stuff

1274
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:05,660
and say I've disseminated what I had to know

1275
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,740
you want it to go out to the whole world

1276
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,080
like you don't want it to fly

1277
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,800
and post them on the telegraph poles

1278
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,180
in your local community anonymously

1279
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:15,560
I have done that before

1280
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,460
in the past by the way regarding issues

1281
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:18,340
in the community

1282
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:20,080
so you do want to reach more people

1283
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,220
it's not just about covering your ass

1284
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,720
no I don't want to reach

1285
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,640
once I've established that

1286
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,380
I want to do it organically

1287
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,620
do I want to go out and buy

1288
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,020
a four section file drawer

1289
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,620
to file all the stuff that I need

1290
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:35,760
yes that's beneficial

1291
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,480
but also do I know for sure

1292
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,180
if I have a table with all the papers

1293
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:41,100
stacked organically

1294
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,800
I know that the lower I go on the stack

1295
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,360
it's in time

1296
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:47,180
and I know if it's important

1297
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:49,340
I'm going to set it in a separate basket

1298
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,280
you see

1299
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:53,040
which one has more organic

1300
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,120
or natural immediacy

1301
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,120
is what looks like a messy desk

1302
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,320
versus the triple collated

1303
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,120
file cabinet

1304
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:00,840
you see

1305
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,540
so in other words

1306
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,780
reaching more people is irrelevant at this time

1307
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:08,220
because I've always said

1308
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,220
there's only going to be a small handful of people

1309
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,620
that can use or grasp any of this

1310
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,500
yeah understood

1311
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,280
but if you want to find those people

1312
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,400
or rather if you wanted to reach those people

1313
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,520
then presumably you need to reach more people

1314
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,780
because they're all scattered

1315
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,600
about the globe

1316
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,140
well yes I know for sure

1317
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:28,240
over 100,000 people have heard at least

1318
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,060
one hour of

1319
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,200
Greek speak

1320
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,300
and only about 4 or 5 have made an attempt

1321
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:35,080
to contact

1322
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:37,640
out of 100,000

1323
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,320
so if you multiply

1324
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,420
that times 10

1325
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,900
that's a million

1326
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,580
so it's 40 out of a million

1327
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,400
ok

1328
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,460
so you've got the numbers there

1329
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,200
yeah those are

1330
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,140
pretty good numbers

1331
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,760
here locally I've spoken to

1332
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,600
several thousand people

1333
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,380
and only 2 were interested

1334
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,100
afterwards

1335
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,120
after I gave contact information

1336
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:02,620
right

1337
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,020
so it's a very small percentage

1338
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,340
I'm quite satisfied with the

1339
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:08,340
number

1340
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:12,180
from a responsibility point of view

1341
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:13,860
if I knew more people were

1342
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,840
interested I would have to do

1343
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,460
what you mentioned earlier

1344
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,480
about the lack of being streamlined

1345
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,700
the lack of coherence

1346
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,260
I would have to be put together

1347
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,780
in a more coherent

1348
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,260
format

1349
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,900
that people are used to seeing

1350
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,820
with contents

1351
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:32,720
and more development

1352
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,160
like a really basic

1353
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,840
thing and I don't necessarily want you

1354
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,560
to follow this because I don't know

1355
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,040
whether what you're presenting is positive or not

1356
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,000
but it's simply to

1357
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,140
have somebody do the notes for each streaming

1358
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,080
so then you've got

1359
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,320
a list of the content for all of your archives

1360
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,480
that would enormously

1361
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,920
then it's cross referenceable

1362
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,220
that's a really basic

1363
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,960
I've several people offer

1364
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,720
that and they all fell to the wayside

1365
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,660
right they didn't follow through

1366
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:02,880
no they didn't follow through I'm not going to do it

1367
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,160
because like for example

1368
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,060
by another hour or two I have to go pick

1369
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:09,020
up a box of things that are being

1370
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,100
sent to me an industrial thing that has to be

1371
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,300
modified because the engineers don't understand

1372
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,220
the drawing and I

1373
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,860
said well it has to be modified a certain way

1374
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,860
and they had the brilliant idea then why don't you do

1375
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:21,220
the first one and then we'll copy it I said that's a great idea

1376
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,940
why don't you ship the device

1377
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,380
to me I will do the modifications

1378
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,060
I'll include notes and

1379
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,540
do a follow up on it and then I'll

1380
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:30,800
send it back to you right

1381
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,660
you understand what I'm saying right

1382
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:33,960
so

1383
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,540
yeah and that's where I'm dedicating my

1384
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,080
time to

1385
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,020
it's work you know

1386
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,600
so in other

1387
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,460
words for me to start putting

1388
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:47,420
it all together myself I'm going to have to sit down

1389
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,620
an hour or two or three a day until I get enough

1390
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,580
of it put together edit it

1391
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,500
polish it up put it together put it

1392
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,960
up and then maintain it

1393
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:55,880
right

1394
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,520
fine if you want to do it fine

1395
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,460
like I told Sam you set it up you tell me

1396
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,360
what you need from me and if I can do it

1397
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,260
time wise allotted or anything else

1398
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:07,340
financial whatever I'll do it oh yeah

1399
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,940
Greek I'll do it I'll go set it nothing

1400
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:10,660
right

1401
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,420
other people have said it too so it's not worth

1402
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:13,880
much

1403
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,660
that's not where I'm

1404
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:19,340
positioned myself

1405
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,600
obviously I'm an outsider

1406
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,300
who's interested in what you're doing

1407
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,600
and wanting to

1408
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,560
find out more about it and about yourself

1409
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,460
even before putting this on

1410
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,640
a podcast or whatever I mean you can certainly use

1411
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,600
it but I'm undecided about

1412
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,540
whether I want to make more

1413
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,580
people aware of what you're doing not that I've got

1414
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,580
some massive platform or anything like that

1415
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,600
but I've got some very serious minded

1416
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,500
people you can probably laugh internally

1417
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,480
at that but anyway

1418
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,660
by my gauge

1419
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:49,780
who give positive feedback to what I'm doing

1420
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:50,740
that's good

1421
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,780
makes the earth go round right

1422
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,100
keeps me feeling like my life is meaningful

1423
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,460
anyway and rain

1424
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,460
and bullshit keep the flowers going

1425
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,660
and to me I mean

1426
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:03,940
like where I'm

1427
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,740
coming from talking to you about these things

1428
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,940
is obviously from where I'm situated

1429
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:09,820
and why I do what I do so far

1430
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,880
as I'm conscious of it which is

1431
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,720
making connections to other living

1432
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,660
beings other humans

1433
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,740
meaningful connections that enrich

1434
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:19,460
my experience of myself let's say

1435
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,820
so yeah I can do that in the thrift store

1436
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,540
in a very superficial way

1437
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,900
as in I can just

1438
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:27,720
develop more

1439
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,840
tolerance for my fellow man let's put it that

1440
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,640
way whereas what I do on the

1441
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,140
internet does seem to lead to

1442
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,940
much richer deeper connections

1443
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:37,680
that bring about

1444
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,040
some sort of understanding

1445
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,780
of stuff I don't know what

1446
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,660
it's worth but I

1447
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:45,840
I'm not going to

1448
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,760
provide that because now I'm going to have to talk about

1449
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,860
the things that I do

1450
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,800
and that's not why I'm

1451
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,580
speaking public

1452
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,700
you're not going to provide what?

1453
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:57,600
personal aspects

1454
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,860
of what I would like to see in people and how I'd

1455
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,700
like to help people because that is

1456
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,620
secondary to the people being able to help

1457
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,700
themselves well no I think

1458
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,160
you're again you're making a categorization

1459
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,980
that I wouldn't make like you and I

1460
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,960
I think you said this in the conversation

1461
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,900
you and I it doesn't

1462
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,940
really matter to a great deal

1463
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:18,000
what we're talking about what we're focusing on

1464
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,340
verbally or mentally because

1465
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,860
there's some connection that's occurring just by

1466
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,760
us hooking up would you agree?

1467
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:24,480
yes it's beyond

1468
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,720
what we consider to be

1469
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,860
psychophysical yes

1470
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:31,080
so that's the thing I'm talking about

1471
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,980
something can happen when two sentient beings

1472
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,380
come together and have a dialogue

1473
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,260
that may only be

1474
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,880
dimly observable on the

1475
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,820
surface of the dialogue itself but it'll

1476
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,260
be tangible in some way

1477
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:45,560
it's tangible although it's purely spiritual

1478
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,900
right now because I mean there's no physical

1479
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,780
interaction at all other than

1480
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:53,300
the devices that we're using

1481
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,580
well you know I was thinking about that recently and that's

1482
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,220
actually not true because we're

1483
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,780
we're both situated on the

1484
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:01,620
earth and so we're

1485
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:03,540
connected just as if you know my leg

1486
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,660
brushed against your leg we were wearing

1487
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:07,540
trousers you would still say we've made

1488
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:09,540
contact right? but we're not because then

1489
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,480
we would all be connected on a seven and a half

1490
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,440
or eight billion level

1491
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,920
I'm saying right now the interaction

1492
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,480
qualitatively and quantitatively that we're

1493
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,420
having is purely spiritual meaning non

1494
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,340
physical but we are connected

1495
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,920
to the seven and a half billion

1496
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:25,620
you speak for yourself I've

1497
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,500
been working on the past decade to disconnect

1498
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,460
myself well but I okay

1499
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:31,640
but whatever deep level

1500
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,060
I mean however deep you have to dig

1501
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:34,980
on the deepest level possible because

1502
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,540
for example when you're part of

1503
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,280
that group or on any level

1504
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,600
you end up communicating on the level that

1505
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,000
they've been manipulated to do

1506
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,340
oh how are the meds? how's the weather?

1507
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,580
how's Donald Trump? how's this

1508
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,420
new drug? how are the vaccines? all

1509
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:51,840
bullshit right when you pull yourself

1510
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,580
away from them when you come back you could

1511
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,520
no longer communicate to them on their level

1512
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,380
you can only inform them

1513
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:59,600
or you can pretend to

1514
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,500
not pretend but you can communicate

1515
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,640
to them on their level while being aware of what's

1516
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,020
going on at the deeper levels

1517
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:06,520
it's disingenuous to me

1518
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:08,480
this is what I've had to be

1519
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,860
trained in working in the thrift store

1520
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:12,680
I mean imagine have you ever done retail

1521
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,940
work? oh yeah I've had retail

1522
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,940
businesses it's the hour after hour people

1523
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,460
coming in saying how are you?

1524
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:20,140
not wanting to hear the answer

1525
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:22,800
they'll start talking to you about that stuff you don't

1526
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,540
want to hear it right? that's culture

1527
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:26,080
in Japan they would never do that

1528
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,660
in Bushido when you ask someone how are you

1529
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:30,720
even if they're dying of stomach cancer

1530
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,760
they're going to say I'm fine but I'm not

1531
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,480
in Japan I'm in British Columbia

1532
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,600
that's the culture that's why I'm saying it's cultural

1533
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,380
you're around the headhunters they want

1534
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,540
to know about how many shrunken heads they can catch

1535
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,560
they're treasure hunters coming into the thrift store

1536
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,820
I know the analogy

1537
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:46,800
and they're seriously damaged

1538
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:48,640
people and if I treat them

1539
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,600
with contempt it's bad for business it's also

1540
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,480
bad for my soul let's say

1541
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,260
you know I so

1542
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,640
for me it's always

1543
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,600
finding that possibility of connecting to

1544
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,620
people at a deep level regardless of where

1545
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:02,800
they're at in awareness it's not disingenuous

1546
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,420
because I know that there's

1547
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:06,700
a living soul underneath all

1548
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:07,920
that trauma crust

1549
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,720
that's fine that's

1550
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,560
on a personal level of course

1551
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,420
yeah I do that often here

1552
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,780
and locally you've heard me say

1553
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,460
that if half of the people in the world

1554
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,960
each helped only one person

1555
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,880
it takes care of the whole rest of the world doesn't it?

1556
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:23,760
yeah

1557
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,360
if half of the people of the world just helped

1558
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,800
just one person each that means everyone's

1559
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,860
taken care of now that's not a lot

1560
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:33,020
to ask for if you ask for one person

1561
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,160
to help one person

1562
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,560
is that too much?

1563
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:37,640
that's all that's required

1564
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,900
it's very simple right but it's not easy at all

1565
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,380
it's not easy to meet somebody in that distorted

1566
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:44,780
cultural monster self and actually

1567
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:45,960
be open to

1568
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,560
when you understand that they rely on food

1569
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:50,740
clothing and shelter instead of bombing a country

1570
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,260
why don't you send them food packets

1571
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:54,680
you were just saying

1572
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,000
you want to disconnect from human beings

1573
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:59,400
that's the part that's not easy

1574
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,460
is staying connected

1575
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,800
to human beings no matter how

1576
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,320
distorted they are

1577
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,040
you can disconnect from the culture but never from the

1578
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,900
human being because right now I'm having

1579
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,820
some coffee and that was

1580
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:12,580
roasted and delivered and packaged

1581
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:13,920
and grown by humans

1582
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,660
their energy and their essence

1583
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,100
for example I've worked in a lot

1584
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,820
of the healing arts in the past

1585
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,240
and if you go to a restaurant

1586
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:24,980
and you don't feel good could it be that the cook

1587
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:25,600
was angry

1588
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,880
scientifically you can't prove that his

1589
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,040
intent and his anger has a

1590
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,620
field around his body that the

1591
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:35,080
food is within that field and the food has memory

1592
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,240
just like magnetic tape

1593
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,880
and records that and it can affect you

1594
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,500
negatively

1595
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,120
if you want to go more chemical

1596
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,120
if I eat at a place

1597
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:46,820
and the food is across

1598
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,500
very salty I'll tell the waitress

1599
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,120
you have a new cook and he likes

1600
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:52,960
eating sweets and she'll

1601
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,620
drop her little menu

1602
01:02:54,620 --> 01:02:55,900
her little ticket board and say

1603
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:57,960
how do you know that

1604
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,760
I'm like well the food is salty because he eats

1605
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,220
too many sweets so he has to compensate

1606
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:04,760
so he's throwing salt around him and everything

1607
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:07,180
and it's

1608
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:08,800
not just eating sweets like he had

1609
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,700
for dessert but he's constantly eating

1610
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:11,020
sweets

1611
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:14,480
elementary my dear Watson

1612
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,020
you just cut out

1613
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,080
change the

1614
01:03:18,770 --> 01:03:19,040
password

1615
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,760
we'll go to wifi

1616
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,660
connection problem

1617
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:24,460
ironic timing

1618
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:26,380
the connection

1619
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,320
is bad

1620
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,660
ok that's the end of the second part

1621
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:37,140
parts 3 and 4 are also

1622
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:39,240
available so just scroll down

1623
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:41,060
past the show notes and you'll find

1624
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,180
those there

1625
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:45,240
I did decide to air these

1626
01:03:45,240 --> 01:03:47,160
after all based on the

1627
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,020
comments it wasn't a voting

1628
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,420
system I'm not a democrat

1629
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:53,220
but just to see

1630
01:03:53,220 --> 01:03:54,520
if there was enough interest

1631
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:56,620
and not too much

1632
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:58,760
absolute aversion or

1633
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,220
probably about

1634
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,240
40, 60,

1635
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,840
for and against and

1636
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,800
no unequivocal

1637
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:08,360
for's and some very

1638
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,280
unequivocal against

1639
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,860
and some quite funny comments too

1640
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:15,260
if you do want to find the grease

1641
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:17,180
just do a little protective work

1642
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:19,380
there's enough information in these

1643
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:20,020
conversations

1644
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,500
ok so this is

1645
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:25,260
