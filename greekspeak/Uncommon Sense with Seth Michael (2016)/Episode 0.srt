1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,930
This is the first installment of this sonic endeavor with myself, Seth Michael, and The Greek.

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,310
We are going to stick with the moniker Uncommon Radio,

3
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,190
meaning that we are hosted currently at UncommonRadio.com.

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,190
If you're listening to this, you're probably already aware of that.

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:31,210
We will integrate with every format that we can to make it as easy as possible for the listeners to get to the program.

6
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,250
And so iTunes and things of that nature will be forthcoming.

7
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,190
This, like I said, is just kind of a test.

8
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,050
We'll call this episode zero.

9
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:52,650
And we're going to use this kind of as a primer for what is to come in this sonic endeavor,

10
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:59,210
as well as to test the capability of transmitting it to those who would like to hear it,

11
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,450
and even perhaps to those that would like to listen.

12
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:07,110
So I would like to welcome The Greek, as always.

13
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:07,850
Welcome, Greek.

14
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:11,330
Thank you.

15
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,090
And we're back.

16
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,310
We're popping up like toast.

17
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:23,690
So we're going to continue perhaps discovering levels of discernment and subject matters

18
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:29,610
and things that could be conveyed sonically that just simply are not anywhere else.

19
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,770
And maybe that's why we are doing it.

20
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,110
And welcome, everyone, and let's see how it goes.

21
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,770
What's on your mind, Seth?

22
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,970
Oh, what is always on my mind?

23
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,630
Scripture, I suppose, is what's on my mind.

24
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,250
It's left to me.

25
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:55,570
That's where we'll go.

26
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,090
Yeah, referred to as the scriptures.

27
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,110
By the way, I finished watching a series called Wolf Hall.

28
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:13,070
It was a novel written by a woman novelist around what they call 2009 on the Pope's work schedule,

29
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,370
and it was about the court of King Henry VIII, and the main character is Thomas Cromwell.

30
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:24,210
Not so historically accurate based on some critics on it, but a very enjoyable show.

31
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:25,970
Do I recommend it?

32
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,390
Perhaps.

33
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,710
It's called Wolf Hall.

34
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,750
Unfortunately, it's a streaming type deal.

35
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,990
You're going to have to purchase somehow.

36
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,490
It was on a PBS masterpiece theater.

37
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:45,310
The reason why I brought this up, because around that time there was no English translation.

38
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,010
This is in the 1500s.

39
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,690
Tyndale and some others were doing a reformist movement,

40
00:02:51,450 --> 00:03:00,250
and what's interesting about that show or that presentation is there was the Roman Catholic precedent set of what's called

41
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,390
Christendom throughout the land, which England was a part of and King Henry tried to break away from,

42
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:12,810
but they repeatedly referred to the scriptures and how interesting the scriptures were

43
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:19,030
versus what the Roman Catholic Church, which represented and really founded Christendom,

44
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,990
was pervading throughout England.

45
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:27,590
So I just wanted to bring that up because there's a resonance in the mind still from watching that short series,

46
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,810
which I don't really partake in a lot of media,

47
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:39,510
and this was something that I came across and found interesting because it was a well-acted, well-done presentation around Thomas Cromwell,

48
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,390
and the scriptures were a main feature of this presentation.

49
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:49,910
So this is just something that's fresh in the mind, and I'm bringing it up because people have to remember that,

50
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:56,010
as we've said before many times, or I have said, the Greek has said, let's say,

51
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:05,630
even today in your modern time, you do not have an accurate translation of what is known as the scriptures.

52
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:08,290
Sorry, folks, that is the truth.

53
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,610
All of the versions that you have are not translations.

54
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:28,510
They're very loose reference versions, inaccurate, that convey the general story of what is in the scriptures, and that's it, period.

55
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:34,990
So you have no real understanding, no real information conveyance of what is in the scriptures.

56
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,730
Now, a lot of it comes across.

57
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,410
You will in the versions, but unfortunately,

58
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:52,170
when you combine that with the social aspect of how people read into works of information

59
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:59,810
or things that they revisit later on in life, that they were initially exposed to that subject matter as a child through various social institutions.

60
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:09,150
What I mean by that is if you right now pick up what they call a Bible and you read something familiar,

61
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:15,170
you get to, let's say, Exodus or the flood or Adam and Eve or the apostles,

62
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:25,910
most people tend to read in and overlay what they saw on television by Disney, Cecil B. DeMille,

63
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:31,950
what they were told in church or the circus or their parents.

64
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:35,970
And unfortunately, none of it is accurate. Sorry.

65
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:47,330
And what the reason why I'm saying it that way is because it's still a massive endeavor to delve into that thing we call the scriptures.

66
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:54,230
And what I mean by massive endeavor is it has to be retold or restated.

67
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,710
So with that said, yeah, go ahead.

68
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:06,950
With preface, with background, it has to be established that we're working with versions and not with a translation.

69
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:07,930
Correct.

70
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:14,090
That's easy to do for yourself.

71
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:19,390
If you'd like to find an inner linear, there are a number of them available on the Internet for free reference.

72
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:28,930
You can punch the one that always comes to mind first is, you know, what's called Genesis, Bereshit.

73
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:38,910
The first verse of Genesis, as it is the version that is available to English speakers and those who read English like myself,

74
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:50,410
the first verse in the King James Version is 10, 10 words in the Hebrew and the language that has been memorialized.

75
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,950
And it's it's seven words.

76
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:59,530
It could be argued that it's eight words because there's a V in there, which is in English.

77
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,530
We translate that as and and that's that's relatively accurate.

78
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:15,290
But at the same time, there are two words, two words in the first verse of Genesis that actually the same word.

79
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:22,450
So it's one word that appears twice in the first verse of that that book that is not translated.

80
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:32,950
And not only is it not translated, those that word occurs in in the scriptures between six and seven thousand times.

81
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,290
And it's been omitted. It's been omitted.

82
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:44,350
So just to sum that up one more time, because there are 10 words in the first verse of Genesis one, one in English in the version.

83
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:49,770
But there are seven in the language of preservation, but only six are being translated.

84
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,850
Right. Generally. Correct. And that would be the olive top.

85
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:01,130
And it would be the first seven words would be the first, the fourth one, the fourth word that is not being translated.

86
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:08,750
So what's interesting about languages and names and things, they are sounds that we attach to things.

87
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,690
Right. What is a name? A name is a sound that you answer to.

88
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:21,310
Right. So what's interesting about, you know, even we describe these presentations as being sonic presentations,

89
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:30,890
meaning it's of the sound nature of our perception, not visual yet because it's, you know, it's audio strictly.

90
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:36,030
So just for the audience, just to have an effect on the mind, just to.

91
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:41,970
And it's good to start at the beginning, which which we will find out later on that Genesis is not the beginning, I guess.

92
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:48,010
But that's for another discussion in Genesis, basically one one.

93
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,030
It says in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

94
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:57,830
But in Hebrew, it would be something like better sheath, but all of him at Hashim had to audit.

95
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:10,320
Right now, what's interesting is better sheath beginning, but I would say created or presented Elohim, the gods at.

96
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:18,700
Which is the olive top, the first and the last, or would be the letters of the Hebrew alphabet or any alphabet,

97
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,000
which would be the A and Z or the alpha and the omega.

98
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,700
And there's someone who identifies themselves as being the first and last and the alpha and the omega.

99
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:40,940
Right. And then it was the heavens and which can be namely the waters and it's audits, which is the earth.

100
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,340
So there you go. And you don't get that in the King James or any version.

101
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,260
So guess what, folks? You open what's called a Bible.

102
00:09:52,260 --> 00:10:00,480
You're on the first verse, the first of the first book of the first chapter of the first verse, the first book.

103
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,220
And you're already spit out on the other end with an omission.

104
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,680
How do you think you're going to fare on verse two or verse three of the first edition?

105
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,380
An obvious and obvious mistranslation in the first verse.

106
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:22,660
Right. Now, a lot of, by the way, the side note or footnote here, some scholars say, well,

107
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:30,040
the olive top is just a punctuation for him to show you something is important or it's a conjunction of some kind.

108
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:38,880
I've seen it presented as I've seen it translated as the word the or the which is is also inaccurate.

109
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,300
Right. That's because it's defined.

110
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:47,700
Is that that's right? Yeah. And how would be for plural or singular?

111
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,680
So so we're going into this kind of like head fast and I mean, a head first quickly,

112
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,020
only because there's something here that needs to be set in the mind.

113
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,240
You know, everything that we do or hear has an effect on the mind.

114
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,740
And that's how we tend to rationalize things.

115
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:15,900
And when I when I mentioned earlier, reading into subject matter that is brought up, that is biblical, as you know,

116
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:22,580
we're actually overlaying and reading into things because when we perceive information,

117
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,360
this is just a commentary on how the human mind works.

118
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,800
There's a there's a maturity level that people reach,

119
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,760
known as adulthood, and they feel that they can operate freely in the world and do what they wish.

120
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:42,900
And when they approach things, they are constantly comparing what they're doing throughout their day with previous experiences.

121
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,880
And that's how people read and that's how people interact. Right.

122
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:55,740
So, you know, if you, let's say, are walking on the street and you see a dog, you you actually see the dog,

123
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,800
but you're not really seeing the dog. You you see enough of the dog to know it's a dog.

124
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,060
And you immediately the mind compares it to all the other dogs you've seen.

125
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:12,160
And it's close enough. And that's just a dog. But if someone were to ask you what that dog really looked like, you would give it.

126
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,080
No, it's a dog, you know, but you're really not looking at it.

127
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,660
You're just I mean, you just kind of glance that it's enough and you've compared it to everything else that you've seen about a dog.

128
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,180
It's good enough. That's what I mean about reading into it.

129
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:32,880
So when people are also having conversations, I'll notice or reading something, if you ask them to describe what they just read.

130
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:41,480
Well, if the subject matter is familiar, they're not really paying attention because they're comparing it to previous things that have been downloaded.

131
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:49,100
That's where in I guess in media school years ago, they used to talk about, you know, man bites dog.

132
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,320
And people were like, OK, yeah, because it sounds like dog bites man.

133
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,600
That's pretty common. But man bites dog is very uncommon. Right.

134
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,160
That's the the story that you're always looking for.

135
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,340
Something that people see is familiar, but is very strange at the same time if you're paying attention.

136
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,120
So we're jumping into scripture. And basically, we're only a few minutes into the sonic presentation.

137
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:23,800
And we laid out pretty much a gem, I would say, about how you're not even getting anything true in the first verse of the first chapter of the first book.

138
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:34,020
So what do you think you're going to get in the rest of it? Very much similarly, the same attitude carries through.

139
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:57,340
So the I found it easier to discuss things that are written in the text with those who have very little to no experience with preferably with.

140
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:03,460
Preferably atheists or secular people that might be interested in the subject matter.

141
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:12,180
I've jumped into conversations at coffee shops, actually, where I heard, you know, something of interest to myself being discussed like.

142
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:18,160
But that's that's not what it said. And the ones I've I've many times, actually.

143
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:30,780
And it's it's much easier to talk to people that don't have miss misinformed preconceived notions to battle with when when speaking about it.

144
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:37,020
Mm hmm. Let's just jump into another concept, because we do bring up time very often.

145
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:44,060
It's almost the last week of the sixth month. And it's what you want to sound off the date.

146
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,200
Roughly what it is on the pope's work schedule. It's August something.

147
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,800
The 10th. Yeah, something like that. I think.

148
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,260
What they call 2016, I think. Right.

149
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:04,020
With the 25th of the sixth month. Yeah, roughly last week of the sixth month going into the seventh month.

150
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,680
So why is time important? Because you have to realize that when we start discussing, let's say, Scripture,

151
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,520
one of the things we'll bring up is that the word forever is not in there. Right.

152
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:23,100
The word being translated as forever is the word Olam and the word Eon, which means the age.

153
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:29,180
Yeah. Onto the ages. And an age is typically a thousand or two thousand years, pairs of thousands.

154
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:43,540
Right. So there is no forever. And the reason I bring that up is because you all information is only pertinent when it's registered as pertinent in the time that it's pertinent.

155
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:52,080
What does that mean? Well, if you're reading about, you know, horse drawn carriages,

156
00:15:52,800 --> 00:16:00,340
you will find information that is difficult to understand if you're living in an age of what they call the automobile or the car.

157
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:08,480
Right. Because you're you've spent your entire life most likely being driven around,

158
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:17,720
as they say, colloquially in a rubber tired reciprocating engine, gas guzzling, gas eating machine.

159
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:29,060
You are not familiar with the basic common things of of what a horse drawn carriage is.

160
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,240
You know that you yeah, you might know that it's yeah, it's made of wood and it's got a metal strap around the wooden wheel.

161
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:41,740
So it doesn't break, which called which is called a tire. And there's an animal in the front drawing it.

162
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:48,880
And that's simple enough. But if you were to study, let's say the Casanova wagons and things like that, pick up some reference material on it.

163
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:55,420
The majority of information conveyed will be unfamiliar to you, even though they are simple terms and simple concepts.

164
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:07,440
And this is very much what scripture is like, because people don't know how to place the information within the time period that they're living in.

165
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:17,760
So that's why time is very important. So where what is important about time and scripture is knowing where you are in that entire story.

166
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,300
And that cannot be garnered until you've basically downloaded the entire thing or been familiar with the entire thing

167
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,200
and then pieced it all together rationally, just like the.

168
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:34,760
I guess the horse drawn carriage, because you can still access a horse drawn carriage somewhere.

169
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,280
So there's something about it that requires, let's say, an understanding of time.

170
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,940
What do you say, Seth? And how to keep time and things like that.

171
00:17:51,180 --> 00:18:00,740
Absolutely. Especially if you're talking about something that is is referencing times when to do things or when things will happen.

172
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:08,840
And you're trying to trying to make proper observations about such things.

173
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:15,060
It's impossible with the pope's work schedule, as they call it.

174
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:22,100
But even with the pope's work schedule and mechanical clocks, time has to be measured accurately to some degree.

175
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,020
Let's use the mechanical clock. And I just want to throw something in right now.

176
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:33,000
There is a particular religion and culture on the planet that is allegedly adhering to this type of information.

177
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:41,340
And many people are under the misunderstanding that the day ends at sundown because a certain group says so.

178
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:51,540
A religious group, let's say. And if you study scripture with an open perception where you see it objectively,

179
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:58,280
you will see that the day starts at noon because very simply, you cannot make a measurement at sundown.

180
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:05,280
Sundown is actually the last hour. The noon time is using, let's say,

181
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,560
what you might call a sundial or just a stick in the ground can be measured very precisely.

182
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:15,300
Also, there is a concept that the new moon is the dark moon in scripture.

183
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,120
And that is another mistake because you cannot make a measurement with a dark moon.

184
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:28,520
It just sits around in the West and it's dark, where the full moon rises like the sun and it has its own noon time.

185
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:35,260
In other words, when the full moon is at the apex of the sky at the zenith, it will cast a very sharp shadow,

186
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,380
which you can compare it to the solar shadow taken that day.

187
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,700
And that's how you determine what's called the equinox.

188
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,160
It has nothing to do with equal day and equal night. It has to do with the measurement at night.

189
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,660
That's why it's equinox, equi meaning measure, nox meaning night.

190
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,340
If it was equal parts day and night, it would be equimodium nox.

191
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,160
So these are things I just want to we're kind of like randomly throwing in concepts here.

192
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,260
And just to throw in a few other things here, this is kind of like running into someone and pushing them around.

193
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:13,120
You know, and I don't mind doing that sometimes, but because kind of like a little bit.

194
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,280
The subject matter is not really something we're going to delve into other than the overall mindset.

195
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,660
Like we said earlier, there is no forever in the scripture.

196
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,220
It's the ages, which are chunks of limited times.

197
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:33,180
You will not find the word. The other one that's important to consider is you will not find the word church.

198
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:41,440
The reason I'm saying that is because from a secular perspective, secular historians consider this to be the Christian era.

199
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,000
And when the first thing you bring up in the mind or most people do when you bring up Christendom is the church.

200
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,800
You will not find anything that resembles that in scripture at all.

201
00:20:53,040 --> 00:21:02,000
Zero. What they call church today is a revival of the ancient circus or the architecture resembles the ancient sex temples.

202
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,980
None of it is biblical at all. Zero period at all.

203
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:16,000
You will not find hell as Dante's Inferno when where bad people go when they die.

204
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:22,400
And there's devils with pitchforks and things like that. There is no such thing in scripture, period.

205
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:35,640
You will not find anyone being animated in a heavenly realm after they die, where you die and you find yourself with a light and a cloud and plucking a harp and doing all that.

206
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:41,920
That is a lie. You will not find any of that. Actually, you won't find any of those in any ancient texts.

207
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,660
Those are those are inventions of a particular character.

208
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,860
A group of characters inspired by a magician in the first century.

209
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,960
So this is the truth of these matters.

210
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:19,360
When you discuss the time, because you're in a time right now, people, where when this topic is brought up, you think of heaven and hell as plucking a harp in the pearly gates or being in a fiery infernal place with demons or forever or church.

211
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:26,980
And all of these things are completely irrelevant and not in scripture at all, period.

212
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:37,380
Give me a quick example. The word congregation or ecclesia, as it is in scripture, just means a group of people.

213
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,620
And that is being translated as church and what's called the New Testament.

214
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:51,600
And if you actually do some research, there's an unruly mob protesting or ready to do some harm.

215
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:57,500
And they're referred to as an ecclesia of people. Right. I think it's in the Book of Acts.

216
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:05,460
I think when Shaul was there, he roused up a crowd and they were and he was arrested for rousing up the crowd.

217
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,180
OK. And that crowd is referred to as an ecclesia.

218
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,760
So it just means a crowd or a group or people or, you know, group together.

219
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:31,760
So when you hear us say things like there's no such thing as a church in scripture or heaven or hell or forever, we're going to try to throw in a very fast reference on how to the how and why we're saying it as well, which I think is important.

220
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:47,240
Absolutely. Absolutely. We have we're doing this, you know, on our own independently from any other media outlet or anything like that.

221
00:23:47,970 --> 00:24:06,300
Currently, it's going to be available just here. And I am fond of that idea. After having experience with sonic projects in other venues, it's a lot more comfortable to sit in our own venue and speak.

222
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:32,940
Oh, yeah, definitely. We don't have there are no time limitations. We can broadcast very, very short episodes or, you know, very long ones. And we can speak freely without the the implied audience that is coming to other venues.

223
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:44,860
So, yeah, media was I think it was Edward Murrow, someone that when the advent of television, meaning it was popular and available to most people, he said it's across.

224
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:51,660
It should be taken seriously because it's almost a cross between a national park and a library or university.

225
00:24:52,740 --> 00:25:04,540
And a lot of the media that people partake in, known as Internet radio, can be viewed very similarly. And we've tried that. And we're very grateful that we're given the opportunity.

226
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:12,620
But if you don't have to be associated with it, why not not be associated with it is the point.

227
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:23,200
And in essence, being able to do this, being very grateful that the Web site can host it at the moment. And we'll see other ways to get information out.

228
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:29,460
I think the four or five listeners that we kind of like semi jokingly talk about will be able to access it.

229
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:40,360
So, you know, with that said, in terms of media, folks, I've heard that there's some frustration regarding media.

230
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:49,260
I hear that constantly, but people still use it. And I think we've mentioned in one of the sonic presentations that this is all a beta test.

231
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:55,600
What you've been watching throughout the human course of events with television, radio and the Internet.

232
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:02,300
Right now, it's just a beta test. That's why it's all junk. It's just, you know, just like I think we did an audio test here.

233
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:08,440
You know, get on the mic testing, testing one, two, three. Right. That's all you've been experiencing all your life.

234
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:16,200
There's there's events that are going to be occurring in the future where there's going to be an imparting of information.

235
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:23,660
There's going to be that there's going to be the witnessing of events in real time with audio and video throughout the world.

236
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:31,620
This is what this entire evolution, let's say, or an opening or unraveling from radio to television to Internet is.

237
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:41,860
So if you're frustrated about all the junk out there, yes, and it's all junk, because if it wasn't, we would probably be saying, go listen to here or go over there.

238
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,620
We wouldn't be doing this, you know, at least in private.

239
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:55,100
So what the attempt here is to give maybe a little bit of credence to maybe a cross between a national park and a university.

240
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:01,880
And by the way, folks, I want to throw this in as another commentary, because, you know, I kind of ramble, but I could try to tie things together.

241
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,860
You university folks, your academics, whatever, look up the word academic in an etymological dictionary.

242
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,580
To paraphrase, it means theoretical and practical, never leading to a conclusion.

243
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:23,280
If there is any benefit in the current system of academia and you live in a benevolent society and you have such free media available,

244
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:32,780
why can't you turn on the television or the Internet and have these wonderful universities that want to help mankind do all of their teaching online?

245
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,100
Because, first of all, this is the truth, folks. It's not worth learning from them.

246
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:48,160
They have nothing to teach you. When I say nothing, there's something there, because even a counterfeit note has to look like the real thing.

247
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:56,640
You know, sorry. And you've been pranked. You've been pranked by your parents to go to these schools.

248
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:06,680
And then where if you study intellectual minds of the 19th century, they have already received their graduate degrees by 15 or 16 years old.

249
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:11,720
They only went through several years of schooling. That's all you need.

250
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:19,120
The kindergarten through 12th grade in university is a prank that destroys your formative years.

251
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:24,280
It steals all of your formative years. Now, this might sound like heresy.

252
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,240
And by the way, the word heresy means what one prefers or one likes.

253
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,020
And this goes beyond that. This is trying to be objective.

254
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:43,500
So when you hear us discussing certain subject matter, this is the kind of stuff that makes academics crawl out of their skin or go into convulsions and fall on the ground and vomit.

255
00:28:44,860 --> 00:29:03,660
Right. Because it is possible to take very large pieces or chunks of subject matter and reduce it down to a few sentences where the man or the woman listening or even the child can digest what's been said and understand it.

256
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:10,280
And that is one of the things we like to do. And it's based on discernment and clear, concise communication,

257
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:17,600
which is a big contrast to academia, which I think is just what anyone can think.

258
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,260
Actually, if you were to objectify it is a prank on humanity at this point.

259
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,980
And it actually has always been these public institutions.

260
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:33,120
And I'm not speaking against them that they shouldn't exist or anything like that, just like, you know, ice cream shops shouldn't exist or shoe stores or whatever.

261
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:43,800
But if you're trying to associate knowledge and learning with these institutions that are in place, you are really you don't get it.

262
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,560
Sorry. And you never probably never will.

263
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:56,980
So I wanted to bring that up because conveying and imparting information can be done very quickly, concisely and effectively.

264
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:03,680
And that might be one of the things that we might start, you know, endeavoring on these sonic experiences with.

265
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:15,160
I think that we do. I think that a lot of what is spoken about requires, you know, explanation.

266
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:28,800
And the more that we get into it and the more that things are explained, we'll be able to speak about them without the explanation and be able to refer back to where we have explained it, where it has been explained.

267
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:47,680
But I think that explanation is important, especially to anyone who, you know, makes it a habit to listen, to seek out such such conversation as as we have.

268
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:54,840
And I I require it myself for for my own knowledge.

269
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:12,900
I know instruction is something to be sought, and that's certainly a large part of why why I do this and why I have enjoyed the conversations that you and I have had over the years, public and private.

270
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,580
Mm hmm. Sit down here. Yeah.

271
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:23,080
And with this endeavor, I think that we have the ability to to do it in a more comfortable and more comfortable setting.

272
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:31,180
There have been you know, we've we've had some objectively or relatively good broadcasts in the past.

273
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:39,920
And I don't mean to speak derogatorily of any of the venues that, you know, we've spoken in because, well, they allowed us to speak.

274
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:46,300
And that in and of itself is relatively rare. But there's just there's no pressure with this.

275
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,820
And that's that's that's wonderful. So. Yeah.

276
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:57,360
In other words, you can have a beautiful venue and they serve food that is synthetic or, you know, bad ingredients in it.

277
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:05,280
Right. Let's say. But the venue is fine. We're we'd like to have a good venue, let's say, with good ingredients.

278
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:11,540
Right. You know, when when when we serve cheese, it's made with milk, not cheese made of whatever.

279
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:17,340
Right. Correct. Or if it's salt, it's real salt, not, you know, something from the aluminum industry.

280
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:31,320
So, yeah, but here here's the thing. Also, the the partial rant and commentary regarding Internet radio or other venues or academia or any of these things that are people are going to

281
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:42,500
where the hosts, the teachers, the professors, those professing, you know, those behind a microphone or a lecture hall or writing a book,

282
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,740
they are just part of the human collective that have decided to do such a thing.

283
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:59,260
And they come from the same, let's say, maladies and flawed aspects of the society that we're sort of being critical about.

284
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:06,520
Now, if you told me that a wormhole opened up and a bunch of people came from another dimension, let's say,

285
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:14,360
which is only one dimension or another universe or planet to be your Internet radio hosts or your professors or whatever.

286
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:25,200
Yeah. You might want to give a listen because they haven't been subjected and pranked by the the insanity going on on this planet by the human race for thousands of years.

287
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,080
You see, they haven't been subject to that. So it might be worth listening to.

288
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:42,180
But all of these professors and whatever, all these people pontificating, they they they have not realized that the majority of what they're saying is is a product of pranked them.

289
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:48,380
None of I mean, I shouldn't say none of it, but very little of it is accurate. Very little of it is based on anything.

290
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,120
It's just the typical social chatter that you hear, whether it's academia all the way through.

291
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:01,380
I mean, any form of media. So this is this is the point.

292
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:13,139
You know, can we can information be imparted in an objective, clear, concise matter regarding any subject to a surface dwelling earth inhabitant?

293
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:17,380
And I believe the answer is yes. And that might be the crux of this whole thing.

294
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:27,880
Absolutely. Absolutely. I would say that it can be.

295
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:38,480
But how whether the seeds fall on on fertile ground is I don't know.

296
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,719
Yes, there's plenty of fertilizer out there. Yeah, there is.

297
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:52,320
Flowers need a lot of bullshit to grow, but I think sonic experiences can be free of it to a certain extent, but because you're not really growing flowers.

298
00:34:53,060 --> 00:35:02,540
But but the thing is, the the the the point of conveying information is also that it has to fit the time period.

299
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:09,920
So it's more relevant because I think we've mentioned how the nature of existence is very simple, folks.

300
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,340
It's basically where spirits animated through material, you know, the spirit, the soul, the body.

301
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,340
The spirit is the mind. The soul is the breath and the body is the physical matter.

302
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:26,960
And the three working together to animate the show known as everything that we consider a reality is the reality of it.

303
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,300
And that's all it is. It's very simple. It's not easy, but it's simple to explain what's going on.

304
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:40,600
And to to give information that is pertinent to a mind animated through material, OK,

305
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:48,040
is not being done effectively or efficiently on this planet at the moment.

306
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:59,480
It's just something it's astounding to observe. So that, again, would probably be the way we would like to discuss things objectively.

307
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:05,260
And as if you're just visiting a place and clearly and concisely.

308
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:11,220
And just to go back to what we started with, the interest in scripture, just to give a thought.

309
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,980
The reason we brought up the concept of maybe discussing scripture more.

310
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:25,040
And please, you have to bear in mind that this has nothing to do with any religious affiliation at all.

311
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,840
And even you folks out there that think you're non-denominational, that's just like going to a supermarket.

312
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,760
And instead of buying a particular brand, it's the generic white box. You know, that's not any better.

313
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,200
It's still macaroni and cheese with whatever in it. It's it's not.

314
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:46,700
We're not discussing any religious affiliation or any religious anything in that aspect, which I think I brought up.

315
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:55,020
There's no forever, no church, no heaven and hell, as people are just discuss it in certain religious circles and certain timekeeping things.

316
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:07,800
It's just the maybe a little bit of a preface. I would I would recommend that for anyone that is interested in studying such things or looking at things objectively.

317
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,680
Use the you know, the Internet only has what the Internet has.

318
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:19,980
But there are tools available there and you can find free interlinear software, things like that, that make it.

319
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,680
I wouldn't say make it any easier, but make it more fruitful.

320
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:39,080
Studying such things. I'd like to recommend Kohalath Ecclesiastes, as it's called in the English versions to anyone who is considering considering such things.

321
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:46,560
It's not going to make you friends. It will be a point of contention.

322
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:55,100
If it's something that you are looking at objectively between you and anyone that you speak about it with or anything in Scripture.

323
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:01,300
Yeah, absolutely. But there are tools available. How about this?

324
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:09,080
How about not a promise, but a consideration that if people adhere to what we're presenting and piece it all together,

325
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:16,320
they'll have a pretty good idea of the rhythm of of of what is going on.

326
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:21,280
And what I mean by that is, yes, Kohalath is important.

327
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,920
Proverbs are important. The Book of Jeremiah is important because those things are universal.

328
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:31,280
Those are pretty much for everyone. Most of the other things in Scripture are directed to certain groups.

329
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,080
Right. Just like you would go to someone's mailbox and they're being addressed specifically.

330
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,980
But, you know, those I just gave a handful of things there.

331
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,780
Now, that's a lot of information right there in a very short sentence.

332
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,020
But it is. But that's a lot of consider that anyone. Yes.

333
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,320
Now, the rhythm of it is let's give an example like the band Fleetwood Mac.

334
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:57,940
The first time you hear a Fleetwood Mac song, you're like, oh, OK, I see what they sound like, how they play music.

335
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:01,960
OK. And then you hear another song from them, let's say on an album.

336
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,400
And OK. All right. I could see it's the same band, but it's a different song.

337
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:12,100
And if you're familiar with, let's say, 10 Fleetwood Mac songs, if you were to go about in life and another song comes on,

338
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,420
you'll say, oh, that sounds like Fleetwood Mac, even though you've never heard it before.

339
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:24,780
And there's on the same on the same note, if someone plays a song for you and tells you that this is Fleetwood Mac and it's not,

340
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,480
you'll be like, this doesn't sound like Fleetwood Mac at all. Yeah, exactly.

341
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,300
So what we will do besides reading the Book of Wisdom, the Books of Wisdom and things like that,

342
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:38,500
and maybe the Book of Jeremiah, which is addressed to everyone, like Seth likes bringing up Ecclesiastes and rightly so.

343
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:46,340
Let's say we'll discuss certain very specific topics like like we mentioned, let's say the flood,

344
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:54,460
a very short thing about very specific interlinear kind of etymological aspect of a certain part of, let's say,

345
00:39:54,540 --> 00:40:00,420
the flood in Genesis or like we just started out by doing the first verse of the first book of the first chapter.

346
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,440
We just gave an illustration of what's going on there.

347
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:15,240
We could pick and choose various aspects of scripture and go into it in great depth, very quickly and short and concise and objectify it all over.

348
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,160
And you will notice that it's obviously there. It's all tied together. It's the same band.

349
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,920
It's playing. It's the same. It's the same band, but different songs.

350
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:31,840
And let's say we do a dozen examples of like, for example, something in the flood, something in, let's say, the Garden of Eden,

351
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:37,280
something about when the Israelites left Egypt or something from what they call the New Testament.

352
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:44,900
And we'll explain it and people will figure out, hey, there seem to be these things have something in common,

353
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:50,620
even though they seem that, you know, they're all set, you know, separate instances and separate events.

354
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,020
These guys are showing us what all these things have in common.

355
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,240
And there's an understanding here how it's all tied together.

356
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:02,120
And the mistakes are pointing out seem to have a frequency and a rhythm in an app.

357
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:07,860
There's a mindset to what makes the versions that you're given so bad.

358
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:15,260
If you reveal that mindset and then we reveal the mindset that when you do research,

359
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:19,000
what is really being said in the language of preservation, you'll have a good contrast.

360
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:25,440
And just giving maybe a half a dozen examples like we just started out with the first verse of Genesis.

361
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:35,440
The listener then will be able to have almost a pretty good understanding of what is going on and when on their own,

362
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:41,940
like listening to Fleetwood Mac, for example. And so this is just an example.

363
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:49,480
So just like we gave the example right out of the gate, we will perhaps go into many other explanations like that.

364
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:56,100
And this is not a lot of people resist this because it goes contrary to what they believe.

365
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,960
But if belief is based on nothing, well, there you go.

366
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,800
If you say you believe in something and someone questions it in terms of why do you believe that?

367
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:11,060
And it's based on nothing. Well, then you just need to kind of like walk away because guess what?

368
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,420
Nothing is based on nothing. So, yeah.

369
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:20,300
It's like listening to music in a different tuning that is unfamiliar.

370
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:30,680
If it doesn't, if it sounds, it's going to sound discordant to many.

371
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:38,920
Now, why Scripture? The big question here is very simple, folks.

372
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,000
And we'll lay it out really quickly and really simple.

373
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:47,920
If someone has a lawful mind, meaning that when you have a communication and you have a lawful mind,

374
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:54,660
you see if that communication sets a precedent, if it's an important communication or is it trivial or is it, you know,

375
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,660
how much attention does that what you just heard or read require?

376
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,860
Like, for example, if someone says, excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom.

377
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:04,480
Well, that's a communication. But, you know, it's like, OK, fine.

378
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,080
It's common. No big deal. But thanks for letting me know.

379
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:14,280
But if someone if you read a communication that says I created the heavens and the earth and I am the supreme being,

380
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,480
that's a trivial I don't really believe in that. I don't care.

381
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:23,240
Well, you see, that's the typical mindset. But if someone has a lawful mind and they hear that, they're like, wait a second.

382
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:28,840
That is a really, really tall claim. Right.

383
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:39,520
And it sounds extremely important. And I mean, and has it been rebutted? Is it true? Right.

384
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:47,560
Or whatever. Right. So that's why we go to scripture, because you will find things that are claimed in there that are really tall claims.

385
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:55,680
I mean, we're talking big claims. And the majority of the surface dwelling earth inhabitants are apathetic to it because they don't have a lawful mind.

386
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:04,920
So that's why that is why I I would like to say from the Greeks perspective is why I have an interest in it.

387
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:12,920
You know, if if someone says, hey, I got to go to the bathroom or else, you know, I've got to go rearrange the sock drawer.

388
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:18,120
That is a communication, just like I created the heavens and the earth, for example, as a communication.

389
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:25,160
But they have different veracities. You know, one needs to be considered to see if it's true.

390
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:30,300
And if it is true, well, that is really important information.

391
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:44,660
And it's been hijacked, just like all information right now is been somehow conveyed through some corrupted kind of presentation or individuals that are loose and apathetic and don't really care.

392
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:54,340
And I say not all. But, you know, typically here, the reason I'm saying that to be ranty or critical is because I like the truth.

393
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,920
I like information. I like learning. This is a personal thing. Right.

394
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:05,680
And I like to see and hear that other people are doing this, you know, just like if someone likes, let's say, basketball.

395
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:10,200
They like to associate with other people who have a fondness for it. Right.

396
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:16,300
Or playing instruments or cooking or whatever. So I like learning. I like, you know, learning things.

397
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:24,220
And especially if they're big things that are important. And I have certain people that I communicate with.

398
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:35,760
And if I had found a source that was able to convey important information clearly, concisely and objectively, wouldn't be doing the sonic presentations at all.

399
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:42,040
I would just sit back and people that I communicated with, I would, you know, send them information, say, look at this, look at that.

400
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:48,300
Look at this guy here or whatever. Right. And I would you would not know about the Greek at all.

401
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,320
But the reason why I come out and speak is because no one is saying anything.

402
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:02,580
You know, I mean, I want to say no one is saying anything. It's just. Yeah, it sounds kind of arrogant or whatever.

403
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:09,060
But on the other hand, it's like, what the hell is going on? Are you people lost your minds? Are you crazy?

404
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:17,640
Oh, they're saying they're saying plenty, but generally what they're saying is just a complaint about the symptoms.

405
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:28,480
Yeah. Is anyone paying attention? Yeah. So, you know, sitting back, there's a there's a if I was not speaking,

406
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:36,480
I would feel that there's a level of negligence incorporated in my existence. So I have to come out and say, I mean, if you want,

407
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,420
if you folks want to know what I'm talking about, just go to the Internet radio and turn on anything. Right.

408
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:47,980
Or go to YouTube, start watching stuff. It's like, huh? What the hell is wrong with you people?

409
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,460
So anyway, you may not you can't really say they're wrong. Right. But you can't say they're right.

410
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:05,380
I would say that my interests and the reason that I, as I said, right when right when we started this,

411
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:15,900
that if it's up to me, that we'll we'll discuss scripture. I, I guess that I grew up in an environment where it was spoken of quite a bit.

412
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:24,740
And so I was familiar with it from a relatively young age and put together pretty early on that.

413
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:33,400
What is written and what is said in these congregations is very rarely congruent.

414
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:44,240
Not not even to touch upon what is actually done, but just just what is said, what is taught is not it's not there.

415
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:52,880
And there you'll get various explanations from any of these groups as to the why they apologize.

416
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:57,020
Apology. You'll get an apology. They'll speak in defense of it.

417
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:04,840
But so I've always it's I guess I've just kind of been drawn to it for that reason.

418
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:11,360
I'm going, well, there's there's good information here. It's obvious there are directions, lots, lots and lots of directions.

419
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,100
It's almost like a handbook for living on the surface of this planet.

420
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:22,720
And but it's it's ignored and distorted. And so I see this this object.

421
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:29,700
If you look at the scriptures as a whole, as an object, as a singular book, although it's many.

422
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:39,840
Forty nine. Yeah. Forty nine books that are being discussed, but not being directly addressed.

423
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:49,260
The only time that I could tolerate being in these places is when we were sitting in a circle and just reading passages and discussing them,

424
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:54,680
because it's very hard to skirt things when you have the ability.

425
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:04,220
But I can't. I can't. It's been many, many years since I've subjected myself to to that particular form of punishment.

426
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:12,960
But I've there's value and it's valuable. It's something that is rare.

427
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:20,500
You know, there are many, many textbooks and I'm sure we'll get into, you know, who edits textbooks these days.

428
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,320
But there's lots of information available.

429
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:33,760
But when you start going and looking for what this information is based upon, it's just it's not present theory.

430
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:39,080
Lots, lots and lots of theory going from scripture to what people refer to as science these days.

431
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,540
Science is just a word that means knowledge. It kind of is a pet peeve.

432
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:49,320
I suppose when I hear people talking about science, because that's that's simply what it is.

433
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:54,640
You know, knowledge being aware of it, being aware of something else.

434
00:49:55,060 --> 00:50:00,760
It's been turned into a faith instead of being natural philosophers.

435
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:08,240
Now we have the priests in the white coat that call themselves scientists or that other people refer to as scientists.

436
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:18,940
It's just it's absurd. The the way that information is communicated, good or bad, currently is just absurd.

437
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:25,740
And there is so much that is left out. And when instead of things being discussed,

438
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:36,080
people start insulting people that do not agree with their beliefs, be them, quote unquote, scientific or even if the beliefs are founded on nothing.

439
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:43,040
Yeah. If you peel away the onion, there's nothing there. And then it just the whole process just brings tears.

440
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:54,040
Right. Right. One of those people that's just looked around and like this, the way that we exist, we I'm using very, very lightly, I guess.

441
00:50:54,220 --> 00:51:01,080
But referring to, you know, service dwellers and what I've had the occasion and the opportunity to observe.

442
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:09,920
There's three words in a row is that it's it's just it's it's absurd.

443
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:16,740
And yet the absurdity is only referred to in art.

444
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,940
It seems art seems to be where the absurdity at least is reflected in a more accurate manner.

445
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:28,100
But. Yeah, punk rock and hip hop. Yeah. No, I'm just joking.

446
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:35,600
Surprise, man. There's lots of both now. Once upon a time, you could pigeonhole it.

447
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:41,640
But these days, music is one of those things. I'm I'm a musician, for those that are unaware.

448
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:49,180
So it's something that is it's certainly a passion. It's something that I've done since I was very young.

449
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:53,220
And it's all I've ever really wanted to do as far as work goes.

450
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:58,560
But it's it can be used.

451
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,440
You know, it's a medium like any other can be used properly or improperly.

452
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:05,140
You can impart good information or bad information.

453
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:09,320
So sonically using an instrument in the voice can be an instrument as well.

454
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:16,020
If you listen to opera, I want to go back to the concept of scripture, perhaps calling it a manual.

455
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:19,340
I haven't done that in a long time. A user's manual.

456
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:27,920
Now, whenever you have a benevolent creator of anything, they fit whatever they've created to the end user with a manual.

457
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:34,000
You ever notice buying something, even a very rudimentary appliance like a toaster or hairdryer?

458
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:38,760
You open the package and and what falls out a manual.

459
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:48,860
And you ever notice on these manuals, especially electrical devices, that the first couple of pages are filled with what not to do.

460
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:55,440
Danger could cause shock, potential injury and death. Do not submerge in water. Do not.

461
00:52:55,660 --> 00:53:00,560
Right. You ever notice that? Yeah. Yeah. The first few pages are the dotes.

462
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:05,560
Right. It's not interesting how it. Yeah. Think about that for a moment, folks.

463
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:13,780
And it seems like right now humanity is they've got a product, let's say a blow dryer, and they've got the manual.

464
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,900
They're aware of it, but they don't they don't want to look at it.

465
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,720
So what they do is they take the blow dryer, plug it in and dunk it in water.

466
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,180
Right. Or they have to.

467
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,320
Current society. It's it doesn't. Oh, I don't like what I don't like that.

468
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,380
Like this is how it's done. I'm not going to do it like this.

469
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:46,500
It's like, well, OK, so it's interesting what we'll get into is what most of humanity is incorporated in incorporating their behavior and their actions and deeds and works are the don'ts in the in what's called the scripture.

470
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:55,220
Like, for example, I've stated before, there's not one religion on the planet that knows or does anything that's in the text that they allegedly subscribe to.

471
00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:03,400
So that's a tall statement. But if if you are have a faith in one of the main religions, you might find that to be offensive.

472
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,420
That's too bad because you're not pursuing the truth of the matter.

473
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:15,760
And if essentially if you on a cursory level start looking, it would say whatever religion you are in the book that is supposedly based on,

474
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:20,460
you'll say that what I just said is not true and you don't see it because you're reading into it.

475
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:26,220
But if you actually sit down and study it, you'll find that you might want to light your hair on fire and run down the street screaming.

476
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,100
We've wasted your entire life following these ridiculous institutions.

477
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:44,100
But anyway, the other thing about about this that you'll find that what they are actually partaking in, no matter what religion it is,

478
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:49,900
is the don'ts in what the book that they allegedly subscribe to us.

479
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:54,080
When I say nothing, that they don't do anything, that that's a general statement.

480
00:54:54,080 --> 00:55:01,100
But to get more specific, most religions are doing things that are in the text that they allegedly subscribe to.

481
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,680
And the things that they're doing are the things that are considered abominable or forbidden.

482
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:16,700
I would say most most. I would say there are. And I'll be at a lot of them are just a disguise for something else.

483
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:21,180
But there are, you know, charitable organizations out there.

484
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:26,760
There are people out there feeding people that don't or don't have the ability to feed themselves, clothing themselves.

485
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:35,020
You know, there's still good being done. But what is what is discussed and what is taught?

486
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:40,200
It's honestly what is discussed and what is taught. It's kind of amazing that there are still good things being done.

487
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,900
Well, the good things that are being done are out of a guilt.

488
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:48,260
Just like, for example, I bring up the example, whether it's good or not, just something that is in your face.

489
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:54,720
After 9-11, you notice how most government officials started wearing these little American flag lapel pins to show how patriotic they were

490
00:55:54,720 --> 00:56:00,140
when they were actually in on what was going on prior to it. It's to kind of like cover their guilt.

491
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:07,880
And it's not really I shouldn't say it that way, because the government I've never all governments and all throughout time,

492
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:11,840
current, past, present, any country in the world is the government you deserve, period.

493
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:16,340
There's nothing wrong with it, even though they might just be doing wrong in certain cases.

494
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:25,460
They are there to fit what the society is about. That's all it is. So, yeah, it's like a mirror.

495
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,060
You don't put a pink elephant in the mirror and expect to see a green giraffe.

496
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:33,080
You put a pink elephant in the mirror, you're going to see a pink elephant in the mirror.

497
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:39,820
If you don't like the people that are ruling you, you need to just look at your neighbors and your family and whatever,

498
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,280
and you will find that they are identical in nature.

499
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:50,700
So, yeah, that's why if you look at the things about wisdom is don't try to change any of this because you're not.

500
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:58,400
Just set yourself apart from it. It's like if you had a well-paying job working in the sewer or with high-tension power lines,

501
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,200
do you go in there with a tank top and flip-flops and touch everything?

502
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:05,220
Or you go in with protection?

503
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:15,560
Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, you don't want to touch, yeah, because you will be zapped or you will be dirty and stinky and unhealthy.

504
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:24,560
So, that's the other good advice is avoid people that talk about making humanity better and the world a better place.

505
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:31,720
Those people are clueless. They have no clue. They are just, yeah, it's just not good.

506
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,220
It sounds good, makes you feel good.

507
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,960
And here's just another note, folks.

508
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:46,760
This is not about pessimism or things being dark or evil or whatever, because you are at the precipice right now.

509
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:54,580
From an age, from the age's point of view, you know, the 30 seconds or 10 seconds to midnight where things are going to end,

510
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:02,480
the next stage of humanity is going to be so wonderful and so incredible compared to all of the things that have been recorded about humanity,

511
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:09,340
good or bad, that even the worst things that you've ever imagined done by humans will be nothing,

512
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:17,560
will be considered trivial when you compare it to the benefits and the wonderment and the existence that you're going to have in the future as humanity.

513
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:24,500
So, the most atrocious, horrendous things that have been done by people will be just like peanut shells falling on the floor

514
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:29,060
compared to the wonderful things that you will be open to.

515
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:36,060
You will fully understand all the misery, the evil, the mayhem, the lying, the deceit, the corruption,

516
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:45,760
and you will see that it has its place and why it had to be done the way it was done in the future, but not now.

517
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:52,680
And we will discuss what's coming in the future because there's only a couple of years left where you can actually discuss it,

518
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:58,060
and then those who know what's coming will not be speaking because it's going to be kind of dangerous to do so.

519
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:09,680
So, the reason why is because the closer you get to a point where things are going to go south, let's say, meaning not well,

520
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:17,440
the window dressing and what you're going to be shown in society and in your personal lives is going to be the opposite.

521
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:24,660
Things are going to appear to be getting better and better and better, judicially, economically, academically, let's say,

522
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:31,520
religiously, government-wise, financially, economically, all these things are going to be getting better and better and better

523
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,740
the closer you get to what I call the kill shots.

524
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:46,780
So, it's going to be very difficult to explain to people what's coming next when they're fully engrossed in a real society

525
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:49,700
with real things going on that are getting better.

526
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:53,480
Yeah, they're going to get harsh, and we will explain how and why with detail.

527
00:59:54,900 --> 01:00:04,500
One example would be of what the future is going to be like in the next decade is if you run into someone who lives in a big mansion

528
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:10,320
and has a very expensive exotic car and fancy jewelry, and you say, wow, look how wealthy this guy is,

529
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:16,220
and then you find out that it's all borrowed and rented and the person is just one day away from being homeless.

530
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:18,680
People don't want to hear that.

531
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:24,300
They just want to see, wow, look at that expensive house that he has, an expensive car, and all that jewelry.

532
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,420
There's no way this guy is completely destitute and broke, and none of it is really his.

533
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:34,340
And that is how humanity, this is what humanity is going into in the next decade.

534
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:45,280
You're going to be exposed to the pinnacle of human society, but you are going to be subject to pretty much a condition

535
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:55,100
that's going to last three and a half years that is going to render the entire surface of the planet only with a small remnant of humans left.

536
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:00,660
And the reason why is because most people are unrehabilitatable.

537
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:08,020
You cannot have seven billion people with the mindset that they have right now to go to the next level.

538
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:14,180
And the remnant that's going to be left, it's not because they're better or only the good people.

539
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:16,560
No, it'll be a representative sample.

540
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:28,750
So the reason I'm throwing this in there is because this is part of the subject matter that I found is very interesting and can be conveyed.

541
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:37,760
It's an interesting basis, that's for sure.

542
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:52,520
Yeah, and you can rationally sort out the information, even though it seems irrational when you incorporate the mind and the body,

543
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:53,860
because the body likes comfort.

544
01:01:54,660 --> 01:02:02,970
And when things are getting better and feel better in society, both personal and social, and when I mean social,

545
01:02:02,970 --> 01:02:11,230
I mean geopolitical and personal and all around, when things are seemingly getting better and better,

546
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:18,790
people don't want to hear that the whole thing's going to crash next week or in a year or three years, or this is how it's going to go down.

547
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:22,790
They don't want to hear that because the body is comfortable and the mind is comfortable.

548
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:26,010
It's housed in this container that is experiencing joy.

549
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:27,250
You're a party pooper, right?

550
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:35,670
So right now, before these things are incorporated into society and this upward swinging tide comes through,

551
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:41,370
it's kind of interesting to those that have eyes and ears to be aware of what to be aware of.

552
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:44,010
And we will discuss that in detail as well.

553
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:51,180
I'd say that we've already gone into quite a bit of detail.

554
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:52,180
Yeah.

555
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:52,980
So what do you think?

556
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:54,500
What's the time on this?

557
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,380
Should we wrap it up or what do you think?

558
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,480
I think we've been going for like half an hour, something like that, a little bit longer perhaps.

559
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,060
Oh, that seems like hours.

560
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:03,500
Okay.

561
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:05,460
Anything else?

562
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,580
That much worth of information certainly.

563
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:09,560
Yeah.

564
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:20,980
If you would like to get into contact with us, the email is uncommonsenseradio1 at gmail.com.

565
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,820
I know that's a mouthful, but you can go to the website uncommonradio.com.

566
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:30,820
www.uncommonradio.com because if you put in uncommon radio as a general search,

567
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:35,120
we're not near the top of the query result query on that.

568
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:40,780
So www.uncommonradio.com brings you very close to it.

569
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:41,260
Right.

570
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,040
And there's a form there.

571
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:46,760
You can email directly from the site.

572
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:55,060
The sonic broadcast that will be forthcoming will be easily available there as well.

573
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:03,020
We also have a blog done by someone that really thinks the reporting that we've done

574
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:08,620
and the Greek has done is critical and important for others, and it's a blog, Just Greek Speak, I believe.

575
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:16,080
And there's also a Skype setup, which anyone that's interested in joining the Skype.

576
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:21,460
And there's also a chat in the blog, and I don't have that in front of me,

577
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:33,020
but you will find a link to the blog on the Uncommon Radio site, and it's listed as the unofficial blog.

578
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,100
And it's not done by myself or Seth,

579
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,920
but it's done by someone who has invested quite a bit of time into it

580
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:49,740
and has found that what is being said is being important enough that a blog would have been a good project for them to engage in

581
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:54,640
and invest that amount of time into it, and I'm very appreciative of them doing that.

582
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:01,260
They have their own way of expressing what has been expressed, which I found to be ‑‑

583
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,880
you know, I haven't really spent much time on it.

584
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:04,760
I just put it up for everyone else.

585
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:09,740
And there's also a Skype setup as well and a chat there.

586
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,120
So I just want to throw that out, things to look for.

587
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:15,000
We might be more engaging in the future.

588
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:16,640
Yeah, absolutely.

589
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:25,500
And we will respond to emails when opportunity is there.

590
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:34,660
You can get into contact with me directly at dearredshoesatgmail.com, D-E-A-R-R-E-D-S-H-O-E-S at gmail.com.

591
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:38,820
And that's a relatively quick way to get into contact with me.

592
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,080
And yeah, come back.

593
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,420
We will be doing this.

594
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,680
We're not going to do it scheduled, really.

595
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:52,400
We're going to do it as we have the time and the topics to discuss.

596
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,900
Let's say weekly or four times a month or maybe not.

597
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:00,120
You know, roughly the weekly thing seems to be okay, right?

598
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:01,040
Maybe in frequency.

599
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:02,540
Certainly.

600
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,220
And we're going to do that.

601
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:13,880
If you'd like to help support the broadcasts in any way, you can email us,

602
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,880
and we'll let you know how to do that as well.

603
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,300
Everything is appreciated.

604
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:23,740
I'm glad that there are some people out there that are going to be able to hear these conversations.

605
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,060
And I do encourage you to get into contact with us.

606
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,600
We will, you know, explain what we can.

607
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:32,680
Yeah.

608
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:33,780
Perfect.

609
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:34,300
All right.

610
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:35,100
Yeah.

611
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:35,560
Okay.

612
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:41,800
Well, thanks again, Seth, and everyone who's listening and hearing as well.

613
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:42,580
Absolutely.

614
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:43,880
See you again soon.

615
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,740
Be well, and we'll speak to you again in the near future.
