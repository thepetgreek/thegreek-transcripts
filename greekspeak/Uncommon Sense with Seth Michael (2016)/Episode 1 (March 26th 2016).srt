00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,670
Welcome one and all this is American Freedom Radio at Americanfreedomradio.com

2
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,110
And this is the Greek with Seth Michael

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:16,330
And we're going to be working on a project called Uncommon Sense. So welcome everyone who's listening out there and welcome Seth

4
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:16,950
Hello, Seth

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,430
Hello Greek

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,930
All right, and we're here

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,930
We're calling it Uncommon Sense. This is a project. We're calling it a project because

8
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,430
There's a purpose

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,110
and we're

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,090
thankful to American Freedom Radio to give us this time

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:34,290
and

12
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,810
You're going to be hearing us meaning the Greek and Seth

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:43,970
For as long as it takes for this project to perhaps either come to a completion or somehow

14
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,470
Be perpetual in one way or another

15
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,670
and again, it's called Uncommon Sense and

16
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,550
Why is it uncommon?

17
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,210
Because maybe

18
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,510
It's time for something like this

19
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,010
There's an ancient Greek philosopher

20
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,930
That talked about things being uncommon

21
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,330
And maybe we're going to go beyond philosophy and talk about the practical

22
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,550
And things that anyone can attain or observe

23
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,810
So with that said

24
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:15,630
Yeah, you perhaps heard the greek speak before

25
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,990
And you've heard Seth Michael before as well

26
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,050
And yeah, Seth you you have some

27
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,650
Expertise of your own as well people know you as being sonically rich in one way or another

28
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,290
So if Seth want to say a word or two before we start getting into what we're going to do

29
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:39,430
On this project Seth you want to just maybe say a few things?

30
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,730
Yeah, i'd like to let everyone know if they would like they can visit the website

31
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:51,170
It's currently just sort of like a calling card, but it's uncommonradio.com spelled just how it sounds very

32
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,950
Straightforward and should be relatively easy to find

33
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,010
uncommonradio.com

34
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,290
Eventually, you'll be able to find past recordings of the program there

35
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,870
We may end up doing a small bibliographic section just for

36
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,210
Possible references for some of the subjects that we talk about

37
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,090
and it's going to be

38
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,710
Relatively

39
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,330
This being the first episode. It's kind of an introduction

40
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,210
Um quite literally and etymologically even

41
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:27,470
That's a an accurate way of describing it. So

42
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,710
We're going to just kind of have a conversation

43
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:31,990
and

44
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,050
For those of you that are new to well, everyone I suppose will be new to this program

45
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,850
but uh, we'll we'll do you know, we're not just gonna

46
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,270
jump in

47
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,590
To the thick of things without a little bit of a a primer for those who haven't

48
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,790
Heard these topics discussed before and honestly if you haven't

49
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,130
heard

50
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,630
the greek

51
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:02,630
Or myself or heard us speak, you know with each other on the different programs that we've done. So

52
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,690
It will be

53
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:13,610
Something that is is certainly uncommon. I think that uh, i'm I like words and uh their meanings throughout

54
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,730
uh history i'm kind of a

55
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,450
a an etymologist of sorts

56
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:20,970
and

57
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:27,870
Uncommon is is a an apt title for for this program. So

58
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:35,070
Um, yeah, let's let's get into it. What would you like to discuss? Well, you know, there's a perspective

59
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,310
that one can take and um

60
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:44,050
it's called the the object the objectivity of a matter or the objectiveness of something or the perspective of

61
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,670
Uh something being a little more clean or pure less tainted or corrupt

62
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,070
and uh

63
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,830
We found that

64
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:58,770
I say we whoever the we is incorporated in that is that there's a there's a a social

65
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,410
Undertone about this is a society of corruption. It's a society of

66
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,950
just bad things happening and you know, everyone sort of accepts this as being common, but

67
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,910
But why you know, is it?

68
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,190
Are we just discussing the symptoms as a collective?

69
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,950
Are there specific reasons? Is there a history involved? Is the perception involved?

70
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,090
Is uh, is there something called the psychology of a crowd?

71
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,190
You know, I just want to introduce

72
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:33,030
Someone named gustav lebon who wrote a book called the crowd in 1895

73
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,550
And it's the psychology of a crowd and what happens when people get together

74
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,630
And typically it's not very positive

75
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,050
But there are positive things that can come out of it if it's done

76
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,890
And let's say a fit and proper or lawful way

77
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:55,170
So we're going to start looking at things here. Um, partly because uh, there's an unspoken need for it as well

78
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:01,070
You know seth many times I turn on what's called media whether it's mainstream or alternative

79
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:07,330
And I might be alone and I find myself yelling at the speakers or the device that i'm listening to

80
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,770
And i'm like, I can't believe this is being said and accepted

81
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:14,670
You know how many times have I think you and I have mentioned that in private?

82
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:21,010
And it goes across the board seemingly with almost any topic that's ever discussed whether it be religious

83
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,250
governmental judicial economic scientific

84
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,590
I'm, like wondering and saying what are they saying?

85
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:28,970
This stuff is

86
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:30,010
Unfounded

87
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,250
It's completely debased

88
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,910
so there there's a search that some people want to want to

89
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,550
Embark on which is to find out what things are based on

90
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,010
and of course

91
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,590
Like i've said before

92
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:52,670
You're not going to make friends doing this because people like to be part of the crowd. You will have some interesting conversations

93
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:53,810
Yes

94
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,110
Yes as well, you know the thing with that is occasionally

95
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:02,830
People that have strong beliefs in the things that we just brought up as being unfounded

96
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,450
you you have to be very careful with them because sometimes they start to put on a face that

97
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,990
Implies that they're ready to bring physical bodily harm to you

98
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,910
You have to be very careful on how you approach some of these subjects

99
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,110
Yes. Yes, um i've found

100
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,930
uh in talking with

101
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,810
Just specifically with the history of words and

102
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,970
I guess kind of a small primer on

103
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,990
my perspective of what words are and my own kind of

104
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,870
involvement and

105
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,230
intrigue

106
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,010
you could say with

107
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:47,970
The specifically the english language just because that's the one that I you know am most familiar with

108
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,870
Is that words are

109
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:52,810
are

110
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,910
It can be very very useful. Um, and that's because in

111
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,570
the very very basic

112
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:08,630
It's they they're tools. They are tools and we use them. Yeah, we use them to communicate with one another

113
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,910
Uh, we use them in in song in verse

114
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,130
um, and that's you know

115
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,350
has been

116
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:22,030
We've used them for for quite quite a while now we being, you know service-willing earth inhabitants

117
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,350
um

118
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:24,210
and

119
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,430
I when I was younger I read

120
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,150
um

121
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,610
a a few a handful of books that had a

122
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,850
Probably an unintentioned impact upon me, uh by ursula le glean

123
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,290
um

124
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,230
and

125
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:45,930
They they were you know novels. It was fiction, but the the way that words were used

126
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,450
As uh, what could be described as like a plot device?

127
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:57,110
Um was kind of eye-opening for me at a at a relatively young age, um, and

128
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,310
That's so i've i've always had

129
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,770
uh this

130
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:09,290
You know like we all do like the that feeling that something just isn't right and when you start getting into

131
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,610
uh language

132
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:11,810
and

133
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,850
you realize that

134
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:18,290
We take words from other languages and apply our own meanings to them

135
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:25,270
Specifically english speakers as it means perhaps. Yeah. Yeah as we we will change

136
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,470
What is being said and as someone who?

137
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,470
Uh likes to read old books

138
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:36,070
And study, you know old writings and things of that nature

139
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,230
Knowing what the words meant when they were first used in these writings

140
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:47,230
becomes something of importance because we live in a time where

141
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,630
These tools, you know, these words are used

142
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,570
not simply to build things but also to

143
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,330
tear things down and to alter them to change what is

144
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:06,170
Being built and not only not only written but spoken i've noticed

145
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:11,390
Perhaps there's a qualitative issue there, you know people can be wordy

146
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,610
Many things can be written and said but on the quality issue perhaps

147
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,490
Um, I like saying do you say what you mean and mean what you say?

148
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,570
You know like the issue of people describing their offspring as kids

149
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:29,570
Is an interesting concept to dwell on just for a moment because um

150
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:35,710
People will say my kids this my kids that and I said well that's going to be really rough having that many goats around

151
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,010
And they're like, well, you know what?

152
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:42,370
I mean, i'm not talking about goats and i'm saying but you said kids 15 times in the last 10 seconds

153
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:47,650
So a kid is a baby goat so you don't say what you mean and you don't mean what you say

154
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,370
So we have a quality issue here. Hmm

155
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,070
So because intentionally

156
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,730
One can just sit back and say i'll let them use the term kid

157
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,530
Because I do know what they mean in this particular society, right?

158
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:07,290
But what that tells me about that certain person man woman individual let's say

159
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,690
Is that there's a quality issue here, right?

160
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,530
They're not

161
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,210
Looking at the quality of what they're saying

162
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:21,390
whether it lacks specificity or accuracy or it also tells me a lot about the person that they

163
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,370
Are very readily prepared to fall into the social norm of the day

164
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,110
you see and

165
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:34,630
You know, and by the way, you mentioned about looking at ancient and old books and writings and I just want to say this

166
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,490
out loud

167
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:36,730
uh

168
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,890
Is that many people today have an aversion to bringing up the topic of things old?

169
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,090
I've noticed that and it's increasing

170
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,910
Uh, and and what I found looking at things that are old

171
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:54,710
Is that when you one studies, uh, let's say these heightened civilizations in the past, you know

172
00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:00,750
Ancient babylon ancient greece ancient rome and so ha and so far even some of the ancient cultures right before their fall

173
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,430
They considered themselves to be modern

174
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:10,050
And if and I guess this society today does consider themselves to be modern as well, don't they

175
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:15,670
And you've heard that history repeats itself. I don't think it does because history is just a record

176
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:18,130
I believe that people repeat it

177
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,870
um, there's a level here of quality again if

178
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:29,570
One doesn't care about the outcome whether it's positive or negative and they just seem to just go ahead with something

179
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,670
Just to go ahead with it

180
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:33,290
There seems to be a major issue of quality

181
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:38,330
So it's the quality of things I think that we will begin to broach on and discuss

182
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,850
Further and further as time goes on

183
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,250
yeah, and the

184
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,530
um

185
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:48,410
I've i've heard it said and I cannot place the quote

186
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,490
That history does not repeat but it does rhyme

187
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,810
right and you will see uh throughout

188
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,930
Even just what is easily available to us through specifically, you know

189
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,390
right now

190
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,510
with uh the access to

191
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:12,110
All this information whether it's good or bad or true or false, you know is

192
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,510
something that we will get into further but

193
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:18,070
the the access that we have

194
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,110
currently is

195
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,670
uh without precedent in

196
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,190
You know academically accepted

197
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:31,990
History be careful with that word. Yes. Yes, well, uh with intention. Yes, let's uh

198
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,810
Whether it's been you know, whether we've had uh ease of communication

199
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,990
uh worldwide in the past is something that is currently

200
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,170
uh

201
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,010
speculated about um, there have been you know, a lot of

202
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:47,870
recent findings

203
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:49,070
that

204
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,090
would suggest that

205
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,010
the

206
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,810
the ability to communicate globally

207
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,130
um

208
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:04,330
Has you know is not something that is actually new and though it may not be, you know, exactly history repeating itself

209
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,970
Um, it seems to like I said, you know, right?

210
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:14,210
So yeah, well here here's here's maybe a thought that will probably set the tone for things uncommon

211
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:20,710
Um, it could it could be dubbed the information age right might have heard that we're in the information age

212
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:26,070
And now let's look at a little bit of history and I know people cringe because you know, we just kind of established from

213
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,530
Sensing, uh some feedback not not from all but from many people don't like discussing things that are not

214
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:37,010
Modern, but let's not get too old. Let's just talk about have you heard of the industrial age, right?

215
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,470
This was late 19th century or so

216
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,850
um and and um

217
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,530
Then you know, what is what is how did that end up?

218
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:52,210
Um, a lot of planned obsolescence toxicity and and proof of that is you know, I like going into

219
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,510
um chiding, uh

220
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:59,670
New car dealers, you know, I walk in and I say to the car dealers. I say well, you know, is this the new model?

221
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,130
And they say yes it is and I say is it different than last year's and say oh, yeah it is

222
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:08,490
I said could that be because you guys haven't still figured out how to make them, right?

223
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:13,150
You know, uh, I bought a hammer 30 years ago and if I go buy a hammer today

224
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,950
It seems to be relatively the same almost indiscernible

225
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:22,810
Might be a different color might be a different color as such but but here's the thing. What is the industrial age brought?

226
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:29,490
A lot of things that people are not really so happy about but don't want to discuss

227
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:34,990
I mean in in the americas you have what's called the rust belt in in united what they call the united states

228
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:38,930
Uh, and there's there's just an interesting just tastefulness

229
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:45,030
That lingers when you say industrial age now, let's go maybe bump around a little bit

230
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,890
And then came what's called the space age, right? That was the space age, you know when they're in 1950s 60s 70s

231
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,690
We're in the space age. How did that how did that work out?

232
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,430
Uh, we had jumped the gun on titling that that age

233
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,650
Yeah, I think they were talking about the space between people's ears, but but nonetheless

234
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,390
Um, here's the thing and and i'm going to say this emphatically you you're not going into space

235
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:14,430
You know, you were promised flying cars at the world's fair in the 30s by the 1980s

236
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:20,890
You're promised jet packs. I know the jetsons supposedly took place in the year 2200 or 2100 or something

237
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,190
But you're not going to the moon. You're not going into space. Sorry folks

238
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,350
And there's a very simple reason why because if you go out into space

239
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:34,610
There is no way you're going to be come back and tell people what you saw because if you're in space things are not

240
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,790
As you've been told

241
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:40,970
And the people that's why there are so few going into space and coming back

242
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,690
And you don't go into space unless you accept

243
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:49,930
The truth that you will give the report that you're told to report on what you saw when you're out there

244
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:56,770
Fascinating, but what happened to the space race? What happened to space age? No, let's not talk about that, man

245
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:00,810
Right. So now this is the information age. Oh boy

246
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,730
Need I say any more?

247
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,610
What information what information

248
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,950
Well, there's plenty of information. It's it's uh,

249
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,330
You know, it's validity. It's convenience is is

250
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:18,770
Questionable. Yes and yeah convenience. Absolutely. I mean here here's the interesting part about it

251
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,570
There's something called about the best and highest use of something

252
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,170
and um, uh

253
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:29,950
You know what let's just be truthful about this if the internet or alternative media had

254
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:37,830
Anything that was in its best and highest use in terms of uncommon sense we wouldn't be here

255
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,050
I would just privately be messaging people go listen to this

256
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,010
Go hear that

257
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:49,490
And it's not to say that there's not a lot of good stuff, but it's really difficult to find it

258
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,610
And is it a needle in the haystack? Absolutely, but you know the easiest way to find

259
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,850
A needle in the haystack is with a magnet

260
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,210
That's right

261
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:05,170
Yeah, and there's a lot of we could say the term bulldung or bullshit and there's a lot of it everywhere

262
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,290
But you know what? It only takes a little shovel to move a big pile of it

263
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,890
So it's going to be very interesting. So henceforth this project

264
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,849
You know, uh, there's it's all about perspective and point of view

265
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,569
You know, it's uh, what vantage point

266
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:29,310
You know, and again, I encourage anyone to pick up gustav lebon l-e-b-o-n the crowd and just to preface on that

267
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,870
What's going on still?

268
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:31,950
is

269
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:39,450
Gustav lebon wrote about the crowd psychology. I don't fully endorse everything that he said, but it's really a very neat and tidy package

270
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,310
um to look at

271
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,870
And just to boil it down for people

272
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:48,530
In order to form a crowd or when a crowd forms they form under an idea

273
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:53,030
And typically the idea has to be simplified and often oversimplified

274
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,090
So everyone in the crowd can accept it

275
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,110
and when these ideas and concepts that the crowd unites under become

276
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,450
Simplified and sometimes if not mostly

277
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,330
Oversimplified they no longer represent the original concept or theme

278
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:16,030
And now we have a big diversion and what ends up being a mob very often. I mean

279
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,390
A very simple way to look at it is look at uh,

280
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:20,850
alternative media

281
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,930
What do they call activism?

282
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,390
or protesting

283
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,770
Or movements or they call it truth movement and such, you know, I mean

284
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,430
Has that yielded anything?

285
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:32,510
um

286
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:39,170
You know, I mean is it yielded anything really other than youtube hits for people, you know when there is you know

287
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:44,910
um, I I would agree with what you said at the very at the very beginning with

288
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,810
Listening to media in all of its forms

289
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:48,850
um

290
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:54,090
and I suppose that it's easy for us to pick on, you know alternative media in particular because

291
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,190
Uh, you and I are you know

292
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,950
Relatively familiar with it and have been for a number of years

293
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,750
And have listened to a lot of what is out there and not just

294
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:11,150
Okay, so we will seth has just maybe lost a little bit of contact I hope i'm still available

295
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,310
But uh the picking on the alternative media is not the be-all end-all but it was probably

296
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:20,710
One way to say folks you've got to start thinking about what is the highest

297
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:25,630
Use the highest and best use of this and it's first communication second

298
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,210
information and third entertainment

299
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:33,790
And very often what i've heard from many is that they just like listening for entertainment

300
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:40,570
And the subject matter can be very very serious to the trivial and what's interesting is when we get serious

301
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,450
you know

302
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:47,510
One thing that I come out and say very typically is hey, does anyone know what day it is today?

303
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,030
And that ends up always being one of the most interesting topics that people like to ignore

304
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,890
You know keeping time

305
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:56,930
Keeping uh

306
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,070
a basis for things that

307
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:04,230
You might want to function in what is that based on? You know, what is your faith based on?

308
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:09,250
What is the science based on you know, and these are the subjects that we're going to try to perhaps

309
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:15,150
Grab by the tail one by one and continue to open and show people. Hey

310
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:22,990
There's no reason to be frustrated and if you are it's really your choice because everything is commonly available

311
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:29,130
And when you show things as being commonly available, it seems very uncommon because not all the other

312
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:30,670
people or

313
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,770
Children in the class want to do that

314
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,150
So it's going to be a very interesting ride here. So as we're

315
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:43,250
Continuing we lost seth for a moment. Hopefully we'll get him back in a moment. Uh, so

316
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,650
I'll just continue with some of the concepts that people might want to

317
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,690
Say is called greek speak

318
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,510
you know, uh

319
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,350
i'd say

320
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,690
one thing to start with is

321
00:20:56,430 --> 00:21:00,870
What day is it really basic and uh might sound kind of shocking

322
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:05,810
But do you know that you can't keep time with the pope's work schedule? What?

323
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,230
Pope's work schedule. Yeah

324
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,190
Do you know the thing you call the calendar?

325
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,750
Do you know that you can't keep time with that?

326
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:18,570
It's not a time piece, but wait a second greek. I go to work and do all kinds of things

327
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,310
Well, it seems like we dropped

328
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,810
Lost the web coming back

329
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,250
Oh, we're all we're still on we just had a glitch there technical

330
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:33,030
Glitch, uh, it shows that we don't have the radio, but I hear that we're still speaking. We're still on

331
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:34,770
so, um

332
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:41,310
Let's see if uh, we are I don't have a way to monitor this, but we'll just continue we did we did lose you

333
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,210
uh

334
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:47,310
Yeah, and we shouldn't be on because american freedom radio is uh,

335
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:53,990
Showing that we're offline, but I don't know if we're online. Maybe i'll uh, just take a five second inquiry here

336
00:21:53,990 --> 00:22:00,090
I'll be right back. Okay. Well, I think it's just you and I uh, I think we got dropped

337
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:03,390
I don't know if uh, danny is I don't know. I don't know if we're on right now

338
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:07,010
Um, let me just go into chat and see what happens

339
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,610
Oh, it says we're still on. Okay, great

340
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,670
We're still on I just got a message. Thank you. Thank you, uh steve

341
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,370
uh

342
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:18,810
So, you know seth I was going into a little bit of a monologue there before you

343
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:23,950
You know, we were trying to recover you is and that was about keeping time. Isn't that very interesting?

344
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,150
One of the most basic things

345
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,130
Is learning how to keep time?

346
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:34,310
And I brought up the subject that you know, you can't keep time with the pope's work schedule and that sounds really strange

347
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,870
Huh? What?

348
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,850
That thing you call a calendar is not a time piece

349
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,350
Uh, that's something we could start at in

350
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,630
Wondering, you know, what is going on?

351
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,210
Could it be possible that the entire planet?

352
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:48,510
Is not paying any attention

353
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,770
and they've

354
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:55,470
Basically gave up on keeping time for a work schedule put out by the papacy

355
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:59,470
You know, I I think starting uh, and

356
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,710
Answering the question. What is time?

357
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:08,930
Would be a good place to start with that. Thank you. Yeah, because it's such a broad subject

358
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,950
I mean, it's a big it's like a large elephant

359
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,930
Which side of it you want to look at?

360
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,870
And interesting time can simply be defined by the recordation of events

361
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:23,570
And that kind of goes in the face of time travel you hear a lot about time travel

362
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,510
And you're not really traveling in time if you if anyone

363
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:33,330
Supposes to have done that you're actually traveling to past or future events, but time itself

364
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,770
time itself is uh

365
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,750
Are you still getting an echo?

366
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,570
No, i'm not getting an echo

367
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,350
Neither am I

368
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:51,090
So maybe just on the monitoring end, yeah, sorry about the technical difficulties, um folks will bear with us

369
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:57,070
But uh, maybe we'll just keep rolling along and seeing uh, kind of feedback we get from the studio

370
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:03,710
Um, but but timing the recordation of events and maybe there's a lot of nonsense thrown into science fiction

371
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,110
That can actually travel through record events

372
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,930
Perhaps it's the

373
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:12,970
Event itself that people are listening that either there's something from the past or the future

374
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:20,990
But in essence, uh keeping time and then to start back that you can't keep time with the

375
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,210
Pope's work schedule is an interesting concept as well

376
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,190
um

377
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:26,610
i've heard

378
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,390
uh, i've you know, i've

379
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,770
a lot of

380
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:30,970
anything

381
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,870
a lot of anything in this in this plane is

382
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,150
uh, very subject to

383
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,710
uh perception and

384
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:45,730
One's perspective where you were perceiving things from so I imagine that from

385
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,330
a uh

386
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,130
a higher perspective

387
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:50,810
There would be

388
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,330
a

389
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:57,790
A completely and totally different concept of what we would be familiar with this time. Whereas

390
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,110
Uh, you know, we are experiencing this

391
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:03,470
through our own very limited

392
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,330
um

393
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,990
perception and if there is a

394
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,570
Another point of reference another

395
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,790
point actually not point of reference but point of

396
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,750
perception

397
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,270
That things could be viewed actually

398
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,530
as

399
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,390
nothing existing

400
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:29,790
Outside of now and I don't mean this moment as relative to you and I but I mean

401
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,410
all moments as relative to

402
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,710
a perspective

403
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:34,690
that

404
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:38,130
might be if not difficult to

405
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,850
attain certainly difficult to

406
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:41,710
comprehend

407
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,350
with the you know, the limited

408
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:50,410
Interaction that we have with this world through our our meat puppets, you know our

409
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,350
But but but but again just to revisit the concept of time

410
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:58,310
It's a form of communication when we show up when we meet when we do things

411
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:01,190
and to see that uh, uh

412
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:06,550
It's such a simple form that maybe we can say there's lawful time keeping and there's

413
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:07,510
the

414
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:11,050
Could we say unlawful? Would it be fair to say unlawful?

415
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,330
You know, uh, in other words what i'm trying to

416
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:17,190
Is like if anyone observes a certain day

417
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:22,190
On what they call their glory encounter, you notice how it's a different day of week every year

418
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:26,170
How could it be and no one's paying attention to this?

419
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:31,990
Because you know could it be that there are actually mechanisms that are lawful for keeping time that are being ignored

420
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:36,690
And actually might become the norm in the future as they were in the past

421
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:42,390
You know, certainly like just throw this out, you know, uh today appears to be the sixth day of the second month

422
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,610
I'm, not making this up

423
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,470
So, uh, we'll still have a little

424
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:50,050
A bit of a technical problem. Let's see folks just bear with us

425
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,750
So we might just reset this and be back in a moment

426
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,650
And we're waiting for seth to come back

427
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:59,330
Apparently there was an echoing problem technical problem here

428
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,250
Which hopefully will be mitigated some way or another

429
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,690
Addressing some technical issues

430
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,330
So

431
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:18,370
But I do believe that we are back broadcasting live again, this is american freedom radio

432
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,430
And you are listening to

433
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,210
Seth and the greek

434
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,970
on uncommon sense

435
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,050
This being our first broadcast like this we are

436
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,470
Dealing with some technical issues, but they're being addressed. So we do appreciate your patience

437
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:43,450
I think I can speak for the both of us on that at least

438
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,350
Okay

439
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:48,210
Yes. All right. Let's see. We're back now. We have a little bit of technical issue

440
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:53,690
But I hopefully it's been resolved and i'm relying on some feedback from anyone that's monitoring to see how we're doing

441
00:27:54,570 --> 00:28:00,030
Okay, so I hear that we're all back to normal. So, uh, yeah, so seth, uh, let's try this again

442
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:05,150
There's something about this timekeeping thing that we uh, just can't seem to bring that properly and I hear that we're good

443
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:10,670
Okay. Thank you. Uh steve. Thank you everyone else for uh supplying the uh,

444
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,530
quality

445
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:12,990
feedback here

446
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:21,310
Uh, but seth in short, you know, how many times have you and I discussed even publicly and publicly, uh on air about um

447
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:24,330
the pope's work schedule and no disrespect, of course because

448
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,750
You know through certain covenants one might say that you should never say anything bad against the leader of a people

449
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,910
But what's interesting about that?

450
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,810
Is very often there's a lot of

451
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:35,290
Hmm

452
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:41,350
Conspiratoriality or let's just say bad mouthing of the papacy

453
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,630
The vatican the roman system

454
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:49,610
And what's really interesting about that is you approach any of those individuals and ask them what day it is and you know

455
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:54,110
What they always say something between january and december and monday through friday

456
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:59,790
I just got to shake my head and walk away and say you've just admitted with your own mouth that you're the pope's subject

457
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,170
By the way, you keep time

458
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,750
How do you think the rest of your active

459
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:09,650
Activism or protesting the papacy is going to go for you. It's not going to do very well

460
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:10,590
so

461
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:18,890
You know, how how can one set themselves apart without acknowledging what they're doing? That's another concept as well

462
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:25,350
But you know, I think we can go over time keeping but maybe just rolling along with some of the concepts that'll be brought up

463
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:28,690
You know the concept of being set apart perhaps

464
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:32,950
Do you think we're moving along on too many subjects here seth, how do you feel about it?

465
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:34,690
No, I think we're doing just fine

466
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,170
dealing with

467
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,910
What we're dealing with. I think that I think that time is a good

468
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,390
a good, uh

469
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:48,210
Basis, um and having it it's recordation actually based upon something

470
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,930
Uh that might be a little bit more

471
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:56,090
Than arbitrary or a yeah a methodology that is easily referenced

472
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:56,650
uh

473
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,190
for you know

474
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,390
certain localities

475
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:08,330
Um, but well beyond that as well for you know anywhere on on on the face of this

476
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:12,150
Planet that you can see the sky

477
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,190
because from

478
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:15,930
the earliest

479
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:22,330
Records that we have available to us and again by we I just mean, you know service-willing

480
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:23,870
earth inhabitants

481
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,130
Um, it seems that

482
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:32,070
The stars and the other celestial bodies have always been used

483
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:35,110
uh to keep time because it is

484
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,750
those are things that

485
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,190
um

486
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:43,430
If they are arbitrary, they are arbitrary on a level that makes the term

487
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,470
Uh moot

488
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:50,950
Yeah, exactly from our perspective. So with that we have

489
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:51,510
uh

490
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:59,770
a system of reference that is can be you viewed if if not universal certainly

491
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:03,110
colloquially universal to

492
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,810
You know surface-dwelling earth inhabitants you can look up and identify

493
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:11,630
The you know the difference between the what we call the moon

494
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,730
And the sun

495
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,450
Then you have uh

496
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,170
You have all of the tools necessary

497
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,930
uh at the very least

498
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,330
to tell

499
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,510
what day

500
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:26,770
of the month

501
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,890
Uh, what day of the month not what the date is, but what what day?

502
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,010
it is

503
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,790
uh using

504
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:37,710
Which is say one more time say that one more time

505
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:43,510
Please there's a difference between the day and the date where a date is something used on a document based on a system

506
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,210
That's accepted

507
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,390
For the let's say nomenclature of that document

508
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:52,730
Or that society but it has nothing to do with the day. Yes continue, please

509
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,910
Yeah, so we are

510
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,710
uh dealing with uh

511
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:03,610
Subtle differences, but as I said, you know words are our tools and how how they are used

512
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:10,870
It has an effect upon the world around us. Um and our interactions with it. So being aware

513
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:13,230
That's

514
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,450
Uh things it's not just that things

515
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:20,170
Feel as if they are not right is actually the things

516
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:28,450
In general are not are not right. We're living in a time. That is incredibly arbitrary. Um arbitrary just means

517
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,070
um spoken

518
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:36,130
It's very very basic uh an arbitrator someone who speaks generally on another's behalf

519
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:40,330
but uh, it's literally, you know spoken so

520
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:43,830
the the date, um, which

521
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,710
What the

522
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,750
They would call it

523
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:49,190
uh by the by the work schedule

524
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,670
um, the papacy today would be

525
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,530
The third month and the what 26th day

526
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,730
Uh-huh

527
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:03,410
2016 and I wonder what happened over the other years, but go ahead, right? Yes, certainly. Um, even

528
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,990
even uh skeptics

529
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:11,310
I don't think that year, you know, the the zero year is when time began

530
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:18,310
Uh, that's just oh, yeah, and it's a it's it's significantly arbitrary and once you realize that

531
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,750
at the very basic things of what we use

532
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,430
uh to

533
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,550
Orchestrate our lives and to plan things

534
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:33,490
Um is completely and totally arbitrary. That's one easy simple easily referenceable way

535
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,490
to acknowledge and

536
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,190
Be aware that

537
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,670
Yes thing something is not right

538
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,810
right many things are not right this is

539
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:46,310
uh, and it's something that's it's

540
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,510
uh, very rarely discussed

541
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:51,390
at least in this manner and

542
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,210
um for

543
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,570
people all over all over the earth, that's

544
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,970
Reckon certain days to be significant

545
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:07,250
For one reason or another what those days are has been impacted greatly by

546
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:08,050
Um

547
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:13,110
By this work schedule and it is functional as a work schedule

548
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:18,130
It's good for a building plan if you have a work that needs to be done

549
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:20,909
It works very well for that

550
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:27,330
But it works well for organizing the subjects and by the way, it just does a footnote here. We're not poaching any subjects here

551
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:32,350
We're not asking anyone to consider what we're saying for their reality. Let's say

552
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:33,889
So yeah

553
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:41,110
But it is it is you know, i've heard of certain corporate campuses where they had 10 day work cycles

554
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:45,010
And the days were either given letters name, uh letters or colors

555
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:48,889
Yes, and the people rotated on the on certain cycles

556
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:54,030
And and what's going on right now is the entire planet has pretty much adopted that like, you know

557
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:59,170
Can we give a quick example today is what they call here where we are saturday the 26th of march

558
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:03,790
Do you know that last year it was probably a thursday or friday and next year it might be a sunday

559
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:08,250
So let me ask you is march 26, uh thursday or friday a saturday or sunday

560
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:11,790
It's neither and no one is paying any attention to this at all

561
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,490
you know, so

562
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:17,350
What else are they paying attention to you know, it's quite interesting

563
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:22,190
How about how about instead of um, I feel like we might be leaving a little bit of a vacuum

564
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,590
Maybe just show a little historic

565
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:24,610
reference

566
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,150
uh, perhaps uh

567
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:31,150
Let's just maybe discuss the concept that if anyone does a little bit of history

568
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:38,970
They'll notice that uh, it was traditional in ancient societies that they settled their debts with the full moon

569
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,010
and isn't it

570
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,570
Interestingly apparent that today you're sent a monthly bill

571
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:47,810
Your debts are allegedly settled with the moon

572
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:52,550
Or but even though they're not following it and what's interesting is you ever look at the?

573
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,650
pope's work schedule that the

574
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:58,890
Beginnings of the months tend to align more with the full moon

575
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:02,990
Than the middle dark moon interesting just something to think about

576
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:07,150
and and also because you got to remember all systems whether they're

577
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:13,370
Accurate or arbitrary still have there a parody on something that was lawful or based on something you see

578
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:19,430
Now the other interesting thing is if when the day starts if we look at ancient texts we see

579
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:21,950
That the day started at high noon

580
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,670
Whether it's biblical or secular

581
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,390
And what's interesting if people are old enough

582
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:33,390
Do you remember if you went to a banking institution and made a deposit afternoon they counted it as the next day?

583
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:37,330
Yes, um, they still I i'm not

584
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:38,450
uh

585
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,870
Incredibly well versed in in

586
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,330
current banking practices

587
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:49,050
But it is I I believe that it is still the case

588
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,530
um that

589
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:54,870
The you know, the banking day, um does still

590
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,490
uh

591
00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:02,730
Begin and end, you know, uh midday, you know, yeah, and and what's interesting is

592
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:10,530
Uh those that are I guess older film aficionados. Remember the wild west films the the papacy didn't chase them down

593
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:11,890
into the

594
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:14,450
the nether parts of the western americas

595
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:21,070
And they would hold court during day and uh the executions of hanging someone what what time did they start?

596
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,970
What when did those happen high noon?

597
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:23,810
Yep

598
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,350
Interesting, right

599
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:29,110
uh, so so these things now are something

600
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,010
that

601
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:36,770
Is the basis for time keeping and why why is it important to have a basis for things because guess what when you have?

602
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,530
The basis of it. You don't have to buy anything you ever notice that

603
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:45,490
When you start going into things that are based on something that is tangible

604
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,230
it sort of

605
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:50,630
Eliminates a need to have commerce being involved

606
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,490
you know, uh

607
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:59,270
So if you're using the celestial bodies to keep time, which is the lawful way or it's the basis you don't have to buy anything

608
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,370
I remember, uh

609
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:05,370
Growing up and the parents and the people around me said oh it's near the end of the year

610
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:10,050
We need to go to the hardware store or whatever and get a free calendar. So we know what day it is next year

611
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:10,870
right

612
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:14,730
Yeah, now it's done through the electronic conventions through the devices

613
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:18,170
So it's interesting how it transferred from print

614
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:22,950
To electronic it's and by the way, I just want to throw something in there you ever notice how

615
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:27,190
you bring up a bit of information, let's say in a text or a chat or

616
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:32,510
Online and what do people ask for they ask for a link you have a link for that

617
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:37,970
And i'm like, wait a second this link thing. I mean, it sounds reasonable, but there's something funny about it

618
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,470
Oh, I see aren't chains made of links

619
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,890
But anyway, I just wanted to

620
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:46,330
Yeah, so so this massive chain of links

621
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:51,670
Is being built and no one is paying attention to the fine points on what anything is based on

622
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,030
you know, another thing

623
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,970
maybe we could bring up is

624
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:57,170
temperature

625
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:03,030
Again, we mentioned something about quality. No one is paying attention to quality. It's all about quantity

626
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,950
You know when we discuss temperature we kind of talk about

627
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:11,670
The mercury rising or the mercury falling and by the way, you know mercury is toxic to us by the way

628
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,430
That's mostly

629
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:17,750
Yeah, okay. So it's interesting that was chosen. Yeah, I'd say well greek, you know was chosen. It's fluid. It's easy to work with

630
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:22,550
Okay, okay. Okay. That's not the point just an interesting observation. Remember just visiting here taking notes, right?

631
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,690
But what's interesting is the mercury

632
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:27,790
Or let's say the temperature quantity

633
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:32,530
Strictly limited to the expansion and contraction of mercury now. Hold on a second here

634
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,350
If you're wearing let's say a short sleeve shirt at sea level

635
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:39,950
At 70 degrees fahrenheit you might say you're comfortable

636
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,510
But if you go down below sea level at 70 degrees fahrenheit

637
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,750
with the same article clothing

638
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,250
You might say you feel a little a touch warm

639
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,570
But if you're at a mountaintop

640
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:57,590
At 70 degrees fahrenheit with the same short sleeve shirt, you might say you're a touch cool and you might need a jacket

641
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,910
But wait a second

642
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:04,510
It measured 70 degrees according to the mercury at all three locations. But how come you feel different?

643
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:09,510
Because it's the quality of the temperature that's not being discussed and where are the young

644
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:14,530
People let's say the brighter minds. Let's just say what people like to say about it

645
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:20,790
Why aren't they taught in these quote-unquote educational institutions to come up with devices that measure quality?

646
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,010
hmm

647
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:29,370
You see how important is that? How is how important is it to comprehend that just because it's 70 degrees flat

648
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,050
at sea level

649
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:34,830
Below sea level and at the top of a mountain you feel quite different

650
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,050
And it's noticeably felt

651
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:39,810
And there's no way to measure that quality

652
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,830
And how come there's no discussion about that?

653
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:49,110
It seems like quality has gone away. I want to lead into one other thought how many times have you heard

654
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:50,370
of

655
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:52,190
overpopulation

656
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:56,410
The earth is overpopulated man too many people

657
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:02,650
Oh, is that a quality issue or a quantity issue? It seems like oh, it's again. It's a quantity issue, isn't it?

658
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,370
So I throw out something here for folks

659
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:14,170
Do you know that a combustion engine your average size combustion engine you combusts more air in eight hours than an average person does in a year

660
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:19,390
So if you figure out the amount of combustion engines that are on the planet right now

661
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:22,770
Not only automobiles motorcycles, but generators and machines

662
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:27,330
And you did the long hand math on that and i've done this and I don't need to

663
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:30,470
Put this load on people's minds technically

664
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:34,950
If you did the math the amount of air that's being consumed by these motors

665
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:40,570
Or engines I should say is equivalent to a thousand billion people on the planet right now

666
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,110
So, where's the quantity problem?

667
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:47,090
But here's the thing i'll recommend and this is an opinion which I give very shortly

668
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:51,310
If the earth's population was reduced down to less than a hundred people

669
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:55,630
If you threw in one rabbi one priest one attorney and a scientist

670
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:59,390
In 40 years, you're going to be exactly where you are right now

671
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,150
Sorry

672
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,650
Not to offend anyone

673
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:09,510
And let's just take this around the block maybe and come back to where we started you ever hear people say that offends me

674
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,350
I have a thought for them

675
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,130
If you're if you're pursuing the truth, how can you be offended?

676
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:19,370
If someone if someone calls if you're pursuing the truth

677
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:20,830
and

678
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:22,830
Someone calls you an a-hole

679
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:24,390
well

680
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:30,350
Okay. Well, let's examine that we'll say well, uh, this person just called me that

681
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:31,750
uh

682
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,190
Is it true or not?

683
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:39,670
Well, if it's not true, it's not true. So it doesn't matter and if it is true, well, they just perceived the truth

684
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,570
So where's the offense?

685
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:46,210
Where's the offense truth is often dissonant. What if it really is?

686
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:53,150
What if the lie is resonant now again for the people cringing these guys are talking about ancient languages and ancient books?

687
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,270
I can't stand it

688
00:42:54,270 --> 00:43:01,090
Right. I can't I hate that stuff because i'm modern i've got an ipad and I declare i'm modern and I know

689
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,730
Yeah, I know

690
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:05,050
Uh-huh

691
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,510
Yeah, uh, so

692
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:11,450
Here's the interesting part about all this right? I don't want to go into a rant, but it's so easy

693
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:15,630
right, uh, because remember I think we prefaced earlier that

694
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:20,450
You know you try to tune into what's being said whether it's mainstream or alternative

695
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:24,310
If you find yourself yelling at the speakers or the device you're listening to

696
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:28,350
This is the show for you. That's all i've got to say but

697
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:30,510
What's interesting though?

698
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:35,130
Is oh is is it really a show but but here here's the point

699
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:37,310
um, the point is

700
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:42,250
When you listen to what people sing because you kind of like try to meditate which means to revisit

701
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:46,730
Maybe go over it again. Let's say in your mind. I'm trying to find where are they where are they getting this from?

702
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:49,790
It just sounds good. Well, it resonates with me

703
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:50,910
Wow

704
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:54,710
So what if the lie is resonant and the truth is dissonant?

705
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:57,210
What if people really hate the truth?

706
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:58,610
about any matter

707
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:01,730
Isn't that an interesting concept? It's kind of scary

708
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:05,010
And and if it if that seems to be the norm

709
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:10,530
You ain't gonna change it. So I guess your only option is to set yourself apart from it

710
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:16,010
What I mean by set yourself apart, let's say you had to work in the sewer because they paid really really well

711
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:19,530
Would you jump in naked skinny dip and drink the water?

712
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:24,290
Or would you put on full body hazmat suit with breathing tanks?

713
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:25,690
you see

714
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:29,470
And a lot of people want to change things that ain't gonna change

715
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:30,810
so

716
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,630
How about thinking about setting yourself apart?

717
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,190
You know, how about

718
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:39,510
People say oh the opposite of love is hate

719
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:42,610
I found out by observation

720
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:48,350
Takes sometimes a bit of passion to love and it's almost an equal amount of passion to hate

721
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:52,410
Could it be that the opposite of it of love might not be hate at all?

722
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:55,070
That it's possibly apathy

723
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,410
Or just leaving it alone

724
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:02,430
Yeah, it's interesting. I want to throw in something because this might be non-secular but

725
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:07,850
In the biblical text and I hate bringing that up because it's been hijacked by certain religions

726
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:11,090
It says if your brother sins against you forgive him, right?

727
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:16,870
You've heard that people say that and by the way, I haven't well we can get into a little bit of discussion of these things

728
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:19,890
But you know, the word forgiveness is not in the biblical text

729
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:22,150
What they're translating as forgive

730
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:26,430
Is the greek word a feces which means to get away from it or leave it alone

731
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:30,590
Anyway, you're not supposed to be a masochist or is it a sadist?

732
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:31,590
so

733
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:37,450
Setting oneself you're also not going to find the word holy in there. Sorry. That's the word set apart

734
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:39,930
or unearthly or unworldly

735
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,190
So anyway at one time

736
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,150
These words, you know

737
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:50,690
They're as I was speaking to the the etymology in the history of words spoken and recorded in in literature

738
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,730
And how they were first used

739
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:57,710
It's not that the word holy isn't in there. It's that the word holy has

740
00:45:58,450 --> 00:45:59,730
uh taken on

741
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:04,690
a a new a new thought pattern in in colloquial speech

742
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:10,110
When you say the word holy it doesn't simply mean something that is set apart. It means

743
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,290
uh, you know

744
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:13,690
Whatever those when you hear

745
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:19,250
someone speak the word holy not you greek, but

746
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:25,230
When you know when most people hear that word it's going to immediately bring to mind

747
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:27,530
a great many things

748
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,210
And that may not that may not just be coincidence. Yes, but

749
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:37,910
what the term actually means in specifically in you know, the

750
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:42,910
These these old texts is simply that it's it's something that's set apart

751
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:47,210
Right and like if you're something another term, uh

752
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:54,130
With uh in the same vein would be uh, you know unclean whereas that one actually is

753
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:55,110
uh

754
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:56,290
relatively

755
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:57,410
etymologically

756
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:01,350
Uh accurate even in even in modern english

757
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:04,630
Unclean, but that's simply what it

758
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:11,510
What it means, you know what it says it's it's unclean that that isn't clean. It should you know, so

759
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:12,510
But go ahead

760
00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:13,190
Hmm

761
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:19,130
No, it's interesting because there's an interesting concept of what resonates with people, you know, uh, you go to a courtroom

762
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:21,030
They tell you to put your hand on the bible and swear

763
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:25,490
How about you just say wait a second? I've got it here on a thumb drive or a dvd. Can I swear on that?

764
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:28,190
Oh, no. No, no, you can't it's it's not the same thing

765
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:33,030
Wasn't the biblical text a form of communication if you don't know what's trying to be communicated now?

766
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,070
It's just a rabbit's foot

767
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:42,330
Or a talisman or a good good luck charm or some form of iconography. Yeah, that's uh, that instance in particular

768
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:44,810
Is not something that i've ever actually

769
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:46,270
had to do

770
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:51,130
but um, I would I would find it difficult to not

771
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:55,590
Uh ask the administrator of whatever proceedings those were

772
00:47:56,190 --> 00:48:01,670
Uh, i'll say judge. I would not ask I I would find it difficult to not ask the judge

773
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:06,730
Just like this so what you're asking me to do

774
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:13,690
Is to place my hand on on this book that you have idolized that specifically says

775
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:17,170
To not make and to not swear

776
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:23,290
Exactly. It says to not swear first and foremost. It says to let your yes be yes and your no be no

777
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:25,930
um and to not

778
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:27,130
idolize

779
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:31,810
Uh physical objects, so you're asking me to place my hand

780
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:34,850
On this on this icon

781
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:41,890
And to swear on on this icon that if you look at the information that is actually preserved in this text

782
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:44,670
It specifically says to not do both of those things

783
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:48,310
Yeah, because it's it's basically you're you're

784
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:56,310
Have we ever discussed what justice is perhaps you're walking into a justice court? And yes, every nation every group of people

785
00:48:56,310 --> 00:49:00,130
Uh has a patron deity you've heard of patron saints

786
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:05,870
But no one's talking about and justice for all oh boy, no, thank you

787
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:10,930
Why because maybe we've done a little bit of homework on that by the way, the internet is very sparse

788
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:13,170
Maybe because it's subject to human input

789
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:18,830
But if anyone does have a chance to research the ancient goddess religions that are being revived

790
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,270
One of their high days is coming up

791
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:29,030
Yeah, one of their set apart dates. I should say are you saying this in jest as in the first day of what they call april?

792
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:30,630
um

793
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:38,370
No, actually, uh tomorrow I believe at least here in the states, uh is what they call easter

794
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:45,050
Oh the festival of ashtar. Yes, and you know, I read something interestingly enough. Uh,

795
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:48,190
Sorry to to digress but I think it's let's go

796
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,770
Go down that road

797
00:49:50,370 --> 00:49:50,870
um

798
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:57,910
That the name easter doesn't actually come from uh ishtar, but actually comes from

799
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:58,770
oyster

800
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,090
um, which is uh

801
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:07,290
proto english word actually but in the same text that was describing how

802
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:12,270
Easter does not actually come from ishtar and that rabbits and eggs weren't

803
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:15,570
associated with ishtar although she was

804
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:21,470
Babylonian goddess of fertility sex and uh, was it war?

805
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:24,210
and

806
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:31,190
But then later in this same article and it's not something that I I delved into greatly but it's a concept that i'm well

807
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:32,970
versed in I suppose

808
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:34,210
and

809
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:39,870
Uh later in the same thing that says that it doesn't actually come from uh, ishtar

810
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:47,790
Which was the this babylonian goddess that comes from oyster, which was uh, this like english or or druidic

811
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:54,870
Uh goddess of of fertility and things like that i'm going so you're totally missing missing the connection there right between the

812
00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:56,570
So we'll pick this up

813
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:00,470
We'll pick up the a little more on the ishtar oyster, uh

814
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:04,510
Easter mess when we come back. You're listening to american freedom radio

815
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:09,030
And welcome back to uncommon sense with the greek and seth michael

816
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:16,030
Seth we just uh had the break and we left off perhaps talking about the entire easter ashtar oyster mess

817
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:20,050
And uh, what's interesting is these things have become so arbitrary

818
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:24,150
That have you ever heard the expression? I don't know whether we should laugh or cry

819
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:28,770
Yes, I would suggest laughing. I would suggest laughing as well

820
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:35,370
there is not to say that I haven't done, you know, my own share of crying over various things, but uh the laughter

821
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:37,710
um at that point where you

822
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:42,030
It's like well, it's one or the other and i've had to explain to people when I was laughing

823
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:44,590
At an appropriate time is like well, I mean

824
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:50,730
It's either we have a breakdown or we just look at it for what it is and uh and laugh about it

825
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:55,150
So and from and it's got to be from the quality of it because from a quantity

826
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:59,090
Point of view all the other boys and girls are doing it. What's wrong with you?

827
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:05,610
If you look at the quality of what's being done, though, you've got to say like little boys and girls do it sucks

828
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:11,710
Now, why does it suck? Let's just preface. I got to say this and I can't say it enough times. Listen folks

829
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:18,590
Whenever you hear someone come up whether it's on radio whether it's on print or in your university halls

830
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:24,210
And they start discussing anything biblical if the first thing that doesn't come out of their mouth

831
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:25,170
is

832
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:33,350
The biblical text has yet to be translated. Well what it was based on which is preserved in ancient greek and ancient hebrew

833
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:36,170
Has not been translated to this date

834
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:42,850
Well, wait a minute greek that's a pretty harsh statement because I got something that says the king james version

835
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:45,170
It's one of the best-selling books in the world

836
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:52,470
Yeah, and i've got the new new international version. I even got one of these blah blah blah blah the other bibles

837
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,590
But they're all versions

838
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,350
What are you talking about

839
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:02,890
And what's interesting is you've got people coming out and being interviewed and I get lots of youtube hits by the way

840
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,110
They're real must be really good

841
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:11,590
Oh that never existed and the interviewer is saying oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No one's ever saying well, wait a second

842
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:17,550
It's never been translated. How would you know? Did you do any research on the languages of preservation?

843
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,630
I mean you hear all kinds of stories

844
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:22,950
ranging from reincarnation

845
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:25,670
To none of these characters ever existed

846
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:28,830
or the son of god is the sun in the sky

847
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:29,910
or

848
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:33,430
It's really about chicken semen dripping out of your nostril

849
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:34,390
or

850
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:39,230
whatever, whatever whatever and you just got to do the double-faced palm and say

851
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:45,430
I can't believe i'm hearing this and the major and this resonates with the public. Why?

852
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:53,210
Because when you bring up any ancient writ of any culture, it has literally been hijacked by its corresponding religion

853
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:54,290
because

854
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:55,690
Guess what?

855
00:53:56,030 --> 00:54:01,210
There's not a religion on the planet bar none that does anything that's in the text that they allegedly subscribe to

856
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:05,370
Yeah, yeah, it's it's tradition I would almost

857
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:09,410
because of my fondness of of words

858
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:15,670
I'm hesitant to use the word religion when someone asks me a question about things

859
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:16,990
of

860
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:18,510
you know

861
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:20,830
having to do with ancient texts

862
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:21,830
or

863
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:24,790
what is commonly referred to as

864
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:28,510
spirituality and the varying religions

865
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,850
Like, you know what what religion

866
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:36,310
Etc. I'm like, well, I'm I you know, I I wash my hair

867
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:40,970
Every day, I brush my teeth every day. Those are you know things that I do

868
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:44,270
With a lot of regularity those could be considered a religion

869
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:47,530
but what is often referred to or

870
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:49,750
What is always referred to?

871
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:51,930
statistically

872
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:53,430
is

873
00:54:54,130 --> 00:55:01,610
In religion is simply the traditions that are commonly followed by a group of people generally relatively large groups

874
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:03,550
But that's not necessarily the case

875
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:11,130
On a regular basis something you do regular basis. I go to church on sunday. I go to temple on saturday all in the pope's work schedule

876
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:14,410
and uh, yeah, yeah real interesting, uh

877
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:18,270
You know, you know, here's the you know, the spirituality I think we've defined

878
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:21,710
Many times and we might actually want to do an entire hour on this

879
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:25,290
Is what the spirit and the soul is and let's just say it real fast

880
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:26,890
The soul is your breath

881
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:31,950
And if you're breathing whether you're a dog a cat an insect a bird or a man

882
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:33,650
That is the soul

883
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:44,330
Yeah, let me let me address that very thing for for just a moment and because that is a subject of

884
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:50,330
Uh of interest to me certainly and again it comes back to the the studying of the the old writings and where

885
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:54,490
We get these terms because the language that we used to discuss a lot of those things

886
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:57,690
Are very is is very arbitrary

887
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:04,730
And again when I say arbitrary, I mean basically someone is saying that this is the way that it is that's arbitrary

888
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:07,010
if someone says okay today

889
00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:08,010
is

890
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:10,610
friday or today is

891
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:16,670
Yeah, and pick a day today is cow day, okay, that's arbitrary that's our blue day

892
00:56:16,670 --> 00:56:23,450
Yeah, or blue day or red day. I would I would be fond of that. I like the color red. Um,

893
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:30,630
but before I digress and they're able to inflict that on the rest of the civilization and they agree to it now, it's

894
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:35,030
Still are through authority be that authority. Uh

895
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:40,490
Traditional or or religious or governmental and honestly, uh religious

896
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:44,050
Hierarchy is simply a government and so if you can look at history

897
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:51,510
That way and realize that these religious organizations are just simply another form of government using a different dialogue different jargon

898
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:52,490
You'll have

899
00:56:52,490 --> 00:56:54,990
a more accurate way of things

900
00:56:55,670 --> 00:57:03,130
Way of perceiving it and I suppose that's an opinion but before I go too far off off it and soul

901
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:11,170
Um when we say that soul when the specifically the greek, um says that soul is is breath and air

902
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:13,630
and spirit is

903
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:19,390
Is basic is you basically not the carnal you not not your hands not your feet

904
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:21,390
but that force that

905
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,270
what what

906
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:26,110
Brings in and lets go of thoughts

907
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:30,230
The the self the site and it's intangible where the soul

908
00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:36,310
Yeah is that's that's spirit and

909
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:39,410
Now it's it's confusing

910
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:46,690
Because when you go into the etymology of soul and spirit both of those words are going to take you back

911
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:47,630
to

912
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:48,910
wind

913
00:57:49,710 --> 00:57:55,050
Essentially, um, and i'm i'm paraphrasing it here for this. I have a feeling just interrupt for a moment seth

914
00:57:55,050 --> 00:58:00,170
I just interrupt just to step on you just for a second because I think it's important. I'm not a conspiracy theorist

915
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:03,410
But if you really want to look for a conspiracy, this is it folks

916
00:58:03,890 --> 00:58:07,290
You have the you have the definition

917
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:16,260
So obfuscated and obscured that there's something important about being able to discern that because

918
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:24,480
The soul is what the spirit is. You've pretty much got the three components of headquarters, which is you

919
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:29,980
Now, let me just put it this way if you're deceived about headquarters. Is it possible that you're going to be?

920
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:37,220
Emanating that deception and everything you do. But anyway, seth, please continue a lot of the deception that takes place

921
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,140
uh is not

922
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:42,280
Intended as deception. It's bad information

923
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:43,920
that has been

924
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:49,400
Traditionalized that has been repeated but on specifically spirit and soul

925
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:54,880
Um etymologically you're going to run into uh some speed bumps to use a metaphor

926
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:59,480
that both of those words when traced etymologically

927
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,180
Speak to wind air

928
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:05,540
um breath essentially

929
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:10,380
um esprit is you know french which comes from

930
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:15,340
Uh, the latin spire, you know, which is to is wind breath

931
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:16,760
but in

932
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:24,300
Just for the sake of our western listeners and I don't mean, you know, like the old west. I mean those who are you know

933
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,220
have grown

934
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:28,780
Uh and and learned in in the western

935
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:30,820
Perspective of things

936
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:35,140
What that is based upon is their use

937
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:41,960
in in the oldest text that we have available to us that use those terms where we have a version that has

938
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:44,200
We have a version. We don't have a translation

939
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:50,180
But in in the version that we have where the word soul is used and the word spirit

940
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:53,620
Those are two completely separate words

941
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,360
Um, and we've

942
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,180
Remember to go into them real quick

943
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:03,140
Yes, okay. Uh, the english speakers typically are based on the greek and this is an interesting prep

944
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,520
Would call it prefix before a word versus a suffix. Yeah

945
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,840
Um, if you look at the any ancient text and this goes across hebrew and arabic as well

946
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:16,420
But we'll just use the greek as a metaphor and as an example more than a metaphor. It's a direct example

947
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:21,520
When you see the word pneuma or whenever you see the p n e a u prefix

948
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:28,120
Um, that means soul that means your breath that's where in english words we get the prefix for pneumatic or pneumonia

949
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:32,080
It's very much has to do with the movement of air

950
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:38,720
for example, one of the first things that you look for when uh, someone is presumed dead or dying or

951
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,840
Mortally wounded is you look to see if they're breathing and then they look for a pulse

952
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:47,420
So when someone is not breathing, they don't have a soul. It's very simple folks

953
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,660
Now, let's just leave that alone for a moment and go to spirit

954
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:59,580
Now if you look at any of the greek texts the word prefix psy or psyche or psyche means spirit, which means mind

955
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:03,840
That's why when you hear the psy prefix for psychic psychotic

956
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:05,120
psychiatrist

957
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,160
Or psychopath or whatever it has to do with the mind

958
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:17,000
Yes, and it's intangible. Yeah. Now what's interesting about that is yeah

959
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:23,240
They could put in cephalograms or whatever fancy technological devices and see pulses on the organ known as the brain

960
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:28,580
But very few people recognize this is a medical fact there are brain cells in the heart as well

961
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:32,360
So it's beyond the brain one example to explain

962
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:36,280
The psyche would be let's say you have

963
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,720
a hundred

964
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:42,260
A given number of dvds that are unlabeled, but they're all recorded on

965
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:48,100
And you dump them in the middle of the floor. They all look like shiny metallic plastic discs

966
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:53,560
But not until you put them in a computer or dvd player to start playing it

967
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:58,560
Do you see what is actually recorded on it? Now if you send that dvd to a material scientist

968
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:02,520
He'll give you a long report on how it's made of this. It looks like that

969
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,600
But he won't be able to see what's recorded on it

970
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,660
You need a specific player. So the spirit

971
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:12,160
The mind is played or animated through the carne the body

972
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:17,580
The corpus and the soul and the soul is part of the body

973
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:22,500
So, you know, what's the funniest thing to say? Well, they don't have a soul

974
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:26,800
You know, how many times have you heard that as a criticism about someone like are they dead cpr?

975
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,220
Yeah, if they're not dead, of course, they have a soul. What are you talking about?

976
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:32,200
now this is the part where

977
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:35,240
When you hear such ignorance and stupidity

978
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:39,700
It kind of puts like a tightness in the solar plexus region of the body, right?

979
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,180
And that's where I suggest

980
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:47,900
You either laugh or cry about it because people ain't going to change when i'm using that term loosely, you know

981
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:49,280
Like they ain't going to change, you know

982
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:54,020
I mean like let's not be too serious even about the language here because they don't want to look at anything now

983
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:59,320
Who's they? Well, whoever's listening is going to have to decide who they is whether it's them or the people around them

984
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,240
and

985
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,600
This is so simple and let's just say this

986
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,840
What do you think the chances are?

987
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:11,960
As you go higher to the entitled classes the quote-unquote super educated academics and university

988
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:16,620
What are the chances of them even being able to discern these two definitions?

989
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,820
Would you say like one out of a million?

990
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,600
one out of a thousand

991
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,980
I have i've not found

992
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,880
any yeah, yeah, i've not found any and

993
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:30,940
Um, that's not for not looking. Um, I don't go to campuses and things like that

994
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,520
I have kind of actually sort of an avarice to

995
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:35,480
Most temples actually

996
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:36,580
but

997
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:38,220
um, I do

998
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:41,440
I have but I have sought them out. Yeah

999
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:42,600
have

1000
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:45,940
and I tend to uh frequent establishments where

1001
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:47,860
uh people who

1002
01:03:48,550 --> 01:03:49,980
are super educated

1003
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:57,400
Congregants and hangouts and i've gotten into a number of conversations on on specifically spirit and soul

1004
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,420
And it's very difficult because

1005
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:04,760
As I said, even etymologically in english, it's difficult. You have to take it back and go. Okay, we're using

1006
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,080
the text that

1007
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,040
These concepts are based upon

1008
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:15,320
Uh as as spoken where they were first arbitrated. Let's say

1009
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:22,540
Because that's what etymology is a word was first spoken and recorded and how it was used its meaning then that's why i'm so interested

1010
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:28,720
Yeah and decided as to be used as a reference like a tape measure or a scale of weights or something correct

1011
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:35,960
And I you know, this is a time where uh, the comprehension of sound and what we refer to as syllables

1012
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:37,720
um was

1013
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:41,940
Okay, we're back. I think let's see if we get seth back in again

1014
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:48,100
Okay, uh, and we're we're on again and we're going to have seth join us in a moment

1015
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:54,580
And as we were saying before the spirit and the soul are just two interesting concepts are very little simple words that

1016
01:04:54,580 --> 01:05:00,440
Can allow one to really see what's going on around them when regarding these spiritual matters

1017
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,720
Let's say and if one could even call them that anymore

1018
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,320
And uh, seth, are you with us?

1019
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:07,320
I am

1020
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:13,420
Okay, so so let's uh, yeah, we're back as we were saying the soul and the spirit

1021
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:18,740
Uh, these are two very simple things that have yet not been overcome by in definition

1022
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:20,920
and um

1023
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:27,060
by the way, we didn't throw in the uh for the quote-unquote arabic and hebrew audience that would be

1024
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:29,960
the terms, uh, uh nefesh and rook

1025
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:35,560
Uh, yes. Yeah ruach or rook. Uh ruach in hebrew rook in arabic

1026
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:40,660
Uh meaning the spirit and the nefesh or the nef being the soul

1027
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,920
Uh, which you might see in some versions and they were living beings or living souls

1028
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:50,280
So if this is really really simple, you know, the funniest thing i've noticed seth

1029
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:56,080
How many times have you heard someone proclaim? I'm a very spiritual person. I'm very much into spirituality

1030
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:57,400
You heard that before?

1031
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:58,540
Yeah

1032
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:07,320
I've heard that a few times. Yes. Yes. Yes, and who hasn't go ahead and ask some of these folks and let's be polite here

1033
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:08,260
uh

1034
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,200
Can you define soul and spirit?

1035
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:16,660
And you will hear a million reasons why it's not what you're explaining even though they could go look it up for themselves

1036
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:18,960
I've i've heard generally

1037
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:22,700
What I hear when I ask that question

1038
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,920
Immediately what follows is well to me

1039
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,180
It means

1040
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:33,260
This i'm going. Okay. All right. So if we just get a pick what things mean

1041
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:41,560
Then us talking there is absolutely no purpose to because nothing can come of it because I can say I like the color red

1042
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:43,100
And you can say

1043
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,640
Well, I talked to this guy named seth

1044
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:47,920
He

1045
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:54,240
He to me he really really likes colors

1046
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:58,280
he likes colors this guy really likes colors whereas

1047
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:00,200
that's

1048
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,100
kind of similar

1049
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:08,540
To what I said, right, but I like the color red and there's there are reasons behind that it's not just the aesthetic

1050
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:10,800
Although that is part of it. What about

1051
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,460
Yeah, just as an example. What about from a constructive point of view? Isn't it interesting?

1052
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:19,980
That people go and buy shoes and they you know, let's say, you know, take a size nine

1053
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:25,920
Well, what just you know, just try a size 11 or try six for now, you know, it doesn't really matter

1054
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,120
That's what I think you should have. No, no, no, you know, but he

1055
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:33,040
It's got to be a size nine or you know, I have a 34 waist, you know

1056
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:37,980
Why not just throw on a pair of 36s or 28s, you know, what's you know, isn't it?

1057
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:40,120
I find the hypocrisy to be interesting

1058
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:45,260
A lot of these people that don't want to look at what these things mean or mean what they say or say what they mean

1059
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:51,320
They do like doors that close don't they they do like windows that close and they do like when they go to buy

1060
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:57,840
Let's say tires for their bicycle or car that it makes sure that it's the right size for their shoe or shirt

1061
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:02,260
But when it comes to things like discussing what the soul and the spirit is

1062
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,540
It all goes out the window

1063
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:05,700
figuratively

1064
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:07,620
Isn't that phenomenal?

1065
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:09,580
But they love

1066
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:11,000
accuracy and precision

1067
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:13,880
When it comes to shoe size waist size

1068
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,500
car tire size bike tire size or windows and doors working

1069
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:19,220
interesting

1070
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:23,479
What's going on, man? You know here this is

1071
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,380
Yeah, and if you find what we're saying uncommon

1072
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:27,880
Thank you

1073
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,920
Yeah, that's why that's

1074
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:37,680
If there is a reason that's that's why we're here doing this right now. Well, let us proceed on this because

1075
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,560
Um the concept I think we brought up in time

1076
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:41,899
uh

1077
01:08:41,899 --> 01:08:43,600
You know, what's interesting though

1078
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:45,939
Uh in time here

1079
01:08:45,939 --> 01:08:50,680
This is a what they call a date of observance for them on the pope's work schedule because if you look at the date

1080
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:54,660
Today it's a different day than last year that they're calling that date

1081
01:08:54,660 --> 01:08:57,420
And if that sounded confusing good, that means you're common and normal

1082
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,680
But but here's the point

1083
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:06,020
The point is where are they getting this from now? It's interesting. I've gotten several emails from certain marketing companies

1084
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:07,660
and they're saying

1085
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:12,640
They're giving me the history of what they call easter and they're very careful

1086
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:19,020
legalistically to start out that easter is a church or christian church tradition

1087
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:26,520
And they go on for paragraphs explaining what it is resurrections and crucifixions and all this stuff

1088
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:30,779
But you know never once do they mention any historical or biblical reference

1089
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:34,660
Very carefully. They don't they're quite accurate to do so

1090
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:40,359
Is that interesting but most people presume that it is biblical and historical

1091
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,040
right

1092
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:48,060
What's interesting is should we get into what is in the actual biblical record that anyone could look at if they so dare?

1093
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:52,580
Yeah, I don't are there any uh what they call

1094
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:54,140
um

1095
01:09:55,550 --> 01:10:02,820
For just just for the sake of this question, uh, regardless of the you know, the the papal calendar

1096
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:04,560
Are there any?

1097
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:05,760
holidays

1098
01:10:06,430 --> 01:10:07,960
that uh

1099
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:10,740
specifically um

1100
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:16,000
Those that call themselves christians, uh recognize that are

1101
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:21,660
Actually based upon scripture none and what's interesting

1102
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:27,480
If you go into divinity schools and all that you just laugh. Um

1103
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:33,400
They do tell you that most of the curriculum is based upon the teachings of the apostle paul

1104
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:38,020
And what's interesting if you read any of his writings, he says you must do the week of unleavened bread

1105
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:42,480
How are you going to do that on the pope's calendar? Most christians don't even know what that means

1106
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:46,920
So the hypocrisy is just amazing but what's interesting seth

1107
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:51,620
This goes in against what people hear even on the alternative media

1108
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:55,760
There are quite a few characters for a long time that are trying to discuss biblical matters and I assure you

1109
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:01,060
It's all false. Sorry, and i'm not looking for a challenge or debate because it would be

1110
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:02,220
really sad

1111
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,320
but here's the point

1112
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,040
the point is

1113
01:11:06,700 --> 01:11:11,540
That if one looks at the biblical text even in the version and just watches the movie

1114
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,460
about anything

1115
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:20,740
You will see the anomalies that could be easily sorted out with basic logic and rationale what's going on

1116
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:22,440
you know, um

1117
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:30,320
What's interesting here? I keep saying that the biblical record matches precisely with the historical record, but it doesn't match any religious tradition

1118
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,480
You know, should we go down that road for a moment?

1119
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:36,060
certainly

1120
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:42,020
If you look in the biblical record, let's be cursory because you know, this is a this is a very wide subject

1121
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:45,800
There's a figure called the christ and even if you've never read it and watched the movie

1122
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:53,140
There's a character called pontius pilate that he's finally brought to based on the roman occupation superseding the judean authority

1123
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:57,480
He washes his hands of the matter and says I see no guilt in this man

1124
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:02,900
And then they continue with the whole story just falls apart after that becomes fiction

1125
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:09,360
In other words, there's no historical or biblical record of the rest of the movie. But if you go to the biblical text

1126
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:16,500
And find where pontius pilate actually does the hand washing scene and continue to read even in the poor versions

1127
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:23,380
Pontius pilate proceeds to say I find no guilt in this man and I am returning him back to you meaning the judean authorities

1128
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:25,520
to use your law

1129
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:27,560
in another book it says

1130
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:33,200
Of the same what they call the new testament. I am returning him back to you have a law

1131
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,560
I know you have a law use your law. I am making this exception

1132
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,040
Now, wait a second

1133
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,900
The judeans didn't use roman law

1134
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:45,100
The judeans used mosaic law

1135
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,240
So at the time they were subject to roman rule

1136
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:49,060
That's right

1137
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:51,460
Which is why they brought him to pilot in the first place

1138
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:56,780
Exactly, it would be no different than if the chinese took over the united states and did things their way

1139
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:59,160
But the americans wanted to do their fourth of july. They

1140
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:04,260
They have to let the chinese authorities give them permission to do the fourth of july

1141
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:11,840
So what you would see is the chinese military lining the streets and you'd see a parade of americans blowing off their fireworks

1142
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:14,900
Right very simple

1143
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:16,380
But what's interesting?

1144
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,580
Is this exception was made?

1145
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:22,840
So but if you look at the mosaic law if you're accused of a high crime

1146
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:27,680
You're to be nailed to a tree and stoned and I just gave off the whole thing. I didn't want to there's a stoning involved

1147
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:33,220
So so I don't know where this crucifixion stuff came about and I don't know

1148
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:38,680
And now wait a second you could say well the word crucifix is there if anyone wants to look up the term crucifix

1149
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,020
It's a botanical term

1150
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:41,980
It has to do with botany

1151
01:13:42,980 --> 01:13:43,860
but nonetheless

1152
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:49,920
It's just not good because people are so disgusted about what religions are doing that you can't bring up what they're based on because it

1153
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:52,400
Sounds like a disgusting subject and I don't blame them

1154
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:56,100
But let's just jump away from the biblical text for a moment

1155
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:00,800
Let's go to the historical secular records poncho's pilot did exist

1156
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:04,040
There are records of his writings and what's interesting

1157
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:10,360
Is what you will find mostly of poncho's pilot's writings is when he became the prefect governor of judea

1158
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:13,540
He was writing to claudius tiberius caesar

1159
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:14,620
profusely

1160
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:20,220
Why because he was severely understaffed and undermanned being an occupying force

1161
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,880
At one point he suggested that his men go out in disguise

1162
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:28,480
Looking like the rest of the judaeans so the people don't figure out they're so small in number

1163
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:33,300
And he was constantly pleading with claudius tiberius caesar for backups

1164
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:39,520
And in those writings he mentioned he heard about about about a one man named yasha who spoke against authority

1165
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:46,680
And he personally checked it out and said he this man didn't speak against the romans. He spoke against the judaean religious authorities

1166
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,240
and one day

1167
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:51,440
He was brought to to them under arrest

1168
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:56,140
But he couldn't do anything about it because the mob took him away to be

1169
01:14:56,940 --> 01:14:57,400
stoned

1170
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:01,480
This is in the secular record which is in 100

1171
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:08,580
Agreement with the biblical text because if you get down to the new that's why the quote-unquote authorities tell you

1172
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:14,200
Don't look at the old testament. No. No, no, don't look at that. No. No, it's got no, just look at the new testament

1173
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:15,740
well

1174
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:19,780
It's one huge cohesive document and sorry folks

1175
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:21,720
That the historical record

1176
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:27,820
Is in 100 agreement with the biblical record or any ancient text what you've been told about it

1177
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:30,460
Is not in agreement with anything

1178
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:33,160
Whether secular or non-secular

1179
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:39,180
So folks, you're gonna have to do a little bit of homework and if this sounds uncommon, we're doing our job

1180
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:44,940
But you know, I didn't want to get too much into the detail and if there's anybody in chat that wants to put in

1181
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,480
a question regarding that or anywhere else

1182
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:51,080
Uh, we could expand on this further

1183
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:52,080
but

1184
01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:59,680
This this is not only for the biblical or christian tradition or the jewish tradition, which is also allegedly biblical

1185
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,560
But this goes for the hindu the buddhist

1186
01:16:03,110 --> 01:16:04,760
And everything across the board

1187
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:09,720
No, no one is understanding or even looking even lifting a finger now

1188
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:14,500
What's interesting is they can say they are but when you look at what they're doing

1189
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:17,020
They take it completely out of context

1190
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:22,460
Which can be done any and if you if you're fixing on reading into what it says

1191
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:23,820
well

1192
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:25,880
You've got a problem there also

1193
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,880
So, you know and this goes across the board now

1194
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:34,160
This goes also with your sciences with your medical field and your legal societies with your academics

1195
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:41,340
You know, so we didn't really quite get too deep seth and I don't think we really need to but we could in the future

1196
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:42,480
by request I believe

1197
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:43,660
and

1198
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:48,760
Let's not be arrogant, but let's just say it this way a lot of the things that we're going to start saying

1199
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:51,020
at the uncommon sense place here

1200
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:54,160
Haven't been said in a very very long time

1201
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:56,180
maybe millennia

1202
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:03,140
And a lot of people are going to hear it and get very upset because it makes them unnerving. There's a man named william reich

1203
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:04,620
Look him up

1204
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,420
And he talked about something called emotional armoring

1205
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:12,460
When people hear certain things that make them uncomfortable

1206
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:16,720
They don't like it for it to get under that armor that they put up

1207
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,000
and

1208
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:24,140
This is not a place and this is not going to be the place for that kind of reaction

1209
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:28,060
In other words, if you feel like we're getting under your skin and making you uncomfortable

1210
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:33,380
that is not necessarily the intent the intent is to be uncommon because

1211
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:37,180
What I see as being common hasn't done

1212
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:39,420
anyone questioning

1213
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:44,640
I think knowledge itself is is uncommon. Um

1214
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:48,000
I hear a lot of well, I know that

1215
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:49,640
It's not anything

1216
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:51,440
I know that

1217
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:56,500
And a lot of the knowledge that we claim for ourselves

1218
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:01,900
Is just something that has been told to us

1219
01:18:03,260 --> 01:18:04,220
Through tradition

1220
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:05,560
through

1221
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:10,900
Books things like that. Well, I read in this book that and it says this and this and this

1222
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:16,800
You can find observations on the world around us and on writings anywhere

1223
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:22,900
But it takes it takes some discern some some discern some discernment

1224
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:25,260
to identify

1225
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:33,540
Observation from conjecture observation from opinion observation from theory

1226
01:18:34,300 --> 01:18:36,080
observation from supposition

1227
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,480
you can take

1228
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,300
uh

1229
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:42,700
Recently, I read through a book called the golden bow by uh, frazier

1230
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:47,220
I can never remember his first name, but his last name is frazier and it's actually been

1231
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:55,840
Popularly, uh debunked on on many levels, but what has been debunked is not the the author's

1232
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,700
observations

1233
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:59,200
But his supposition and conjecture

1234
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:03,240
On to what his observations mean and and the observations

1235
01:19:03,970 --> 01:19:06,760
that are presented in that book are a

1236
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:10,400
very interesting to anyone who is interested in

1237
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:14,620
Uh, the religions or spiritual practices of the world

1238
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:16,840
um as observed by

1239
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:21,140
A guy who lived I believe the book was published in the late 1800s

1240
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,020
Um

1241
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:27,180
I don't know all that much about the author but as I said, I read the book

1242
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:29,380
I I think I read through it twice

1243
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:35,960
So would you say there was an ad hominem critique versus addressing what was being said? It was how it was said perhaps

1244
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:37,640
I haven't

1245
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:43,820
read into a lot in depth into a lot of the critiques just the cursory glance at what I said, um, or

1246
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:44,980
what was

1247
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:51,620
Said of the critiques is that the book is referred to in a few places is something that has been widely debunked

1248
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:58,260
But as I said, it's not the observations that are being debunked but the conclusions that this gentleman comes to

1249
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:00,640
And there are some inaccuracies

1250
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:02,140
even in

1251
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:04,940
the information presented but the

1252
01:20:05,930 --> 01:20:07,500
There is so much there

1253
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:09,060
that

1254
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:17,200
Would suggest that a lot of the traditions and rituals specifically

1255
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,700
Of varying groups that could be referred to

1256
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:25,600
As pagan if you have a comprehension of the word that is something other than

1257
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,440
What is colloquial?

1258
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:28,880
Pagan is just

1259
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,900
uneducated essentially

1260
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:38,880
um, you know the tribes around the world and the similarities in in ritual and

1261
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:42,180
The ideas and thoughts expressed through their ritual

1262
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:43,900
is very

1263
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:45,400
interesting

1264
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:51,140
Dealing with the fact that you know, uh modern academic history

1265
01:20:51,490 --> 01:20:52,500
does not

1266
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:54,680
allow for the

1267
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:56,580
communication between

1268
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:57,720
these

1269
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:02,880
uh, these tribes these peoples these societies all over the globe

1270
01:21:03,710 --> 01:21:04,260
and

1271
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:05,600
there is

1272
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:08,300
Undeniably

1273
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:16,340
Similarities there are undeniable similarities between a lot of a lot of these practices and they go back to a time that

1274
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:18,100
uh seems to be

1275
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:22,680
Before we had a lot of accurate records being made

1276
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:27,540
Yeah, but the thing is I believe that the concept of accuracy

1277
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:31,540
Is typically found in things that are memorialized

1278
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:34,860
Uh, and when they're not accurate they almost

1279
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:36,320
Eek it out

1280
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:40,780
You know, they almost like if you read let's say a court case it's all presumptive

1281
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:43,220
There's nothing being stated

1282
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:46,220
But people read it as if it's being stated

1283
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:47,760
as such

1284
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,540
Right, uh, there are many ways to really discern a communication

1285
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:53,440
right

1286
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:58,640
Uh, and perhaps in the future we'll get into that for for certain individuals

1287
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:03,060
But you know seth one thing I wanted to mention like you mentioned the pagan tribes and such and there's maybe more

1288
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:07,260
Definition that be be given to what's behind those traditions

1289
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:13,520
in the form of what was really going on in terms they're based on something real and maybe have become debased but

1290
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,780
I brought up the concept that

1291
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:18,000
Mankind is not an animal

1292
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:20,260
from the social sense

1293
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:24,980
That we're the only creatures that are susceptible to external input

1294
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,780
You know and the example would be if you had a six-week puppy dog

1295
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:36,480
Let's say raised by a family of gorillas to adulthood and you adopted that dog as an adult

1296
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:41,340
You really couldn't tell that it was raised by a family of gorillas. It would pretty much act

1297
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:43,840
It's not going to act like gorillas, right?

1298
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:48,800
It's going to act like a dog and you didn't know but if you had a six-week-old baby raised by gorillas

1299
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:54,000
And adopted this individual as an adult guess what they're going to act like almost identical

1300
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:56,660
To a gorilla

1301
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:00,000
So this is why you'll find

1302
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:03,800
The passing down of information the

1303
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:10,420
The almost the necessity of what's called schooling and training for humans where you do find some of that in the animal kingdom

1304
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:14,520
But you never see schools other than a school of fish

1305
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:17,760
Okay, you know, but you're not going to find

1306
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:24,860
You know, in other words the animals sort of they come pre-downloaded with an operating system

1307
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:27,180
You know, it's already pre-loaded

1308
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:29,380
In their

1309
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:31,880
Body, let's say within their spirit

1310
01:23:32,420 --> 01:23:33,480
but with mankind

1311
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:38,580
It's the operating system has to be garnered as the individual develops

1312
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:44,160
and it's really unique and that's why I have an aversion to when people make comparisons to

1313
01:23:44,620 --> 01:23:46,640
the man or woman or humankind

1314
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:52,380
Being an animal form we share similar organs and similar features skin

1315
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:57,800
Hair some people might have fur but you know the organs and things like that

1316
01:23:57,800 --> 01:24:02,020
But we're not animals in the least when it comes to the spirit aspect or the mind

1317
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:06,480
And I think this is one of the important things that discerns

1318
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:12,720
Why we search for information why we search for reasons to do things and then all of a sudden it seems like when you look

1319
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:14,280
Around us everyone's given up

1320
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:20,160
On inquiring on anything anymore and they just go along to get along which by default. I want to go back to

1321
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:26,280
Gustav leban about something he wrote called the crowd and the crowd mentality and

1322
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:32,140
The purpose of talking about uncommon sense is perhaps bringing up some of these concepts

1323
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:38,300
Along the lines of what why how these groups are formed and how when these groups are formed

1324
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:42,020
they lose the basis of the concept

1325
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:46,240
Of whatever was the original purpose of the group being formed on

1326
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:52,440
And you know sometimes I tell people if you want to destroy a good idea form an organization around it

1327
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:54,960
and it seems to be the

1328
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,300
The norm, let's say well what's common?

1329
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:00,180
and perhaps

1330
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,940
If there is a big pile of bulldung

1331
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:08,460
It only takes a little shovel to move it aside for a moment. At least we can do it two hours a week

1332
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:10,700
And perhaps get into it

1333
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:12,940
I'm perhaps various subjects

1334
01:25:13,420 --> 01:25:19,140
Uh, and it also depends on what feedback we get if there's anything that wants to be that anyone would like to hear discussed

1335
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:24,580
But essentially there's a very long list of things pick anything any topic any subject

1336
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:26,940
It's really simple to see what it's based on

1337
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:34,640
And and what it's being promoted as and if you look at what any subject that man gets involved in

1338
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:38,860
Is supposed to be based on you'll find that it's pretty much debased

1339
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:40,380
I mean

1340
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:42,180
Going back to the example

1341
01:25:42,660 --> 01:25:47,700
They produce a new model car every year. I guess they haven't figured out how to build it right yet

1342
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:49,460
So

1343
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:52,540
What's going on and

1344
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:54,560
What's going on is basically?

1345
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:58,040
It's what people want to go on, you know, I want to

1346
01:25:58,520 --> 01:25:59,640
be apologetic

1347
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:05,120
Or not necessarily be apologetic for a lot of the things you hear from the conspiratorial

1348
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,160
quote-unquote activism

1349
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:11,140
In alternative media about there is a global elite

1350
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:15,080
That is bringing demise and doom on mankind

1351
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:16,640
now

1352
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,840
Uh, I just want to say one thing

1353
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:26,500
Could it be that this global elite if there is such a thing are simply capitalizing on the greed and gluttony

1354
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:29,940
And stubbornness and rebelliousness of the average

1355
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:31,760
person on this planet

1356
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:36,320
If you actually pull back far enough, you might see that's what they're doing

1357
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,060
They're just capitalizing

1358
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:40,720
It's the average

1359
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:42,280
common

1360
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:44,800
human acceptance

1361
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:48,680
Of what they find they want to accept as being common

1362
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:51,220
That is the source of the problem

1363
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:53,060
If there is a problem

1364
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:57,400
Because if you decide to set yourself apart from it, there's no problem

1365
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:00,340
So the interesting thing here

1366
01:27:01,060 --> 01:27:01,700
is

1367
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:05,800
How does one put into words what is really going on?

1368
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:07,820
And who is to listen?

1369
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:11,520
You know and it's not a philosophical question

1370
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:18,380
Because there really is just a sequence of events and then this thing called hysteresis kicks in which is basically a fancy

1371
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:23,000
Term of a dog chasing its tail and I think that's where humanity is right now

1372
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:29,180
And we can expand on that with greater accuracy like maybe the concept of we're in the credits part of the movie

1373
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,780
And things like that, you know

1374
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:32,680
So

1375
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:39,500
I think it can get really interesting here and as we proceed with further episodes, it's called them episodic in a sense

1376
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:40,780
but

1377
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:42,660
It's very rational

1378
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:49,020
And in essence not to go back to be apologetic for the global elite

1379
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:51,980
But could it be that they're simply accommodating the masses?

1380
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:55,880
You know when you see a travel on a barren highway

1381
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:59,840
The middle of a desert one of these big interstates and you see this big

1382
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,320
Service station in the middle of the desert

1383
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:08,860
Do you think those people are like really bad at business to open this big huge truck stop in the middle of the desert?

1384
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:12,080
That's a real terrible business decision. Hey, man

1385
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:16,460
I need like 10 million to open this truck stop in the middle of the desert. Are you crazy?

1386
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,120
That's a terrible business decision

1387
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:24,680
Oh, but you see there's this four-lane highway with a half a million cars that drive by every day and trucks and things

1388
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:26,540
Oh, that's a great business decision

1389
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:32,400
So the reason you open this establishment in the middle of nowhere is to accommodate the passersby aren't you

1390
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,840
What happens if that highway closes?

1391
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:38,440
That business goes away doesn't it

1392
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:39,960
That it does

1393
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:42,720
So maybe these global elite are opening

1394
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:44,680
are investing

1395
01:28:45,620 --> 01:28:46,820
into accommodating

1396
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:49,380
the passersby in this big desert

1397
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:52,380
maybe a desert of knowledge or a desert of

1398
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:54,660
concept of reality

1399
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:59,340
Maybe the desert in this case is what people have preferred in their minds

1400
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:01,620
Yeah, well, we're

1401
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:02,760
right now

1402
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:08,820
Just there's commentary on that. You know, we're living in a time you talked about obsolescence and planned obsolescence earlier

1403
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:10,040
We're not living in a time

1404
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:13,600
Where uh a light bulb

1405
01:29:14,860 --> 01:29:15,340
company

1406
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:16,580
opens up

1407
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:20,440
to make light bulbs, you know, they open up to make

1408
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:24,200
Money or what they think is money at the very least

1409
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:26,660
Yeah, it's great and glad there's yeah

1410
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,180
Absolutely. Yeah. Um

1411
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:35,660
We are you know, the our carnal, you know, this body is is certainly

1412
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:36,760
animal

1413
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:38,220
but these

1414
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:41,560
You know what animates it how how we think?

1415
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:45,540
Uh, i'd say the question that sets us apart from the rest of nature

1416
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:48,480
Is why

1417
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:52,380
You know what what other creature asks

1418
01:29:53,330 --> 01:29:59,540
Why not not the how you know, that's a lot of where the varying conflicts between

1419
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:00,740
uh

1420
01:30:01,490 --> 01:30:04,520
What what are commonly referred to as religious organizations?

1421
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:05,720
uh versus

1422
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:11,760
Say, uh, you know scientific what they were what they call scientific or scientific. Yeah

1423
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:18,700
Scienticulous you mean right exactly, but it's one group, you know describing how

1424
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:21,500
and the other group describing why

1425
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:22,380
and

1426
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:27,160
In some points, you know, even with the the lack of information that is available

1427
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:31,860
Um on either side of that they they can they can get things relatively correct

1428
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,560
But when one tries to go into the other

1429
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:38,820
uh, you you realize how very debased everything is

1430
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:41,480
Um, oh, yeah when when those

1431
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:46,040
Who would be considered religious are trying to describe the how?

1432
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:50,120
Or when those who would refer to themselves as scientists?

1433
01:30:50,860 --> 01:30:52,760
Start referring to

1434
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:58,620
Uh the why um, you're going to find very quickly how um

1435
01:30:59,740 --> 01:31:07,020
How very we've become incredibly departmentalized in our thinking and who thinks about what and who does what about what things like that

1436
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:09,700
uh, just generally speaking and

1437
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:10,740
so

1438
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,920
when both are working on

1439
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:16,100
uh information that

1440
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,800
functions for a

1441
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:22,800
uh system of beliefs be that a scientific faith or a

1442
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,520
You know a religious faith

1443
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:29,700
Either is going to be working on incomplete information

1444
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:31,420
and

1445
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:35,800
That's just because we're you know, it's not being sought. It's not well

1446
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,740
It's it's being capitalized

1447
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:41,680
But by the way this ignorance or it's not really see ignorance can be is not the problem

1448
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:46,120
A lot of people seem to say that's the problem. I don't see that as being a problem. You can fix that very

1449
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:52,140
Quickly it's the stubbornness and rebelliousness against looking at what these things should be based on

1450
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:56,420
you know, um, and by the way, the the majority of

1451
01:31:57,020 --> 01:32:00,460
Communication whether it's mainstream or alternative is still taking advantage

1452
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:08,760
of the disinformation and misinformation, you know, the the truck stop in the middle of the highway kind of concept and

1453
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:14,620
You know what I mean by disinformation those are the ones putting out knowing that it's false and the

1454
01:32:14,620 --> 01:32:16,940
Misinformation are the ones that are believing it, right?

1455
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:22,620
So you have a world of the distant the disinformants are very few but the misinformed are the many

1456
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:28,360
um, and but there is a rebellious and stubbornness not to look at the

1457
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:33,340
Let's say the source or the or any reference material on both sides

1458
01:32:34,010 --> 01:32:40,740
You know and uh, and again, uh, it's very uncommon. Uh to discuss what things should be based on

1459
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:43,540
According to the way we communicate about them, right?

1460
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:47,440
Uh, you know how we just mentioned earlier, uh,

1461
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:52,160
Go ahead and try to have a discussion with not just common folk but people that are supposedly

1462
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:56,500
Educated in the matter and defining the soul and the spirit and watch what happens

1463
01:32:57,140 --> 01:33:00,540
you're gonna you're gonna either laugh or cry about it and

1464
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:06,360
Or any subject, you know, and but i've seen there's a tremendous amount of gluttony

1465
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:08,960
where people

1466
01:33:09,860 --> 01:33:11,800
There's something called ethics and morality

1467
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:17,060
Right, and it's very easy to say well we you know, it's all gone downhill, but can you give specifics on it?

1468
01:33:17,640 --> 01:33:22,480
You know, you hear a lot of people discussing about there's an evil force controlling mankind

1469
01:33:23,380 --> 01:33:25,080
But can you give specifics on it?

1470
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:28,360
You know, there are bad things happening in the world

1471
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,620
Can you give specifics on it? The answer to all this is no

1472
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:35,800
And if you try to give specifics on it that anyone can readily access

1473
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:39,180
You kind of either try to either find yourself being

1474
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:45,700
Resisted or the communication is resisted not necessarily yourself because hopefully you don't want to find yourself being resisted

1475
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:48,060
because typically when you sense that

1476
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:54,420
They're fixing on doing some kind of harm to you physically. So you might want to get away from them physically also

1477
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:00,180
But these are the things that we're going to be discussing here and showing how simple they are

1478
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:03,740
And how anyone can access it and here's the thing

1479
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:06,220
When you bring up the term study

1480
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:14,660
It's become a bad word, but you know if you have a uh, let's say 900 some odd page book if you read one page a day

1481
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:20,420
Or you'd be done in three years, right? Or if you had three pages a day, you'd be done in a year

1482
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:24,940
And I mean that's not really difficult to study, especially if you look at

1483
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,020
documents

1484
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:27,460
that

1485
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:31,340
Where the introduction and the conclusion are basically the same

1486
01:34:31,860 --> 01:34:38,880
You might want to start at the end i've seen NIH documents on viruses, which is national national institute of health

1487
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:45,720
And they're about 900 page pdfs. So I read the introduction where they're fixing on doing a study on what a virus is

1488
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,360
Then I go to the conclusion page

1489
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:53,260
987 and the conclusion says well, we still don't know what a virus is

1490
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:56,360
Why the hell would you bother reading everything in the middle?

1491
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:58,380
Right

1492
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:01,360
So you can really go through

1493
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:04,740
stuff pretty quickly and pretty easily

1494
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,080
but this is just from

1495
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,640
private communications and what i've heard of people in the

1496
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:15,460
Alternative media and mainstream media as well because I used to work in television for a short time

1497
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:21,280
Is that you've got to really dumb it down for the people people just want to be entertained and i'm like what?

1498
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:23,560
And

1499
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:32,100
When I speak to people regarding what they hear that's information-based like oh, yeah, I I think it's crap, but it's entertaining anyway

1500
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:33,340
I'm, like what?

1501
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,900
So there's there's really no exchange

1502
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:38,480
Are you kidding?

1503
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:44,600
This is why I said earlier, you know, hopefully we're going to be exploring the highest and best use of the medium

1504
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:46,500
So

1505
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:47,740
Yeah

1506
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:49,780
Absolutely

1507
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:56,440
Um, I do want to mention and you know, we're broadcasting on american freedom radio and you're listening to

1508
01:35:56,440 --> 01:36:02,040
The greek and seth michael on uncommon sense and you can find

1509
01:36:02,940 --> 01:36:05,520
us on on the internet or at least

1510
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,480
a website

1511
01:36:07,480 --> 01:36:15,040
The uncommon radio is like a card. It's where you're going to get access to perhaps the archives and it's just you know

1512
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:20,280
People ask you, you know, if you're walking around in society years ago and say well, you know, I do carpentry, you know

1513
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:21,040
So you have a card?

1514
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:26,460
Uh, yeah, here's a card. It's just you know, these days people that's what they ask you. You have a website

1515
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:28,580
Yeah, it's uncommon radio.com

1516
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:33,840
But you will find this sonic experience at americanfreedomradio.com and by the way folks

1517
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:41,460
Uh, we're not selling anything and I don't really intend to sell anything and I do intend and do intend though

1518
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:43,140
To dedicate a bunch of time

1519
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,960
Uh, and I believe seth does as well

1520
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:47,160
uh

1521
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:49,360
He's right here. He'll tell you perhaps he does

1522
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:55,280
But american freedom radio is um might consider it a minor internet radio

1523
01:36:55,980 --> 01:37:00,180
Station that has it's got big aspirations and they're really good at what they do

1524
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:04,660
And they could use some help. However, you want to pipe it over to them

1525
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:09,460
Remember, it's it's not the cost of the radio. It's the piping it to you that costs right?

1526
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:10,360
so

1527
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:19,440
They're they're all exceptions, uh all exceptions all any kind of contribution donation anything you want to send their way, you know, um

1528
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:22,500
That'll help them along. It's well deserved

1529
01:37:23,140 --> 01:37:23,740
uh

1530
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:26,200
And consider that an endorsement

1531
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:29,600
Um, they could really they could really use

1532
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:30,620
uh

1533
01:37:31,360 --> 01:37:36,940
the vote for lack of a better term if people are familiar with what's going on and

1534
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:44,900
I guess the united states of america, uh, you kind of vote with your money if there is such a thing. So

1535
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:49,560
Uh, yeah, if you if you want to send something over because you know, it's just like the water, you know

1536
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:53,580
People complain about the water bill. It's not the water man. It's the piping it to you

1537
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:55,320
Right. Yeah

1538
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:58,480
Structure, it's the infrastructure. They really use it

1539
01:37:58,480 --> 01:38:02,760
Yeah, so you can find us on american freedom radio if you'd like to get in contact with me directly
