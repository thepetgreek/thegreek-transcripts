00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040
Hello and welcome to Uncommon Sense here on AmericanFreedomRadio.com as well as Ustream.

2
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:15,680
My name is Seth Michael and I'm joined as always by the Greek.

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,740
Welcome Greek.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,980
How are you doing today?

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,060
Doing great.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:19,960
Greetings everyone.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,920
We're here another, it's been about a week and we're here and maybe we're going to talk

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,619
about more things people are pretty much never going to understand.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,540
But it doesn't mean you can't talk about them anyway.

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,340
It's just the funniest thing.

11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:43,320
The reason I say that is, you know, talk about money system or health or anything at all.

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,760
It's like you get this look like, wow, you know, but it just kind of clears through and

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,500
stays blank.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,260
I don't know, man.

15
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,560
I don't know what's going on.

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,140
I mean, I kind of do know what's going on, but people don't really want to hear why,

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:02,500
you know, but they just want to maybe hear about things that they don't know about.

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,120
So I don't know.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,540
Yeah.

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,120
What do you think?

21
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:15,980
I'd say that if all reality is just making a broad generalization here, all reality can

22
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:24,140
be viewed as being a symphony or an orchestra or a group of people making music instead of,

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:32,260
you know, varying experiences that what we talk about is tuned a bit differently than

24
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,200
what everyone else is used to.

25
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:40,520
So it sounds quite discordant to the reality that everyone is used to.

26
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:47,520
So even the things that we discuss that are obvious to those who have been, you know,

27
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,380
had the feeling that things are wrong, we're being lied to, et cetera, et cetera.

28
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:00,180
Even those things that are discussed here are discussed in a way that is quite opposed

29
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:08,180
to the way that they are discussed generally, because we're not the people that say, well,

30
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,860
you know, if it makes you feel good, it must be right and isn't that pleasant and, you

31
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,380
own truth and all of that good stuff.

32
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,880
I say that euphemistically.

33
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,480
And so what is heard here is it's discordant.

34
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,740
It doesn't vibe.

35
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:35,560
It doesn't resonate because it's so very different from what you're going to hear the rest of

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:43,480
the choir singing, that if you enjoy what they're saying, if you're enjoying that tune,

37
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,840
it's going to be difficult to take information out of what's being shared here.

38
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,340
So maybe turn down the background noise.

39
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,420
Yeah, if possible.

40
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,840
You know, what's interesting just on that thought came through when you were saying discordant,

41
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,400
the majority of the things we discuss are essentially the matters or the things that

42
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,500
most people subscribe to mentally, meaning in their groups, you know, whether it's religious,

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,320
scientific, social, economic, what we're doing is discussing the foundation of those things

44
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,540
that they can access with just a few minutes of research or hours or just a little bit

45
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:28,400
of inquiry, you know, and it's their own stuff.

46
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,800
It's real interesting.

47
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:37,780
Right. And they don't want to pretty much go back and see what things are based on.

48
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,660
It's interesting.

49
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,920
It's like a runaway situation, a self-consuming situation.

50
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:51,220
It seems like once the lie and the deception was started, it kind of like locked itself in.

51
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,680
And everyone, when I say everyone statistically, meaning most of the people you've ever met,

52
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,500
most people, you know, and most people you're going to meet will typically not have interest

53
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,460
on looking at the foundation or what things are based on and essentially are leading patterns

54
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:13,020
of thought and a life that is baseless, but yet adequate enough to maintain what's called

55
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,100
food, clothing and shelter or some semblance of.

56
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,079
So it's interesting to see that.

57
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,860
And I believe part of it might be taking things for granted.

58
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,260
You know, if I wake up in the morning and I'm breathing and I can walk or talk or do things

59
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,580
that I was told I'm supposed to do, that's good enough.

60
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:41,240
And the rest of it has been somehow hijacked and re-led or re rebooted in a way that is based

61
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,700
on nothing. It's the most interesting thing.

62
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,340
Well, it's the nothing is not really nothing.

63
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,160
It's based on a perception of the thing.

64
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,420
You know, like we've talked about all the world's religions, none of them are doing anything

65
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,800
that's in the text that they allegedly subscribe to, quote unquote, the scientific community

66
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,040
does not pass its own scientific method.

67
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,080
Forget about economics, there is no money.

68
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,420
How you know, it's a credit based economy right away.

69
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:18,320
By the way, folks, prophetically, the majority of the people on this planet, if not most of

70
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,440
the people, will never understand the money system.

71
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,420
Isn't that interesting? Until a very certain specific time, which is when you're pretty much

72
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,800
out of time. So that is a moot point to discuss.

73
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,800
You know, I was always thinking about doing a couple hours with you, Seth, on how the money

74
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,840
system works. And I've kind of abandoned that because, again, prophetically, people will

75
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,500
never understand that.

76
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,420
Actually, what they will do in the future is they will just stop using it.

77
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,500
It doesn't state that they will ever really comprehend how it works either.

78
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,160
So I think discussing economics is a moot point.

79
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,100
And just to throw a little dig or a jab to the imbeciles and morons, by the way, if you

80
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,820
haven't noticed in listening to the show, especially the past few episodes, that is the

81
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,300
term that we refer to as the typical surface dwelling earth inhabitant.

82
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,740
And it's a polite one, by the way, had a message about someone maybe taking slight offense

83
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,900
to it. And I'm like, well, if you read any of the ancient texts, the gods think a lot worse

84
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,420
of you on that. So when you hear the Greek referring to your typical surface dwelling earth

85
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,160
inhabitant as an imbecile or a moron, take it in a good light.

86
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,060
That is about the best description that can all be a fitting

87
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,060
and maybe not as polite as one might perceive it to be, but it is actually quite

88
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,280
fitting. But wanted to go back to the discussion perhaps on economics is

89
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,560
that it's just boggles the mind on how there is not one, not a one,

90
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,380
this is a definite that I've discovered so far on the Internet or anywhere,

91
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:55,040
economic commentator that is even slightly accurate or discusses

92
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,440
the credit based economy in its true nature.

93
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,400
Not a one. Not one.

94
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,040
And there are several of them that are quite popular.

95
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,180
They have thousands of subscribers and they're quite popular and they're idiots,

96
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,380
every single one of them. And they don't even come close to discussing

97
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,660
anything. I was going to ask that.

98
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,120
I was going to ask if any of them even come close.

99
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,460
Nope, not at all. It's just amazing.

100
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,340
And some of these guys have celebrity status, just like in the conspiracy community.

101
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,980
I mean, you have people that are supposedly studying the occult and discuss the occult

102
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,220
and they get on and they talk about for 20 minutes.

103
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,680
No one knows who the pyramids were built.

104
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,920
We don't even have cranes today that could lift them.

105
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,840
Oh, boy. Since when?

106
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,720
Really heavy. This is just absurdity,

107
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,500
but there's an interesting word that came by this week

108
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,080
and it's called, I'll just sonically say it's coprophagia.

109
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,440
Starts with a C and it's a PH.

110
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,940
C-O-P-R-O-P-H-A-G-I-A.

111
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,480
And it's a it's a behavior.

112
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,160
So do you want to look it up?

113
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Just a general search, coprophagia, and this is what's going on.

114
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,780
So anyway, just for you guys out there that are also into wordsmithing.

115
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,039
Coprophagia, it's an English word.

116
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,500
Yeah, it's basically Greek, but it's been used very often in terminology.

117
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,060
You want to read the definition?

118
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,460
This is yeah, this is just out of what they call the dictionary.

119
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,440
That's fine.

120
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,060
It's the eating of feces or dung.

121
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,060
Yes.

122
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,180
Coprophagia.

123
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,520
From copros, which is feces.

124
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,800
Phagia, which is to consume.

125
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,180
Yeah, it's a Greek prefix in a Greek suffix.

126
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,170
Yeah. Yep.

127
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,790
This is what's going on.

128
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,230
Right. If nothing is based, if what's being discussed is not founded.

129
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,590
Then what are they eating?

130
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:24,510
There you go. So.

131
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,050
Interesting. Anyway, we like words.

132
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:34,470
And so you mean it's not all about going back to the gold standard or the silver standard?

133
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,330
Or what are they auditing the Fed?

134
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,690
You could audit the Fed.

135
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,250
Yeah. Yeah. Why does the Fed need to be audited?

136
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,430
That's not their purpose.

137
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,430
There's nothing there to audit.

138
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,390
So they are basically think about it, folks.

139
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,050
As I said, I wasn't going to discuss.

140
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,270
Yeah, we're not going to dedicate a show to it, let's say.

141
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:01,530
But you've heard of stockbrokers colloquially like they get a cut from the transaction,

142
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:08,590
whether you buy or sell or whether you get an increase or profit or loss is irrelevant.

143
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,430
They get a cut from the transaction.

144
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:14,110
So that's all. There's nothing there to audit, folks.

145
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,290
If you want to know what the Fed's doing, just look at the money supply that's reported.

146
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,950
That's it. Takes about three minutes to audit the Fed.

147
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,730
So ridiculous.

148
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,490
And yeah, they're all endorsing this stuff.

149
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,590
You know, hey, how about this?

150
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,210
You know, this part of the world, by the way, it's getting warm.

151
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:39,550
And that means these little pathogens that allegedly cause the common cold are increasing

152
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,670
and they're quite active.

153
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,430
I don't see people really complaining about the common cold in the beginning of summer.

154
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,070
It's not interesting.

155
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,930
I just thought I'd throw that in there, folks, because apparently the Medical Society of

156
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,630
the United States is never going to understand anything either.

157
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,370
This is real simple stuff.

158
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:04,790
So if you'll notice that things tend to prefer refrigeration when it gets warmer to retard

159
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,970
the growth of bacteria.

160
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:11,950
But yet you're told that when it gets cold and the bacteria are dormant, they are the

161
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,290
cause for your illness.

162
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,330
OK, guys, just let that sink in for a minute.

163
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,050
I think that's comprehensible.

164
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:27,010
To some degree. So then what is if that is not the cause?

165
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,010
Obviously, it's not the cause.

166
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,090
It's temperature, right?

167
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:38,050
Yeah. Yeah. We use refrigeration, as you said, cold temperatures to inhibit the spread of

168
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:45,190
these bacteria or when viruses, pathogens, we'll call them pathogens.

169
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,370
But, you know, by the way, viruses and black holes and a couple other things don't exist.

170
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,410
You know, they're only a method.

171
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:58,050
Well, they're all they're figments of one's, would you say, presentation because they're

172
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:58,970
presented to you.

173
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,650
You'll never see a black hole and you'll never see a virus, folks.

174
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:03,870
You'll see an animation of one or a drawing of one.

175
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:13,530
But you'll see it's basically they're inaccurate ways of explaining a phenomenon.

176
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,890
Yeah, it's really it's cellcopro is what it is.

177
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,290
This is what it's yeah, it's broken up.

178
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,390
Things are created in the liver.

179
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:28,010
So anyway, these things are really, really astounding when you think about them, how

180
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,190
simple they are to approach.

181
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,130
It's the emperor has no clothes, you know.

182
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,630
Now, that was that uncommon.

183
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,870
I think so. But either way, there's a level of appreciation.

184
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,630
But, you know, we just touched upon medical a little bit.

185
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,810
Well, not medical health.

186
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:47,870
What is it? You know, well, one one suggestion is that the human body.

187
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:51,710
For lack of a better term, is very tightly integrated into its environment.

188
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,470
You know, sensory, of course, you know, when it's cold out, you're going to want to

189
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,230
you're going to feel cold and you're going to want to warm up.

190
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,050
And when it's hot out, you want to you're going to feel hot and you want to cool down.

191
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,070
So you are integrated very tightly into the environment.

192
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:14,030
So could it be that you're at the intake of what you consume, what you eat?

193
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:20,770
Foggy, right, has a systemic effect based on its seasonality and its latitude.

194
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:27,390
In other words, foods that are grown in a tropical location are going to influence those

195
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:34,130
that consume it chemically, at least as if they are adjusting the body to be in the

196
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:38,530
tropics. So if you're eating tropical food when it's cold out, your body will adjust to

197
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:41,230
living in the tropics and you will not fare well.

198
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,610
And the opposite is true.

199
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,330
If you live in the tropics and eat, let's say, for example, food that's grown near the

200
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:58,710
Arctic, typically the most commonality on that I've seen is people living in summer

201
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,490
months eating cold water fish.

202
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,630
Right. And they wonder why they can't cool down.

203
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,670
It's the most unusual thing.

204
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,490
And you tell them and they're like, oh, wow, that's really a good idea.

205
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,550
And then what do they do?

206
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,030
They go right back to it.

207
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,130
So, yeah, it's interesting.

208
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,190
I don't think the information, I think you and I have always discussed it's the

209
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:26,390
information or the ignorance of something is not what is driving this mess.

210
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:33,410
Let's say it's the stubbornness and rebelliousness and the, I guess, taking things

211
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,290
for granted concept is another thing.

212
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,650
And the gluttony. That's why, for example, back to the system, people will never I

213
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:46,090
think they're being cosmically blocked from understanding it because what's called

214
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,710
currency is derived from the signature.

215
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:51,990
So you really don't. All you have to do is go sign you sign the name that's attached to

216
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,190
the account that was created when you were born and you get whatever you want.

217
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:01,670
But they can't be made available to your common surface dwelling earth inhabitant

218
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,590
because they won't do anything.

219
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,790
So, yeah, that's I think enough said about that.

220
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,950
But yeah.

221
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:16,870
And the media, the sources of information that you're getting and the talking heads are

222
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:25,010
suggesting. Well, the entire group, both the ones giving the information and receiving it

223
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:33,390
are in the coprophagia dimension, I should say, because the stuff is just so

224
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:37,910
poor. So anyway, that's the word of the week, folks.

225
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,310
And speaking of the week, lawfully, it appears to be the third week of the fourth

226
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,690
month. What the hell is he talking about?

227
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,410
Yeah, lawfully, something people don't know.

228
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,850
Fourth day. Yeah.

229
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,090
Twenty third reckoning.

230
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:51,970
Twenty fourth. Yep.

231
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,670
By noon. Much.

232
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:56,730
I'd reckon the 24th of the fourth month.

233
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,550
Yep.

234
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:06,310
Lawfully. Now, you know, typically what most people reckon time with allegedly is a

235
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,590
work schedule, which is not a lawful timepiece.

236
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:14,790
And no one really cares, obviously, because, you know, most people are looking to be

237
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:19,470
socially accepted or find things to be, let's say, sociable.

238
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,630
So I guess there's a tipping point.

239
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:28,470
If you if you get the majority of the people that perhaps perform or think a certain

240
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,770
way and then they find comfort in it, then it's self-consuming.

241
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,130
I think it's, you know, they're looking for free energy.

242
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:39,710
There it is. Social memes, traditions and customs.

243
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,470
There's your free energy, folks.

244
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,210
Keeps on going. Yeah, it's important.

245
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:53,710
I think it's important to point out that your environment, the environment has become a

246
00:16:53,710 --> 00:17:05,270
word that is used in a lot of like dogmatic speech currently with the, you know, the

247
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,569
state and being what it is and where we are.

248
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:13,410
But I think it's important to point out that your environment is not simply, you know,

249
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,930
like the state that you live in or the climate in which you find yourself.

250
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,030
But the environment is everything that is surrounding you.

251
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:25,829
And when you say that we are a very subject to our environment, it's not solely on a

252
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:33,150
health, but it's also on a the way that we act and the way that we think our abilities,

253
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:39,630
the ways, you know, our capabilities to think and act are limited by our environment as

254
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:45,710
well. Be it, you know, not just the extremes of, you know, extreme temperature, but the

255
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:53,770
from the clothing that is your immediate environment to, you know, the couch that you sit

256
00:17:53,770 --> 00:18:01,870
on to, you know, the porch that you stand, it's it's all inclusive and being as subject

257
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:08,630
to input as the human form is, it's it's important to consider all of those things

258
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,810
because all of these things will affect you in one way or another.

259
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:21,050
And being aware of that makes it a lot easier to be conscious of those effects and

260
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:28,290
gives you a little bit more of perspective that is valid for seeing what is correct and

261
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:34,930
what is incorrect and not only what, but, you know, why comprehension, understanding.

262
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,250
So I just want a little aside there, but I wanted to point that out.

263
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,330
No, that's that's good, because it's how tightly you are integrated to that, you know,

264
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,490
here, a state of being environment environment now in 1600, the aggregate of the

265
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,470
conditions in which a person or thing lives first recorded 1827.

266
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,210
So it's a fairly new word here.

267
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,050
Specialized ecology since first recorded 1956.

268
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:03,230
It's fairly new, stating that it doesn't give much of an origin.

269
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,370
But the word economy is the same way, meaning people think that has to do with

270
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:13,390
currency and money, but actually economy actually means a set of laws or guidelines

271
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,270
or covenants that one lives by.

272
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:21,230
Like, you know, when I discuss, for example, certain things, I'll say in the biblical

273
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,950
economy, so and so and so.

274
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,010
And they're like, what are you talking about?

275
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,990
That has nothing to do with money.

276
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,090
Like, well, the word economy, ekos means house and nomos means law.

277
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:34,650
So it's a it's a control, it's a structure that is being controlled by a set of rules

278
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,950
or laws is the term economy.

279
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:43,950
So, you know, so when one states, let's say, the American economy, it also would

280
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:49,770
incorporate pastimes and customs and traditions and the way things are done, it's

281
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:56,150
not, you know, but perhaps the way they do things is why they believe they are in such

282
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,450
poor shape, which they're not.

283
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,190
So that's a real interesting thing.

284
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:12,030
In Vyron, in Vyron, yeah, the broken down in its original, the end, the end at the

285
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:19,710
beginning is, you know, in in English and Vyron, which is a circle or a circuit.

286
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,150
So encircled essentially what is around you.

287
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:29,430
Right, right. And how and how tight, you know, tightly integrated you are to it, which

288
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:34,730
is, you know, there's a series of boundary layers, like, for example, clothing is a

289
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,670
boundary layer, a dwelling place is a boundary layer, you know, you know.

290
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,310
Right. So, yeah, absolutely.

291
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:53,490
And seeing yourself as, you know, in an environment or being aware of how how it can

292
00:20:53,490 --> 00:21:00,830
affect you, you know, is one way of separating yourself from it instead of just being a

293
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,270
part of that environment or a piece of that environment.

294
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,850
You can realize that you were it's something that you were in, as opposed to

295
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:14,570
something that you are a part of, like the fauna of the area or something or flora,

296
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,630
plants or animals.

297
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:22,450
Either way, there is a it's the guidance of the mind.

298
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,050
You know, there there's certain discussions I've had this week and people saying, well,

299
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,310
they're distracted by this and distracted by that.

300
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:33,450
And I said, wait a second, this is you're the third or fourth person that said that the

301
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,190
cause of these ills and things that people are going through are because they're being

302
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:42,830
distracted. Now, let's I think I briefly mentioned this last week, but a distraction is

303
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:49,970
simply a detour or a slight change that course corrections are made.

304
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:57,550
And I made a note to this fellow that, you know, if an airplane or a ship is on a on a

305
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:04,830
course and there's a distraction, a storm or a roadblock, you consider it a detour or a

306
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:07,550
course correction or a change and then you go back on course.

307
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,210
So the distraction cannot be the cause.

308
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:15,690
The cause is that people have no rules or covenants to live by.

309
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,930
They have no purpose that they are looking to attain.

310
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:26,930
So if the distraction is all there is enough to throw them off, you know, then, yeah,

311
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:32,190
that again confirms what we've been saying is that these things are unfounded because

312
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,210
people what they go upon are unfounded.

313
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:42,030
Yes, the distraction is can be critical and fatal in many instances, meaning fatal,

314
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:46,110
meaning where the the cause is it dies.

315
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,270
Right. Or whatever they're thinking about.

316
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,970
So or catastrophic.

317
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:58,390
But when one has a set course, for example, again, just like an airplane or a ship on the

318
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:03,130
ocean, if there's a storm, yeah, they might have to do a detour, go around the storm,

319
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:08,230
which is going to add time and distance, but they still end up arriving to their

320
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:16,450
destination. So this this metaphor or this is more direct than a metaphor is very much so

321
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:21,070
that when we say the religious societies, the scientific societies, medical size, legal

322
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:26,450
societies, because they're not based on anything while they say they are, but they're

323
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:36,130
not doing anything or not familiar with it is is kind of there's no stability, meaning

324
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:42,610
that the people are not aware that these religion sciences and so on and so forth are

325
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:45,670
based on something they're aware that they're supposed to be, but because they're not

326
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:50,730
aware of what's in what they're supposed to be based in, they fall for all the other

327
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:57,510
machinations, you know, like black holes and viruses and, you know, look at what's going

328
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,530
on in all the religions.

329
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:02,990
I mean, I'm you know, here's a thing that was a personal private thing.

330
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:08,830
I'll say I'm in complete shock still today that there are schools of divinity or

331
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:13,130
biblical colleges that are still open teaching what they teach.

332
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:18,270
And I'm still shocked that there are law schools today still teaching what they're

333
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:23,570
teaching. I'm in complete shock that there are medical colleges still teaching what

334
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:30,790
they're teaching. You know, forget about the people being unaware and naive, the gall

335
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:38,250
and the just just the the how would you say when someone just doesn't give a crap in

336
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,090
your face, blatantly wrong, still procuring this stuff.

337
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,410
You know, it's unbelievable.

338
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:50,490
I'm in complete shock that these schools, these professional schools, you know, that

339
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,830
people go to get a quote unquote degree still exist.

340
00:24:55,290 --> 00:25:00,430
It's shocking. And what makes it shocking is you look at the curriculums and what they're

341
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:02,110
teaching. It's nonsense.

342
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:08,230
It's it's just it's yeah, it's just you got to really just grab yourself and say,

343
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:12,670
well, wow, you know, you can't really turn around and say the people are too naive,

344
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:17,070
let's say. So these people that supposedly know, how can they be responsible?

345
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,810
You know, why aren't they being held responsible for what they're doing?

346
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:25,210
So is it throughout history?

347
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:34,350
Has it been uncommon for the majority to rely upon the the presumed comprehension of

348
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:42,450
a few of the much because currently, like what, you know, I'm limited by my own

349
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:51,370
experience here inside of the States, but what is taught and how it is taught from

350
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:56,090
what little I've gleaned from history certainly appears to have changed significantly in the

351
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:01,950
last 60 to 70 years and in the last 50 and in the last 20, et cetera.

352
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:09,630
So like I'm familiar with the concept of like the, you know, the trivium and it seems

353
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:11,410
like they've just kind of picked one.

354
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:17,190
And currently what is being taught is the rhetoric for whatever, quote unquote, field

355
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:20,370
one is going into, at least on the higher education level.

356
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:26,210
You know, if you're planning on doing something other than simply pushing buttons or

357
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:31,690
building something, they teach you how to speak, but not how to do.

358
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:39,270
Like you brought up, you know, law, the legal society more specifically than actual law,

359
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,690
because that's not being discussed.

360
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:51,090
But as well as, you know, the the practical side as well, as opposed to just the.

361
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:58,870
Well, that would be the vocational vocational training you're referring to, like

362
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:03,530
technical training, like versus purely academic.

363
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:10,070
No, actually, I was referring more to the the rhetoric side of the academic part of

364
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,410
everything, because, I mean, there are still things being made.

365
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:18,330
You know, there's still machines being built to do things could certainly be improved

366
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:23,710
upon. But it's not like we're living in relative chaos.

367
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,230
Yeah, I wouldn't say it's chaos.

368
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:33,410
I think there's a brashness and an arrogance in the academic world or the places that

369
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:41,550
procure degrees in fields, the major fields being, let's say, the ones regarding faith,

370
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:45,770
the ones regarding science, which is the same, the ones regarding medicine, the ones

371
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,430
regarding law, legal, which is not law, let's say at this point.

372
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:57,490
In other words, even though there is no law, there is order, you see, and that's done by

373
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:00,790
motivating the society through penalty.

374
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,470
There's a big difference.

375
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,710
I'll say it again. You're living in a society pretty much across the board on the

376
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:15,310
planet that does what they do and maintains order by authoritative figure because the

377
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:17,670
motivation is within the penalty.

378
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:21,770
In other words, how many times have you heard with your, you know, this guy got away

379
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:24,470
with it. That means he wasn't subject to the penalty.

380
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:31,910
Well, how about having instruction and inspiration into the society that they should

381
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:37,610
do the right thing? See, very few people are in the legal society ever discuss what the

382
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:41,830
right thing is. They always discuss the penalty side, the motivation through that.

383
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:46,210
And this seems to be pretty much carried on by the population as well.

384
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,950
I mean, this is the way things go.

385
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:56,830
But back to the what is a complete shock is the arrogance of how trivial and incorrect

386
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:03,510
and inaccurate these higher forms of education are within their system, within their

387
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:08,890
curriculum, within the knowledge base that the so-called professors have, the texts.

388
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,830
And no one is paying any attention to it at all.

389
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:18,470
I mean, there are the ones that will criticize it to a degree.

390
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:23,050
Right. But they can't give specifics generally.

391
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,690
And I think that's why we get together to give maybe little slices.

392
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:34,830
You know, sometimes we go shallow and wide, sometimes we can go narrow and deep on a

393
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:40,890
subject. But I assure the listeners that never do we discuss anything in a very highly

394
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,070
specialized form.

395
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:47,130
Typically, we discuss things in a way that you can notice immediately just within your

396
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:52,890
immediate surroundings, within a few feet from you or just using a good rational

397
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:58,270
objectivity. You know, and that's pretty much uncommon.

398
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,270
Speaking of uncommon.

399
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:07,370
Yeah. If you if you like to contact us, we do have a site and it's just basically a site.

400
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,430
That's all it is. Not much on there other than just contact information.

401
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:15,310
And you can do that at www.uncommonradio.com.

402
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:24,410
And we'll link you to archives and where to listen at AFR as well and an email.

403
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,670
So, yeah, just wanted to throw that in.

404
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:34,050
And also American Freedom Radio is wholly and solely reliant upon the listenership for

405
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:36,690
support. So if you're listening, you know what to do.

406
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:40,310
Homepage will direct you on how to contribute.

407
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:46,010
So I just wanted to put that in as well, because we've received quite a courtesy by

408
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:51,150
showing up once a week here from AFR and doing it on what's called Internet Radio.

409
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:58,190
So, yeah, but nonetheless, many of the things that are discussed here might sound kind of

410
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,430
brash again. I'll say it is people will never understand.

411
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:05,570
Typically, as a society, it will never be understood as a group.

412
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:14,810
So most of the things that are spoken of here are not conducive socially for making

413
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:21,470
friends. You will not make friends if you listen to what's being said here and tend to

414
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,270
repeat the subject matter or the way it's being approached.

415
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,630
You will not be welcomed.

416
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:32,170
So that's very unusual to say, but it's unfortunately or fortunately, it's true.

417
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:39,690
We also like to think things are based on should be based on quality, not quantity.

418
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,550
Quantity is important, of course.

419
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:49,110
It's a rational measurement, but it seems that they're rationalizing quality has left

420
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:55,990
most. They don't really know how to rationalize quality, you know, and that's another

421
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,710
thing that's always being discussed here.

422
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,250
What is the quality of the thing?

423
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:09,570
Well, it's like having having one pen that functions or having, you know, 15 pens that do

424
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,670
not function or function well.

425
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:17,290
Yeah. You know, for the guys, I always say, you know, you're blessed if your feet fit in

426
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:24,610
Spanish or Italian shoes, if you if you if you can fit in Italian or Spanish made shoes,

427
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:27,110
buy them. They last very, very long time.

428
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,510
Yeah, they're 200 bucks or so.

429
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:36,650
But yeah, by quality stuff, I bought a pair of cycling shoes about 20 years ago for 400

430
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,550
bucks. And guess what?

431
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:47,750
Still have them and they're rocking, you know, and where if they weren't the best that I

432
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:51,950
wanted to afford at the time, I would have gone through five pairs at about a third of

433
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,910
that price, which would have made made it more expensive, believe it or not.

434
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:03,830
So, yeah, there's something about quality, you know, there's a question or a little bit

435
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:11,290
of a question from the chat on Ustream that you mentioned just a moment ago, you know,

436
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:14,970
things that are easily referenced and that are right in front of us.

437
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:17,470
And so this kind of goes along with that.

438
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,610
But it's the question goes like this.

439
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,150
What of ignorance of the stars?

440
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:29,570
Understanding the times and seasons communicated by the sky is uncommon and many

441
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,690
comments, a couple of things about what we've been talking about.

442
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:36,530
The Bible school dummy load has to keep rolling until the heavens roll back as a scroll.

443
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:42,870
And he says, you know, the universities and Bible schools are trade schools effectively.

444
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,950
And that's how they are pagan, Hellenistic paganism.

445
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:52,330
If you want to be specific, let's let's get into a little bit of that, what they're the

446
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:58,410
trade school, what they're teaching is for people to partake in ritualistic, Hellenistic

447
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:04,370
paganism with Assyrian, Assyrian and Babylonian symbology.

448
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,449
I'll say it again, it's a mouth load.

449
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:15,610
What the all of them, whether they're biblical or any other religion, is essentially

450
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:21,969
Hellenistic paganism with Babylonian and Assyrian symbology.

451
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:30,010
Now, a lot of these higher ups in these religions in private have other rituals that

452
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:35,050
work on the Philistine and Canaanite and Babylonian rites and rituals.

453
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:42,489
So, yep, that's pretty much as accurate as you can get and specific as you can get.

454
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:48,810
But regarding the stars, the stars pretty much reckon the ages, which are broken down

455
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,850
into one thousand and two thousand year chunks.

456
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,889
I just want to address one other thing.

457
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:56,890
I just went into the Ustream here until the heavens roll back as a scroll.

458
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:02,290
Well, what's interesting about that, and we kind of like to give a little things about

459
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:08,570
that. You ever see a time lapse photography of the North Star where it looks like the

460
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:11,930
star is in the center and then you have these white lines of streaks.

461
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:14,230
That go around because of the time lapse.

462
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,310
All the other stars are kind of rotating around it.

463
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:19,710
When you look at the end of a scroll, it has this rolled.

464
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:29,430
Look to it, right, a spiral almost, you know what that means, by the way, and what it if

465
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:35,270
you look, if you look at the heavens rolling as a scroll in context, it refer it's

466
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:41,010
referring to the pole shift, by the way, of the planet, which will happen in the future.

467
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:46,910
So something to think about keeping things in context, which which I wanted to throw

468
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:52,030
in. We usually like to do dispel a little cliche every time we've missed the past

469
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,450
couple of times. So it's going to take this opportunity to do itself regarding a

470
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,210
biblical cliche.

471
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:00,050
How about it? A biblical cliche?

472
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:04,530
Yeah, but you'll use versus inaccurately as cliches.

473
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,990
They don't know what they mean or they're out of context.

474
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:11,270
Like, for example, no one knows the day or the hour.

475
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:17,030
Isn't that supposedly it's the return of someone out of the biblical text.

476
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,450
That's what they apply it to.

477
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,410
It has nothing to do with that.

478
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:26,690
If any, if you read the verse that comes before it, the Christ is asked, when will the

479
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:29,310
sun and the earth wither away or go away?

480
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,430
And he says, no one knows the day or the hour.

481
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,070
But if you're asleep, you're going to miss the time of my return.

482
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,330
Isn't that interesting?

483
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,090
So anyway, just thought I'd throw that in there.

484
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:47,130
So whenever you hear someone says no one knows the day or the hour, it has nothing

485
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,550
to do with what you think it does.

486
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:55,770
It has to do with the wearing away or the destruction or the entropic effect on the

487
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:57,510
sun and the earth and the stars.

488
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,170
So I thought I'd throw that in there.

489
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,770
There's not much understanding.

490
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:07,930
And, you know, just like if you look at what's called this, you know, you've got this

491
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:11,110
guy long and long hair nailed to a Roman cross wearing a diaper.

492
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:15,030
Right. That's Assyrian symbology.

493
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,730
That never happened. You could read the King James Bible a million times.

494
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,510
If you are reading into it, you will never see it.

495
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:28,430
If you're reading out of it, you will see everything that's being put in front of you

496
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:33,360
is a lie. So so I throw that in there.

497
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:42,640
Yeah, it's baseless rhetoric or the basis that is being used is inaccurate to the text

498
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,820
that was. But even in that has been preserved.

499
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:50,640
But, you know, even in the in the crappy King James versions and any English version is

500
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,020
pretty crappy, by the way, because singular things are turned into plural and plural

501
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:01,640
turn into singular and words are changed and it's just not even it's just make you want

502
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,320
to crawl out of your skin if you look at it.

503
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,700
But and you figure out what's what's been done.

504
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,220
But but here's the point.

505
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,300
It's just going back to that guy nailed to a cross.

506
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,920
If you read the text.

507
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,860
It's very clear that Pontius Pilate, he was the last jurisdiction he was brought to

508
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:24,160
cleared him any wrongdoing and returned him back to the Judean authorities to use their

509
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,140
law. Very clear.

510
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:32,040
Judean authorities are not familiar with Roman laws and Roman execution.

511
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,860
There was no crucifixion, folks.

512
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,160
Doesn't matter how many times it says it.

513
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,280
Very clear about that.

514
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:44,620
Word crucifix, by the way, is a botanical term has to do with the flower of a tree.

515
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:51,000
So anyway, I figured I'd just throw that in there because it's just shock.

516
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,120
It's just shocking and how relevantly irrelevant what people believe in is.

517
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,900
So. Absolutely.

518
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:11,440
So any comments on what is referred to as the Zodiac or the concept of astrology?

519
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:18,220
There's a question in chat asking if it's accurate or it is, but but they don't use the

520
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,420
Zodiac. They use more like the Maserat.

521
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:24,540
It is very accurate to a degree, but you have to look at the entire thing.

522
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,540
In other words, the movements of the planets and the stars, just like anything like if you

523
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:37,420
ever heard of the obsession with the occult, with the penis and the vagina.

524
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,880
Yes, I said it.

525
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,140
And, you know, like all of your church architecture and temple architecture is based on

526
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,440
the ancient sex temples.

527
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,520
Why did they focus on it?

528
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:54,520
Because the the the flower where the seed is is the most important part of the crop.

529
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:57,040
Well, obviously, the yield of the crop is important.

530
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:01,160
But if you don't have a flower in a seed, there's no crop next year.

531
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:08,500
So what was recognized is the genitalia as being the most important organ because there's

532
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,780
a limited lifespan to the living thing.

533
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,100
And it's important that the seed continues.

534
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,420
So they went a little overboard.

535
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:20,420
Well, the movement of the stars and the effects of the planets on the Earth, they went a

536
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,560
little overboard with that.

537
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,700
And they think that's it and that's it alone.

538
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,320
And it's not. There's more to it.

539
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,580
Now, there's also a comment in there.

540
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,420
There's too bad the Bible is a flat Earth book, numerous references to the Earth being

541
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:36,760
flat. I guess now there is no reference to the Earth being flat in the biblical text

542
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,980
whatsoever. Zero, it is very clear that the Earth is round.

543
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:54,320
So it's now what obviously this person is reading King James or Fenton or NIV or all

544
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,160
that stuff there.

545
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,920
They have not gone into the intralinear aspect yet.

546
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,020
So there's what there's a lot to do.

547
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,940
This is it's not time yet to discuss that.

548
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,320
But here's the point.

549
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,520
Have you ever heard of the four corners of the Earth?

550
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,600
Yeah, that's exactly what was yes.

551
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:18,500
Yeah, that's just like just without giving the explanation how it's derived and how it's

552
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,680
defined. Well, actually, I will.

553
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:26,480
There's one place there where part of the economy states that you are not to shave the

554
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,460
four corners of your head or the four corners of your face.

555
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,920
Right. It's what's called Leviticus.

556
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,460
Right. So that means your head is flat.

557
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,100
Right. It's talking about someone else.

558
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,560
Obviously. Yes.

559
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:43,420
The way you derive four corners on something that is round is by two intersecting lines,

560
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:48,920
right, like taking a pie and cutting it across and then rotating and cutting it across

561
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,020
again where those two lines intersect.

562
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,120
Now they become four lines and they're in the center of the circle.

563
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,940
So whenever you hear of the four corners, just like the four corners region of what's

564
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,320
called America is where four states intersect.

565
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,400
And you could with two legs actually standing, you have two people standing in four

566
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,400
states at the same time.

567
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:18,140
Right. So the four corners typically symbol is is very specific about the center of

568
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,360
something that is round.

569
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,380
So anyway, let's let's go on.

570
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,300
We kind of landed on that question.

571
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,440
I think there's much to discuss on these things.

572
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:34,080
Yeah, it's an interesting thing as well, because, you know, the easiest reference

573
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:40,720
material available is dramatically flawed.

574
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:45,840
Dramatically is not the right word, but catastrophically flawed in many aspects,

575
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,920
especially if you're trying to study minutia or not minutia, but details.

576
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,200
The details have been obscured.

577
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:58,780
So, you know, interlinear is an easy tool to find if you have access to the Internet.

578
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:02,460
And if you're listening to us, chances are you have access to the Internet in one

579
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,800
form or another. Right.

580
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,920
Be careful. It only has what the Internet has.

581
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,520
But yeah.

582
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:11,340
And the thing is, even in the interlinear, they're going to show you a lot of

583
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:15,260
differences. But still, there's still pretty tricky little scoundrels.

584
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,280
Yeah. You'll see that certain things are not being translated and you see that they

585
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,880
lean towards a certain bias again on certain things.

586
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,900
But here's a here's a thing.

587
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:29,380
And I tell people this is pretty it sounds dogmatic, but it's actually very true.

588
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,700
And it's so true. And it's so simple.

589
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:35,640
It should be said whenever you hear anyone discussing anything biblical, they have to

590
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:41,300
preface that even today to this current day today, meaning all right up until this

591
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:45,760
current day, there is no translation of the biblical text from its original languages of

592
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,940
preservation, period.

593
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,020
That is a fact. And that is the truth.

594
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,760
It has yet to be translated.

595
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,080
What the hell do you got?

596
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,580
Well, ain't no translation, that's for sure.

597
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,660
Or interpreted versions.

598
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,900
Yeah, it's a very poor version.

599
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:00,940
Extremely poor.

600
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:07,040
Actually, if it was any poorer than that, you'd find a cell phone and Julie and Julius

601
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,180
Caesar and Mickey Mouse or something like that.

602
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:15,040
I mean, it is so poor that it's it's absolutely scraping the bottom in quality.

603
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,360
But why?

604
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,340
Why, why, why?

605
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,500
I'm sorry, I don't mean to.

606
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,640
We've discussed cosmic censorship.

607
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:29,660
Humanity was put under major, the last major axial period was around twenty five

608
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:35,280
hundred years ago. And at that time, there was a big obfuscation of general knowledge of

609
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,080
the spiritual world and the true history of mankind.

610
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,820
I know, again, this might sound a little crazy, but if anyone wants to look at what's

611
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,220
called the axial period of 500 B.C.

612
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:50,620
or twenty five hundred years ago, you're going to find a little bit of what emerged and

613
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,520
what was taken away.

614
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,020
And at this point, what we're saying, all of this stuff is still accessible.

615
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,460
Right. It's just that it takes a little bit of effort.

616
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:07,420
But you've got to remember that there is still very heavy cosmic censorship.

617
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:11,780
Recently, someone said to me, oh, I read a certain book of the Bible and I didn't get

618
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:17,720
anything out of it. I'm like, wow, you know, you could spend a year on just a chapter

619
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,560
of that. I figured it doesn't matter.

620
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,660
You know, here's someone who is censored.

621
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,300
You know, you could read it, but are you reading it with comprehension?

622
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:36,860
You know, so there is a time and a place where things are properly discussed.

623
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:44,540
And now is not the time to discuss certain things, believe it or not, you know, even

624
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:50,020
for the very few. But there is a time coming in the next couple of years where things

625
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,060
that are more lawful.

626
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,520
Can be presented in a more rational way.

627
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,620
You see. Yeah, there's a.

628
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,420
Well, here's an example.

629
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:06,340
One way to measure timing is when you go out into public and you see what's going on.

630
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,380
Right. All right.

631
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,860
Give an example. All right.

632
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,500
Look at all black and white films.

633
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:18,520
When you had, let's say, men going out into public, they all wore hats.

634
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:23,640
You ever notice that? You ever notice in the old black and white prior before the 1950s

635
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,360
or so, you're looking at the old films, everyone wore a hat.

636
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:33,860
And believe it or not, most of the shops or retail areas had hat shops.

637
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,980
And then all of a sudden, haberdasheries, haberdasheries.

638
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:43,440
Yeah. And and all of a sudden, within a decade or less, they all went away.

639
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,860
So it wasn't hat time anymore.

640
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:52,220
I mean, if you guys are familiar with Charles Fort, 14 times he talked about anomalous and

641
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,800
paranormal things at the turn of the century.

642
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:59,700
And he was in a discussion once and said, well, you know, look at something really simple

643
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:05,120
as a steam engine. You know, there's inklings of its invention 2000 years ago and things

644
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,980
like that. But how come it's so prolific today?

645
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,820
And he says, well, it wasn't steam engine time.

646
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,280
Then it's steam engine time now.

647
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:16,920
Right. The reason we have the steam engine is because it's steam engine time.

648
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,640
The reason why you have the airplane, it's airplane time.

649
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:25,360
The reason why you have no biblical translation is because it's not time yet.

650
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,300
So it's very interesting.

651
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,900
It's it's the same with all religions, by the way.

652
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:37,280
I have yet to meet anyone in any particular faith that knows anything really about what

653
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,660
and, you know, what they're professing.

654
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:46,440
And this is not just the average, you know, socialite, you know, the person who subscribes

655
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,220
to the group. I'm talking about the people that lead these groups as well.

656
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,120
And the same with the scientists and the same with the legal society and the same with the

657
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,060
medical society.

658
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:02,560
You know, the ones that tend to be more foundationally based or like Seth was saying

659
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,760
earlier on, we're more like the engineers, people that make stuff.

660
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,300
I think you said it several times that people that build stuff and make stuff, they

661
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:17,200
can't skirt around the issue of being practical or, you know, truthful to some degree.

662
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,240
Like if you're an engineer designing a bridge and decide to make it out of paper mache,

663
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,400
well, you know, there's going to be a lot of other people on the way that are going to

664
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,200
stop it from happening in paper mache.

665
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:32,860
Right. But when you have scientific endeavors put out by the scientific community or the

666
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:36,820
religious groups or the medical groups, it seems like no one kind of gets in the way

667
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:39,640
and says, hey, did you ever stop and think there's no such thing of what they're telling

668
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:45,640
you? I find that to be a phenomenon, almost paranormal in its existence.

669
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,540
That's why we bring up the concept of cosmic censorship.

670
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,320
There's more in control here.

671
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,320
There's also some people that do discuss, you know, they'll typically say, oh, there's an

672
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,340
evil force controlling the world.

673
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:03,480
I don't know what it is, but there's something bad.

674
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,880
Well, how about starting discussing these things?

675
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,460
Yes, there's going to be a time for it.

676
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,740
But not this time.

677
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:19,620
You know, we can actually what can be brought up is that what's called as how many times

678
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:23,900
have you heard, you know, man, we're going to ascend to the next dimension and all this

679
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,360
really I don't even want to reference all the dumb shit that's out there.

680
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:31,960
But basically, your existence is very sure and very clear and very simple.

681
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:37,320
You have all things that are perceptible and all things that are unperceptible, meaning

682
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,360
things that you see, touch, feel, can ponder.

683
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:45,540
And then you have the things that you can't see, touch, feel or imponderable doesn't mean

684
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:46,360
they don't exist.

685
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:53,680
And just like any information about anything, if you decide that it's bunk, don't look at

686
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,300
it. You can criticize it and you can call it stuff, whatever.

687
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:01,460
But if the information is looked at, let's say, can it be validated?

688
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,400
Is it memorialized to some degree of importance?

689
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:06,220
In other words, it's preserved.

690
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,240
And that was from a long time ago regarding certain matters.

691
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,880
Let's say the matters here would be the things that are imponderable, unseen or

692
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:20,880
imperceptible. If we start looking at these things, we get a chock full of information,

693
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,980
albeit not written in the way that you're willing to accept it.

694
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,400
Because, for example, when you look at timekeeping, you will not see the Pope's work

695
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,920
schedule or the Gregorian calendar on there or anything.

696
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,380
Right. And there's no such thing as, well, these people keep time this way and these

697
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,140
people keep time that way.

698
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:41,660
It does. That has nothing to do with keeping time that has to do with the work schedule

699
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:44,340
or some kind of cultural functioning calendar.

700
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,140
But lawful time is reckoned by the sun and the moon and the stars.

701
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:57,740
Right. So there's many, many things that need to be overcome to understand what's

702
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,820
been memorialized through from ancient days till now.

703
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:08,140
So. And that time is coming, it's not now, it will be more prevalent in the future.

704
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,900
But you're being set up for it.

705
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:16,000
I think Seth, you and I were discussing this years ago on how humanity will be set up

706
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,400
to have more of a spiritual mindset or a mind mindset.

707
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,560
Right. Same thing about considering the realm of the gods.

708
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:27,800
Most of the information that will be discussed, of course, will be inaccurate.

709
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,320
And I'm saying, of course, facetiously and also being accurately accurate.

710
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:41,960
You know, they will not have any accuracy, very little or precision or being true to

711
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,120
what's been memorialized.

712
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:47,880
But their minds will be leaning towards that direction increasingly as time goes on.

713
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:50,120
Also to other things as time goes on.

714
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:54,340
But certain things will not be understood until in this society at all.

715
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:59,280
And one of the things that we mentioned is the money system will not be understood.

716
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,780
It will change when people will just decide not to use it anymore.

717
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,440
And this is a time that's coming in the future, not now.

718
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:16,460
So I guess these things can be considered uncommon, but always referring back to

719
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,460
things that people can commonly access.

720
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,620
Any other comments we have, Seth?

721
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:31,760
Well, the guy in chat still commenting on the Flat Earth book.

722
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,600
Oh, it's fine.

723
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:41,660
And I'd ask them to be specific because we can address something specific, but that's

724
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,380
just not the case.

725
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:47,140
Yeah, there's an interesting thing regarding the Flat Earth thing.

726
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,300
You know, people brought it up, by the way, and I've also asked what I think of it.

727
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,320
And I'm like, that's really funny.

728
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,240
I'm like, how old are you?

729
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,800
I'm like, what do you mean, how old I am?

730
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:54,660
And they give me their age.

731
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,360
And I'm like, you just so you've been on this planet all these years.

732
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,020
And all of a sudden, this idea of it being flat came to you.

733
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,440
I doubt it.

734
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,040
You're just falling for Gustave Le Bon's the crowd mentality.

735
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,300
You're part of the crowd.

736
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:10,200
It's an interesting phenomenon.

737
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:18,040
Recently, within the last year or so, I've seen a lot of, I haven't actually watched,

738
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:22,180
but I've seen a lot of things commenting on Flat Earth.

739
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:23,180
It's a dummy load.

740
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,240
Yeah, it's a dummy load.

741
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:26,500
It's a hamster wheel.

742
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,360
People have a lot of energy.

743
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:34,460
All the way to the point where a soccer mom's minivan turns over and she could lift the van.

744
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,320
Where did you find that energy?

745
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,080
So let's find some more energy for the next hour.

746
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:42,660
All right.

747
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,160
We'll be right back.

748
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:48,820
You're listening to Uncommon Sense here on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

749
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:55,280
Welcome back to Uncommon Radio, Uncommon Sense here on AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

750
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,300
Which is Uncommon Radio.

751
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:59,380
Yes. At least for these two hours.

752
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:06,920
Yeah, you can find us at UncommonRadio.com, which is like a calling card, I suppose, contact

753
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:11,040
information and whatnot, possibility of archives and things like that as well.

754
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,060
So, yeah, welcome back.

755
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,680
Yeah, we're back.

756
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:20,740
We just finished off saying we're not going to discuss the Flat Earth, but it is one of

757
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:25,180
those things like, do you remember, if you know anyone old enough, going through photo

758
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:30,060
albums and they were, let's say, already adolescent or adult in the 70s and they had

759
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,820
polyester bell bottoms with big lapels and all that.

760
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:33,720
Remember those days?

761
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,100
Or you might not remember them, but you've remembered the fashion.

762
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:42,420
And they thought they were so cool going out and buying a Kiana nylon shirt.

763
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,740
And now it's like, oh, no, that's so that's so hideous.

764
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,980
Put that away, you know.

765
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:53,360
So there's very often when I in public hear people discussing things that are in vogue.

766
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,740
I say, well, do you remember polyester bell bottoms?

767
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,800
You're like, what does that have to do with it?

768
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,340
I say, well, you'll figure it out.

769
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:06,820
Anyway, it's one of those things, the thing that all of these questions that do come up

770
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:14,660
regarding things that are in vogue or fashionable to discuss or whatever, the answer

771
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,860
perhaps might be, where's the mastery in that?

772
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,680
Any subject, any concept?

773
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,600
Is there a mastery?

774
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:29,100
Like regarding the earth and the sun and all that, there is no mastery in being told, for

775
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:31,160
example, that the earth goes around the sun.

776
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,660
That doesn't help anyone in anything.

777
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:39,700
What helps a surface dwelling earth inhabitant is a very good comprehension all the way to

778
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:46,080
the mastering of these movements as they refer to you, meaning existing on this planet,

779
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:52,820
meaning mastering that the sun rises in the east and the sun sets in the west.

780
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,220
So that gives the appearance that the earth is in the middle of it.

781
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,120
And why is that important?

782
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,040
Because there's something called orientation with buildings and houses.

783
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,900
You know, someone likes to sleep in late.

784
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:06,880
You don't want to orientate the windows of that house towards the east.

785
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:11,860
Or if you're planting crops, you want to plant them in a certain way that they get even

786
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:17,020
light so certain parts of the crop don't get just the warm afternoon sun.

787
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:24,520
You know, you see, so, yeah, so you're looking for mastery within the subject matter,

788
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:27,240
but not the way the subject is being discussed.

789
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,680
And this is regarding anything.

790
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:33,640
It also comes up with the religious aspects, for example, with regarding what's called

791
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:38,900
Christianity. Some people say, oh, no, I used to be Catholic, but now I'm Mormon or now

792
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:42,300
I'm Quaker or now I'm Protestant or Luther was better.

793
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,320
I'm like, oh, boy, they all miss the point.

794
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,040
They all miss the point.

795
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,440
None of that stuff is based on anything.

796
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:53,320
Again, you see, it's not so the problem is there is no problem.

797
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:59,620
The problem is that the subject is not being dealt with from a mastership perspective.

798
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:03,980
In other words, let's first exhaust what's been memorialized on the subject and stop

799
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:08,220
just looking at what has emerged in the last five minutes or five months about the

800
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,100
subject. Right.

801
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:13,200
And this is something that humanity in wholesale lacks.

802
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:19,020
I think, again, bringing it up, I'm not promoting the book, but it's Gustav Le Bon in

803
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,680
the crowd talks about it.

804
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,120
There is a certain crowd mentality.

805
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:30,200
And in order to have the crowd form, what's common about them is that the crowd forms

806
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:34,520
under a subject idea or subject matter, let's say.

807
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:39,680
And in order for those participating in the crowd to accept it and come together under

808
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:44,860
it, the idea has to be so simplified that it no longer represents its original form.

809
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:47,920
That's why Le Bon refers to them as imbeciles.

810
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:54,480
Typically, you will find these crowds still forming there, especially in the alternative

811
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:01,340
media. Well, I should say in the mainstream as well, very much in all sorts of causes

812
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:02,900
or subjects.

813
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:08,980
And if you actually look at the heart of the matter, you will see there's not much

814
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:11,980
there other than the way things are being discussed.

815
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,980
But what is being discussed is no longer being discussed.

816
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,640
It's the way it's being discussed.

817
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,800
So it's very interesting.

818
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,880
Again, so all right, so let's be uncommon.

819
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,980
All right. So we're here on the second hour.

820
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:33,240
And by the way, I just want to interject something that I've gotten a lot of positive

821
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:38,880
feedback regarding the cooking tips, you know, rice and starches and various other

822
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,800
things past couple of weeks.

823
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:45,140
So I just want to thank the four people and actually another four or five maybe that

824
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:50,860
have gotten back regarding having good success regarding making perfect rice or nearly

825
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:53,920
perfect rice I've heard and various other things.

826
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:56,640
So you're welcome.

827
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:00,480
And yeah, let me add my own voice to that as well.

828
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:08,780
Thank you. I've the wife and I've made rice several times actually in the last week

829
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,540
it's yeah, it's the outcome was it's perfect.

830
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:14,680
It's good stuff. Yeah.

831
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:19,100
Used it for a few different dishes as well.

832
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:23,740
It's just it's very, you know, tasted it after just cooking it.

833
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:29,280
So it's just plain, you know, long grain rice, no no flavoring or anything to it.

834
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:32,940
And it's the flavor of the rice itself is really good.

835
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:38,500
So right. And it would be the rinsing and the cooking with a tight lid and letting it

836
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,440
rest and fluffing and you had a good sheen and a good flavor on the rice.

837
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,480
Good. Absolutely.

838
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:47,040
So, yeah, there's much more to do on things like that.

839
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:54,560
And I have one personally that I think we could go through this program or this

840
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:58,400
broadcast relatively quickly that might be a benefit.

841
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:04,020
It's I make we talked about it in passing a little bit, but I thought maybe we could

842
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:08,200
walk through it like we walked through the rice for the benefit of anyone listening.

843
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,560
And that's just a simple, quick flatbread.

844
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,240
Hmm. Yeah. Well, why don't you go through it?

845
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:20,820
You know, I would, but I don't measure anything.

846
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,500
I've done it so much that I just kind of work with the materials that I have at hand.

847
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:30,440
And if it's not the right consistency, I'll add a little bit of water or a little bit

848
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:31,860
more flour or something like that.

849
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:37,940
So I don't have I mean, I can I can walk through the process of how I did it.

850
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:42,400
You know, the evening before or yesterday, actually.

851
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:45,580
Yeah, go ahead. No measuring is fine as long.

852
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,020
See, the reason we bring up the measurement for the rice is because it's extremely

853
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:53,700
simple. Well, for example, just, you know, whatever volume you measure out of dry rice

854
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,300
would be equal volume of your liquid.

855
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:02,560
And it's simple because you typically would use something to, you know, scoop the rice

856
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:03,660
or measure the rice.

857
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:07,040
Typically, you know, I've actually done it for so long.

858
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,720
Believe it or not, I don't even I just pour the rice out and do it visually.

859
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:17,100
And just when the liquid covers about a four fingers depth over the rice, I've pretty

860
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,240
much got equal volume.

861
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:23,280
And that's how pretty much I reckon we're going to discuss things with the flatbreader

862
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,380
if there's no measurement, right?

863
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,120
Yeah, it's a it's a visual, intuitive thing.

864
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,520
But essentially, do you want you want to give it a shot or you want me to jump into it

865
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,900
real quick? It's up to you.

866
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,860
I can give it a shot and then go for it.

867
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,700
Like I said, it's relatively quick.

868
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:44,020
Essentially, you're going to start out with your flour, whatever flour it is, you can

869
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:46,060
find unbleached stuff relatively easily.

870
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,060
I'd recommend that because who wants bleach in their flour?

871
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:55,820
But so take your flour and I like to do it with an egg.

872
01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:03,140
I've done it without, but egg adds a little bit of good flavor to it.

873
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:08,700
So and butter or is what I used last night, like I said, I'm just kind of going to walk

874
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,520
through how I did it last night because it came out really well.

875
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:19,940
And you mix a little bit of salt, mix in with the flour, you know, to your own taste, I

876
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:23,840
guess. I don't like predominantly salty bread, so I just add a little bit of salt.

877
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,540
And by the way, Seth, I like throwing in very, very coarse rock salt.

878
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:32,860
So it's so if you occasionally you'll get a bite of it.

879
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:36,160
But anyway, go ahead. Yeah, it's just really flavorful.

880
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,460
So go ahead. Yeah.

881
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:45,660
And the I use just salt that doesn't have anything added to it.

882
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:54,320
No additives. It's relatively inexpensive, which is always a concern of mine, I

883
01:02:54,320 --> 01:03:02,600
suppose. But so I mix the salt in with the flour and then mix the butter in, you know,

884
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,640
not melted, just mix it in by hand.

885
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,820
I'm doing this all by hand on a clean countertop.

886
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:09,740
Mix that up a little bit.

887
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:12,120
It makes it easier for the butter to mix in.

888
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:18,080
And then you could break up the butter by squishing it between the fingers, let's say

889
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,620
while you're doing it. Yeah.

890
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:23,000
Yeah. And if you do that in the flour, it makes it break up really well.

891
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:29,660
And then add add your egg, just crack your egg on the counter and drop it in there.

892
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,040
Not the shell, obviously.

893
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:38,420
And then I mixed all that up with my fingers right there on the countertop and had a cup

894
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:42,240
just I did measure the water, but I didn't use all of it.

895
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:46,360
I just had a cup of warm water sitting on the counter.

896
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:48,060
Slowly add the water.

897
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:49,920
Uh huh. Yeah, exactly.

898
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:55,800
And add the water slowly, kind of keeping a circle or a ring of flour around where you're

899
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,800
working. So you can add a little bit more in and it kind of will help it keep from

900
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,840
spilling out if you accidentally add too much.

901
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,600
And then you just start working.

902
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:11,380
I work the egg in to the flour and made it almost like a dough like that before I

903
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:15,200
started adding the water and then, you know, add a little bit of water.

904
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,640
You can add a little bit of sugar if you like.

905
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:22,860
But I didn't, you know, I didn't add any yesterday was just flour, water, butter and an

906
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:24,340
egg, a little bit of salt.

907
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:28,460
And then instead of baking it, I just turned a skillet on low heat.

908
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:35,600
I have an electric stove that we use and, you know, a thick bottom skillet and brought

909
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,780
that up to temperature low heat.

910
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:38,300
Didn't put anything in the skillet at all.

911
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,340
No, no butter or anything to keep it from sticking.

912
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:42,300
It's just stainless steel.

913
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:46,420
And rolled the I have an empty Merlot bottle.

914
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,900
Well, it's not empty. It's full of water, actually, that I use as a rolling pin.

915
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:58,240
And I, you know, mix the the dough up between my fingers, add a little bit of water as it

916
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:01,080
was necessary or a little bit of flour till it comes out like a dough.

917
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,900
You're familiar with what dough feels like.

918
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,080
That's kind of what you're going after.

919
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:10,520
Then you however much you're making, you twist a little bit off, you know, make a ball

920
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:16,720
with it in your hands, set it on some loosely spread out flour on the countertop and then

921
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:22,920
roll it out flat with a rolling pin or an empty bottle of repurposed bottle of wine, I

922
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:28,300
suppose. And then take it off the counter, stick it on the skillet.

923
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:34,040
Medium to low heat is better, actually.

924
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:36,400
If you're using electric skillet, low is still pretty hot.

925
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:43,320
And then you throw it on the skillet and cover it, put a lid over it and let it cook for

926
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:47,880
maybe a minute, a little bit less or a little bit more, depending upon the stove,

927
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:53,740
probably, and the skillet till it starts to you see the you see it bubble just slightly.

928
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:56,600
Then I was just reached in there and flipping it.

929
01:05:56,660 --> 01:06:01,880
My hands were covered in flour, but you can flip it, you know, with tongs or a spatula if

930
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:04,860
you like, and then let it do that on the other side.

931
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:11,160
It'll brown just slightly and, you know, it's ready when you see that basically you're

932
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:15,380
just heating it up until the water is slightly cooked out of the dough and it changes

933
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:17,120
color a little bit and goes a little bit.

934
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:25,420
If you're using, you know, white flour, it'll turn white instead of kind of an off

935
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:28,840
white yellowish color as it's not golden brown where it bubbles up.

936
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:33,880
And essentially it's like making a pancake, but less time and it's more durable.

937
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:34,620
Or a tortilla.

938
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:35,820
Yeah, or tortilla.

939
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,880
Yeah. Another way to do it is the whole thing that, Seth, I'm glad you mentioned doing

940
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,920
it on the stove top uses very little energy, right?

941
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:55,080
You what when I'm in an area where I have limited cooking abilities, let's say

942
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:59,000
visiting someone's house, I would do I would start off with the skillet on the

943
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:06,140
stove top, flip it and then or not flip it so that the side on the pan is flat and

944
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:10,700
where the bubbles are, then I immediately turn on the oven on broil and just put it

945
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:14,040
in the broiler section with the door open for about 30 seconds or so.

946
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:15,980
That's another way to do it.

947
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:18,300
But yeah, that's pretty much how it's done.

948
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:23,900
And the I believe the suggestion for a rolling pin is just that anything that rolls.

949
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:26,880
Yeah. Will will act really well.

950
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:31,400
I think we discussed this a while back, even if you don't roll it out with a wine bottle.

951
01:07:33,830 --> 01:07:35,050
That's right. You could you could.

952
01:07:35,370 --> 01:07:37,350
Yeah. And the thing is, the thinner the better.

953
01:07:37,730 --> 01:07:40,590
You don't want to make it so thin where you know it's too thin.

954
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:44,930
If it becomes translucent, you see the counter or the space below it.

955
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:47,690
But it's the thinner, the better to some extent.

956
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:49,810
You might want it slightly thicker for a different thing.

957
01:07:49,890 --> 01:07:54,190
And again, what this does is there's nothing like fresh bread, right?

958
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:56,570
Nothing like fresh baked bread.

959
01:07:56,570 --> 01:08:02,450
Now, in this case, you're not going through the complexity of using a leavening agent or something

960
01:08:02,450 --> 01:08:06,710
like a yeast and using a lot of energy like firing up an oven.

961
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:11,770
But you are going to get the effect of a fresh flatbread, unleavened flat cake bread.

962
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:14,290
Let's say we will leave the cake out.

963
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:20,029
Most Western places, cake is a pastry, but a flatbread, which is a wonderful starch,

964
01:08:20,109 --> 01:08:22,590
which would substitute a starch in any meal.

965
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:25,970
Right. And actually, in your case, you mentioned that you use it sometimes

966
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:28,990
as a tortilla. You can wrap things in it as well, right?

967
01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:35,250
Yeah. Yeah. And I would second you certainly on the for that particular method.

968
01:08:35,390 --> 01:08:40,710
If you're actually going to do that, the thinner the better, because if you especially cooking

969
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:46,029
it on the stovetop like I did, where you're bringing it up to temperature very quickly,

970
01:08:47,210 --> 01:08:53,029
you want to have it thin so that it cooks consistently all the way through.

971
01:08:53,029 --> 01:08:57,729
And if you roll it out, fold it over twice and then roll it out again, it will it will

972
01:08:57,729 --> 01:09:02,930
puff up a little bit more kind of if that's what you're looking for.

973
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:04,689
And then we used it.

974
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:06,569
I made hummus as well.

975
01:09:07,069 --> 01:09:08,910
And that was that was dinner last night.

976
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:10,130
And it was it was splendid.

977
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:11,470
It's wonderful. Excellent.

978
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:17,890
Yeah. And the thing is, we're stressing here is the quality aspect for as long as anyone

979
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:23,890
can remember through historically flour products were intended to be,

980
01:09:25,149 --> 01:09:27,830
I guess, assembled and used immediately.

981
01:09:28,290 --> 01:09:29,310
Right. Like daily bread.

982
01:09:29,430 --> 01:09:32,010
Right. Like again, I'm in shock.

983
01:09:32,109 --> 01:09:36,310
You know, I go to the to the shops and I see there's bread on the shelf that's supposed to be

984
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:40,670
there for a week or so, you know, and I'm like, wow, you know, typically anything that was

985
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:44,069
baked that was held over to the next day was heavily discounted.

986
01:09:44,069 --> 01:09:48,450
And, you know, the today's fresh batch was procured typically.

987
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:53,670
Right. So what this is, the reason I think not necessarily stressing the flatbread, but

988
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:59,790
what what we're trying to say here indirectly is that when you're looking for a flour

989
01:09:59,790 --> 01:10:03,990
type bread product, right, it should be as fresh as possible.

990
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:07,970
And it doesn't get any fresher than making it yourself on the spot.

991
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:10,490
And there's something about the experience.

992
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:14,250
I mean, it's the smell, the taste, the whole thing.

993
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:16,610
It's just a wonderful attribute.

994
01:10:16,790 --> 01:10:18,130
And it's a starch, basically.

995
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:23,810
So if you're having a meal and you're thinking of making rice or potato or starch to go

996
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:29,630
with that meal, consider a flatbread and you will if you want to enjoy a flour based

997
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:32,790
product. And it could be even a more of a whole flour.

998
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:38,390
You can experiment with it or do 50-50, you know, a refined flour and a whole flour.

999
01:10:38,910 --> 01:10:46,910
And it's a very, I would say, Seth, you know, if if I'm preparing a meal and I would

1000
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:54,230
like a bread to go with it, if I make a flatbread, that goes over way better than going

1001
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:56,570
to the store, let's say, and buying a flatbread.

1002
01:10:56,750 --> 01:11:00,650
Right. It's always a much better quality to do it yourself.

1003
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:02,810
And it's much more pleasurable to your senses.

1004
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:09,010
Yeah, yeah, it takes a little bit more time and there's a little bit of mess and clean

1005
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:13,070
clean up involved, but it's you can do a whole bunch of it at once.

1006
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:15,370
It'll keep a day or two relatively well.

1007
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,010
I would not keep it any longer than that.

1008
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:19,310
It doesn't have anything in it to preserve it.

1009
01:11:19,390 --> 01:11:22,450
You could freeze it, you know, you could freeze it for a couple of months if you wanted

1010
01:11:22,450 --> 01:11:25,690
to. You can refrigerate it for a few days.

1011
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:31,510
I would leave it more than like, you know, three, three or four.

1012
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:34,970
But it's it's good.

1013
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:37,710
It's versatile. You can use it with anything and you can flavor it to taste.

1014
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:40,270
You can throw herbs and spices in the dough if you want.

1015
01:11:40,850 --> 01:11:44,950
Or, you know, like I said, sugary, throw cinnamon and sugar in it.

1016
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:48,230
Sesame seeds. Yeah, anything at all.

1017
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:51,890
And well, with it within reason, I guess.

1018
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:54,630
But yeah, it's quick.

1019
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:57,250
It's easy. It's it's inexpensive.

1020
01:11:57,930 --> 01:12:02,610
And if you have someone helping you, it's it's a lot easier on the cleanup, too.

1021
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:06,270
So yeah, but yeah, good stuff.

1022
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:07,530
Food prep. Yeah, yeah.

1023
01:12:07,530 --> 01:12:13,030
An hour, an hour per meal, like a like a like a large meal, which would be, I guess, in some

1024
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:15,670
places late afternoon, you know, your main meal.

1025
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:22,210
It's not unusual to spend an hour to prepare or at least a minimum of a half an hour to

1026
01:12:22,210 --> 01:12:27,190
prepare. This is not anything required, but typically half an hour to an hour.

1027
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,790
To allocate for the main meal of the day is totally fine.

1028
01:12:31,830 --> 01:12:35,570
And it's amazing how humanity, well, not all of humanity, but generally the Western

1029
01:12:35,570 --> 01:12:39,290
culture has gravitated away from that food prep time.

1030
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:41,030
Yeah, absolutely.

1031
01:12:41,350 --> 01:12:42,710
Quick, convenient, right?

1032
01:12:43,330 --> 01:12:43,830
Convenience.

1033
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:45,290
To what end? Yeah.

1034
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:46,630
To what end is that convenience?

1035
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:53,450
Well, I'd say it was about 45 minutes from when we started with on the bread to when

1036
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:55,130
we were, you know, eating.

1037
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:57,890
The hummus doesn't take much time at all.

1038
01:12:57,970 --> 01:13:03,070
That's just adding some ingredients to a blender and then blending it till it's desired

1039
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:04,110
consistency, essentially.

1040
01:13:04,990 --> 01:13:07,870
But a bean paste, basically Middle Eastern style.

1041
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:10,230
Yeah, bean, Middle Eastern bean dip, essentially.

1042
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:10,870
Bean dip.

1043
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:12,390
Yeah, it's interesting.

1044
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:17,130
Most cultures do have some kind of a bean paste, bean dip, like, for example, in Asia,

1045
01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:24,430
there's a dookie bean or red bean, small red variety is sweetened and it's made in a cake.

1046
01:13:24,430 --> 01:13:29,610
It's a filler where that type of filling would be more of a fruit filling or cream

1047
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:31,070
filling in Western countries.

1048
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:36,750
In Asian countries, a sweet filling for a pastry would be a bean, believe it or not.

1049
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:39,210
So a bean paste, red bean cake.

1050
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:45,250
If you ever go to a Chinatown type place or Asian market and you see anything packaged

1051
01:13:45,250 --> 01:13:49,490
and says red bean cake, it's a sweet filling.

1052
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:55,530
Yeah, this is another interesting way to look at various things.

1053
01:13:55,650 --> 01:14:00,550
Again, consider these things, by the way, when you're trying to pursue some kind of

1054
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:05,390
cross-latitude way of eating or eating seasonally.

1055
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:10,690
The thing is to have variety, folks.

1056
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:13,330
When you have variety, there's health in that.

1057
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:19,070
So, you know, there's something to be said about variety.

1058
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:25,190
And, you know, again, you will get variety when you eat seasonally, you will get variety

1059
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:30,670
when you pretty much cook things or prepare food for yourself because you will just gravitate

1060
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:32,850
towards making things different every time.

1061
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:35,370
So these are things to consider.

1062
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:40,490
And not to be misconstrued here, this food stuff, by the way, this is another form of

1063
01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:43,210
what I call bioterrorism that's been put on society.

1064
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:47,630
Many people have been discussing, oh, yeah, food and health, you know, it goes together.

1065
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:49,010
Well, yes, it does go together.

1066
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:50,290
It's very important, obviously.

1067
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:53,250
And we're not flipping around here and saying that it's not important.

1068
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:58,330
But usually when Seth and I are, I guess I could speak for you on this to a certain degree,

1069
01:14:58,450 --> 01:14:59,550
Seth, let me know if I shouldn't.

1070
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:04,210
When we're discussing food preparation is just to enjoy a quality meal.

1071
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:10,310
It's the quality of the meal and health stuff aside for a moment because most of the

1072
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:13,390
comments that I do get a lot is regarding health and food.

1073
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:16,310
And it's just too much of an emphasis on that.

1074
01:15:16,410 --> 01:15:18,070
And yes, it should be emphasized.

1075
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:22,770
But when we have food discussions, it is how to obtain the highest quality and the highest

1076
01:15:22,770 --> 01:15:25,230
level of enjoyment from what you're doing.

1077
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:26,830
Are you with me on that?

1078
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:29,570
Yeah, absolutely.

1079
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:32,930
It's that.

1080
01:15:33,230 --> 01:15:36,210
And like I said, it's really inexpensive.

1081
01:15:36,990 --> 01:15:48,470
Yeah, it's those things with the, you know, it's yeah, you know, even though money doesn't

1082
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:52,510
exist currently in the system that we're in, things are still expensive.

1083
01:15:53,090 --> 01:16:00,070
And if you're going to exist in the society and, you know, just to interact with it, you

1084
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:02,970
need you need credits.

1085
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:09,990
And bread and rice are two things that are inexpensive, easily available, you know, everywhere.

1086
01:16:12,050 --> 01:16:19,090
It's just I've listened to a lot of programs talking about these very exotic and difficult

1087
01:16:19,090 --> 01:16:25,190
to acquire or expensive or very exclusive, like helpful products and things like that.

1088
01:16:25,190 --> 01:16:32,930
And in order to consume things that are not consumed, but in order to eat, you know, good

1089
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:38,010
food intake, it doesn't have to be expensive or difficult to to do.

1090
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:42,870
It's just the very simple things have kind of been left out of a lot of stuff.

1091
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:44,010
So it's uncommon.

1092
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:49,590
And so, yeah, everyone has access or nearly everyone, you know, statistically everyone

1093
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:52,350
has access to rice and flour.

1094
01:16:52,350 --> 01:17:00,770
So now, you know, at least a couple of methods to prepare very basic things inexpensively,

1095
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:08,250
easily, relatively quickly and to an end because you can use the rice, you know, in just about

1096
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:10,870
anything, just like you can use the flatbread, which is about anything.

1097
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:17,210
You know, you make a sweet dish, you make a dessert, you can make a hearty meal.

1098
01:17:17,210 --> 01:17:23,010
I've done a very similar recipe to that in a waffle iron and added, you know, a good

1099
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:32,250
quantity of oats and just cooked essentially the flatbread with oats in there to make a

1100
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:37,010
little bit heartier oil instead of butter, although I do use the butter to keep it from

1101
01:17:37,010 --> 01:17:37,310
sticking.

1102
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:45,970
But, you know, so there's just it's easy, it's useful, it's good and it's uncommon.

1103
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:47,290
So there you have it.

1104
01:17:49,650 --> 01:17:50,190
Yeah, okay.

1105
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:52,870
Someone just commented, yeah, we're becoming a food show.

1106
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:53,750
That's I like that.

1107
01:17:55,290 --> 01:18:00,630
In essence, that's something that we enjoy, Seth and I do, and we're not going to put it

1108
01:18:00,630 --> 01:18:01,990
on the listenership anymore.

1109
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:06,210
There's just, well, it might come up, but it might come up again.

1110
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:11,610
But either way, yeah, the thing is, though, also the quality over quantity.

1111
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:14,050
This is regarding all things, for example.

1112
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:21,370
You know, we were discussing earlier, just to jump off the topic for a moment, I tend

1113
01:18:21,370 --> 01:18:26,030
to sound kind of ranty when I discuss the various societies.

1114
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:31,150
But essentially, when you objectify, when I say various societies, medical, scientific,

1115
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:38,950
religious, so on and so forth, these little specialist groups, because they've debased

1116
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:44,790
themselves, they go into the realm real simplified over maybe oversimplified for some, but it's

1117
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:45,890
quite objective.

1118
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:48,310
They've gone into the realm of being pranksters.

1119
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:53,310
And when you mention things being expensive, what ran through the mind is, yes, you know,

1120
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:54,490
it's a credit based economy.

1121
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:57,270
So what's interesting right now, there is a balance.

1122
01:18:57,450 --> 01:19:02,410
I wouldn't say perfect balance, but there is a balance that maintains order with the

1123
01:19:02,410 --> 01:19:08,930
surface inhabitants of this planet, that the balance is such you have a population on the

1124
01:19:08,930 --> 01:19:13,010
planet right now that is pretty greedy and pretty gluttonous.

1125
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:21,370
And they are being ruled and overruled, let's say, or controlled by other entitled societies

1126
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:24,010
that are pranking, that are pranksters.

1127
01:19:24,770 --> 01:19:29,590
You might want to consider the legal society.

1128
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:35,790
OK, they are pretty much what most people will interact with when it comes to what they

1129
01:19:35,790 --> 01:19:36,510
think is law.

1130
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:41,790
And they are the ones that actually procure the penalties that motivate the people to

1131
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:42,570
stay in order.

1132
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:47,970
But if you actually look at what the legal society is supposed to be based on in their

1133
01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:52,270
own writings, what they have memorialized and how they're supposed to function, they're

1134
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:55,610
not doing any of it, very little, if not any of it.

1135
01:19:56,210 --> 01:20:01,190
So that would put them clearly, the legal society, all of them, legal society would

1136
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:04,250
be law enforcement, attorneys, judges, all the way up, legislature, all that.

1137
01:20:05,330 --> 01:20:08,610
They would be in the category of a prankster, right?

1138
01:20:10,030 --> 01:20:14,530
Now, this is which is interesting, because the reason I bring them up is because of them

1139
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:18,050
being the legal society is because they're the ones that procure the penalty, which is

1140
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:23,390
what motivates the order, because people are not motivated to do the right thing.

1141
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:31,730
They behave generally in a certain way or ways, because if they didn't, they would be

1142
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:32,750
penalized, right?

1143
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:36,970
So you have a society that's motivated by penalty.

1144
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:42,530
And this is, again, tied in pretty much directly with the legal society, which is not

1145
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:45,130
based on what they're supposed to be based on.

1146
01:20:45,310 --> 01:20:47,210
And this is in their own writings, right?

1147
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:52,250
So that means that the legal society, then, they're just pranking, right?

1148
01:20:52,490 --> 01:20:55,550
And this is, again, going across the medical community.

1149
01:20:55,550 --> 01:21:03,090
You know, I mean, it's very simple to see that if you look at what's called the human

1150
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:10,650
body, the state of affairs today regarding health and medicine is a very good testament

1151
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:12,950
to the robustness of the human body.

1152
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:20,250
If you look at the level of quality that the quote, unquote, scientific and medical society

1153
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:25,370
is inflicting, you know, their medicine, let's say, and techniques that are being inflicted

1154
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:31,730
upon the society as quote, unquote, health care, right, is a testament to how robust

1155
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:32,730
the human body is.

1156
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:34,110
You know, there was an interesting study.

1157
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:35,730
And by the way, they're pranksters also.

1158
01:21:37,450 --> 01:21:41,670
You know, so you can actually research the medical society and how they work.

1159
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:47,770
But there was an interesting study, by the way, regarding socialized medicine.

1160
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:51,190
The doctors are typically unionized.

1161
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:57,250
And when they go on strike, a lady did a study quite a few years ago, and she noticed

1162
01:21:57,250 --> 01:22:01,730
that when in countries where doctors had gone on strike, the morgues were empty.

1163
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:03,830
People stopped dying.

1164
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:08,760
I found that to be quite interesting or frightening statistic.

1165
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:15,240
And by the way, speaking of people dying, there's a lot of that being used in the media

1166
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,520
for sympathy calls.

1167
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:21,240
Yes, it's very sad when people die.

1168
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:25,820
But right now, the number, of course, is very conservative.

1169
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:32,560
But there's over 1,000 people per day directly killed by the medical establishment through

1170
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:33,740
sheer negligence.

1171
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:39,100
Another 1,000 by accident and another 1,000 from the pharmaceutical.

1172
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:46,000
So you have roughly 3,000 people per day in the U.S., what's called America, being

1173
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,880
outwardly, we use the M word, maybe not, killed by the medical society.

1174
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,480
That's almost a million a year.

1175
01:22:55,180 --> 01:23:00,820
And no one is, well, I shouldn't say no one, but where's the outrage?

1176
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:03,120
None at all.

1177
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:05,240
That's 1 million people a year, folks.

1178
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:06,500
And that's very conservative.

1179
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,580
The actual official number is three quarter of a million.

1180
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:13,520
And we know what official numbers are meant for.

1181
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:19,120
So right now, just to kind of recap on this thought, because

1182
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:26,680
basically, if we were to leave Earth right now and go and explain what's going on here

1183
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:30,240
somewhere else, we have to leave ourselves out of it and be objective.

1184
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:36,840
And essentially, all you have to do is say it's basically a society of greedy and gluttonous

1185
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:41,020
people ruled by small subgroups of pranksters.

1186
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:44,380
Now, why do I say people are greedy and gluttony?

1187
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:46,080
Not all of them, but the majority are.

1188
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:50,320
If they did understand how the money system worked and the legal system did what they

1189
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:57,060
were supposed to do, you wouldn't really be considering things as being expensive because

1190
01:23:57,060 --> 01:24:02,480
you would go to the store and buy your flour and butter and egg and you would sign the

1191
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:03,680
name that was given to you.

1192
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:06,120
That is an authorized signature behind the credit line.

1193
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,520
And you would take your stuff and walk out.

1194
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:09,960
That's it.

1195
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:14,200
And this would be the same with all of your utilities.

1196
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,740
If you need a car, if you need clothes, you need a house.

1197
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:20,040
All you got to do, sign the name.

1198
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:25,640
Typically, when I'm out in public and I see people set up stands to raise charities for

1199
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:29,920
different causes, and I stop and I say, OK, what are you doing?

1200
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:32,840
This is, oh, we're raising money for this and such and such group of people.

1201
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,660
And I'm like, are their hands broken?

1202
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:37,980
Why are you out here asking for notes?

1203
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:39,260
Are their hands broken?

1204
01:24:39,260 --> 01:24:40,720
What does that have to do with anything?

1205
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:42,140
So can't they sign?

1206
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:45,460
All they have to do is sign the name on a piece of paper.

1207
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:53,000
That's why, folks, that if you know any investment banksters, if they're driving down the road

1208
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:59,100
in their limousine, let's say in a limousine, and someone writes a name on a bubble gum

1209
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:04,200
wrapper and throws it on the ground, he promptly tells the chauffeur to stop, pulls over, picks

1210
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:09,920
up the bubble gum wrapper with the signature on it, and can use that as money.

1211
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,700
You can't, but they can.

1212
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:12,960
Why?

1213
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:14,300
Because they're pranksters.

1214
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,700
And this is a fact, and this is the truth about being on this planet right now.

1215
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,440
So this has to do with the religious societies as well.

1216
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:23,220
All of them, not some of them.

1217
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:29,620
Everyone in every religious society that is part of that society that administers any

1218
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:35,040
religion, whether it's a temple, a synagogue, or a church, is engaging in pranksterism.

1219
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,280
Yes, they are.

1220
01:25:36,860 --> 01:25:37,720
Sorry about that.

1221
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:38,660
You may not like that.

1222
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:43,580
Now, those that are being pranked, by the way, are very, very confused.

1223
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:52,600
And the best that they can do is attain a level of rationale that states, well, I'm

1224
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:56,920
doing it because everyone else is doing it, or we're doing it because this is how the

1225
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:00,220
system works, or, or, or.

1226
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,720
But never can address what's going on directly.

1227
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:07,540
And one of the things, since we brought up the religious society last, it's funny how

1228
01:26:07,540 --> 01:26:12,520
an alternative in mainstream media, or even in public, you will hear people professing

1229
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:18,400
a very strong religious faith, but they're extremely concerned about the politicians.

1230
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:24,380
Like the politicians are going to make things better or worse.

1231
01:26:24,380 --> 01:26:29,740
But yet they believe, oh, so they've abandoned their God for a politician.

1232
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:30,680
Very interesting.

1233
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:34,840
I just listen to these things, and I find it to be, again, shocking and appalling.

1234
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:40,700
But nonetheless, if you have a common type of reference and think commonly, you will

1235
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:44,420
find what's being said here shocking and appalling, if you understand it.

1236
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:47,100
That's the other thing I wanted to state.

1237
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:51,560
During the week, I get some people trying to communicate and saying, hey, here's a link.

1238
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,820
This guy's saying exactly what you're saying.

1239
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:58,600
And I, well, you know, I try to be courteous and I go and look at the link or whatever

1240
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:01,460
it is, and it has nothing to do with what I'm saying.

1241
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:06,260
So that pretty much tells me still a great majority of the people out there are not listening

1242
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:07,140
to what's being said.

1243
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:11,580
But nonetheless, we know we have got at least four or five listeners that do listen.

1244
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:17,540
So that's, that's something that might be worth doing an internet radio show or not.

1245
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,060
I don't know.

1246
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:23,120
I may not be very efficient, but would you think we have more than four or five listeners,

1247
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,100
Seth, at this point?

1248
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:27,440
Perhaps not.

1249
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:35,080
But nonetheless, this is the situation about being objective.

1250
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:38,020
And perhaps you're muted.

1251
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:38,400
Were you there?

1252
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:39,600
I was muted.

1253
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:43,740
Yeah, I believe that we have probably at least a handful.

1254
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:48,380
And that's and I don't need any reason to have the conversation.

1255
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:52,520
But having, you know, four or five people that would like to listen in to the conversation

1256
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:55,160
is motivation enough to broadcast it.

1257
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:57,560
So, yeah.

1258
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:00,480
Yeah, I think that's quite enough out of seven billion.

1259
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:01,460
That's pretty good number.

1260
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:02,620
Only four or five.

1261
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:07,040
That would put it in the point zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, one more zero, I think

1262
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:12,020
zero percent in terms of the quality, which is very good.

1263
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:16,360
I think it's a pretty good, pretty good odds for if there were four or five people that

1264
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:20,820
get it out of seven billion, that is actually quite a success, I believe.

1265
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:22,780
It's better than none.

1266
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,260
So that's the optimism.

1267
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:30,820
But nonetheless, folks, there's a lot of stuff going on that you will encounter, whether

1268
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:33,140
it's one form of media or another.

1269
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:36,700
And be sure to discern what you're listening to.

1270
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:40,000
Be sure to discern even what you're perceiving or thinking.

1271
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:45,700
And you will find that typically you have the two sides.

1272
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:54,120
You have, there's some authority or some subject matter that is supposed to be based

1273
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,800
on something, right?

1274
01:28:55,980 --> 01:29:02,180
And the authority would be either the host or the, depending on what society the subject

1275
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:06,360
matter might be attached to, you usually might get a professional or an expert in that society.

1276
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:15,680
Learn to discern what's being said and try to gravitate or even rush to see what is based

1277
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:21,700
on and if what they're telling you is actually based on what they're saying it is or if it

1278
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:24,240
even exists in the real world, right?

1279
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:31,020
That's why I pretty much say there is no economic commentator publicly right now that is saying

1280
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:34,780
anything worth a can of beans or actually shouldn't put down a can of beans.

1281
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:39,260
They're actually, I should say, how about all economic commentators at this point are

1282
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:40,140
coprofagos?

1283
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:48,860
Anyway, so at this point, because this is a very common thing to hear people concerned

1284
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:49,680
about the economy.

1285
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:55,340
There's another thing that's going on right now in the States regarding some kind of a

1286
01:29:55,340 --> 01:30:02,380
presidential election, which I'd never get into and don't want to get into because.

1287
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:03,480
Melodrama.

1288
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:06,980
Well, in order to be a president of what, right?

1289
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:09,020
And that what no longer exists.

1290
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:16,660
So the whole point is moot, but nonetheless, it's melodrama.

1291
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:23,960
This is a level of imbecilism or moronism or whatever you want to call it that is way

1292
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:27,320
below worth discussion at this point.

1293
01:30:27,820 --> 01:30:32,980
The leaders of the people, by the way, are always discussed, but the patron deity that's

1294
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:36,260
behind the country is never discussed, which is very interesting.

1295
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,180
And this is just the way things are done on Earth.

1296
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:40,400
It doesn't matter if you believe in it or not.

1297
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:44,740
If you do a little bit of research, you will find there is always a patron or matron deity

1298
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:45,680
behind a country.

1299
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:50,460
And there's a lot more going on to that, folks.

1300
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:52,320
And that's where you get your law from, by the way.

1301
01:30:52,640 --> 01:30:54,140
It's from your god.

1302
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:58,660
And if you look at the Western world, they've revived the goddess religion.

1303
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:03,280
Someone recently wanted to discuss justice and they're being very specific about it.

1304
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:07,660
And I said, well, first of all, before you start trying to comprehend what that means

1305
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:15,420
or what it is, the easiest way to comprehend it is to actually state that what you are

1306
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:21,280
talking about, justice, is nothing more, nothing less than one of the revived goddess religions.

1307
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:23,840
It's a revival of a goddess religion.

1308
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:30,240
So the question here would be then, why go into justice very deeply when you are not

1309
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:35,740
familiar with what goddess religions are based on or how they functioned in the past?

1310
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:43,160
So one of the things that I advise this individual is, instead of getting hung up on what justice

1311
01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:49,340
is and how it is indeed a goddess religion, is start researching the ancient goddess religions

1312
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:50,940
and how they operated.

1313
01:31:51,240 --> 01:31:55,320
And you will find out it was not positive for those that partook in it.

1314
01:31:56,160 --> 01:32:03,580
So these are, again, when you hear a certain subject, whether it's the shape of the earth

1315
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:09,300
or various societies or various matters, go and see what it's based on.

1316
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:14,360
And first of all, see, can it be rationalized within your practical experience?

1317
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:21,760
You know, that's why we like to poke fun and be sarcastic about what is caused, what is

1318
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:27,820
typically blamed on being the cause of the common cold or diseases in wintertime

1319
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:30,160
are these little critters.

1320
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:33,800
And we know that these little critters go dormant when it's cold.

1321
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:37,720
So how can they actually be the cause?

1322
01:32:37,940 --> 01:32:43,640
So it doesn't make these very simple way of looking at it, not oversimplifying,

1323
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:47,800
but simple and rational and objective.

1324
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:55,360
And this is how one might consider, not necessarily deal with the pranksters,

1325
01:32:55,420 --> 01:32:58,800
because you typically want to avoid the pranksters.

1326
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:04,800
Right. You know, all of these professionals, if you can, that's not advice,

1327
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:08,840
because most people feel kind of like you just pulled the rug from under their feet.

1328
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:15,460
But if you keep in the back of the head or the mind that all of these professionals,

1329
01:33:15,620 --> 01:33:19,980
all of them, bar none, are acting in a pranking capacity, whether they're religious society,

1330
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:25,740
legal society, scientific, medical, political society, on and on and on,

1331
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,180
they are acting on a prankster level.

1332
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:34,380
And it's very easy to see that they're pranking by just doing a little bit of cursory inquiry

1333
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:38,540
into what they're supposed to be doing from their own reference works.

1334
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:40,900
You will see that they have abandoned

1335
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:44,840
and are operating through some kind of custom that's accepted.

1336
01:33:46,820 --> 01:33:47,860
So, yeah.

1337
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:52,820

1347
01:34:35,660 --> 01:34:40,240
Now, one thing, by the way, we're still getting comments on doing a show on water.

1348
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:46,620
Now, what we've, I wouldn't say every time, but very often bring up the concept of water.

1349
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:51,980
And these are the two most important things, keep it in the dark and keep it cool.

1350
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:56,780
And yes, we will do a show on water, just have an organized one as it should be.

1351
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:03,580
But we tend to bring up several things repeatedly on the uncommon sense.

1352
01:35:04,220 --> 01:35:09,220
And maybe if we keep repeating that people should keep water cool and out of the light,

1353
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:14,600
if they actually start doing it and experiencing the increase in quality,

1354
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:21,160
then when a water show is done, there'll be even more to connect to

1355
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:22,920
because they've already had some practice.

1356
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:25,800
You see, that's one way of thinking of it.

1357
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:30,900
But the water show will be coming, Seth, soon hopefully.

1358
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:36,480
And also we're threatening a recap of all of the things that were discussed or most of the things

1359
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:41,620
and filling in some of the blanks on the previous sonic experience that was done on this

1360
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:44,380
radio station, let's say.

1361
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:52,480
So again, for those that have been requesting the water show, remember, keep it cool.

1362
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:57,640
39 degrees Fahrenheit or 4 degrees Celsius is optimum and keep it in the dark.

1363
01:35:57,820 --> 01:36:04,320
And again, facetiously and sarcastically to say that's why when you go to the shop to buy water,

1364
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:11,260
they always have it in a clear bottle in room temperature, which is contrary to what it should be.

1365
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:16,020
So what you will discover by keeping water in the dark

1366
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:19,820
and keeping it cool is that its quality will raise on its own.

1367
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:24,660
And then we will discuss, well, we've also discussed,

1368
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:28,720
the shape of the container is important as well.

1369
01:36:29,060 --> 01:36:37,580
Ovoid, meaning not square, even something that resembles what you'd find in nature.

1370
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:41,620
If you notice that all stagnant fluids or fluids that are not flowing in and out

1371
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:48,600
in all of nature take on this ovoid shape, meaning ovoid like egg type of shape,

1372
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:52,600
not extremely archetypal to the egg, let's say.

1373
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:54,400
Sometimes it's more elongated.

1374
01:36:54,520 --> 01:37:02,060
Sometimes it's more squat and flat and less egg-shaped, but nonetheless, typically egg-shaped,

1375
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:08,060
meaning spherical somewhat, not elliptical somewhat, but egg-shaped,

1376
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:11,380
meaning one end is slightly more curved than the other.

1377
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:14,640
Now, someone asked me why, why not an ellipse?

1378
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:17,760
Now, what's interesting is that when you have an egg shape,

1379
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:23,540
there is an internal reflection that creates an instability that promotes movement

1380
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:26,540
without putting energy into the system.

1381
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,800
And someone asked me to give an example of that.

1382
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:31,620
And I went through the three typical shapes.

1383
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:33,540
One would be the sphere.

1384
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:37,460
The other one would be the elliptoid, which would have more points,

1385
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:41,000
like a football, let's say, an American football, and then the egg shape.

1386
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:46,280
Now, when you have a sphere, the distance to the center is equal all around.

1387
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:53,280
And if there's any motion, it comes to rest very quickly, and you get stagnation.

1388
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:58,820
When you have something elliptoid, where the two ends are slightly at a point,

1389
01:37:58,820 --> 01:38:03,920
but are equal in geometric form, when there's any movement, yes,

1390
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:09,240
there's an unequal distance from the pointed ends to the center.

1391
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:11,540
So it will promote a little more movement.

1392
01:38:11,660 --> 01:38:14,420
But because the ends of the elliptoid shape are symmetrical,

1393
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:20,020
it will find stagnation again, and it will come to an end and a stop.

1394
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:23,460
But when you have an egg-shaped or ovoid shape,

1395
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:26,600
where one end is slightly pointier than the other,

1396
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:30,460
where there is a slight bit of movement,

1397
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:33,160
when it moves to the slightly pointier end,

1398
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:39,740
it will contract more than when it moves to the slightly less pointy end, let's say.

1399
01:38:39,860 --> 01:38:46,360
And the center of these two dissimilar curved ends are not equal.

1400
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:51,640
And because of that, when the fluid will move from one end to the other,

1401
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:54,660
not only are they dissimilar in shape,

1402
01:38:54,660 --> 01:38:57,360
but they're dissimilar in distance from the center,

1403
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:00,260
it promotes a consistent movement of the fluid.

1404
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:01,380
So there you go.

1405
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:04,120
There's a long-winded explanation why the ovoid shape.

1406
01:39:05,540 --> 01:39:09,600
There's a question here also, the material that it's made of.

1407
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:11,140
A material is interesting.

1408
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:13,760
Now, depending on what you're looking to do.

1409
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:18,140
Typically, avoid metal.

1410
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:21,860
If you're going to have metal, it should be a noble metal,

1411
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:24,640
silver, pewter, or semi-noble.

1412
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:29,260
Copper, perhaps, could be avoided because of oxidation.

1413
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:31,100
Glass is good.

1414
01:39:31,820 --> 01:39:32,720
Wood is good.

1415
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:33,840
Terracotta is good.

1416
01:39:34,060 --> 01:39:34,900
Porcelain is good.

1417
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:40,060
Polyethylene might be okay in plastic, polypropylene,

1418
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:45,520
but not polycarbonate and not chlorinated plastics like PVC.

1419
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:46,620
Those are to be avoided.

1420
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:50,940
I tend to avoid plastics if possible.

1421
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:55,080
So stone, glass, noble metals are fine.

1422
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:57,200
Glass would probably be the easiest.

1423
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:03,900
Now, the material does have an effect on the water on charging and discharging.

1424
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:05,020
Here's an example.

1425
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:10,540
You could take your mind and apply it to this example regarding water.

1426
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:15,260
If you have crops, for example, and there is a heat wave coming,

1427
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:17,140
and you know it might damage the crops,

1428
01:40:17,140 --> 01:40:23,520
the best way to inhibit some of that heat wave to the crop would be to spray

1429
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:29,900
water on the crop through a copper nozzle, perhaps copper and silver combination.

1430
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:34,320
That will tend to lend the water to have more of a cooling effect.

1431
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:38,600
Now, let's say you have a crop and there's going to be a freeze.

1432
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:44,340
You might want to spray the crop with water to prevent them from freezing

1433
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:46,580
with an iron nozzle.

1434
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,140
When you run water through something that has an iron nozzle,

1435
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:57,560
it will tend to give the water a quality of a warming effect, right?

1436
01:40:57,880 --> 01:40:59,260
Let's just think about that for a moment.

1437
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:03,720
And I've actually suggested this to people and it has worked both times.

1438
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:12,260
And if we're going to raise the quality of water and keep it stored cool and in the dark,

1439
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:19,560
I would suggest avoiding any type of ferrites-based material, including stainless steel,

1440
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:26,180
albeit it being chemically neutral or chemically viable to not oxidize, let's say,

1441
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:29,780
or they say stainless steel, you know, is a very good material for these reasons.

1442
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:33,600
It still is a ferrite-based material.

1443
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:35,880
And what's interesting about that,

1444
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,380
there's a big fad that started maybe two decades ago

1445
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:41,480
by people carrying little water bottles around.

1446
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:45,440
And then there was a big fad about having your own little personal water container.

1447
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:49,520
There were many of them that were made of stainless steel that people carry around.

1448
01:41:49,620 --> 01:41:54,900
And I've gotten many reports that they went to plastics because they noticed

1449
01:41:54,900 --> 01:42:01,580
that there was a bacteria or mold developing in the stainless steel that didn't on the plastics.

1450
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:04,520
And I told them why.

1451
01:42:04,600 --> 01:42:10,120
And they were kind of befuddled by it because it has nothing to do with it degrading or decomposing.

1452
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:15,440
It's the very presence of the iron that promotes that type of growth.

1453
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:18,620
So nonetheless, things to be considered.

1454
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:20,340
And these are very subtle.

1455
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:25,000
I would say, hmm, okay.

1456
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:30,180
Subtle meaning subtle, the effect and the outcome is not subtle,

1457
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:32,020
but the application might be subtle.

1458
01:42:32,540 --> 01:42:34,800
You see, there's a lot of discussion on water,

1459
01:42:34,820 --> 01:42:38,760
and it sounds very technical and very far out there about structuring water

1460
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:40,340
and all these other things.

1461
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:46,100
But I can assure the listenership that water is one of the least understood materials

1462
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:49,840
that man has ever interacted with, albeit one of the most significant.

1463
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:53,860
So I think we included a few more things this time.

1464
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:56,720
I think every time just including a little bit more about water

1465
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:59,680
so people that are interested can proceed.

1466
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:04,420
And by the way, there's nothing wrong with having interest.

1467
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:08,280
I do get some feedback, by the way, about a lot of the quackery that's out there.

1468
01:43:08,280 --> 01:43:09,680
Yes, I'm calling them quacks.

1469
01:43:09,820 --> 01:43:11,540
There's a lot of people discussing water.

1470
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:12,380
They've got...

1471
01:43:12,380 --> 01:43:15,180
I'm not going to give specifics or names or what's irrelevant,

1472
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:19,460
because, again, if water is going to be discussed,

1473
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,760
I've heard and been sent links to YouTubes and other things

1474
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:28,800
about hours and hours of people discussing this type of fantastic water.

1475
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:34,300
And not once, not once, do most of them ever state it should be kept cool and in the dark.

1476
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:38,820
Right away, there's an agenda in there that I find extremely distasteful.

1477
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:42,900
So because they're missing the most basics.

1478
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:46,260
So if you've missed the most basics, the rest of it is just quackery.

1479
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:48,040
And sorry, folks.

1480
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:55,320
We tend to be polite and kind, but sometimes using the term like quackery

1481
01:43:55,320 --> 01:43:58,820
or moron or imbecile is too accurate to not use.

1482
01:43:59,200 --> 01:44:02,420
So at this point, learn to keep the water cool.

1483
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:03,600
Learn to keep it in the dark.

1484
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:10,220
If you can seek out a ovoid-shaped container, you will notice a rise in the quality of the water.

1485
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:14,360
And like Seth had once mentioned, perhaps discussing the health benefits,

1486
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:17,780
which are going to be very interesting as well.

1487
01:44:18,680 --> 01:44:25,800
So we'll figure out somehow how to do a two-hour strictly water conversation

1488
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:29,140
in the near future, perhaps, Seth.

1489
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:30,760
Yeah, absolutely.

1490
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:40,720
The health, it's makeup, what it's made of, what can be done with it.

1491
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:49,960
Water's very useful, not only to, I mean, it's key to the existence of surface dwelling,

1492
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:57,120
earth and evidence like ourselves, but it's also very useful in other things as well.

1493
01:44:57,120 --> 01:45:02,200
So, and just not, there's not the comprehension.

1494
01:45:03,620 --> 01:45:07,260
No, and the problem with it, and it is a serious problem, by the way,

1495
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:13,160
is that the infrastructure that's been enabled and put throughout the planet

1496
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:17,900
in most cosmopolitan industrial areas, places that have running water, let's say,

1497
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:23,000
they're using, they're moving water in the opposite way that it should be moved,

1498
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:28,240
through straight pipes and putting chemicals in it to prevent the rise of pathogens.

1499
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:34,260
It's the opposite direction because, just because you're putting antibacterial chemicals in water,

1500
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:37,200
it doesn't mean that you're giving rise to a classification of bacteria

1501
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:39,260
that you're not familiar with and other things.

1502
01:45:40,220 --> 01:45:46,280
So, and also moving them, moving water in straight ditches, straight pipes,

1503
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:50,680
straight canals, straight tubes is basically a straight jacket for the water.

1504
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:53,840
And if you have someone that is fairly sane,

1505
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:58,300
and you put them in a straight jacket for long enough, they become fairly insane.

1506
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:07,280
So, maybe we should call it the insane water that people are partaking in,

1507
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:09,380
meaning not healthy itself.

1508
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:10,640
Yes, very accurate.

1509
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:16,120
Yeah. So, the movement of water is very different also from the storage of water

1510
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,300
and handling of water, which tends to be more static.

1511
01:46:19,140 --> 01:46:21,820
You know, most people that engage in water,

1512
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:25,680
dealing with water for, let's say, consumption and other things,

1513
01:46:25,740 --> 01:46:30,520
it's in some static form, unless you're washing dishes or taking a shower or whatever.

1514
01:46:30,620 --> 01:46:32,360
But when you're seeking out quality water,

1515
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:36,240
typically it would be in some form of bottle or container.

1516
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:38,260
And that's what we're addressing at this point.

1517
01:46:38,340 --> 01:46:41,400
It gets a little more complex to address the moving water

1518
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:44,860
because that involves modifying infrastructure and things like that,

1519
01:46:44,860 --> 01:46:48,480
albeit to a home or plumbing or other things.

1520
01:46:49,020 --> 01:47:01,440
And also, I have much experience with devices that can be made or acquired,

1521
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:03,700
but I don't promote them as such.

1522
01:47:03,940 --> 01:47:08,240
I'm not, quote unquote, in the business of doing that publicly.

1523
01:47:09,260 --> 01:47:13,980
So, that is another discussion, maybe sometime in the future.

1524
01:47:13,980 --> 01:47:18,820
Maybe someone might want to do that because we are working with, let's say, we,

1525
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:24,580
whoever the we is, with ways of dealing with water that are quite unique and quite effective

1526
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:33,440
and have not made it available on these public sonic expressions or shows and things like that.

1527
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:37,760
Just giving people the ability or knowledge to do what they can do

1528
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:40,220
with what they have, I think, is more effective at this point.

1529
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:43,340
So, with that said, being effective, folks,

1530
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:48,280
if you would like to contact us, it's at www.uncommonradio.com.

1531
01:47:48,700 --> 01:47:52,200
And you're listening to us on Americanfreedomradio.com.

1532
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:56,460
And again, if you folks find it within your avail

1533
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:59,420
and would like to afford to donate to AFR, please do so.

1534
01:48:00,660 --> 01:48:04,120
And then again, here we go, another two hours of Uncommon Sense.

1535
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:06,460
We will see you folks in about a week.

1536
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:07,220
Thanks, Seth.

1537
01:48:07,780 --> 01:48:08,880
Yeah, thank you.

1538
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:09,820
It's a pleasure.

1539
01:48:10,140 --> 01:48:12,100
And yeah, we'll be back in about seven days.

1540
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:13,420
Be well, everyone.
