1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
It is close to the end of the month.

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,500
I was looking at the wind-up toy for reference there and yeah, very close.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,100
About the 30th, I'm reckoning, of the fourth month and of course right there we lost everybody

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,000
but four people when we say that but that's all right, it has to be said.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:33,820
Also, another contact way is www.uncommonradio.com, www.uncommonradio.com, that is just a simple

6
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:40,220
way to contact the Greek or Seth Michael and a lot of little convenient things you can

7
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:47,520
click on perhaps and yeah, that's just another way and also you will find a link to the chat

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,940
and a link to Ustream without having to go longhand.

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,560
So, it's uncommonradio.com and it's a common term.

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,420
If you just search uncommon radio, there's quite a bit of it being brought up by the

11
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,140
search engine so that's why I mentioned the www.com part of uncommon radio.

12
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:15,280
Also, speaking of which, four or five listeners, we got an email regarding four or five listeners

13
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,680
and maybe we'll start off with that a little bit.

14
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:23,380
Of course, keep it anonymous and I want to thank the people behind the scenes that do

15
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:31,300
a little bit of administrative work including yourself and listen and watch the contact

16
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,880
information so we do get it and we do like to answer back.

17
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:45,610
So, just a moment, I thought I had just hit something and it went away.

18
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,370
So, let's just bring it up in a moment again.

19
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,490
But yeah, so this is going to be a long month by the way.

20
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,910
It seems an extra observable long month.

21
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,270
It looks like the moon won't be coming around again for a day or two again.

22
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,970
So, very interesting how that's working out.

23
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:24,090
Yeah, one of the emails that we received was, I like to mention when we talk about studying

24
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:30,190
old texts and things like that, one of them that I like to recommend to anyone who is

25
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:38,470
trying to study such things is Kohaleth which is better known as Ecclesiastes.

26
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,050
The word just means preacher.

27
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,970
Or Ecclesiastes means the assembly or the group.

28
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,410
In English, sorry.

29
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,710
Yeah, Kohaleth being.

30
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,550
They stretched Kohaleth into meaning assembly or assembler.

31
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,310
But go ahead, yeah.

32
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,930
It gets complicated, doesn't it, Seth?

33
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,350
But go ahead.

34
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,090
Yeah, so I'm just going to basically read a little bit of this email.

35
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,070
It's very short and I'll leave any names out to protect the guilty, I suppose.

36
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,030
It's a great show.

37
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:10,930
I'm really enjoying it.

38
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,210
I did read Ecclesiastes, Seth, and seemed to get a lot out of it.

39
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,750
What I found interesting was that it confirmed a low opinion of the concept of karma with

40
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,830
the statements, I'm paraphrasing, about the wicked living long and prosperous lives and

41
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:29,230
seeing good men whose lives were cut short and how time and chance happens to the good

42
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:29,770
and the bad.

43
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,130
Thanks for recommending that in the audiobook version.

44
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,050
What was confusing was the previous book of Proverbs seemed to say the opposite.

45
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,710
Again, paraphrasing, wicked will be punished and their lives will be cut off, etc., and

46
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,750
the good men will prosper.

47
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,250
Am I missing some context for Proverbs?

48
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,310
Do you think you will be putting up reference section with suggested reading?

49
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,030
That would be great.

50
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,670
So that's something we might look into.

51
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,470
I was looking at the word idle and I want to I'm going to stick with the Ecclesiastes

52
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,850
and just kind of read very short.

53
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:05,170
I kind of I was I don't have a lot of time to sit at the computer and answer emails,

54
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:10,030
but I did feel I this is this was my response.

55
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,149
It said Vanity, a coleth Ecclesiastes preacher book written by one who is considered wise

56
00:04:15,149 --> 00:04:16,570
about wisdom.

57
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:21,930
And so the question I asked this this guy that sent the email is what did it say is

58
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,870
good for one to do or bad for one to do?

59
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:31,910
And yeah, so that's as far as that goes.

60
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:39,370
You know, it's one of the things in that book that is repeated and and studying such

61
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,710
things, you'll find a number of ideas, concepts repeated.

62
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,310
And it seems like a way of emphasizing a point.

63
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,630
If you're going to go through the trouble of repeating it, you know, perhaps it's

64
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,590
worth the consideration taking note of.

65
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:04,850
It underpins it underlines actually emphasizes and underscores the thoughts of those that

66
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:05,510
know the secret.

67
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,970
You know, I say the secret, it's not there's not only one secret, actually, by the way,

68
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:14,730
Seth, anything and everything in Scripture is still secret, by the way.

69
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,650
But that's another discussion that we've brought up.

70
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:24,550
So, yeah, it does even a cursory view of the of that section or that book, let's say,

71
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:31,150
because it is a book, does give one maybe, I don't know if it's a sense of relief,

72
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,230
because in this case, it raised a big fat question mark.

73
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:42,990
So, well, and it's I think that part of the question is picking one idea or concept

74
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,470
out of the book that's mentioned.

75
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:57,750
And the, you know, it's saying in Kohalath where it speaks about, you know, the wicked

76
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:03,610
living long and prosperous lives and seeing good men whose lives are cut off short time

77
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,770
and chance happens to everyone.

78
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:13,010
It's that in and of itself is underscoring or underlining the, you know, the vanity.

79
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:17,290
And the repeating nature and the repeating nature of things, because you see that repeated.

80
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,270
Yeah.

81
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:21,410
Well, here, I want to just throw in something, tie this in, folks.

82
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,270
And if you want to hide something, put it in the public library.

83
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:29,170
So if you want to keep a secret, just say it on a minor Internet radio station, right?

84
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,370
So let's just do it this way.

85
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,370
All right.

86
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:33,810
How do we do?

87
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,850
This is one of the secrets.

88
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:42,290
There is a primary society known as the gods, and there's a hierarchy and the chief god

89
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,870
by the way, very few people know this.

90
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:50,030
And I don't mean people as in the common way, but the people that the people go to,

91
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,750
you know, the religious leaders.

92
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,710
I mean, not the schmuck down the street that's got a circus or a church or, you know, a synagogue

93
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,410
or a temple or whatever, or a mosque.

94
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,870
Not those guys are completely, you know, the street sweeper class talking about the

95
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,670
guys that are running those guys, you know, like way up at the top.

96
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,150
They don't even know because they're so busy with their stuff.

97
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,830
So that's why I keep saying society is pretty much lost at this point.

98
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,550
But this is it, folks.

99
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:16,950
You ready?

100
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,570
There is a society that controls the society.

101
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,550
And there is, they're known as the gods in English, the Elohim, right?

102
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,410
The El, the emanators.

103
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:32,530
And within there, they have a ladder, basically.

104
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,950
And it goes all the way to the top.

105
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,990
And you have the chief deity.

106
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,630
And what makes them the chief deity, folks?

107
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:36,990
You ready?

108
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,170
Ready for this?

109
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:38,670
Ready?

110
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,970
Not subject to death.

111
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,770
All the other gods are subject to death.

112
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,410
Okay.

113
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

114
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:45,910
I know.

115
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:46,370
I know.

116
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:46,710
Right.

117
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:47,150
Okay.

118
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,350
Lost everybody right away.

119
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,730
But we still got to say it.

120
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:57,370
Now, the interesting part is this particular manifestation of reality is the height of

121
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,730
creation, their creation.

122
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,150
Why?

123
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:06,130
Because what they have done is they have animated material with spirit, mind.

124
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,370
And they've also animated the mind or the spirit through material.

125
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:17,110
And when this was proposed to be done a while back, there was a division in that society.

126
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,610
They're like, no, no, no, no, no.

127
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,930
A third of them said, don't do it.

128
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,370
Don't do it.

129
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,790
Don't do it.

130
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,150
Because when you do that, it'll be full of corruption.

131
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,290
The material gets corrupted.

132
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:29,250
Any other group said, well, got to do it, man.

133
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,490
It's the highest form of our art so far.

134
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:33,929
That's the secret, folks.

135
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:34,990
Very simple.

136
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:41,250
So when you read about that, tie that in with Ecclesiastes and Proverbs, how the wicked,

137
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:41,950
right?

138
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:45,410
Well, actually, you know, we don't even have the text translated.

139
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,770
So it's kind of hard to discuss.

140
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,850
But you have to know what is delivered to the people can be discussed to some level.

141
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,750
So yeah, wicked, corrupt.

142
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,310
Yeah.

143
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,950
This was already proposed and known prior to all of this coming together.

144
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,030
Kind of like, yeah, you know, remember the Ford Pinto?

145
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,630
They knew the gas tank was going to explode.

146
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,410
But they put it on the market anyway.

147
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,610
I don't know.

148
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,870
It's not an experiment.

149
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,370
Oh, boy.

150
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,830
Here's another secret.

151
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,370
The what you call the Bible or the text, anyone starts explaining it to you, they're full of

152
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:18,850
crap.

153
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:25,150
Unless they first start saying that it hasn't not been translated to this date and you have

154
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,650
to go back to the languages of preservation.

155
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,190
So that's one thing.

156
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:35,730
And the other thing is what you have delivered as your version is not even what's loosely

157
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,390
called the version.

158
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,070
It's really poor.

159
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,310
On the grading system, it would get an F.

160
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:51,910
And not only is it poor in meaning, but the books are not even in the right order.

161
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:58,490
But it doesn't matter because you're living in a society that is 100% pagan and or heathen

162
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,750
or whatever you want to call it.

163
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,410
They're into these little charms and talismans like a rabbit's foot.

164
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,830
You know, they carry something.

165
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,290
They think it brings them good luck.

166
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,990
So if they touch the King James Version, they think it's something.

167
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,930
Yeah, they take those into the Temple of Justice even.

168
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,730
Yeah, just touch it and you'll be fine.

169
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,610
Swear on it.

170
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,750
Touch it and say this.

171
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,230
Yeah, I mean, this is ridiculous.

172
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,170
I mean, we're talking about but this is the corrupted spirit in material form at this point.

173
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:32,470
You know, there's an old saying that miners like to use.

174
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,290
It's fix it or blow it up.

175
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,830
Well, you know, anyway, so that's the interesting part.

176
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:44,970
So those are some of the secrets in terms of secrets, plural secret of a grab bag.

177
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,010
You know, we like to bring these out.

178
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,430
And by the way, these things are anything anyone can access.

179
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,830
I just want to throw something in.

180
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,370
It's not ignorance.

181
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,810
And don't and I tell people don't make excuses that people have been dumbed down or they've

182
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:57,490
been conditioned.

183
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,030
I've gotten a couple of messages, you know, you're kind of harsh calling everyone a moron

184
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,150
or an imbecile.

185
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,590
You know, they've been, you know, conditioned and ignorant.

186
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,330
I said, let's let's get away.

187
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,070
That's that's you're making excuses and taking sides.

188
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,150
Where's the objectivity?

189
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,670
You know, if you see a piece of burnt toast and it's, you know, burnt and unedible, you

190
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,130
get, well, you know, they left it in the toaster too long.

191
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:19,570
Well, no.

192
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,190
Oh, yeah, yeah.

193
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,270
Well, yes, or whatever.

194
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,310
But the fact of the matter is this is a piece of burnt toast.

195
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,750
That's objective.

196
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:31,410
Now, how it got burned, why it got burned by who or what is irrelevant at the point.

197
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:37,330
So at this point, society is irrelevant in terms of their excuses that are made for them.

198
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:43,850
So that's why the message that is why what makes this uncommon and why we do state that

199
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,570
there are only four or five listeners.

200
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,030
Right.

201
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,230
There's a difference between hearing sounds and listening.

202
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,210
So.

203
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,230
Yeah.

204
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,850
Anything else you want to touch on that with with the books of wisdom, I guess you'd call

205
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:08,390
it, which which are dubbed only not only not subject to death, but in the in the same in

206
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:14,150
the same words, death is subject to the most time.

207
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,070
That's right.

208
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,930
And what's interesting is the double negative aspect is in the future, death will be put

209
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,410
to death.

210
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,370
And when death is put to death, that death is dead.

211
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,290
So if death is dead, there's only.

212
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,350
See now, believe it or not, this might sound incredible, but it's actually in the fashion

213
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,270
that I just mentioned being objective.

214
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,230
I was in a conversation yesterday with someone.

215
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:35,990
We'll keep it anonymous.

216
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:39,990
And they actually had told me I think they caught themselves.

217
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:40,810
Maybe they didn't.

218
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,290
I don't get my knowledge from a book.

219
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,930
I get it from first hand experience, from experience.

220
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:49,270
I don't need a book.

221
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,730
I was like, wow, well, what if it's on a USB?

222
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,370
What if it's a book is just a communication, right?

223
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,910
We can put it on a drive.

224
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,730
We can put it in electronic form.

225
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,590
We can speak it.

226
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,470
Now, here's the interesting part about the mind.

227
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,790
I was going to badger this person, but it wouldn't be good.

228
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:10,810
I said, look, man, I got this book on how to do magic tricks and how to saw a woman in

229
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,150
half, you know, put her back together on stage.

230
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,730
You know, everyone will believe that.

231
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:15,890
And right.

232
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,910
And then everyone, you know, I'll lie.

233
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:23,530
And everyone in the audience watching me saw a woman in half and put her back together.

234
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,410
We'll swear that a woman was sawed in half and put back together.

235
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,170
That's what they saw through their experience.

236
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,430
I got it all from book.

237
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,010
I got you all fooled, right?

238
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:38,350
Yeah, I mean, this is this is the level of, oh, man.

239
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,230
Yeah, the spirit corrupted in the material sense.

240
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,850
There's a lot of discussion about the mind, right?

241
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:51,890
But no one ever connects it publicly to what's called the spirit, which is exactly what it

242
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:52,150
is.

243
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:54,910
So, all right.

244
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,370
So how about how about we toggle and do this other one?

245
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,810
I'm going to paraphrase because it's kind of long and I'm going to take out the yours

246
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,770
and these and mines and kind of paraphrase.

247
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,270
It says, just wanted to drop a line and say that I love the show.

248
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:06,890
I heard you.

249
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,710
I heard you mention that you only have five listeners, question mark.

250
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:14,550
I wish there were more people out there that tackle the topics in the same style that you

251
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:14,970
use.

252
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:21,170
I did major in philosophy, so I'm grateful for that from the institution, quote, unquote,

253
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,190
I paid, quote, unquote, money to for a work permit, basically.

254
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,970
Now, this person is getting it here, right?

255
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,790
Or they got it.

256
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,750
But that institution never taught me the things I have discovered during my own research.

257
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,190
Do you have any reading suggestions, subjects of law or religion?

258
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,910
Thanks for giving me some truths and thanks and all that, right?

259
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,470
Now, religion just means something you do regularly.

260
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,170
Now, in subjects of law, that's simple.

261
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,330
That comes from your deity.

262
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,350
That's not something that anyone can really escape.

263
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:56,710
They can try to rationalize away what law is.

264
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,430
But when you bring up law and religion, those are societies within society, just like there's

265
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,310
a medical society, scientific society, educational society.

266
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:11,690
You're going to have to be paramount in exercising objectivity because the people that work in

267
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,950
there, all of them, bar a small group, are pranksters.

268
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,930
They don't know anything about the fields that they're purveying to be giving instruction

269
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:20,250
on.

270
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:26,170
And that small group that I'm mentioning are people within these societies that realize

271
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:30,590
what's going on and are looking for an exit strategy, which normally takes anywhere between

272
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,690
two weeks and two years.

273
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:37,570
In other words, you will not find anyone in the medical community, except for people working

274
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:45,470
in emergency medicine and nurses emptying out pee pans or poop pans, or anyone in the law

275
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:51,930
community or anyone in the religious society or education society that has any integrity

276
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,530
and is not operating as a prankster.

277
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,890
Now, they don't know they're doing it, but they're doing it, or they know that they're

278
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:59,930
doing it and they don't care.

279
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,050
Now, the people that are not part of that group have discovered that it's all a prank

280
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,170
and they had bought into it.

281
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:09,910
And now they're scratching their head and they're like, uh-oh, I got to get out of

282
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,330
here.

283
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:15,770
But I got a lot invested and also I'm getting a lot of credits for doing this, so what am

284
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,410
I going to do?

285
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,850
There are quite a few people.

286
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,850
It could be as high as 10% that are in a pickle.

287
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:24,910
I've met quite a few, well, I should count them on your fingers, quote-unquote doctors,

288
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:31,350
lawyers, people in the religious fields that actually don't talk about working in that

289
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,710
profession.

290
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,390
I met an assistant district attorney and she said she quit.

291
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,130
She was kind of embarrassed to say she did that.

292
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,050
And I said, well, why did you quit?

293
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,570
She said, I found out what it was about.

294
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:42,810
Same thing with a doctor.

295
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,410
I went to someone and they were not working and they were working in import-export and

296
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,730
they actually had a degree as a doctor.

297
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,230
And I'm like, what happened?

298
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,710
So I don't really like to talk about it, but I found out what it was about.

299
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:59,310
I met someone who was a Catholic priest once and he was working in a totally different

300
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,470
field and mentioned that and he says, well, why did you leave?

301
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,890
I found out what it was about.

302
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:12,430
So yes, this might sound general and specific and maybe condemning to a certain degree,

303
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,869
but it's just a judgment call and not being objective.

304
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,270
You are being pranked.

305
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,410
So to tie this back to, yeah.

306
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:28,430
Yeah, I was going to say, you know, prostitution is frowned upon generally in society.

307
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:37,430
And yet the systems that are in place, what they call like the justice system or the

308
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:46,950
medical system, things like that, these large portions of society are, it's very, I mean,

309
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,490
it's the same model currently as prostitution.

310
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,190
You get what you pay for, essentially.

311
00:17:52,970 --> 00:18:00,310
So with the justice, perhaps you're paying them to, you know, not screw you, to be euphemistic,

312
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:03,590
whereas prostitution would be a little bit different.

313
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,310
But at the same time, it's all.

314
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,830
Right.

315
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,450
And justice is also the religious system.

316
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,530
It's the revival of the ancient goddess religion.

317
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,370
Sorry, folks, you may not believe that or want to believe it, but that's not.

318
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:19,950
That's you're going to have problems in your life if you think justice has anything to do with law.

319
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:25,970
So anyway, but yeah, they're there to screw, you know, but even prostitution gets complicated.

320
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:30,190
You know, there's a lady, she was working in that field and they take her to she's suing

321
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,850
one of the Johns, one of her clients and for rape.

322
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:36,210
And they put her on the witness stand and ask her, how did you know you were being raped?

323
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,330
She says the check bounced.

324
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,130
And so anyway.

325
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,630
Yeah, but the problem right now is not really a problem.

326
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,890
If you objectify it, it's just the state of affairs.

327
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,910
People are always talking about all these problems.

328
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:53,490
If you I posted in the in the chat, I said the persistent dummy load got you down.

329
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:57,850
Well, there's two hours of relief at the top of the hour by the wind up toy known as the clock.

330
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,070
Right.

331
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:58,810
Meaning this show.

332
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,750
And yes, you're being dummy loaded.

333
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,230
You are in a hamster wheel, folks.

334
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,570
The thing is, but we're done with our treadmill.

335
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:13,690
Yeah, all of your media at this point is not worth reckoning.

336
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,250
All of it.

337
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,310
That's some of it.

338
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:16,850
All of it.

339
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:21,750
And all of your systems that have been put in front of you, informational systems are

340
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,210
easy to reckon as just filler.

341
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:32,190
You're going to go across the board looking for information and it's all a dirty pond.

342
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,270
Now, better than a dirty pond might be a flowing stream.

343
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:38,030
But even better than that is the spring where it all comes from.

344
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:43,750
So what that means essentially is be persistent about going to the source and seeing what

345
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,770
it's founded on.

346
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:46,210
Right.

347
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:52,790
Regardless of what it is, you know, like, let's you know, the religious community is very

348
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:57,630
easy to badger and they should be and they will be by society and the gods themselves

349
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,290
in the future.

350
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,590
Extremely so.

351
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,570
But they are pranksters.

352
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:06,530
Like, for example, if you look up paganism, they define it or they look at, you know,

353
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:07,750
look up religion.

354
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,930
The true religions are Christianity, Islam and Judaism.

355
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,890
And if you're not that, you're pagan.

356
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,910
Well, that's like saying here, have a seat and there's a thumbtack on it.

357
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,270
You're being pranked because all those are extremely pagan.

358
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:23,050
So at this point, you're not going to be able to really reference anything.

359
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:29,870
And if you don't think Islam, Judaism and Christianity is 150 percent pagan, you haven't

360
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,690
done your research.

361
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:34,450
Pagan meaning just ignorant and whatever.

362
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,510
And then you go ahead to have a discussion with someone in medical school.

363
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:45,070
And once if they introduce themselves as such, say, oh, you like to heal people and they

364
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,450
kind of look at you all bewildered.

365
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,690
Like, what the hell does that mean?

366
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,890
Right.

367
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:55,530
Or you run into an attorney and you say, well, you know the laws because not the law, the

368
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:56,570
laws, because there are many.

369
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:58,370
And they look at you as well.

370
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:02,730
You know, I kind of just represent people and right.

371
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,650
You know, they don't know anything.

372
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:09,910
None of them do now, except for the small group that we qualified and quantified that are

373
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,090
looking for an exit strategy.

374
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,130
But here's the pranking.

375
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:12,870
You know where it starts.

376
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,870
I had a discussion about it yesterday with the parents.

377
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,190
How so?

378
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:24,490
Children are all talk to parents and say, hey, or, you know, people around children

379
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,590
and their parents say, you know, the education system is stupid.

380
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,170
You don't learn anything at all for 12 years.

381
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,170
You know, and the parents will say, yeah, I did it because I did it.

382
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,990
The children have to do it.

383
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,770
OK, so now you got pranked by your own parents, folks.

384
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,410
Sorry.

385
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,290
So wherever you look, you're going to be pranked.

386
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,510
It's this is the age of the prankster.

387
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,530
Maybe we're saying that we're not we can't qualify or quantify it.

388
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:58,210
Maybe for the sake of discussion, Seth, that's a pretty good way to maybe overall get away

389
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,650
from the debates and the discussions.

390
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:05,470
People look at the minutia of the ridiculousness of the things they discuss, you know, and

391
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:09,350
meaning that your your media is junk at this point.

392
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:15,430
If they're not talking about genetically modified octopus or purple tomatoes that are going

393
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:19,090
to eat you or little space aliens that are going to get you.

394
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:24,730
They're talking about stupid things like liberty and rights and legalism, right?

395
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,350
Or this religion versus that religion.

396
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,050
You know, that's like arguing you're at Disneyland.

397
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,010
I want to ride the teacups or Thunder Mountain or whatever, you know, what are you talking

398
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:34,330
about?

399
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,170
It's all fantasy.

400
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:38,350
But yet it's a fantasy that is very dangerous.

401
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:40,810
A lot of these pranksters are armed, folks.

402
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,430
They're armed with all kinds of things.

403
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:51,890
Poisons, projectiles, words, institutions, bad information, bad information.

404
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,310
You're dangerous right there.

405
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,190
Bad information is a dangerous weapon.

406
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,470
And people don't know where to go because they're taking up space.

407
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,810
And we've discussed this very much.

408
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,210
If you look at anything that's been created, it's always in large numbers.

409
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,930
All of creation is in very high accountability to quantity.

410
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,310
And there's qualities there.

411
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,270
Are there qualities?

412
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:23,990
So when you hear about 100 people or 7 billion people or all the people in society, it doesn't

413
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,990
mean jack shit.

414
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,170
And I'll use that term.

415
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,630
Has nothing to do with anything.

416
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,450
Don't have to make an excuse for anyone.

417
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:35,530
What you're looking for is what's right and what's wrong.

418
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,610
And that comes from your God.

419
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:37,330
Your God.

420
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,290
Not God, but your God.

421
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,550
So you choose what level you're going to operate on.

422
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:46,350
So anyway, this sounds dogmatic to the ignorant.

423
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,470
You know, there's an old saying that says, never talk about politics and religion because

424
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,550
you're going to offend the ignorant.

425
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:58,870
By the way, anyone who pursues the truth cannot be offended.

426
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,550
Let me think about it.

427
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:03,310
Maybe that's why when you go to court, they consider it an offense.

428
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,650
And here's the thing that people don't understand.

429
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:09,310
They're talking about government, right?

430
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,250
The buildings exist, but the offices are vacant.

431
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,870
Legally and lawfully.

432
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,830
And there's small groups of people in government that are waiting for people to do something

433
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,390
about it, not in the sense of revolution, but in the sense of acknowledgement.

434
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:28,330
And in America, they're doing an election and people are going to vote.

435
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,990
I don't know what you're doing voting at an election.

436
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,290
That's like going over and emptying the waste bin.

437
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:34,470
What are you doing?

438
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:36,810
You're vowing.

439
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:44,130
When you vote, what you're doing is a blanket vow that whoever the electors pick, you'll

440
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:44,790
stand behind.

441
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,930
And they're voting for a leader of an entity that no longer exists.

442
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,870
I mean, this is so twisted and bizarre.

443
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:58,650
And also, if you have a fair assessment of society, who the hell would want to lead a

444
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,510
society like this?

445
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,190
That person would have to be suspect and questioned in the first place.

446
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,290
And what I mean by society like this, just walk out your door, stand outside where you

447
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:08,950
live or walk for five minutes.

448
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,710
You want to lead these people?

449
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:14,910
Anyway, OK, let's let's get let's get happy.

450
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,470
Go ahead, say something happy.

451
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,670
Something happy.

452
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:30,870
How about you mentioned in the couple of minutes before we went to broadcast, you had some

453
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:35,110
news stories or some articles that you you wanted to comment on.

454
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:41,490
And so if you have any of those brought up, that'd be I'm I'm interested.

455
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,950
Yeah, what's interesting, I brought that up because that came to mind.

456
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:49,010
I tend to have been doing a fast from what they call the Internet, other than using it

457
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:53,550
as a glorified telephone book and a telephone, because, you know, back in the days, you know,

458
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:58,170
I grew up at a time when the phone hang on the wall and if it rang, it was really important.

459
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:04,910
You know, it's not, you know, so I've been trying to use it for communication purposes,

460
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:07,110
but just browsing the Internet.

461
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:13,270
Obviously, there was an event that happened last week regarding a shooting and it's just

462
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:17,750
twisted and stupid in the way that it's being viewed again because people are that way.

463
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:24,890
So but nonetheless, looking at several things, one article, this is on Rents.com.

464
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:27,910
I'll scroll down to it.

465
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,150
The war on stupid people.

466
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,490
Well, good subject, right?

467
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:35,870
It's by the Atlantic and it says American society increasingly mistakes intelligence

468
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:36,830
for human worth.

469
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,650
It's a July, August 2016 issue.

470
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,390
What they call that is written by David H. Friedman.

471
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,630
And it's an interesting article because when you go down the article, it's pretty lengthy.

472
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,630
I don't want to read the whole thing, but it kind of starts off something like as recently

473
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,490
as the 1950s, possessing only middling intelligence was not likely to severely limit one's life

474
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:56,970
trajectory.

475
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,230
IQ wasn't a big factor.

476
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:02,330
When you're married, where you lived or what other things or what have you, the qualifications

477
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,470
for a good job, blah, blah, blah.

478
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:04,550
That's all slave talk.

479
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:13,030
But basically, it talks about how people that are not considered smart or regarded as stupid

480
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:16,970
have become automatically disagreed with, right?

481
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,490
And it brings up Darwin.

482
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,710
It brings up all these things in media.

483
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:28,470
But it also brings up as a reference point, who is smart and who is stupid is the reference

484
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:32,970
point of who is smart or those that are educated by the conventional education system.

485
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,570
So what happens here, there is no discernment, right?

486
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:39,290
It's basically backing up the pranksters.

487
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,130
It's another prankster article, you see.

488
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:47,670
So it talks about college boards and university educated people versus those that are not.

489
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:53,670
So it's implying that unless you have a university education or formal education, 12 years of

490
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,610
nonsense, that you're not smart.

491
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:01,590
So right here, people are going and reading articles thinking that, oh, yeah, I'm noticing

492
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,630
the trend of that, you know.

493
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,410
But they're not reading it.

494
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:07,930
They're not noticing that it's another prank, okay?

495
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,670
It's basically supporting the pranksters.

496
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:16,130
That's why I keep saying these pranksters are accommodating the people because if you

497
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:20,810
got rid of all the pranksters, which is about a third of the people on the planet, the other

498
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:24,530
two thirds that are left will immediately subdivide themselves into three groups again

499
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,770
and they will assume the level of prankstership again.

500
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:30,550
There's no changing it, you know, at this point.

501
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:39,230
The other thing, there was a couple of other things that shot by, let's say, the conscious

502
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,270
of looking at what's in the media.

503
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,210
Oh, yeah, another one I'll bring up.

504
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:52,210
There's a group that likes to do international news, several of them, and they have several

505
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:52,610
articles.

506
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:53,410
This is just a general.

507
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,570
I will not get into the article.

508
00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:00,310
Like I said, I would maybe tell people how to look at or describe what they're really

509
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,250
saying if you're looking at it objectively.

510
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:08,530
But there are several international sort of news type groups.

511
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:13,990
One of them is regarding retired military, which I affectionately like to call the cartoon

512
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,390
network.

513
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:20,050
But anyway, they're discussing about what the hell's going on in the Middle East.

514
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:25,090
And believe it or not, I've had some communications with some of these particular news people

515
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:28,130
and laid it out for them, but they dare not touch it.

516
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:36,890
And the actual people that are bringing stories, that's what they are, let's say, lack even

517
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:42,750
the most basic intuitiveness to even indirectly mention the coming Middle East Union.

518
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:44,570
They won't touch it at all.

519
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:50,270
They want to blame it on certain groups, the Jews, the Zionists, or all this other stuff,

520
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,290
or religious people are generally peaceful.

521
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:55,130
No, religious people are generally stupid.

522
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:00,210
So this is the thing.

523
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,950
Maybe we'll digress from what I mentioned about going through some articles.

524
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:09,490
But the thing is, what maybe looking at it generally is when you folks are looking at

525
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:13,630
what's called the news, mainstream or alternative, and a special alternative because we're along

526
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:19,450
that line, I don't feel like I'm criticizing any colleagues because I'm not a team player

527
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,510
and I don't have any colleagues in the alternative media whatsoever, not even close.

528
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,150
And if anyone thinks there is, they're not listening.

529
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:36,330
The point here is this, what you're being told is not only misinformation put out by

530
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:44,090
disinformation is unintuitive, it's just downright unintuitive, which makes it even harder to

531
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:44,510
explain.

532
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:54,030
Now, you see disinformant is someone who knows that they're giving poor information just

533
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,510
to direct the crowd mentality.

534
00:30:55,510 --> 00:31:00,190
The misinformed are those that actually latch onto that and believe it and speak it as if

535
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,290
it's they're reporting on giving a good report.

536
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:08,150
But all of it, whether it's disinformation or misinformation is just downright unintuitive.

537
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:15,010
What I mean very quickly is listen to what's being said and spend just a few minutes looking

538
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:15,990
at what's being said.

539
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:19,550
You hear things about talking about debt and the economy.

540
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:24,850
First of all, that is unintuitive because everyone knows, I'm saying this in a way,

541
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:30,570
that when people go to the store, they have in their pocket a plastic card.

542
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:36,130
Is that a debt card or is it a credit card?

543
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,850
And I didn't say debit, I said debt.

544
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:38,630
It's credit.

545
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,050
It's a credit-based economy.

546
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:44,670
So right away, any discussion regarding money, just like any discussion regarding the biblical

547
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:49,310
text, whatever, if you don't preface what you're going to be discussing because it's

548
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:53,070
contrary to what people think and discuss normally, you're talking crap.

549
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:58,510
You are a coprofago or coprofagia, which is not only talking crap, you're eating crap.

550
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:05,510
So any discussion regarding economic activity or whatever, if it's not brought up that you

551
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:10,510
are in a credit-based, not debt-based economy, you're listening to junk.

552
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,690
The other thing that's unintuitive, I'm saying this is intuitive because it's very

553
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:18,350
simple, credit score, credit card, credit base.

554
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:23,770
The other aspect of it, of alternative media and mainstream, is this thing called liberty

555
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:25,430
and rights and legalizing.

556
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:26,870
What the hell?

557
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,330
I'm not even going to go into that, folks.

558
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,830
Just look up what those words mean.

559
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,690
Privilege, you know, all this stuff.

560
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,590
This is just downright unintuitive.

561
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:36,810
I mean, it just doesn't make sense.

562
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:42,430
Now, I don't know if it's what they're putting in the water, right, quote unquote.

563
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,950
We are always threatening to do a water show.

564
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,230
And by the way, folks, I hope you're keeping your water dark and cool,

565
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:53,330
cool meaning 39 degrees Fahrenheit or 4 degrees Celsius, and keep it in the dark.

566
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:57,410
Yes, we are threatening a water show, which will come one of these days.

567
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,450
So you're going to throw that in.

568
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,150
So how's that water doing?

569
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:02,590
Just keep it cool.

570
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:07,390
Yeah, we're not talking about water on Mars or some super hyper water or some ridiculous

571
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,670
tripe that you hear everywhere.

572
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,030
I mean, everywhere.

573
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,470
You have more power than you think or believe you do.

574
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,630
Learn how to keep your water cool.

575
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:21,630
Learn how to keep the water dark and out of absence of light.

576
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:27,230
But again, just to go back to this mini rant, Seth, and everyone else, the four listeners,

577
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:33,070
five people listening, let's say, is that not only is the information just poor all across

578
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:36,850
the board, it's unintuitive, unintuitive.

579
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:42,150
And I'm not going to touch on the aspect of rights and liberty and legalization,

580
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,010
but go look up what those things really mean.

581
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,010
You know, but here's the thing.

582
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:51,290
You're dealing with a spirit in humanity right now that will discount information.

583
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:54,970
They hate knowledge and they hate good information.

584
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:58,990
As a group, humanity functions in that modality.

585
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,850
They actually hate the truth.

586
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:02,830
Go figure.

587
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,210
You know, if they don't like what you're saying,

588
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,670
the first thing the moron says is that is an opinion.

589
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,370
You ever notice how they do that?

590
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,510
So it's very...

591
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,989
Science has become its own faith.

592
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,989
Yes, the law society...

593
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,630
Science no longer means knowledge.

594
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:31,429
It means what is academically, what is the working academic theory currently.

595
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:32,730
That's science right now.

596
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,370
Let's do a...

597
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:39,449
Well, off the top of your head, the definition of academic means impractical,

598
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,350
theoretical, never leading to a conclusion.

599
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,350
And here's the thing, again, about the media.

600
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:47,790
You ever notice when they have a host or a guest or whatever and they introduce them

601
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,469
based on their academic credentials?

602
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:54,210
Folks, that's when you hit the red button or the X and you close the thing and you go away.

603
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:58,770
Because everything that's going to come out of this person's mouth or head is ridiculous

604
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:06,130
or it's academic or impractical, theoretical, never leading to a conclusion.

605
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:09,950
Now, I'm not saying everything because they might use the word the or is or was.

606
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:14,970
But this is the state of your media, folks.

607
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,070
And I say your media because you're claiming it.

608
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,710
Now, there's a lot of good media.

609
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:26,590
For example, there's streaming music and there's audio books.

610
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:31,170
But right now, the people that are talking and supposedly bringing you stuff,

611
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:36,210
and if it's not in the realm of entertainment in your mind or in the mind that you use,

612
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,890
got nothing else to tell you, folks.

613
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,370
But anyway, you're not getting it.

614
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,810
That's the point.

615
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,450
But they are getting it.

616
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:49,450
If you look at the lack of support in alternative media, the starving artist syndrome,

617
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:53,650
I think that kind of shows how ridiculous the whole thing is.

618
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:56,330
But anyway, we get off that topic for now.

619
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,130
Because it does, you know, why go down to the realm of the ridiculous?

620
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,450
But here's the thing, folks.

621
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,770
It's just listen to it and do a little bit.

622
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:06,930
If you do a little bit of research on what's being said on mainstream and alternative,

623
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,310
not some of it, but all of it.

624
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,750
If you do a little bit of research, you'll find what's being said,

625
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,690
not only ridiculous, but unintuitive.

626
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:15,950
It just doesn't make any sense.

627
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,890
That's why we call it the dummy load.

628
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,790
People dedicate, they have energy, they're energetic beings.

629
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:28,950
People generally dedicate X amount of energy every day or every week or every year in term of time

630
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,570
on learning things.

631
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:33,850
They want to find out, hey, what's going on today or yesterday?

632
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:34,970
What happened this week?

633
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,830
And that's energy that you're dedicating.

634
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:37,950
And what do they do?

635
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,330
They go to the internet.

636
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,770
Very few people buy newspapers and things.

637
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:43,690
Actually, they do.

638
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,770
And what they're doing is they're being dummy loaded.

639
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,150
It is a load that is being put on you, a treadmill or a hamster wheel.

640
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:54,670
And it's taking all the energy away that you could be using and doing good founded research,

641
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:57,590
basically not reading what someone else wrote about something else,

642
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,910
which wrote about what someone wrote about something else.

643
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,730
But what is it based on?

644
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:05,550
You will find you are being served junk across the board.

645
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,270
And then you will find it unintuitive.

646
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:13,910
How the hell can we be listening to an economic commentator talking about debt when it's a

647
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:14,850
credit-based economy?

648
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,790
This is unintuitive.

649
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:19,310
It doesn't make any sense.

650
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,310
Yes, silence is golden.

651
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:26,410
But anyway, what else you got, Seth?

652
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,530
What else you have on the mind?

653
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:33,850
Someone in the Ustream chat says, as the credits roll, so does the slow reveal.

654
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:38,410
Sandy Hook hoax 9-11 conspiracy election fraud project paperclip,

655
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,950
quote unquote, conspiracy theory is being passed to the people via alternative

656
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,750
and primary media sources.

657
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:46,710
Why do you think this is?

658
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:52,910
Do you think conspiracy theory, quote unquote, is being released as data and a paranoid mindset

659
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,850
on purpose and with purpose?

660
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,150
Yes, it is.

661
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,110
Things will be exposed.

662
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,250
People won't see it.

663
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:03,090
But the reason why things are being exposed is so people are without excuse later,

664
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,330
like a real simple thing.

665
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,630
Here's a way to really massage the thought, OK?

666
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,710
I may not go direct.

667
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,090
I'll just massage the thought for a moment.

668
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:15,370
You ever notice people that profess religion, whether they grew up in it or new founded,

669
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:19,450
and they're enthusiastic about it, and I mean that word literally, right?

670
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:23,050
They're very enthusiastic about their faith.

671
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:28,410
But if you discuss anything with them right away, the source of their problems are political.

672
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:33,270
So they all of a sudden profess faith in a higher power.

673
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:37,370
But all of their problems are caused by human agents solely.

674
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,470
They abandon their God, right?

675
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:42,870
So this is the other thing.

676
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:47,270
Theory, the conspiracy theory came around the JFK, right?

677
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:50,010
That was coined to kind of sidetrack, right, like a theory.

678
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,750
But on one side, theory is bad.

679
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:54,250
But on the other side, they like academics.

680
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:54,750
They're good.

681
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,250
OK, all right.

682
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,490
So it doesn't make any sense.

683
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:03,370
Now, things like JFK, the reason why you're not going to find out who killed JFK in reality

684
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:05,630
is because they hired the right people to do it.

685
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:10,330
And what makes the right assassin, the right group of assassins, the right assassins is

686
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:11,370
they do not get caught.

687
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,030
If they got caught, they were the wrong group.

688
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,110
Duh, that's why you're never going to find it.

689
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:17,630
And it's also cosmic.

690
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:21,110
It has nothing to do with JFK's political stance.

691
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:23,050
It was a cosmic stance while he was taken.

692
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,990
In other words, these gods are behind it.

693
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,730
The gods don't abandon these situations.

694
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,850
They have a very heavy hand in it.

695
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:38,030
OK, maybe it had to do most likely with no one is discussing is JFK's faith, believe

696
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:38,550
it or not.

697
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:46,330
But anyway, with some there was some very in just in, you know, what I have read on the

698
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:53,310
matter and things like that, the timing and place that those things happen were heavy

699
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:54,970
with symbolism as well.

700
00:39:55,130 --> 00:40:00,290
Yes, because there are certain, you know, there's layers of entities, there's geographic

701
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:03,830
ones, cosmic ones, and then there's a command group, you know, a hierarchy.

702
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:08,890
Now, 9-11, you shouldn't know what happened on 9-11 because it'll scare the living

703
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,890
daylights out of you.

704
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:16,510
And it has nothing to do with space weapons or something stupid like that, or nanothermite

705
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,710
or micro nukes.

706
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,650
Yes, you know, I'm not going to get into it.

707
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:21,330
It's not that difficult right now.

708
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,710
I mean, it's out there.

709
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:23,430
It's very practical.

710
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:29,610
It would be irresponsible to discuss 9-11 with accuracy because it would be like crying

711
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:30,510
fire in the theater.

712
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,410
People are too motivated by panic fear.

713
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:35,050
Let me just say this, and I'll say more than I've ever said.

714
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:43,990
There are structures that exist today that are occupied, that have the same type of situation

715
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:45,930
or scheme that brought down those towers.

716
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,790
And if you discuss what it is and how it works and why it's there, it would be like crying

717
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:55,750
fire in the movie theater because there are other structures that entail that same scheme.

718
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:58,290
It would be irresponsible to discuss it.

719
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:07,990
Yeah, and if it was discussed with accuracy and that knowledge became widespread, that

720
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:12,930
would affect what they call the real estate market fairly dramatically.

721
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:20,750
Yeah, and again, this is just all, you know, but it's a dummy load and people are going

722
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,230
to academics, you know.

723
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:29,070
They'll be shunned in the future, by the way, but nonetheless, maybe we're a little ahead

724
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:29,590
of the curve.

725
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:31,490
But 9-11 is irresponsible.

726
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:35,630
Now, most of the other to discuss publicly because, you know what, folks, you don't

727
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:39,230
deserve the truth based on the way you behave, right?

728
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:44,970
You don't go out and buy a fine leather couch and put a baby, a six-month-old baby without

729
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:47,410
a diaper on it unless you want to soil that couch.

730
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:53,190
And when I say you don't deserve the truth, I don't mean you're not deserving of it,

731
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,730
but at this point, absolutely not.

732
00:41:55,290 --> 00:42:02,210
You're just, you're acting, the general population is just acting in a severely inappropriate

733
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:02,730
manner.

734
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:06,830
Even I'm talking about from their thoughts all the way down to their outward behavior

735
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:08,590
at this point.

736
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:13,670
And yeah, I know people don't appreciate hearing that, but, you know, clean up your

737
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:17,350
act, things might start being cleaned up around you, but that's not going to happen.

738
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:22,270
It will be, well, it will be cleaned up and you will be going into one hell of a society

739
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:27,410
next decade that you will appreciate, but it's going to be a big fat lie, even though

740
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:29,450
it'll be real at the same time.

741
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:34,130
The real part will be that there's going to be a Middle East Union where things are

742
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:38,730
going to be based out of and you're going to have pretty much a peace on earth like

743
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:45,270
you want, prosperity, what you call liberty, education, prosperity, all these other things.

744
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,450
And you're going to be promised that this is going to last a thousand years and you're

745
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:49,450
going to believe it.

746
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:51,550
It's only going to last a few years.

747
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:55,910
And when the glitches come, that's why I say it's only going to last a few years,

748
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:59,490
you're going to be told you have to do all these things to get back on track and you're

749
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:02,530
all going to believe it and you're all going to do it and you're going to follow through

750
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,590
on what is going to be hell on earth.

751
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:10,490
It has nothing to do with some despotic government, police or military.

752
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:12,730
You're going to be doing it to each other.

753
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:14,430
Yep.

754
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:18,570
So there'll be more details on this coming in the next couple of years.

755
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,890
And then after that, no one will be able to discuss the reality of it.

756
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,710
So it's going to be quite interesting how that's going to work.

757
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:35,340
So OK, so being intuitive, being unintuitive, misinformed or disinformed is pretty much

758
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,220
the question.

759
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,100
All of that can be taken away.

760
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,180
These shades of gray.

761
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:46,880
If you start looking at what things should be based on, what things are referenced for,

762
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,900
in other words, source material, be objective.

763
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:57,720
I don't think that practically people are capable of that at this point in mass.

764
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,760
I'm not promoting Gustave Le Bon.

765
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:10,240
Gustave L-E-B-O-N is a book called The Crowd and talks about the nature of crowds, crowd

766
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:10,800
mentality.

767
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:15,360
You ever run into someone who likes to go to protests or political activism?

768
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,700
People like to talk about conspiracy theories.

769
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:23,160
Religious groups, educational groups, movements.

770
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,340
I'm not talking about bowel movements, but nonetheless the same.

771
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:33,580
All of these require sort of the objectivity that Gustave Le Bon brought up.

772
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,520
It takes a certain type of individual to join a group like that.

773
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,020
And when you join the crowd, obviously you're not set apart.

774
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,060
So with that in mind, I think we'll have Seth here in a moment back again.

775
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:52,440
I might want to go and do a little recap on that because there's something about repetition.

776
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,120
There's repetition.

777
00:44:54,620 --> 00:45:01,440
There's saying the same thing in different ways over and over.

778
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,860
Perhaps maybe that's how learning is done.

779
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,700
And now we're not here to maybe teach, but we're maybe here to share.

780
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,780
That's another way to think about it.

781
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:18,140
So let's see if we could pull up Gustave Le Bon, the crowd, the nature of crowds,

782
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,460
just for a one minute relief here.

783
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,520
This is an interesting thing.

784
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,720
I think this might be it.

785
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,120
And let's see how it comes off.

786
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,200
In this video, we will provide a summary of Le Bon's classic work.

787
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:32,480
In particular, we will investigate his insights into the nature of crowds,

788
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,340
look at the role ideas play in influencing crowds,

789
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,040
examine the religious sentiment of crowds,

790
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:43,000
and discuss the psychological and emotional benefits one derives from joining a crowd.

791
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:45,820
What is a crowd?

792
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:51,840
Le Bon defined a crowd as a group of individuals united by a common idea, belief, or ideology.

793
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,260
The idea which unites a crowd is not chosen by a process of clear reasoning

794
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,180
and examination of evidence.

795
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,440
Instead, as we will discuss in more detail later,

796
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,220
crowds accept beliefs and ideas superficially

797
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:08,180
and utilize them as fuel for revolutionary action.

798
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,100
When an individual becomes part of a crowd, according to Le Bon,

799
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,160
he undergoes a profound psychological transformation.

800
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,600
That is, he ceases to operate as an individual.

801
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,560
He is no longer himself but has become an automaton

802
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,660
who has ceased to be guided by his will.

803
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:29,240
With such a psychological transformation,

804
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,860
an individual no longer lives for himself

805
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:36,320
but instead becomes a pawn who sacrifices his own personal ends and goals

806
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,740
in favor of those of the crowd.

807
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,240
In a crowd, every sentiment and act is contagious

808
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,400
and contagious to such a degree that an individual

809
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,180
readily sacrifices his personal interest to the collective interest.

810
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,460
As was mentioned earlier, Le Bon maintained that a crowd forms

811
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:57,240
when an influential idea unites a number of individuals

812
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,040
and propels them to act towards a common goal.

813
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,920
These influential ideas, however, are never created by members of the crowd.

814
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,860
Instead, they are brought into the world by the minds of great individuals.

815
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:13,540
Well, as I said earlier, maybe not so great,

816
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:17,300
but this is a small excerpt at the one-minute mark

817
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:22,520
from a video called Gustave Le Bon, The Nature of Crowds,

818
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,320
put up by Academy of Ideas.

819
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:29,200
If anyone is ever interested, don't necessarily buy the book.

820
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:32,120
I'm not saying don't buy the book, but perhaps do the audiobook,

821
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,680
which is on that illustrious thing called YouTube.

822
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,120
And of course, it's true if it's on YouTube, right?

823
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,380
But nonetheless, get familiar with some objective reasoning

824
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:45,520
regarding these groups.

825
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,360
And this is something that is brought up over and over and over

826
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,480
that we're bringing up on Uncommon Sense

827
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,600
is because typically, when you get together on a media format,

828
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,820
such as radio, internet, chats, all this other thing,

829
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,700
a crowd is formed, believe it or not.

830
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,140
Now, define the crowd.

831
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,280
Well, who knows?

832
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,780
But the characteristics of the crowd can easily be defined

833
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:13,180
when you look at what Le Bon had written about it.

834
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:18,120
It's easy to perhaps, how would one say,

835
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,220
objectify what is going on or simpler to objectify.

836
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,880
So perhaps someone will do their research

837
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,140
and find out something else and message us

838
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,560
if there's any more details on Gustave Le Bon,

839
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,040
because it's a good sense of objectifying

840
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,960
what is going on with people.

841
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,600
And again, just to go back to what's uncommon,

842
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:47,120
because this is discussing things of uncommon sense in nature.

843
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:51,860
What is uncommon is just basically the faculties and qualities

844
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:54,520
that mankind has been endowed with.

845
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,900
Okay, basically, you have a mind and most people have an able body,

846
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,400
or if you don't, you have people around you that do.

847
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:07,340
And using things to their highest and best use is really uncommon.

848
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,200
It seems like there has been a just rolling around, taking up time.

849
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:15,900
And that is the truth of the matter, by the way,

850
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,340
if you look at it cosmically, you're in a waiting room,

851
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,120
a waiting period or a curing time.

852
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,200
But it doesn't mean that the slightest bit of realization

853
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,700
can make one operate on a higher level,

854
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,960
which is the highest and best use of what they can do.

855
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,240
You know, it might be known as economy of movement,

856
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,300
or killing two birds with one stone.

857
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:36,020
I don't think anyone should be killing birds.

858
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:41,100
But, you know, these things where you're using high efficiency in your life

859
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,460
and avoiding the dummy load, unless that's what you want.

860
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:48,100
A dummy load, for example, is expelling energy

861
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,280
just for the sake of expelling energy.

862
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:54,700
You know, and putting it out there in a way that doesn't do anything

863
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,740
is generally beneficial.

864
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,120
But technically, a dummy load, by the way,

865
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,840
is an electrical engineering term, is very beneficial,

866
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,240
you know, to test the system.

867
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,860
But nonetheless, what is uncommon is people operating efficiently.

868
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,920
And even when I say efficiently,

869
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,300
each one, each person has their own character.

870
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,980
Each person has their own way of looking at things

871
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:25,000
based on what senses they like to employ when they're looking at things.

872
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:30,120
But there are things that are common that all people have to a certain degree

873
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:34,300
that can be objectified, that could lead to a little more harmony

874
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:40,540
than what people are, I shouldn't say experiencing, but complaining about.

875
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,780
So what we like to do is bring you a point of view.

876
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,460
And sometimes, yes, I will say it goes on a little bit of a rant kind of idea.

877
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,660
Yes, it might be a little harsh,

878
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:56,560
but truly accurate to discuss humanity as a group of morons or imbeciles.

879
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,660
Yes, it's quite accurate, I assure you, if you look at it that way.

880
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,740
But nonetheless, the harshness aside,

881
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:10,060
imploring or asking people to employ objectivity in their lives

882
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:14,020
will lead to efficiency and actually using their intuitiveness,

883
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,480
which is granted to each individual.

884
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,560
One person might have an intuition based on something a little more

885
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,760
a different subject matter or perception than another.

886
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:28,440
And having this shared objectively, again,

887
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:32,440
perhaps this is where ideas and thoughts and things come from.

888
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,760
And these are all uncommon.

889
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,860
You know, when you hear people discussing the current societies

890
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:43,160
and the current systems in place, objectify it.

891
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,640
And you will see what is being discussed is absolutely worthless.

892
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,600
It is absolutely tripe and junk.

893
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:54,460
When I say worthless, I mean, I like to throw in the idea that

894
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:55,880
what you consider worthless,

895
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:59,060
one man's treasure is another man's garbage and vice versa.

896
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,220
I've actually discussed this with people.

897
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,420
Sometimes I get a little critical on what people are doing or saying,

898
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,520
but I kind of let them be because, yes,

899
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,440
one man's treasure is another man's trash.

900
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:15,300
So I think it's just let them do what they want

901
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,380
because there's a lot of trash collecting going on.

902
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,120
But welcome back, Seth.

903
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,560
So I think you're back.

904
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:26,100
So, yeah, I played a little bit of Gustav Le Bon,

905
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:31,240
the little excerpt on it because I believe that,

906
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:35,720
well, I believe, meaning repetition has its value

907
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:40,720
and repetition has its own way of,

908
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:46,260
let's say, setting in the mind the message that is being put out.

909
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:49,060
And the message is basically, be careful of what you do.

910
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,980
Be careful of information as it comes to you.

911
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,140
Learn to objectify.

912
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:56,760
You know, that's why very often we bring up,

913
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,320
you hear any biblical discussion,

914
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,620
if the first thing or within the first part of what they're discussing,

915
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,880
they don't mention that there is no public access to the text,

916
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,300
you're having a problem.

917
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,980
So this is our first hour.

918
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:12,920
We will be back.

919
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:16,120
Glad to have Seth back as well and take a break.

920
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,980
We'll see you guys at the second hour.

921
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:24,200
Welcome back to Uncommon Sense here on American Freedom Radio

922
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:29,180
at AmericanFreedomRadio.com as well as UncommonRadio.com.

923
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,260
My name is Seth and I am joined as well by the Greek.

924
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:35,640
Greetings.

925
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,400
Yes, yes, and welcome everyone.

926
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,300
Everyone, let's say four or five people listening.

927
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,280
And nonetheless, we keep going.

928
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,620
This is our second hour.

929
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,480
And, you know, Seth, I just want to tag on,

930
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,400
someone tagged on one of the emails here and on the Skype messages.

931
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,380
Can you explain the differences and relationships

932
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:57,000
between the physical dimension and the dimension of the gods?

933
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,520
And where are they if they never die?

934
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:00,860
Let's go backwards.

935
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,260
The gods do die and they can be put to death.

936
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,200
How clear that is to you?

937
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,340
I don't know, but it becomes very clear if you study.

938
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:13,180
But if you hate studying and you hate knowledge,

939
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,380
well, that's another thing.

940
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:19,240
So let's just say at this point, the gods are subject to death.

941
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,400
That's why there was a film called The Matrix.

942
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:26,100
And I found it astonishing how they revealed there was a section of the film.

943
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,040
And it's really sad, by the way.

944
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:30,900
This is a commentary that society, if you listen to Special Alternative Media,

945
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,280
they give a lot of movie references.

946
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,440
It's like, man, that just really proves what I've said a while back that,

947
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,680
you know, everyone thinks everything was created maybe a couple of decades ago.

948
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:43,520
But nonetheless, the movie, the film called The Matrix,

949
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,280
has said that one of the paraphrase here is that if you die in The Matrix

950
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,600
or you're killed in The Matrix, that you die in real life.

951
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,020
Now, that's how the gods operate.

952
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,260
Also, if you're a god and you manifest physically,

953
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:00,040
you know, meaning spirit animated through material known as aka a living being,

954
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,700
and that living being is slaughtered or put to death, you die spiritually as well.

955
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,740
You're put into disanimation, unanimated, right?

956
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:15,480
And your god friends on the other side will say, oh, he died, right?

957
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,060
And you might make some enemies if you kill a god,

958
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,260
whether intentionally or unintentionally,

959
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,200
and might actually start reading some ancient texts

960
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,740
and see how that's brought up prolifically.

961
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,640
But yeah, they do die.

962
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,240
And where do they go?

963
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,780
Basically, death is a state of unanimation.

964
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:37,680
People are still subject to the ridiculous aspect of what happens after you die.

965
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:42,100
The ridiculous aspect is, go talk to someone about what happens after you die,

966
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:46,400
and the majority of the people will give you something that is akin to the teacup ride

967
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,760
or Thunder Mountain or Mickey Mouse or something at Disneyland.

968
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,500
They are operating in a pure fantasy waiting room scenario.

969
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,140
What I mean about this is, no, do I have first-hand knowledge?

970
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:59,220
No, don't need it.

971
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,640
A lot of people say, do you have first-hand knowledge?

972
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,700
That is the most ridiculous thing to ask someone

973
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:05,660
unless you're operating as a prankster.

974
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:10,200
For example, all you folks out there who want first-hand knowledge about everything,

975
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:16,740
hey, I got a pretty good report that if you put the hand inside of a blender when it's on,

976
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,160
you're going to lose the fingers.

977
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,160
That report is good enough for me.

978
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,560
I don't need first-hand knowledge.

979
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:22,920
No.

980
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,340
If I stand in front of a car, on a speeding car on a highway,

981
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,020
that it's going to flatten me out and kill me.

982
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,760
I don't need first-hand knowledge of that.

983
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:31,820
Right.

984
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,020
So all you folks out there that are pranking or actually have,

985
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:42,620
like metaphorically being pranksters, can't address you.

986
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:43,120
Sorry.

987
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,840
I want pranksters.

988
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:50,500
I'll go to doctors, priests, rabbis, lawyers, whatever, politicians.

989
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,500
There's plenty of pranking going on.

990
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:54,280
But here's the thing.

991
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:55,940
When you...

992
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:57,100
You don't even have to go to them.

993
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,800
You can just turn the television on.

994
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,200
But go ahead.

995
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,020
Or the media, any media.

996
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,140
Now, here's the point.

997
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,960
It's a state of unanimation death.

998
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,820
It's just like being asleep without dreaming.

999
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
And we did discuss dreaming, not you and I, Seth,

1000
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,560
but on a previous sonic experience or presentation.

1001
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,780
When you're dreaming, by the way, you're being plugged.

1002
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:20,760
Just like someone walking up to a dormant computer and putting in a USB stick.

1003
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,460
Usually, it's a low-level spiritual entities that are messing with you while you're sleeping

1004
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:29,400
so they can high-five each other watching you talk about it the next day.

1005
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,900
It doesn't mean that higher-ranking spiritual entities or

1006
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,000
gods will not also send their messengers to give you a dream.

1007
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:43,960
But if you get a dream from a higher-ranking spiritual being,

1008
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,620
you probably won't wake up.

1009
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:48,440
Or you will wake up with severe physical trauma.

1010
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,460
And they will also identify themselves.

1011
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:56,340
Where the pranking spiritual entities make you think that it's your dream.

1012
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:57,720
It's my dream.

1013
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:58,560
I dreamt this.

1014
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,340
I dreamt that.

1015
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,240
I, I, I, me, me, me.

1016
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:05,500
So, and they're just laughing their asses off at you, folks.

1017
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,860
But once you understand that the purpose of sleep is to rest,

1018
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:13,580
that's why when you look at these ridiculous religious ceremonies known as funerals,

1019
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:17,100
the idiot that is conducting the ceremony

1020
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:21,580
will talk about all this stuff, how you're with the Lord, or with this, or with that,

1021
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,720
or going doing this, playing a harp, or going to Denny's for breakfast

1022
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,620
on the other side, or whatever.

1023
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:28,540
What do they write in stone?

1024
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,800
Rest in peace.

1025
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,020
Because you're going to be sleeping.

1026
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,560
Death is the great sleep.

1027
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:36,580
It's no animation.

1028
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,660
There's no, here, here's, how about we throw in another little secret?

1029
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,300
You know, there's a place, by the way,

1030
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,720
where spiritual beings will be held captive on the earth, a physical place.

1031
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,520
But they will know that they're being held captive.

1032
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,160
So that means that they're not going to be killed.

1033
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,140
They're being held captive.

1034
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,380
And this is a place in the earth.

1035
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,920
And if you want to figure it out, you can figure it out.

1036
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:56,380
I'll give you, tell you what it's about.

1037
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,600
The way you deprave or punish these spiritual entities is by sensory deprivation.

1038
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:05,380
So it's kind of like being awake and asleep at the same time.

1039
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:09,440
In other words, there's a place in the earth where these beings will be stored for a millennia.

1040
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,700
And it's a sensory deprivation.

1041
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,480
There's no feeling, no sensation, no light, no sound, nothing.

1042
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:15,720
Quite interesting.

1043
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,180
I figured I'd just throw that out there.

1044
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,860
So, you know, you read about in the ancient texts how these

1045
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,840
being spirits will be chained up for a while, right?

1046
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,780
So I just thought I'd throw that in there.

1047
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:32,020
But yeah, when they die, anything that's dead is inanimated.

1048
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:33,560
There's no dream state.

1049
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,600
You don't come back unless you're brought back.

1050
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,980
And no one has been brought back except for the prototype.

1051
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:41,900
So that was a long explanation around the second part of that email.

1052
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,260
And some people might think that's dogmatic.

1053
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:45,400
That's like the way it is.

1054
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,080
Well, sorry, folks.

1055
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:46,460
You know what?

1056
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:46,880
It is.

1057
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,480
That's a really good report.

1058
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:49,580
Not because I'm saying it.

1059
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,940
And here's the other thing I want to just say.

1060
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,780
If there was anyone that was saying what was being said on Uncommon Sense,

1061
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,540
even close, even 1%, I don't think we'd be doing this.

1062
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,180
I think Seth enjoys conversation.

1063
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:03,840
I do as well.

1064
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:05,000
The Greek does.

1065
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:10,000
But on the other hand, it's like looking at these matters that are

1066
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,640
some of minor, some of great importance,

1067
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,400
depending on your opinion, of course.

1068
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,000
And no one is discussing them.

1069
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:23,160
In other words, I've said before, the media, as prolific as it is,

1070
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,980
is not being used even slightly to its highest and best form

1071
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:31,220
other than a glorified telephone book or streaming music.

1072
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:35,120
And I think it's about time that two hours a week,

1073
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:41,260
something can be perhaps maybe dubbed as saying that the media

1074
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:44,200
is being used for its highest and best reason.

1075
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,280
But anyway, so the rest of it is the differences

1076
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,640
between the relationship between the physical dimension

1077
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,180
and the dimension of the gods don't know.

1078
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:56,760
We know that what we do know that if the gods created everything,

1079
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,200
that they are primary informative.

1080
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,400
So the question there would be,

1081
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,840
what do you know about primary informative conditions?

1082
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:13,680
And what I can report that I've read on that is that

1083
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,380
there it's not a difference of dimension,

1084
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,260
simply a difference of perspective.

1085
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,200
It's all in that mode of thought.

1086
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:26,160
It's all one dimension, the dimensionality,

1087
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:34,460
the idea of like the multiple universes stacked upon the one

1088
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,820
is an inaccurate way of looking at it, I think.

1089
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:44,600
I think that it's all, you know, our perspective is very limited.

1090
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:47,600
Because some maturity as well.

1091
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:48,540
Right.

1092
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,040
Well, yeah.

1093
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:56,180
And, you know, the location in that dimension,

1094
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:00,040
I'd say that it's all right here, so to speak.

1095
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:06,380
But there are physical differences in location, obviously.

1096
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:14,320
But there are a couple of instances in, you know,

1097
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:20,500
the old books that talk about brief moments of time

1098
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:25,560
where an individual or a sizable group of individuals

1099
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:30,740
was shown everything that's going on all around them right now.

1100
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,980
And it broke them.

1101
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:40,420
They, if I'm recalling correctly, begged for it to stop.

1102
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:41,460
Exactly.

1103
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:47,380
Yeah, it's not the fairy godmother and the wicked witch.

1104
01:02:47,980 --> 01:02:51,300
There's no, when you're shown that side,

1105
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:56,340
it's all, how would you say, you might be dematerialized, right?

1106
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,140
You're either rapidly or slowly.

1107
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,560
So it's quite interesting.

1108
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:03,200
It's quite a fearful place.

1109
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:07,260
Yeah, not even to illustrate the awesomeness of it,

1110
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:10,040
just to illustrate that, you know,

1111
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:14,960
it's very possible that there is a lot going on around us immediately.

1112
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:20,340
I mean, like in a room that you're in right now that is not being observed

1113
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:24,780
and that cannot be observed because of the limited perspective.

1114
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:25,980
Yes.

1115
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:29,400
So thinking of it like that is kind of an abstract way, I guess.

1116
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:34,020
But at the same time, it's about as tangible as the intangible can get, I suppose.

1117
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:36,120
So yes, that's what I'd add.

1118
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,680
It should be appreciated.

1119
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:42,800
Now, what I mean should be appreciated is the realm that we exist in,

1120
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,580
that we cannot comprehend or go there, should be appreciated, folks.

1121
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:49,260
Because it's not what you think.

1122
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,740
Hollywood is lying to you.

1123
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:57,180
Your priests, rabbis, imams, ministers, the pope, your college professors,

1124
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:00,320
everyone around you that is telling you about the,

1125
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:03,440
they're all lying to you about this stuff, right?

1126
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,720
Making it happy-go-lucky or it's just whatever you believe

1127
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:10,960
or what you make it or this group says this and this group,

1128
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,980
we believe this group says this and this group believes that.

1129
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:14,960
Well, you pick and choose.

1130
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:16,700
No, it's none of that ridiculous crap.

1131
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:17,820
That's all it is.

1132
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:18,760
It's coprophagia.

1133
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:21,680
Coprophagia.

1134
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:22,480
Look it up.

1135
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,400
C-O-P-R-O-P-H-A-G-I-A.

1136
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:28,260
So here's the point.

1137
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:30,420
The point is appreciate it.

1138
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,840
Stop taking things for granted was one way to look at it, you know,

1139
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,340
and enjoy where you're at.

1140
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:40,120
Be efficient and stop hating knowledge.

1141
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,760
Stop hating good information.

1142
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:45,080
And most people will not admit it, but they sure act like it.

1143
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:49,520
You know, the people that came before you were not ancient primitives.

1144
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,600
Why do you think so much energy, by the way, has been put into obfuscate,

1145
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:57,740
twist, corrupt and not provide accurate information about the past?

1146
01:04:57,980 --> 01:04:59,560
Think about that for a moment, folks.

1147
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:04,560
I'm not just talking about your geopolitical history or history of events.

1148
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:06,520
I'm talking about all of it.

1149
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:13,800
It's very important that people don't get a grip on reality, it seems.

1150
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:18,100
Now, when I say it, I'm not saying that it is very important that it is that way.

1151
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,180
But it is.

1152
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:21,860
You know, I mean, in a good way.

1153
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:27,600
Some of the loose discussions that I have is that

1154
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:32,360
anyone that pretty much figures out the whole truth and nothing about the truth

1155
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:33,340
dematerializes.

1156
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:34,240
You're no longer here.

1157
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:38,020
You know, you see no purpose of it.

1158
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:42,360
You know, it's like you're plucked out or you some interesting stuff going on there.

1159
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:43,300
You know, think about it.

1160
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,880
So just be appreciative.

1161
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:49,640
Going should go back to the we talked about Ecclesiastes, perhaps, you know,

1162
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:49,980
what is it?

1163
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:52,640
Good food, good drink, good convo conversation.

1164
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:58,600
That's that's certainly one of the one of the things that I pulled from that text.

1165
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:03,960
Seeking wisdom is repetitive in in reiterating, you know,

1166
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:08,440
eat well, drink well, good, good company.

1167
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:14,540
That's yeah, it's there's wisdom right there.

1168
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:19,920
It's one of the reasons I enjoy, you know, when we speak about food.

1169
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:25,820
And I think it's a good thing to talk about when we broadcast as well, because,

1170
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,800
you know, it's that's important.

1171
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:33,540
That's important to health, whether you think of that in a spiritual or mental sense.

1172
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,540
And a physical sense.

1173
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:43,400
And that's, you know, if you need that to go anywhere else, it's part of, you know,

1174
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:49,660
the base of just existing in, you know, in this in this place and this time.

1175
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:56,400
Yeah, that's another thing that was discussed in a previous sonic presentation was we called it

1176
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:56,980
the container.

1177
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:03,080
I think it was episode two talked about how the body works, not because of some scientific idea

1178
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,780
or some quack, you know, quackery.

1179
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:09,720
But by the way, still, I have to do this, by the way, so that I have to say it,

1180
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:14,180
you know, when I convey in an engine driven wagon,

1181
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:20,260
and I see like a medical building or a hospital, I have to pull over and stuff the ears with

1182
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:24,600
cotton, because if I don't, the quacking is so loud, the ears are ringing for like a week later.

1183
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:30,660
You know, and people are still anyway, that's kind of a joke, take it how you want.

1184
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,440
But the quacking is so loud.

1185
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:38,920
I mean, yeah, if you live about a mile, if you live within a mile of a medical establishment,

1186
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,520
or so, I mean, can't you hear the quacking?

1187
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:46,220
But, but we talked about how the body works up because based on what the ridiculous grunt,

1188
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,420
now, they've done some good grunt work, by the way.

1189
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:54,640
But we talked about how the body works based on how objective you want to be, you know,

1190
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:58,680
using a lot of the grunt work, you know, that they've come up with, like,

1191
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:02,020
if anyone researches how the intestines work, go look at the intestines.

1192
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,900
I mean, don't look at a graphic bloody image.

1193
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:05,240
But look at the diagram.

1194
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,580
Some of them are fairly accurate.

1195
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:07,960
Look at all the layering.

1196
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:10,680
Nothing passes through that.

1197
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,100
It's all hydrophobic.

1198
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:14,360
It's not porous.

1199
01:08:15,399 --> 01:08:19,720
So when you eat food, you're telling you, you know, I was once on a call,

1200
01:08:19,899 --> 01:08:22,240
I think it might even be broadcast in another place.

1201
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:26,500
There was someone there selling, I've got 30 years medical experience.

1202
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,100
And you should take this because it's absorbed by the body.

1203
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,220
And I'm like, what are you talking about?

1204
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,359
The body doesn't absorb anything.

1205
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,100
And I started going into the, you know,

1206
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:36,760
supposedly they're 30 year professional in the medical field.

1207
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:41,180
They didn't know that the intestines are sealed off.

1208
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,439
And I mean, this is just ridiculous stuff.

1209
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:49,779
I mean, there's prankster, obviously, you know, MD, doctor, whatever, prankster.

1210
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:56,620
So this sonic presentation called The Container was, I believe,

1211
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:59,920
pretty comprehensive in discussing some of the fallacies and some of the

1212
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,779
actual points on what's going on and considering it,

1213
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:07,580
considering what food is and what drink is and how the body works.

1214
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,479
And that's fantastic in its way.

1215
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:10,760
And I think like you mentioned earlier,

1216
01:09:10,899 --> 01:09:15,100
discovering the true nature of the realm of the gods would be,

1217
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:19,040
as you mentioned, memorialized about a certain group of people

1218
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:22,180
who were made privy to it said, stop, you know, it's enough.

1219
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:22,939
We don't want more.

1220
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,899
If you actually start looking into how headquarters,

1221
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:30,020
the actual body that you're using works, you may not want to continue

1222
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:34,600
because it is radically different than what you've been told and what you think.

1223
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:42,670
So it's but on one side, that's an aspect that how it can be perceived.

1224
01:09:42,729 --> 01:09:46,950
On the other side, if the soul, the spirit and the body work together

1225
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:49,210
to animate the being known as yourself,

1226
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:51,630
then you have, let's call that headquarters,

1227
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:55,070
the physical part being the building or the physical aspect.

1228
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:59,110
If you're deceived about that, you're deceived about headquarters.

1229
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:02,250
Don't you think that anything, if headquarters is full of deception,

1230
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:05,210
what do you think will be allowed to come in?

1231
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:07,270
Deception. And what do you think will come out?

1232
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,290
Deception. And when was the last time you turned into any media?

1233
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:13,250
Anyway, we'll dig again there.

1234
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:18,710
But you see, there's a level of how much do you really want to know?

1235
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:22,130
And you don't have to go far away to do it.

1236
01:10:22,770 --> 01:10:26,090
It's just if you stop hating knowing and hating information

1237
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:28,470
and start being objective and intuitive,

1238
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:32,150
you might actually make some headway and find out it's not what you think

1239
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:33,690
and not what you thought.

1240
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:36,050
I don't know. There's an old saying, perhaps,

1241
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:37,550
maybe I kind of twisted it around a little.

1242
01:10:37,910 --> 01:10:40,250
You can bring a horse to water, but you can't make him think.

1243
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:46,590
Speaking of horses, by the way, I want to interject a good report

1244
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:49,830
that I got regarding a horse and maybe applying some treatment.

1245
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:52,350
What do you think, Seth? Go into it for a minute or two.

1246
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:57,370
Somebody that's in Europe has a horse that sprained the ankle,

1247
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:00,570
got pretty swollen. And what do I do?

1248
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:02,390
And I said, well, you know, that's lymphatic, man.

1249
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:04,570
You got to wrap that as tight as possible.

1250
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:08,250
And I mean tight and then let it release it every 15 minutes.

1251
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:09,210
It's going to take a lot of work.

1252
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:11,350
But in a day or two, it should go down.

1253
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:14,770
The third day, 72 hours, roughly, should be gone.

1254
01:11:15,550 --> 01:11:17,090
Well, this person went out and did that.

1255
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:21,650
And they were quite happy to report back that everything worked as such.

1256
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:26,590
And typically a horse that has a problem like that,

1257
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:27,830
it could escalate, it could get better.

1258
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:30,410
But typically things don't get better on their own like that.

1259
01:11:30,890 --> 01:11:32,910
The horse was limping around and dragging around.

1260
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:37,990
And after three days of just very tight wrapping and releasing,

1261
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:40,570
the horse is as good as new.

1262
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:44,950
So I just wanted to report if anyone is interested in understanding

1263
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:48,210
how to promote healing in injury,

1264
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:51,410
whether it's human-based or animal-based or whatever,

1265
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:55,170
study lymphology, the lymphatic system.

1266
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:58,030
And you'll notice when you start doing that

1267
01:11:58,030 --> 01:11:59,630
on that wonderful thing they call the internet,

1268
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:02,910
you'll see how little information there is about it.

1269
01:12:03,150 --> 01:12:05,090
But yet whatever information is out there,

1270
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:07,790
you will find that it is very helpful.

1271
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,090
And intuitive.

1272
01:12:10,530 --> 01:12:12,190
So I believe one of the...

1273
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:14,170
You've heard of blood testing,

1274
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:17,470
you know, looking for pathogens and conditions and things like that.

1275
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:20,650
Well, there was a particular health institute in Europe a while back

1276
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:21,850
that didn't do any blood testing.

1277
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:25,430
They did lymphatic fluid testing because it was far more effective.

1278
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:30,110
So get into comprehending what the lymph system is,

1279
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:32,190
not just the lymph nodes and the fluid itself,

1280
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:36,630
but its effect on the physical being when it comes to injury.

1281
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:41,090
And you will find you'll be able to do things

1282
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:44,870
that might even be called miraculous to some degree.

1283
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:49,770
So anyway, speaking of miracles, Seth,

1284
01:12:50,290 --> 01:12:51,810
what else would you like to discuss?

1285
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:53,270
So we've got about 40 minutes.

1286
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:55,810
I didn't really plan anything for the discussion.

1287
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:58,690
We basically said we'd do some things and we didn't,

1288
01:12:58,830 --> 01:12:59,890
which was read news articles.

1289
01:13:00,070 --> 01:13:05,630
But in essence, I think just having a two-hour spot here

1290
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:09,690
where we could actually are free and open to discuss things

1291
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:12,190
that not only is not being discussed,

1292
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:13,970
but no one else seemingly can't discuss.

1293
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:17,090
So here we are.

1294
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:18,910
Yeah, absolutely.

1295
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:22,850
Talked about the email that was...

1296
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:26,010
Or I don't even know if it was an email, actually.

1297
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:30,530
The message that was, shouldn't call everyone stupid.

1298
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:32,150
I'm paraphrasing, of course.

1299
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:42,750
But it's not as if we are telling you or anyone else to hate anyone.

1300
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:44,390
That's not it at all.

1301
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:45,630
Just kind of looking at everything.

1302
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:49,570
I don't know if rationally is the word,

1303
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:52,250
but it is certainly rational.

1304
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:57,890
Just making observations and stating those observations.

1305
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:02,170
We'd like to get into the text a little bit,

1306
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:05,030
but we're doing that in the same way.

1307
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:10,730
Reading what was preserved and sharing that.

1308
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,230
So, yeah.

1309
01:14:14,190 --> 01:14:17,670
Yeah, that concept is going to slam people

1310
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:19,090
and they're going to take it laying down.

1311
01:14:19,230 --> 01:14:20,810
I mean, imagine right now,

1312
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:23,090
just normally a brick wall falling on someone.

1313
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,550
You know, the person's going to yell, ouch, right?

1314
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:28,970
But something even bigger than a brick wall will fall on society

1315
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,830
and they're going to just be like, oh, okay, fine.

1316
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:31,490
Seem normal.

1317
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:35,610
That is proof of a cosmic influence, you know, allowing it to happen.

1318
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:38,210
And that will be where people will be going back

1319
01:14:38,210 --> 01:14:39,990
and actually referencing things.

1320
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:42,870
And it's going to be a really bad day

1321
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:45,650
for those that are in the religious community.

1322
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:48,190
You know, the leaders, the preachers, ministers, priests, whatever.

1323
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:50,070
The moronic leadership.

1324
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:54,310
And it's also going to be a bad day for many academics.

1325
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:58,110
It's going to be a bad day for a lot of entitled classes.

1326
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:00,410
You know, bad day meaning days.

1327
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:03,790
The one that people will start to spend more than,

1328
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:05,410
maybe I'd say five minutes a week

1329
01:15:05,410 --> 01:15:06,830
looking at what things are based on.

1330
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:10,410
You know, you may not have, like, for example,

1331
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:13,910
the Western world may not have Moloch or Santa Claus

1332
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:14,850
as their chief god.

1333
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:16,150
Go figure.

1334
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:20,390
So, you know, around that time of year.

1335
01:15:20,990 --> 01:15:25,070
I mean, these are things that probably we'll be discussing

1336
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:27,950
to a certain level as time goes on.

1337
01:15:28,670 --> 01:15:30,590
Right now, you can't really discuss these things,

1338
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:33,930
at least on the internet, radio as such,

1339
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:36,130
because there's still, if you listen a little bit

1340
01:15:36,130 --> 01:15:38,590
to how people are bringing subject matter

1341
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:40,690
on what they call internet radio,

1342
01:15:40,830 --> 01:15:43,810
they still introduce people that have academic backgrounds

1343
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:47,810
and beliefs and things as being something good

1344
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:49,230
and setting precedent.

1345
01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:50,150
So you've got to laugh.

1346
01:15:50,790 --> 01:15:53,230
And you still have children being told by their parents,

1347
01:15:53,730 --> 01:15:55,290
yeah, they know that they're not going to learn anything

1348
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:57,290
for 12 years, but they've got to do it anyway

1349
01:15:57,290 --> 01:15:59,510
because they did it, right?

1350
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:02,350
So that's still going on very prolifically.

1351
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:05,010
Social conditioning, essentially.

1352
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:09,010
But when you see it going on on such a level

1353
01:16:09,010 --> 01:16:10,850
that they're emphatic about doing it,

1354
01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:11,970
that it's not time yet.

1355
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:14,170
But when you see that falling apart,

1356
01:16:15,290 --> 01:16:17,350
you know, when you see people trying to bring on

1357
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:20,850
guests to discuss things, and they will start

1358
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:22,630
to not want to bring people who have

1359
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:26,310
academic credentials, you'll see that this thing is cracking

1360
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:27,830
and people are coming to their senses.

1361
01:16:29,370 --> 01:16:30,830
And when you'll see parents saying,

1362
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:33,850
no, we're not sending you to this ridiculous institution

1363
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:36,870
for 12 years, and then you see it's cracking out,

1364
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:38,230
you see the time is coming now.

1365
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:41,010
It's time to come out now and maybe discuss things

1366
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:43,650
in a more clear and objective fashion.

1367
01:16:43,710 --> 01:16:45,090
But right now, it's clearly not.

1368
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:47,110
It might seem like 100 years away,

1369
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:47,930
but it's not, folks.

1370
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:50,250
It's only a few years away before the cracks

1371
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:51,610
in the system start to arise.

1372
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:57,030
So it'll be quite an interesting time.

1373
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:58,570
And then there'll be a short time to discuss

1374
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:00,290
these things openly, and then it's kind of time

1375
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:01,550
to put your head down and walk away

1376
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:05,170
because there's going to be quite a fervor

1377
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:07,370
of revived things.

1378
01:17:07,650 --> 01:17:10,110
And actually, it'll be more than a few years

1379
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:11,990
to discuss these things openly.

1380
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:13,730
But right now is not the time.

1381
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:17,410
But I think we've put out enough.

1382
01:17:17,530 --> 01:17:18,790
I mean, we started off the program

1383
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:20,090
just saying, here's a secret, folks.

1384
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:21,810
And truly, it is.

1385
01:17:22,090 --> 01:17:23,150
And there are many secrets.

1386
01:17:23,410 --> 01:17:24,750
And there's no mystery.

1387
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:27,370
There's just secrets because mystery means no one knows.

1388
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:29,610
And that's kind of leaving the gods out of it.

1389
01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:34,290
You know, so, yeah, on that.

1390
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:35,570
And by the way, you brought up the term

1391
01:17:35,570 --> 01:17:36,630
of hate and stuff.

1392
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:40,290
You know, people think hate is a bad thing.

1393
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:42,610
Well, then love would be a bad thing

1394
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:43,710
because it takes a lot of passion

1395
01:17:43,710 --> 01:17:45,090
to love and to hate.

1396
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:50,810
The opposite of love may not be hate.

1397
01:17:51,050 --> 01:17:53,830
It's apathy, indifference,

1398
01:17:54,830 --> 01:17:57,210
because it takes a lot of passion and effort

1399
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:58,690
to do both love and hate.

1400
01:18:00,030 --> 01:18:02,330
You know, look at, quote, unquote,

1401
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:03,770
hate groups or hating on someone.

1402
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:07,350
It's not, you know, it takes a lot of energy,

1403
01:18:07,470 --> 01:18:08,670
a lot of focus to do that.

1404
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,030
It takes a lot of energy to love.

1405
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:13,010
You know, the opposite of those.

1406
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:14,930
They're both actions.

1407
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:19,110
They're both like we're in the English language.

1408
01:18:19,290 --> 01:18:23,310
We're limited by the many ideas

1409
01:18:23,310 --> 01:18:26,530
that are conveyed with a single word.

1410
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:31,710
It can be handy for art and poetry,

1411
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:35,970
but for, you know, expressing

1412
01:18:38,590 --> 01:18:39,850
quantities and, you know,

1413
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:42,570
or like that side, something tangible.

1414
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:47,090
It's one of the peeves I have

1415
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:48,090
with the English language,

1416
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:49,970
which is the one that I, you know,

1417
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:51,170
certainly know the most words.

1418
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:54,830
And I don't know how well I speak it,

1419
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:58,050
but it's, you know,

1420
01:18:58,230 --> 01:19:01,890
all of these very, very different concepts

1421
01:19:01,890 --> 01:19:05,070
that we express with these single words,

1422
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:10,150
but in that some of the mechanics are lost.

1423
01:19:10,610 --> 01:19:12,270
Like, you know, the fact that love and hate,

1424
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:13,770
those are things that are done.

1425
01:19:14,110 --> 01:19:16,050
It's not just an idea or a concept

1426
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:20,330
that is held as something, you know, acted upon.

1427
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:25,790
So yeah, and the opposite of that

1428
01:19:25,790 --> 01:19:27,750
would be inaction, you know, apathy.

1429
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:30,070
Whereas just like you're saying,

1430
01:19:30,130 --> 01:19:33,890
it takes a lot of effort to hate or to love.

1431
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:39,890
So there's a lot of what's done.

1432
01:19:40,790 --> 01:19:42,010
I, you know, I certainly hate,

1433
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:45,710
I've said in the past in private conversations

1434
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:47,930
a number of times that, you know,

1435
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:51,350
music is one of the few things that people do

1436
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:54,910
that actually like beyond that.

1437
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:58,110
It's all kind of absurd when it's looked at

1438
01:19:58,770 --> 01:20:01,170
from a perspective that is not

1439
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:05,390
very, very small and localized.

1440
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:09,030
Like trying to see everything as,

1441
01:20:10,190 --> 01:20:14,370
if you look at all of humanity as an organism,

1442
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:15,910
you know, a single entity,

1443
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:21,150
a lot of what is done is absolutely absurd.

1444
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:25,490
So I like music though.

1445
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:27,430
Like I said, I still like people

1446
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:29,670
and I like the music they make.

1447
01:20:29,670 --> 01:20:32,590
I don't like them in large quantities.

1448
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:36,890
They tend to be less reasonable in large quantities.

1449
01:20:37,070 --> 01:20:38,370
I'm not sure why that is.

1450
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:42,030
But the crowd, I think the crowd brought it up a few times.

1451
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:42,470
Yeah.

1452
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:44,210
He did a good job objectifying it.

1453
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:47,950
But yeah, the music might be using human attributes

1454
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:50,370
at a highest and best use is, you know,

1455
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:52,170
is one way to view it.

1456
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:53,290
And, you know, here's the thing.

1457
01:20:53,710 --> 01:20:55,110
Here's the thing we've discussed, you know,

1458
01:20:55,130 --> 01:20:57,230
like for example, reading was never done silently.

1459
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:58,650
It was a pretty new phenomenon,

1460
01:20:58,650 --> 01:20:59,710
maybe 500 years.

1461
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:01,610
It was always done reading aloud.

1462
01:21:01,770 --> 01:21:03,050
Like if you went to an ancient library,

1463
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:04,350
you were given reading material

1464
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:05,210
or picked reading material

1465
01:21:05,210 --> 01:21:06,710
and you went to something that looked like a little booth.

1466
01:21:07,570 --> 01:21:08,450
And if it was really long

1467
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:09,450
and you had to read the whole thing,

1468
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:10,670
you brought several people with you.

1469
01:21:10,710 --> 01:21:11,690
And that was the, let's say,

1470
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:13,110
the inception of the conference room.

1471
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:16,570
But, you know, the music,

1472
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:18,950
when people were going to play music back then also,

1473
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:20,670
it was considered a spiritual act.

1474
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,750
You were interacting with the gods.

1475
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:27,310
You know, go look at some of the writings that were done.

1476
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:27,930
Of course, you know,

1477
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:30,150
if you tell anyone to go back more than 10 years now,

1478
01:21:30,170 --> 01:21:32,150
it's like, oh no, none of that stuff existed.

1479
01:21:32,350 --> 01:21:34,070
All of that stuff, those were stupid people.

1480
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:36,510
You know, everything sprang into existence

1481
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:37,570
just 100 years ago.

1482
01:21:38,330 --> 01:21:41,370
You know, I mean, this is the level of humanity at this point.

1483
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:43,170
But when humanity does go back

1484
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:46,290
and look at how things were done,

1485
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:47,870
it will be quite intuitive.

1486
01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:49,350
I mean, they might reject it.

1487
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:51,030
Typically people say,

1488
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:52,970
well, I play music because it sounds good and I like it.

1489
01:21:52,990 --> 01:21:53,770
But, you know, if you go back

1490
01:21:53,770 --> 01:21:55,130
and look at the history of it,

1491
01:21:55,670 --> 01:21:56,930
it was an interesting,

1492
01:21:58,350 --> 01:21:59,550
how would you say,

1493
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:03,210
things were more directed or the conscious effort.

1494
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:05,510
The conscious effort of making the music

1495
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:06,850
was not just making the music,

1496
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:09,510
was that people had a little bit more understanding

1497
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:11,390
on why they were doing things, I should say.

1498
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:17,430
Yeah, it's the natural,

1499
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:22,570
I think that the natural element to making music

1500
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:23,850
and the desire to make music

1501
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:25,930
is certainly a spiritual one.

1502
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:30,010
And currently, like in what is broad,

1503
01:22:30,090 --> 01:22:31,350
what I observe, you know,

1504
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:35,390
I'm surrounded by music a great deal of the time,

1505
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:36,770
all sorts.

1506
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:41,950
And currently that element is still acknowledged,

1507
01:22:42,130 --> 01:22:44,490
but it's done so like most other things

1508
01:22:44,490 --> 01:22:47,270
that are acknowledged in parody.

1509
01:22:48,190 --> 01:22:51,990
It's done like all of the,

1510
01:22:52,630 --> 01:22:54,850
any type of music, just about any type of music.

1511
01:22:55,610 --> 01:22:58,030
There will be elements to it,

1512
01:22:58,110 --> 01:23:02,070
even in the way that it's marketed or packaged,

1513
01:23:02,570 --> 01:23:04,110
you know, in the tangible sense,

1514
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:10,070
or even just a photograph associated with a song

1515
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:12,030
on the internet, you know,

1516
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:14,130
which is becoming more and more common way,

1517
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:15,590
you know, as you were saying earlier,

1518
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:18,550
broadcasting music, streaming it.

1519
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:22,990
And there are elements that are undeniably spiritual

1520
01:23:22,990 --> 01:23:26,690
with any of that in any sense of the term,

1521
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:29,450
colloquially or, you know, etymologically.

1522
01:23:30,650 --> 01:23:33,630
And, but it's all done in parody,

1523
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:35,810
very tongue in cheek,

1524
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:40,150
even if that's not the intention or the style,

1525
01:23:40,350 --> 01:23:41,790
just the way that it's done.

1526
01:23:43,470 --> 01:23:45,370
Sorry, I kind of rambling there, but.

1527
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:46,010
No, that's fine.

1528
01:23:46,050 --> 01:23:47,250
Well, music is still used.

1529
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:49,750
It's a food in a way.

1530
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:53,810
In other words, it satisfies a hunger

1531
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:56,330
or it satisfies a palate.

1532
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:59,390
It satisfies a desire to listen, you know.

1533
01:24:00,950 --> 01:24:05,170
You know, people like music as generally they do.

1534
01:24:05,990 --> 01:24:08,630
There's something that is considered to be pleasant,

1535
01:24:08,730 --> 01:24:11,450
even the most unpleasant sounding music,

1536
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:14,070
by the way, there are people who find it to be pleasant,

1537
01:24:14,210 --> 01:24:14,910
right, you know, there's,

1538
01:24:14,910 --> 01:24:17,810
I basically say, you know,

1539
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:20,310
if it sounds good, it is good, you know, essentially.

1540
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:23,310
And also combined with music,

1541
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:26,510
let's not leave out the aspect of dance, right?

1542
01:24:26,630 --> 01:24:28,010
The physical interaction.

1543
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:30,750
So, you know, these things, again,

1544
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:33,030
are still being used quite a bit.

1545
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:36,950
And, but the purpose of them has been sort of changed,

1546
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:38,850
you know.

1547
01:24:39,390 --> 01:24:42,990
But the, it's, I'd say that it's

1548
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:46,050
the perception of its nature that has changed,

1549
01:24:46,430 --> 01:24:48,410
not its nature itself.

1550
01:24:49,110 --> 01:24:51,370
Like, I don't think what music is,

1551
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:56,130
has changed, has gotten better or gotten worse.

1552
01:24:56,370 --> 01:24:58,570
I'd say that music has always been music.

1553
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:02,470
And it's the perception of that has changed.

1554
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:04,650
There's, you know, a lot of,

1555
01:25:05,150 --> 01:25:07,770
you can look at things electronic and done on the computer

1556
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:11,210
as being like a pseudo world,

1557
01:25:11,210 --> 01:25:13,130
like another reality within our own,

1558
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:15,310
because of all that can be done with it,

1559
01:25:15,390 --> 01:25:18,370
just simply with the manipulation of ones and zeros.

1560
01:25:19,650 --> 01:25:21,110
When you look at it like that,

1561
01:25:21,150 --> 01:25:22,810
and you look at the building blocks

1562
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:25,690
that we are able to observe around us,

1563
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:29,530
the immensity of the hologram,

1564
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:32,690
the whole image that we're experiencing currently

1565
01:25:32,690 --> 01:25:35,010
that we are in is,

1566
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:37,770
it's kind of mind boggling, I guess.

1567
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:40,070
I'm going off on a tangent there.

1568
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:41,450
Oh, no, that's fine.

1569
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:42,190
Yeah.

1570
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:44,250
Go ahead.

1571
01:25:44,450 --> 01:25:46,450
I like that work to boggle.

1572
01:25:46,530 --> 01:25:48,310
Let's do a quick look up on that,

1573
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:49,710
or boggling.

1574
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:51,610
I've been looking up words.

1575
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:53,570
Yeah, boggling.

1576
01:25:54,090 --> 01:25:56,230
Mind boggling, the boggle.

1577
01:25:56,710 --> 01:26:00,050
To start with fright, as startled horse does.

1578
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:01,390
Shy, take alarm.

1579
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:03,170
Middle-aged boog speeter.

1580
01:26:03,970 --> 01:26:05,970
Let's do, I guess, a bug.

1581
01:26:06,510 --> 01:26:08,770
Meaning to raise scruples, hesitate.

1582
01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:10,650
I guess that flips it around a little bit.

1583
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:13,650
Boggled, but one who hesitates.

1584
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:19,370
Or to start with fright, as startled horse does.

1585
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:20,010
Yeah.

1586
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:22,690
Yeah, that's accurate.

1587
01:26:24,230 --> 01:26:25,570
It's kind of frightful.

1588
01:26:25,790 --> 01:26:27,330
It's kind of startling.

1589
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:29,530
Taking alarm, yeah.

1590
01:26:31,530 --> 01:26:34,430
Every once in a while, I'll use a word accurately

1591
01:26:34,430 --> 01:26:35,790
and not even be aware of it.

1592
01:26:36,550 --> 01:26:37,510
Mm-hmm.

1593
01:26:37,550 --> 01:26:41,450
Yeah, so this is part of the, let's say, the discussion,

1594
01:26:42,710 --> 01:26:45,490
something as common as music and common as dance.

1595
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:48,030
When people do a little bit of, let's see,

1596
01:26:48,090 --> 01:26:50,530
historical access to what it was about,

1597
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:54,370
it actually fills the mind or the spirit

1598
01:26:54,370 --> 01:26:57,410
with a little more substantiation on why we're doing it

1599
01:26:57,410 --> 01:26:58,150
and it's okay.

1600
01:26:58,590 --> 01:27:01,250
Or when things are said to not be okay

1601
01:27:01,790 --> 01:27:03,810
and things that are said to be okay to do,

1602
01:27:04,770 --> 01:27:06,690
or fit and proper or whatever,

1603
01:27:07,290 --> 01:27:09,570
it's good to be able to fill in a little bit

1604
01:27:09,570 --> 01:27:12,770
of how things were done to understand where you're at.

1605
01:27:13,290 --> 01:27:15,950
One thing I used to say in public a lot is,

1606
01:27:16,870 --> 01:27:18,910
in order to understand a thing more completely,

1607
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:21,910
you have to understand the history of that thing, right?

1608
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:24,870
And once you look into the history of that thing,

1609
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:28,110
it tends to put things in a more solid perspective.

1610
01:27:29,250 --> 01:27:31,270
And then, of course, there are many determinations

1611
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:32,910
that can be made beyond that.

1612
01:27:33,430 --> 01:27:35,090
Is this something fit and proper

1613
01:27:35,090 --> 01:27:36,670
based on the way that I want to live?

1614
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:38,050
Or is it not?

1615
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:39,990
Or I didn't know that.

1616
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:41,450
How many times do you hear that?

1617
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:42,810
I didn't know that about this.

1618
01:27:44,570 --> 01:27:49,170
There's, again, bringing the best and highest use,

1619
01:27:49,410 --> 01:27:51,230
you always kind of harp and rant about

1620
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:53,970
how the quote-unquote internet is not being used

1621
01:27:53,970 --> 01:27:55,270
at its best and highest use.

1622
01:27:55,390 --> 01:27:56,630
Not at all, very little is.

1623
01:27:57,790 --> 01:28:00,090
But one way to use one's energy

1624
01:28:00,090 --> 01:28:01,450
in the best and highest use

1625
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:03,730
is when you're embarking on something that is new

1626
01:28:04,250 --> 01:28:07,570
or you have interest in, find out where it came from

1627
01:28:07,570 --> 01:28:09,350
or what it's supposed to be based on.

1628
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:15,870
Now, this is not necessarily for one's overall benefit

1629
01:28:15,870 --> 01:28:18,810
because it will not benefit you socially.

1630
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:21,110
Because what we mean by socially,

1631
01:28:22,430 --> 01:28:24,630
go back to Gustavo Bonds, the crowd, right?

1632
01:28:24,810 --> 01:28:29,090
Go to any group that is protesting or activism

1633
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:33,170
or political or religious or whatever,

1634
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:36,770
and you will see the objectivism that Gustavo Bond

1635
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:39,630
brought out about these groups very clearly.

1636
01:28:40,470 --> 01:28:43,210
But when you start looking at what things are based on,

1637
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:45,770
the crowd mentality will not favor it.

1638
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:48,790
It's very difficult to go and discuss

1639
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:50,650
with someone who is deeply ingrained

1640
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:53,770
in the crowd mentality the nature of things

1641
01:28:53,770 --> 01:28:54,870
or how things are.

1642
01:28:54,950 --> 01:28:56,430
Like, for example, we brought up scientists

1643
01:28:56,430 --> 01:28:58,230
several times today.

1644
01:28:58,230 --> 01:29:00,530
And that's a fairly new term.

1645
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:03,830
Prior to that, they were known as natural philosophers.

1646
01:29:05,150 --> 01:29:09,250
In other words, learning or wisdom about,

1647
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:13,030
friendly wisdom to nature, I guess would be the way to say it.

1648
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:13,430
That's right.

1649
01:29:13,950 --> 01:29:16,030
A fondness for the wisdom of nature.

1650
01:29:16,550 --> 01:29:16,830
Yes.

1651
01:29:16,990 --> 01:29:19,130
And the scientists were around

1652
01:29:19,130 --> 01:29:20,870
when it became more technocratic,

1653
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:23,030
meaning the government's involvement

1654
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:26,390
or the ruling class now using it as a tool.

1655
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:29,090
And by the way, kind of like all over the place here,

1656
01:29:29,130 --> 01:29:31,650
but here, folks, this is something that you need to consider

1657
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:33,090
and really consider this.

1658
01:29:33,650 --> 01:29:36,450
These entitled classes, people with degrees and diplomas,

1659
01:29:36,650 --> 01:29:39,590
or there's a fellow on the email called it working papers.

1660
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:42,770
I mean, just, you know, they're entitled.

1661
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:46,690
They're there as a buffer zone between those who are,

1662
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:50,710
you know, the main pranksters and the people being pranked.

1663
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:53,190
They like to have buffer zones, you know,

1664
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:55,370
kind of like a median on a highway or something

1665
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:56,770
so you don't kind of see the cars coming

1666
01:29:56,770 --> 01:29:58,050
the other direction all the time.

1667
01:29:58,370 --> 01:29:59,190
Kind of scary.

1668
01:29:59,830 --> 01:30:01,190
So it's for both sides.

1669
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:05,210
So when the chief pranksters, the human authorities,

1670
01:30:06,550 --> 01:30:10,110
want to keep people away from discovering things or whatever,

1671
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:13,150
they set up scientists, religious leaders,

1672
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:15,410
attorneys, doctors.

1673
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:17,970
So when some poor schmuck in the crowd,

1674
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:19,850
like figures out, let's say a cure for cancer

1675
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:24,490
or a free energy device or a methodology of law or something,

1676
01:30:24,490 --> 01:30:27,570
what they do is they sick these entitled people on them.

1677
01:30:27,850 --> 01:30:28,990
You know, like sick them, like a dog.

1678
01:30:29,070 --> 01:30:31,130
They're basically acting like junkyard dogs.

1679
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:34,230
And if you could look at this as a tool of suppression,

1680
01:30:34,590 --> 01:30:35,870
that's not their whole purpose.

1681
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:38,090
Their whole purpose is also they're pranksters themselves.

1682
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:41,350
But if you actually look at the junkyard dog mentality

1683
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:44,130
that is put on these people with quote unquote degrees.

1684
01:30:44,530 --> 01:30:48,370
Now, this is not because degrees are bad and all this stuff.

1685
01:30:48,430 --> 01:30:49,490
I mean, they're quite degrading

1686
01:30:49,490 --> 01:30:50,910
if you actually look at the system.

1687
01:30:51,610 --> 01:30:53,510
All of that could have been used properly

1688
01:30:53,510 --> 01:30:56,630
and could have been used in a good beneficial way.

1689
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:59,230
But I assure you, it is not at all right now.

1690
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:02,610
And these entitled classes, again,

1691
01:31:02,710 --> 01:31:05,390
the people with the prefixes and the titles,

1692
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:07,150
they're really a buffer zone.

1693
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:10,790
Again, so some poor schmuck in society figures something out.

1694
01:31:10,850 --> 01:31:12,910
They just sick these guys on them.

1695
01:31:12,930 --> 01:31:15,270
They say, well, if you came up with this medical device,

1696
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:16,850
where did you get your medical degree?

1697
01:31:17,090 --> 01:31:18,030
Oh, are you a doctor?

1698
01:31:18,130 --> 01:31:18,290
No.

1699
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:22,050
Okay, that means that everything that you do is worthless then.

1700
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:26,950
And they discredit people based on these entitled pranksters.

1701
01:31:27,530 --> 01:31:30,710
And again, this might sound general,

1702
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:33,950
but it's generally true that most of the people

1703
01:31:33,950 --> 01:31:37,030
that are using their degrees and entitlement in society,

1704
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:38,150
it's a social rank.

1705
01:31:38,530 --> 01:31:42,150
They are pranksters, except for a small group in there

1706
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:43,730
that is looking for an exit strategy

1707
01:31:43,730 --> 01:31:45,090
because they found out what it's about.

1708
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:48,010
And this is really a bird's eye view

1709
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:49,750
of human society at this point.

1710
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:53,150
Now, there are some people that are in those entitled groups

1711
01:31:53,150 --> 01:31:54,310
that have done good work.

1712
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:58,190
But eventually, when you do get to know

1713
01:31:58,190 --> 01:31:59,390
any of these people who've done good work

1714
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:00,570
or look at more completely,

1715
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:02,210
they are very wholly dissatisfied

1716
01:32:02,210 --> 01:32:03,910
with the institutions they adhere to.

1717
01:32:04,830 --> 01:32:06,230
This goes across the board.

1718
01:32:07,010 --> 01:32:08,690
Now, put the propagandists aside.

1719
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:10,330
But here, give an example.

1720
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:13,750
Yesterday down here, down by the university,

1721
01:32:13,870 --> 01:32:16,370
I spoke to no less than four people in a half an hour.

1722
01:32:16,730 --> 01:32:18,610
And they're all either involved or graduated

1723
01:32:18,610 --> 01:32:19,950
or worked with the university.

1724
01:32:20,930 --> 01:32:22,630
And they all admitted within conversation,

1725
01:32:22,790 --> 01:32:23,430
I kind of brought it up,

1726
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:25,090
that it was absolutely worthless.

1727
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:27,730
No, no value at all.

1728
01:32:28,370 --> 01:32:30,350
And yeah, and four...

1729
01:32:30,350 --> 01:32:33,950
Have you ever heard a doctor tell you something like,

1730
01:32:34,490 --> 01:32:36,230
no, I'm not allowed to tell you this

1731
01:32:36,230 --> 01:32:37,490
or something like that?

1732
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:40,930
Sorry, small interjection.

1733
01:32:41,070 --> 01:32:41,530
Oh, no, no.

1734
01:32:41,610 --> 01:32:43,190
Yeah, they're pranksters.

1735
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:45,570
I recently had a discussion with someone said,

1736
01:32:45,650 --> 01:32:47,170
man, I almost got pranked by a doctor.

1737
01:32:47,370 --> 01:32:47,770
I said, how?

1738
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:48,570
And they went through the story.

1739
01:32:48,650 --> 01:32:49,610
I said, yeah, you almost got pranked.

1740
01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:52,630
Yeah, it's just social rank, folks.

1741
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:54,390
This is about being on Earth.

1742
01:32:55,190 --> 01:32:57,450
This has nothing to do with what you believe in.

1743
01:32:57,490 --> 01:32:59,030
This has nothing to do what you've been told.

1744
01:32:59,130 --> 01:33:01,930
This has to do with being a...

1745
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:03,750
Let's say in the mind,

1746
01:33:04,230 --> 01:33:07,030
imagine that you are traveling through the galaxies,

1747
01:33:07,330 --> 01:33:09,530
you know, like a Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry kind of thing.

1748
01:33:09,610 --> 01:33:11,610
Was it Gene Roddenberry did Star Trek as well?

1749
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:14,250
Yeah, Star Trek, yes.

1750
01:33:14,550 --> 01:33:14,870
Yeah, yeah.

1751
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:16,030
So you're going to all these worlds

1752
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:17,570
and you lay down on a planet and you're like,

1753
01:33:17,570 --> 01:33:18,650
what's going on here?

1754
01:33:18,790 --> 01:33:20,070
Come back and report to the captain.

1755
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:21,410
You can't start sitting there and say,

1756
01:33:21,490 --> 01:33:22,730
I like chocolate ice cream,

1757
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:25,210
or I'm Christian or I'm Muslim.

1758
01:33:25,370 --> 01:33:26,930
I decided to believe in this

1759
01:33:26,930 --> 01:33:28,950
or I decided to believe in that.

1760
01:33:29,390 --> 01:33:30,950
Captain doesn't want to hear that.

1761
01:33:31,610 --> 01:33:32,610
You got to be objective.

1762
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:35,310
You know, I really like this TV show.

1763
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:36,350
That doesn't tell me anything

1764
01:33:36,350 --> 01:33:37,710
about what's going on down here.

1765
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:39,770
Or, you know, are you political?

1766
01:33:39,910 --> 01:33:41,570
Who's your favorite political guy?

1767
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:43,550
You know, you can't come back

1768
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:46,950
to giving reports like that.

1769
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:48,090
But that's all you hear.

1770
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:49,670
That's all you hear from people.

1771
01:33:49,910 --> 01:33:51,290
This is ridiculous reports.

1772
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:53,910
You know, there's even a report

1773
01:33:54,730 --> 01:33:56,730
that I'm not going to be persistent about giving.

1774
01:33:57,510 --> 01:33:58,610
There's people talking about

1775
01:33:58,610 --> 01:33:59,990
legalizing certain things, right?

1776
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:01,710
Cannabis has just come out and say

1777
01:34:01,710 --> 01:34:03,350
it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of

1778
01:34:03,350 --> 01:34:05,550
because none of that illegalization

1779
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:07,610
or legalization has ever applied to anyone

1780
01:34:07,610 --> 01:34:10,570
other than the effects of the pranking.

1781
01:34:10,650 --> 01:34:11,990
Actually, if you go study all the laws

1782
01:34:11,990 --> 01:34:13,610
to all these things that are quote unquote

1783
01:34:13,610 --> 01:34:14,590
illegal or legal,

1784
01:34:14,710 --> 01:34:16,430
they're not being administered properly.

1785
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:18,750
It's just a set of pranking,

1786
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:20,710
you know, all of it across the board.

1787
01:34:20,830 --> 01:34:21,530
But here's the thing.

1788
01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:23,290
How many times have you heard in

1789
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:25,050
loose discussion or firm discussion

1790
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:26,750
about all these laws?

1791
01:34:26,810 --> 01:34:28,090
What are we going to do about this law?

1792
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:30,550
Well, first of all, people, listen to this.

1793
01:34:30,590 --> 01:34:32,410
I don't really want to be a proponent of this.

1794
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:34,550
How ridiculous you are and they are

1795
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:36,170
and the whole thing is just ridiculous

1796
01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:38,530
is that according to the federal manual,

1797
01:34:38,530 --> 01:34:39,970
which is also used by states,

1798
01:34:39,970 --> 01:34:42,170
in order for a proposed law to become law,

1799
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:44,470
it has to be read three times,

1800
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:45,750
not once or twice,

1801
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:49,030
but three times on the floor of a legislative body.

1802
01:34:50,090 --> 01:34:52,550
It doesn't matter if the law is one page long,

1803
01:34:52,810 --> 01:34:53,950
10 pages long,

1804
01:34:54,050 --> 01:34:55,870
or 30,000 pages long,

1805
01:34:55,970 --> 01:34:58,430
the entire thing has to be read

1806
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:01,250
three times on the floor of the legislative body

1807
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:03,730
in order for it to be enacted and passed as law.

1808
01:35:04,430 --> 01:35:05,830
Now, how many of those laws

1809
01:35:05,830 --> 01:35:08,770
that have been enacted in the past decades or so

1810
01:35:08,770 --> 01:35:11,410
do you think have been read in any legislative body?

1811
01:35:11,730 --> 01:35:12,030
How many?

1812
01:35:12,230 --> 01:35:13,070
Seth, you want to guess?

1813
01:35:14,850 --> 01:35:15,250
None.

1814
01:35:15,770 --> 01:35:16,650
Yes, that's right.

1815
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:18,310
None of them.

1816
01:35:18,790 --> 01:35:21,450
And how many people are talking about legalization of this

1817
01:35:21,450 --> 01:35:23,230
or that or whatever addressing this matter?

1818
01:35:24,670 --> 01:35:25,070
None.

1819
01:35:26,190 --> 01:35:27,630
None. Zero.

1820
01:35:28,150 --> 01:35:29,490
Maybe one or two research.

1821
01:35:29,550 --> 01:35:31,430
He's not, he's very objective

1822
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:32,510
and he has a very interesting point.

1823
01:35:32,570 --> 01:35:33,710
We might have him as a guest one day.

1824
01:35:33,750 --> 01:35:34,070
I don't know.

1825
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:35,330
I mean, other than his research,

1826
01:35:35,650 --> 01:35:37,510
he might kind of find what we're saying to be very obtuse,

1827
01:35:37,610 --> 01:35:38,510
but nonetheless,

1828
01:35:39,690 --> 01:35:41,990
a person has come up with this

1829
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:42,750
and I've confirmed it.

1830
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:44,210
So here's the point.

1831
01:35:44,290 --> 01:35:46,870
So then what's going on when someone has what they call cannabis

1832
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:48,750
and the cops come in and bust them for it,

1833
01:35:49,050 --> 01:35:50,330
take them to court and throw them in jail?

1834
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:51,430
What is that?

1835
01:35:51,530 --> 01:35:52,790
That's all pranking.

1836
01:35:53,090 --> 01:35:55,490
Why? Because these are all pranksters, man.

1837
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:56,190
They love it.

1838
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:57,450
They love pranking.

1839
01:35:57,930 --> 01:36:00,570
I have seen quote unquote law enforcement in public

1840
01:36:00,570 --> 01:36:01,370
when there's a crowd,

1841
01:36:02,050 --> 01:36:03,450
they discern certain people.

1842
01:36:03,690 --> 01:36:05,670
You know, you'll have 10 people doing the same thing.

1843
01:36:05,730 --> 01:36:06,750
And let's say, I don't like you.

1844
01:36:06,790 --> 01:36:07,590
You're going to jail.

1845
01:36:07,610 --> 01:36:08,890
But no, you, you're okay.

1846
01:36:09,790 --> 01:36:10,650
You just stay here.

1847
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:11,890
And they're doing the same thing, by the way.

1848
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:14,610
This is all who they feel like pranking.

1849
01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:17,750
It's all about pranking, right?

1850
01:36:17,990 --> 01:36:19,770
And it goes on and on and on.

1851
01:36:19,890 --> 01:36:21,510
And this is what it's like on earth.

1852
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:25,770
Not America, not Europe, not Russia, not here or there.

1853
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:28,650
This is the state of affairs of the human condition

1854
01:36:28,650 --> 01:36:30,290
on what is known planet earth.

1855
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:32,650
By the way, I want to throw something in about that.

1856
01:36:32,690 --> 01:36:35,190
There's some people looking for the lost Atlantis.

1857
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:36,710
And you know why you're never going to find it?

1858
01:36:37,430 --> 01:36:38,770
Because you're standing on it.

1859
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:40,290
That was the old name for earth.

1860
01:36:40,470 --> 01:36:41,930
But anyway, I thought I'd throw that in there.

1861
01:36:41,930 --> 01:36:45,150
Lots of little secrets, maybe, which are uncommon.

1862
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:51,360
So yeah, we talked about, again, there's buffer zones.

1863
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,300
There's pranking, a lot of pranking.

1864
01:36:55,440 --> 01:36:58,960
You know, one thing we haven't gotten into

1865
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:01,500
is lawfulness and unlawfulness.

1866
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:04,560
I think you and I have done it before quite a bit.

1867
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:08,320
But until people figure that out, what that means,

1868
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:11,520
which will be in the near future,

1869
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:14,240
when you discuss what's lawful and unlawful,

1870
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:17,760
law tends to be very objective.

1871
01:37:18,340 --> 01:37:23,200
And it tends to go after all, regardless of your title.

1872
01:37:23,860 --> 01:37:25,020
You know, there was an old maxim,

1873
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:27,120
is Rex Lex or is Lex Rex?

1874
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:30,060
Meaning, is the king the law or is the law the king?

1875
01:37:30,860 --> 01:37:33,100
Yeah, that was, yeah, that, yes.

1876
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:37,180
That was a chanted in the streets at one time.

1877
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:39,900
Lex Rex, Lex Rex, Lex Rex.

1878
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:42,560
Law's king, law's king, law's king, yeah.

1879
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:45,020
But yet, at the same time, they put their hand on the Bible

1880
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:47,320
and they think it has some mystical, magical power

1881
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,780
or a rabbit's foot or something.

1882
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:52,320
So these people aren't really going anywhere.

1883
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:53,560
Just like today, you hear about,

1884
01:37:53,700 --> 01:37:55,140
let's go protest this thing.

1885
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:56,160
I'm like, you gotta be kidding.

1886
01:37:57,820 --> 01:38:00,600
You know, you don't know where you are, man.

1887
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:03,760
You know, this is planet Earth, you know.

1888
01:38:04,500 --> 01:38:06,420
In other words, if you've got a lot of energy

1889
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:07,460
to do that kind of thing,

1890
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:10,060
activism, protesting and all this other crap,

1891
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,840
and they let you do it, they meaning the other pranksters,

1892
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:15,680
you know, the pranksters that have sharp objects

1893
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,420
and projectiles and chemicals and buildings

1894
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:19,700
with cages in them, they let you do it.

1895
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:21,360
Yeah, go ahead, spin your wheels.

1896
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:23,340
It's got nothing to do with that.

1897
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:24,380
The gods are in control.

1898
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:27,800
But yeah, and exactly, you know,

1899
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:28,840
someone sent a message.

1900
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:31,240
Man, I'm so glad you said about on the last program

1901
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:32,020
or maybe the previous

1902
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:33,660
that the people have abandoned their gods.

1903
01:38:33,740 --> 01:38:34,380
Yes, they have.

1904
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:36,260
You're living in a,

1905
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:39,120
by the way, the entire human society right now

1906
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:41,360
is either outright pagan or outright atheist.

1907
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:46,020
Atheist meaning without a god or denying it,

1908
01:38:46,580 --> 01:38:50,080
or just pagan, just ignorant, straight up.

1909
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,800
This is your human environment at this point

1910
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,060
across the board.

1911
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:56,660
That is a very accurate statement.

1912
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:59,240
And also lawless.

1913
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:01,900
It doesn't mean you don't have any order.

1914
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:03,300
You have quite a bit of order.

1915
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:06,600
Fortunately, the pranksters are maintaining order

1916
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:08,120
through pranking.

1917
01:39:08,860 --> 01:39:11,060
They do a good job keeping order.

1918
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:15,540
You know, here in the US, what they call America,

1919
01:39:15,820 --> 01:39:18,060
they have a military base pretty much in every state.

1920
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,760
You know, why?

1921
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:22,980
Keep order.

1922
01:39:23,180 --> 01:39:24,840
It's got nothing to do with training anybody.

1923
01:39:26,540 --> 01:39:29,640
You know, so yeah, this is the state of affairs

1924
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:30,120
on the planet.

1925
01:39:30,240 --> 01:39:32,220
It's very uncommon to discuss this, by the way, Seth.

1926
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:32,800
What say you?

1927
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:36,060
I think it's uncommon to discuss the reality of things.

1928
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:36,480
Oh, yeah.

1929
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:38,780
This program is this broadcast.

1930
01:39:39,140 --> 01:39:40,360
I'm just going to call it a broadcast.

1931
01:39:40,540 --> 01:39:41,700
It's not really a program.

1932
01:39:41,800 --> 01:39:43,520
There's no set anything we're doing here.

1933
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:46,820
But I'd say that this broadcast certainly lives up

1934
01:39:46,820 --> 01:39:47,440
to its title.

1935
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:50,680
Yeah, it's a bad object.

1936
01:39:50,780 --> 01:39:51,560
People hate it.

1937
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:54,660
Now, recently, I'm repeating this probably the third time.

1938
01:39:54,860 --> 01:39:57,480
I found out it's kind of a hard thing to figure out

1939
01:39:57,480 --> 01:40:00,200
or come to the realization that people actually hate

1940
01:40:00,740 --> 01:40:01,820
knowledge and truth.

1941
01:40:01,820 --> 01:40:08,120
They have a hate for it, and mildly and not so mildly.

1942
01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:12,160
And that's why, you know, for example, places,

1943
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:15,440
venues where people speak and the people know

1944
01:40:16,220 --> 01:40:19,200
that it's a question answer after the speaker is finished

1945
01:40:19,200 --> 01:40:25,200
or a quote unquote show or program or that has callers,

1946
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:26,280
people calling in.

1947
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:29,200
If you ever look at objectify what's going on,

1948
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:33,020
most of the time, the people that want to interact

1949
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:37,340
with the host or the speaker are just sitting by.

1950
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:39,780
And what they're thinking is, when is this person

1951
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:41,560
going to shut up so I can get the microphone

1952
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:43,540
and I could tell everybody what I want to say?

1953
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:44,640
Right.

1954
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:48,100
This goes on and on and on and on.

1955
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:54,060
So there is a you've got to also look at the character

1956
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:56,760
of the of the society as a whole.

1957
01:40:56,760 --> 01:41:01,180
What what keeps the common base going as it does?

1958
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:03,880
You know, and that's why there is not a lot of

1959
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:07,160
progress on their own.

1960
01:41:07,640 --> 01:41:10,420
And that's why I keep saying it's all cosmically dictated.

1961
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:13,420
And the best thing to be efficient is understand

1962
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:14,360
cosmic cycles.

1963
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:16,520
You have the agricultural cycle on the planet.

1964
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:19,040
You know, you're locked into spring is planting.

1965
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:20,000
Summer is growth.

1966
01:41:21,220 --> 01:41:22,440
Fall is breaking down.

1967
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:24,380
Winter is an in-between time where you do things

1968
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:26,300
that you couldn't do during the other three seasons.

1969
01:41:27,240 --> 01:41:30,160
You know, by the way, folks, this springtime,

1970
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:33,000
we kind of discussed spring and the nature of it.

1971
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:33,240
Right.

1972
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,240
And now you're in summer here on this part of the world

1973
01:41:36,240 --> 01:41:37,300
and winter and the other part.

1974
01:41:37,640 --> 01:41:40,080
But watch what's going on in current events,

1975
01:41:40,140 --> 01:41:41,080
by the way, during the summer.

1976
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:42,840
That is a growing process.

1977
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:45,280
In other words, it's growing things that have been planted.

1978
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:50,160
There was a recent event that happened somewhere,

1979
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:52,320
what they call a shooting, let's say.

1980
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:55,320
And that is growing something that was planted

1981
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:57,620
a few months ago regarding a certain group

1982
01:41:57,620 --> 01:41:59,000
and their rights and things like that.

1983
01:41:59,080 --> 01:42:00,040
So watch that carefully.

1984
01:42:01,180 --> 01:42:02,800
You know, it's interesting, right?

1985
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:07,240
It's also, yeah, summertime is when things kind of grow.

1986
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:10,040
You know, they've already been planted.

1987
01:42:10,180 --> 01:42:11,620
They've passed the sprout stage.

1988
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:18,500
So let's, lest anyone forgets what comes after summer.

1989
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:22,200
Fall, that is a time where things are torn down

1990
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:24,180
or harvested, brought in.

1991
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:28,220
And you've still got another couple of months before that,

1992
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:29,620
a couple of moons, I should say.

1993
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:32,520
And at that point, watch the events

1994
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:34,660
and you'll see that they are breaking down events.

1995
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:37,480
And that's why at least there seems to be

1996
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:39,480
a little bit more reason this year

1997
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:41,220
than last year or the year before.

1998
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:44,000
I'm talking about the pagan year that people go on,

1999
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,040
you know, the Pope's work schedule.

2000
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:50,500
There's not a lot of crying about complete financial collapse

2001
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:52,500
this summer, by the way,

2002
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:55,060
which is absolutely ridiculous, never happens.

2003
01:42:56,700 --> 01:43:01,720
So yeah, just be observant on the seasons,

2004
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:03,660
seasonal changes, spring planting,

2005
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,600
summer growth for fall breaking down

2006
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:06,940
and winters in between time.

2007
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:09,640
Time for travel, time for rebuilding things,

2008
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:12,060
things that you wouldn't do normally.

2009
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:14,940
Yeah, quite interesting.

2010
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:17,920
I always found it very odd that people went on vacation

2011
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:19,740
in the summer because that was a thing

2012
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:22,860
that was always done throughout humanity in the winter,

2013
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:26,700
you know, because during the summertime,

2014
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:31,060
you were in the height of things, right?

2015
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:32,960
Production or growth.

2016
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:37,500
But maybe it shows that society has taken a cue

2017
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:39,620
from people of leisure because people of leisure,

2018
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:41,360
I guess, vacationed anytime they wanted.

2019
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,720
And maybe if it was more pleasant in the summer

2020
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:45,160
to get away from the heat, let's say.

2021
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:48,700
But here's another thing about people that were wealthy,

2022
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:50,660
people back in the day.

2023
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:52,480
When you were wealthy or affluent

2024
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:56,060
or high in stature in society,

2025
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:57,520
you were a person of leisure.

2026
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:00,980
What's interesting now from personal interaction

2027
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:02,700
with people that are of high net worth,

2028
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:05,340
credit worth or whatever, what rich people, as they say,

2029
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:06,940
they have no time at all.

2030
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:08,320
I don't know.

2031
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:11,260
And even if you haven't interacted with millionaires

2032
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:12,220
or billionaires or whatever,

2033
01:44:13,020 --> 01:44:15,020
you might've heard about it, quite busy.

2034
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:17,540
They don't have any time whatsoever.

2035
01:44:17,540 --> 01:44:20,120
I find it to be quite interesting the flip on that.

2036
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:22,180
So I'd throw that in there for a moment.

2037
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:26,280
So we got any questions or anything

2038
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:28,320
that we could throw in the mix here?

2039
01:44:29,480 --> 01:44:35,120
Oh, there was a question earlier in the chat

2040
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,900
that I'm sure would be interesting to some.

2041
01:44:38,940 --> 01:44:41,820
And it was kind of, I guess, a personal question for you.

2042
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:46,360
But it asked, who would you say is your deity

2043
01:44:47,620 --> 01:44:53,120
if one gets their laws from their deity and et cetera?

2044
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:54,400
Well, let's be right.

2045
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:56,320
I'll say it in a general term.

2046
01:44:56,740 --> 01:45:00,340
Why would you, if you were given a plane ticket

2047
01:45:00,340 --> 01:45:03,060
and it was free to travel or a boat ticket

2048
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:05,540
and you could go coach business or first class

2049
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:10,300
and cost the same, which one would you go?

2050
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:12,660
Which one would you go for?

2051
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:16,220
You know, if you were to eat at a five star restaurant

2052
01:45:16,220 --> 01:45:20,520
or a greasy spoon for free, which one would you eat at?

2053
01:45:20,860 --> 01:45:22,980
Greasy spoon or the five star restaurant, let's say.

2054
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:25,320
I'd probably go to the five star restaurant

2055
01:45:25,320 --> 01:45:27,160
because I don't know that I've ever eaten in one of those.

2056
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:29,180
And if it's free, yeah.

2057
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:32,020
Yeah, it costs the same, let's say, or the effort's the same.

2058
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:35,000
Or if you were to fly in one of these big things,

2059
01:45:35,080 --> 01:45:36,580
these big metal cans with wings,

2060
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:41,820
would you sit first class business or coach for free?

2061
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:43,260
You know, it costs the same.

2062
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:44,680
Let's say it costs you a nickel.

2063
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:47,440
What do you get for a nickel?

2064
01:45:48,040 --> 01:45:48,780
Where are you going to go?

2065
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:49,820
Right?

2066
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:51,020
See?

2067
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:56,040
So very simple, right?

2068
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:58,120
And how do you find out about anything?

2069
01:45:58,380 --> 01:45:59,120
Well, guess what?

2070
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:01,380
We've been here for more than 10 years

2071
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:02,860
or 100 years or 200 years

2072
01:46:02,860 --> 01:46:04,360
and everyone that's come before us

2073
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:06,280
is not an idiot like today.

2074
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:07,600
Anyway, I don't mean that that way.

2075
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:10,800
But the things that were memorialized

2076
01:46:11,940 --> 01:46:15,360
a very long time ago and are still preserved today

2077
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:19,260
are here today because they're important.

2078
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:21,320
Think about it.

2079
01:46:21,440 --> 01:46:23,820
Actually, maybe some people do too much thinking,

2080
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:24,880
they get into a lot of trouble.

2081
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:27,460
You shouldn't do so much of that.

2082
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:28,820
Yeah, that's right.

2083
01:46:29,620 --> 01:46:30,700
And here's the thing, folks.

2084
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,520
You're not going to be making friends

2085
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:34,320
listening to Uncommon Sense.

2086
01:46:35,400 --> 01:46:36,160
Are you sure you know that?

2087
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,500
One thing I wanted to mention

2088
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:39,980
before we end the program here,

2089
01:46:40,060 --> 01:46:41,640
also out of ecclesiastes,

2090
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:45,400
is not only the good food, good drink,

2091
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:47,700
but to not do anything to excess.

2092
01:46:48,380 --> 01:46:50,600
In the English, at least,

2093
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:54,440
it says to not be overly righteous

2094
01:46:54,440 --> 01:47:00,220
or overly evil or to be overly anything.

2095
01:47:02,840 --> 01:47:07,060
It's kind of obvious knowledge or wisdom

2096
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:10,860
that is lost on a lot of people.

2097
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:13,800
People are gluttonous with a great deal

2098
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:15,540
more than food.

2099
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:22,060
Study is one of those things.

2100
01:47:22,800 --> 01:47:23,740
Be realistic.

2101
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:25,180
That's vanity.

2102
01:47:25,580 --> 01:47:26,940
That's vanity over much of anything.

2103
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:29,940
And remember, folks, nothing exceeds excess.

2104
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:35,240
So again, thank you again for the past two hours, everyone.

2105
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:37,600
And donate to AFR if you can.

2106
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:40,760
And visit us at www.uncommonradio.com.

2107
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:42,260
If you want to send us a message.

2108
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:42,760
Thanks, folks.

2109
01:47:42,820 --> 01:47:43,480
See you again next week.
