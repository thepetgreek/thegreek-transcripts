1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:07,370
Thank you. Welcome everyone as well. Greetings. And we're here again. Yes. Reckoning the end of

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:12,150
the first week of the fifth month. Boy, did we lose most of the audience by saying that.

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,910
What the hell did you just say? Yes, it's the fifth month, folks, appears to be finally,

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,350
appearingly the end of the first week. And how is that reckoned? It's reckoned in the light

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,110
versus in the dark. So, hey, by the way, ever heard why the sun never sets on the

6
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:36,230
British Empire? Because, you know, maybe you can't trust the British in the dark.

7
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,150
Yeah, it's a little thing to bring up for what they call current events, I guess.

8
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,830
I don't know. Current events. I don't know. Don't touch that current. You might get zapped,

9
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:55,670
maybe. But if you're already brain dead, it doesn't matter. So either way, let's just I want

10
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,510
to just jump into something regarding the current events. Hey, Seth, have you ever heard about

11
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,950
somebody talking about a coming Middle East Union perhaps in the next decade?

12
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:10,890
Pavlovian bells are ringing. Yes. Yeah. There's something interesting about that. I mean,

13
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:17,270
how many people are discussing that? I mean, just you and I, maybe, you know, there might be a

14
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,470
little smatterings about it here and there. It's not really well understood. But we've been

15
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:28,370
basically emphatically saying this for I have for over a decade with great specificity and

16
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:33,770
does anyone care? Well, yeah, we've already established there's about four or five people

17
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,830
listening to this conversation. And by the way, this is when you say we get together to do this

18
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:46,450
as a conversation piece, perhaps primarily. Yeah, that's certainly my end of it.

19
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:51,770
Right. And maybe the other end, I don't know which one's the head, which one is the tail. But

20
00:01:52,990 --> 00:02:01,650
I'd say that maybe bringing a slight highest and best use of this medium known as, I don't know,

21
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:09,229
digital telephony, Internet radio, communications in the open public sort of venue, because I'll

22
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:15,970
tell you, there's very little going on, folks. But yeah, speaking of which, very little going on.

23
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,170
Some of the staff at AFR last week kind of asked, would you like to hear talked about

24
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:26,190
just briefly said, let's talk about technology. Now, what do you think of that, Seth? What does

25
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,750
that word even mean? Do you want to do a little bit of keyboard surfing on that?

26
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:38,570
In the meantime, I can do the technology study of ology. Then we that's a technos,

27
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,830
which also means child and to be deceived in certain parts of the Greek language. But yeah,

28
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:52,050
technos meaning technical, let's say from techno and lology, meaning the study of mechanical

29
00:02:52,050 --> 00:03:01,950
industrial arts, 16 tens of discourse or trusting on art or the arts. Let's see.

30
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,050
Let's go to the techno word forming element, meaning art, craft or skill.

31
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:16,970
Let from later technical technology from Latin, nice form of Greek techno,

32
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:24,870
combining form of technique, you know, technique, et cetera, art, skill, craft and work method,

33
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:32,370
system and art system or method of making or doing. OK, so basically, craftsmanship skilled,

34
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:38,290
you know, like it could be even thrown in there like underwater basket weaving or advanced nose

35
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,530
picking, things like that, you know, things that are considered to be the height of mankind right

36
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:48,790
now. But OK, so in essence, let's let's boil it down real quick. It's just the making of tools,

37
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:58,470
let's say, to impress others or perhaps not just to impress, but to use. Right.

38
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:05,370
Typically, when you think of a craftsman versus just someone freewheeling it or freewheeling it,

39
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,350
let's say you're thinking of tools and things that are being made versus like someone who stands

40
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:13,770
up and sings, for example, that then they're using the voice as an instrument or a tool that can be

41
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:19,550
tuned. But nonetheless, it's the making of tools and to sum things up, by the way, let's just fast

42
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:26,610
forward the state of technology today or the height of it in many cases or in most cases, as it

43
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:33,030
relates to the population, you know, the mass, let's say the large numbers, what you will see

44
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:40,710
if you objectify is the the height perhaps of mass production, making not just hundreds or

45
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:46,090
thousands, but millions and billions of things. And also the height of miniaturization, making

46
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:49,810
them smaller and smaller and smaller. And I'm referring to many of the electronic circuits

47
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:57,050
and things like that and even little motors and things like that. So in essence, one can easily

48
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:02,430
maybe one way to describe what's going on technologically is an appeal towards mass

49
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:10,370
manufacture, mass production and miniaturization. Perhaps that would be a rapid way to broad brush,

50
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:16,830
objectify at least the the advancements that are when you say technology was considered to

51
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:24,750
be advances, small and many of them. The other thing that could be easily looked at is,

52
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:29,470
well, you're ready for this. You know, some people don't like it because sometimes it gets emotional.

53
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:35,630
But here's good emotion, the vanity of it. You know, like what I mean by that is, well,

54
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,670
let me just preface, you know, the ancient Greeks said, you know, fashion for clothing is irrelevant

55
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:45,170
because the human body doesn't change. Why does the clothing always change? Right. So what's

56
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:49,370
interesting, you really want to mess around with the species, you know what I mean, species, the

57
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:55,990
average human surface dwelling earth inhabitant going to what they call a car dealership, which are

58
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:01,670
nothing but horse thieves, by the way. But anyway, you go in there and you say, well, obviously you

59
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:06,130
haven't figured out how to make it right because you're coming out with a new model every year.

60
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,690
Right. Because if they figured out how to make automobiles correctly,

61
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:16,230
well, they just make them and sell them or put them out. But they keep changing them. Why? Because

62
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:22,690
there's a vanity aspect, you know, like, you know, Tom on the block gets 2015 and,

63
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:28,310
you know, Joe down the street gets the 2016. Aha, I've got the newer one. Right. See,

64
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:34,690
it's just a matter of looking different. So there's a lot of vanity in technology.

65
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:42,710
Also, it's just vain, I guess. But let's just look at the state of technology today. It's basically

66
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,590
geared towards communication. But if you look at the communication, well, I shouldn't say just

67
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,870
geared towards. There's a lot of interesting things going on, but not that interesting.

68
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:58,150
Again, if you tie in the miniaturization, the mass production and the vanity aspect.

69
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,290
Anything else you want to throw in, Seth, regarding describing technology today before

70
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:08,450
we dig in a little bit deeper? Well, yeah, there's the different aspects of it, but the

71
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,790
essentially it's doing the same thing better. There seems to be little

72
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:21,290
real innovation in doing something in a different manner. So like you said, mass production,

73
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,150
smalling, you know, smaller, smaller size, scaling things down,

74
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,310
which are, you know, not necessarily bad things. They're done correctly and for a purpose.

75
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:39,730
But that's basically the height of it. Something that's using relatively old technology

76
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:50,590
in a new way currently would be, and it's not even really new, but on the virtual reality,

77
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:57,130
the implementation of such things like that on a larger scale is just around the corner. You're

78
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:02,590
already seeing it trickle in. It's going to be interesting because it will make the internet,

79
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:09,750
which already is, you know, kind of a place unto itself. It will make it pseudo-tangible

80
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,290
in many different ways, you know, tricking the mind.

81
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:20,530
Right, or appealing to the mind or accommodating certain desires that people are told they should

82
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:26,750
have. Right. Absolutely. Yeah. If you listen to that carefully, people have desires that

83
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:32,909
they told they should have. Anyway, I think we gave the definition of puppets and muppets earlier,

84
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:38,750
but that's another story. Okay. You know, we had an email regarding automobiles, cars,

85
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:44,210
reciprocating motors from a fellow, and I've answered it a while back, and I think we were

86
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:48,710
going to talk about it. Maybe now's the time to interject a little bit in there what's going on

87
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:54,350
with the car engine. And by the way, how many times have you heard people saying it's the same old

88
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:59,850
technology from 100 years ago? Yeah, it is pretty much. But not only is it the same old technology,

89
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,710
it's not even being addressed. Everyone is being given the notion that, you know, you have these

90
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:10,390
pistons that go up and down and there's explosions and gases and fuels and things, and it's the boom

91
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:16,230
and the bang and these, you know, that make the thing go. And if you actually study what's going

92
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,250
on in a car engine, you'll find that the common stuff that's discussed about it is just simply

93
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:28,610
not true. Now, what is not true about an automobile, a reciprocating motor, is that these

94
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:35,950
violent occurrences inside the motor are driving it, and there's rapid, you know,

95
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,850
changes and things, you know, and there is actually, if you do what's called a compression

96
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,950
test, which you measure the pressure of the piston, you'll notice that there's no change. What I mean

97
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:51,590
by that is when the piston goes up and down and you have the violent explosions, if you measure

98
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:58,830
the pressure in the chamber, you will notice there is a very little change. What happens is when the

99
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,210
explosion happens and it pushes the piston down, you're thinking, oh wow, you know, like you see

100
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:08,310
in the movies, an explosion, a lot of pressure, shock waves. Well, you'll notice that the pressure

101
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:13,350
is at a certain point, and then when the event is over and the valve's open to exhaust all the gases,

102
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:19,570
the pressure is still the same. Why? What's going on, right? Well, very simply, when the

103
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:25,630
explosion happens, the pressure starts to increase, but the piston goes down, increasing the volume,

104
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,850
which stabilizes the pressure, keeps it very close to what it was before the explosion.

105
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:35,010
But then as the piston comes up to contract, you think the pressure is going to increase again

106
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:40,330
because you're taking the given space and squeezing it, but cold air and cold fuel are

107
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:47,250
being deposited, which creates a rapid contraction. You see? So whether the piston is going up and

108
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:54,290
down, explosion or no explosion, the pressure in the engine is the same. Now, you could look at

109
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,170
compression test graphs and you will see, yeah, there are little spikes and things like that.

110
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:02,350
That's basically what they call valve lash or valve bounce and the valve's opening and closing.

111
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:09,250
But generally, the pressure is in the high hundreds or, you know, between 120 and 200,

112
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:17,570
let's say, typically, with little fluctuation. So there seems to be a natural, just like in nature,

113
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:24,150
a balance that's being made and it's not very much in accordance with the intuitiveness that

114
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:29,250
people have about when they hear explosion and things like that, right? The other thing I want

115
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:34,530
to mention about the car is, or the reciprocating motor, is you're ready for something that sounds

116
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:39,430
ridiculous, actually, that actually will prove that it's not. Well, you know, no one has ever burned any

117
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:46,310
fuel in the engine to make it go. Well, that sounds ridiculous. Well, why are we, you know, when we

118
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:51,570
have a gas tank, it goes down to empty, we can't go. Well, the reason you're putting fuel into the

119
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:57,910
reciprocating motor is to burn the air. Think about it, because you could, let's say, you're using

120
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,790
petrol or gasoline, you could substitute that with alcohol and other fuels, methane, propane, like

121
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:08,850
they do in warehouses and things like that, right? Hydrogen. You can substitute the fuel for many

122
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:15,550
things, but the ultimate goal is to ignite the air. So if anyone out there's got more than two

123
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,710
sharpened pencils in their pocket, which is an old engineering term for meaning you're good at

124
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:26,870
designing things, coming up with ideas, let's say, why don't you think of alternative ways to make the

125
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:34,590
air burn instead of what you're being told, right? And then there's another concept, there's

126
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:38,370
something called the ignition, the spark that ignites everything. There's a hell of a lot more

127
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:43,970
going on with that. And speaking from firsthand experience on developing those types of things,

128
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:51,870
little ignition systems that shouldn't work the way they, you know, do, that needs to be looked

129
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:55,790
at as well. High voltage, there's a lot of phenomenon going on with very high voltage,

130
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:02,870
which I dare anyone to define what a volt is, most people can't. So I just wanted to throw that in

131
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:08,690
maybe to satisfy a little bit more, and maybe we'll talk about the automobile in the future a

132
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:13,510
little bit more, but I just wanted to throw in those concepts right now regarding the automobile,

133
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:18,850
because it's based on vanity. If you look at all they do is they change the way it looks. And

134
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:25,030
they're still, by the way, very, very inefficient. 25% is probably your best efficiency on the small

135
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:30,770
engines, you know, typical car engines. And even if you go to a lot of the government regulatory

136
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:37,730
websites, they tell you that 80 to 90% of all your fuel is combusted where? In the exhaust system.

137
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:46,050
So for every given amount of currency or credits you spend on buying fuel, remember,

138
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:52,010
80% of that might as well just dump it on the ground, because it's just turned being turned

139
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:57,190
into heat, it's not making it go. So it's not very difficult to reverse that, by the way,

140
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:03,350
to make the engine 80% efficient 20% wasteful. I mean, it is it is because there are a lot of

141
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,850
redundant systems put into engines to make them indifferent to change,

142
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:13,030
like computers and things like that. Now, if you tamper with it, and that, but you know,

143
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:17,950
this is a consideration for the young folks and the folks that are have an open mind in that

144
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:24,470
direction. Consider that what you're being told and the thing that you think is going on with that

145
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:29,490
thing called the reciprocating motor is not so when you observe it. And just like anyone,

146
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:34,450
and that it knows these things that are in the, let's say an authoritative figure in that field,

147
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,770
when you explain it to them, or describe have a conversation like this, they look at you and

148
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,390
they don't want to address what you're saying. They're like, Yeah, but who are you going to go

149
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:46,530
tell this to? Because no one really cares, or everyone thinks it's the other thing anyway.

150
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:53,230
So this is for those that are willing to blaze forward and look at things a little differently.

151
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,450
So that's, that's, that's the story about cars, and I'm sticking to it

152
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,330
for now. But let's maybe continue a little more with technology. You know,

153
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:08,690
I've heard a lot of people, by the way, Seth, or let's say a lot meaning because more than three

154
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:16,690
say that we should disregard what is old, because we're so advanced right now technologically.

155
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:23,810
And that obviously is the mark of a simple simpleton. By the way, they over have oversimplified

156
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:30,470
the vanity and the impression that they've gotten from being modern. And they feel that

157
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:35,550
things that have before should be heavily discounted into oblivion. And I've actually

158
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:40,170
heard this from several walks of life, high and low, if you want to look at that that way.

159
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,390
And robots are going to free man from labor, right?

160
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,310
Yeah, perhaps.

161
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:52,370
That was that was predictions about that's what that's what should be going on.

162
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:59,430
That was in the World's Fair typically in the 19 what they call the 1930s. They were promoting

163
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:05,030
that a lot, which is, yeah, they're promoting flying cars by the year 2000. By the way,

164
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:09,750
folks, you're not going to get any of that stuff. And you notice back in the early to mid 20th

165
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,510
century, there was, you know, the Jetsons. And yeah, all these things were so advanced, you know,

166
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:19,770
hotels on the moon and flying jetpacks and you know, all this stuff, you can get none of it.

167
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:24,830
Absolutely not. Not now, at least never, you're never going to get it, let's say,

168
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,370
because never is running out here pretty soon. Another less than two decades,

169
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,970
decade and a half or so. Things will be so different that you will not consider these

170
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:38,410
things. But I want to go back to the mindset that says that we should heavily discount anything

171
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:43,830
that's come before us because we're advanced now, right? With instant communication. It's not the

172
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:51,720
tool of being able to instant communicate. It's what are you communicating? You know, look at it.

173
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:56,980
I mean, look at what's being said in the media, alternative and mainstream. It's laughable.

174
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:06,140
It's a big joke. But anyway, here's the thing. Since I brought up being old, things that not

175
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:12,780
being old, but things of the past, you ever ponder what? Well, you might have heard of what's been

176
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,680
said about it, but ever ponder what would happen if you were able to transport someone from ancient,

177
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:22,119
let's say from two or 3000 4000 years ago into the modern day society, how they would observe

178
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:29,160
things I've actually pondered and written about it. Short little narrative and want to explain

179
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:37,300
that. But what do you think would happen if you brought an ancient Seth into the modern today

180
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,600
current society and you know, they stepped out of whatever they want to step out of the transport

181
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,860
device, you know, let's just keep it figurative here. And they're walking around, let's say in

182
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:51,140
a big city or wherever. Because even if you go into rural environments, you'll still be subject to the

183
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:57,760
influence of the current technology, right? To some degree, what do you think they would be

184
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,820
impressed or shocked or, or find relevant or irrelevant or whatever, you know, how would how

185
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:09,880
would I've got a pretty interesting few interesting thoughts on that. And what do you think, Seth,

186
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:16,020
you think they'd be impressed or not? No, not really. Exactly. It wouldn't be would take 15

187
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:24,610
or 20 minutes, maybe an hour, a day or two or three to get used to it, maybe. Yeah. Now, here's

188
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:32,090
what I discussed and wrote about. I believe I, you know, if this were to happen, what would be the

189
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:36,950
most shocking thing? Well, you know, to to an ancient brought into modern day society. Now

190
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,830
before let me just preface this, this is not you know, I don't know. But this is a way of rationalizing

191
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:48,070
things. By the way, other than walking through society and pointing at all the sex temples that

192
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:51,530
have been built, you know, meaning houses of worship, by the way, they all use the architecture

193
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:57,590
of the ancient sex temples. Yep. And you bring children into them and you worship there. But

194
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:09,050
anyway, all of them. But asphalt, they would be in total shock to see this black stuff spread

195
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:16,090
everywhere on the ground. What you've done with this dark substance. Think about it for a moment.

196
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,870
Yeah, yeah, the lights are the lights will make sense. You explain what's going on, you know,

197
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,090
it glows and it's hot. They had things that glowed and were hot made light as well.

198
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:33,870
But the concept of spreading this coal tar mixed with gravel everywhere would be the main feature

199
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:42,230
that would be just difficult to get over with. Or just kind of like, why the hell did you do that?

200
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,850
Well, makes for a smooth road. Yeah, but still look at it. And no one is paying attention to

201
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:54,470
this. Isn't it interesting? Now, by the way, I just want to throw something in what we'll kind

202
00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:00,090
of maybe move forward on technology or not. You ever hear of water safety regulations and EPA,

203
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:06,470
you know, environmental protection laws regarding like runoff water and storm water and things like

204
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:11,050
that don't contaminate it, right? Don't don't put anything in the water. You know, don't pour

205
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,590
anything down the drain that might be harmful to the fishes or the processing plant or storm

206
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:20,690
sewers tend to go directly back into the environment or something. Anyone ever want to do a little bit

207
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:27,570
of research on the chemical constituents in asphalt and the propagation and leaching rates

208
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:34,830
and what comes out of asphalt when you pour water over it? Yeah, go do a little bit of research on

209
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:43,730
that. Look at the hypocrisy. How much water runs off of asphalt in the modern societies?

210
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:50,890
Most of it in many cases. What do you think is leaching out of the asphalt and running in? Yeah,

211
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:54,670
so yeah, that's that. I can't look at that, though. No, no, no. We can't look at that.

212
00:20:54,750 --> 00:21:03,530
Can't regulate that. Yeah. So yeah, it's an interesting thought. It's the coal tar

213
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:08,070
spread everywhere that would just shock the living daylights out of an ancient product today.

214
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:13,970
Maybe just the coal tar being used everywhere. The darkness. I think we've described briefly.

215
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:20,890
Have you ever heard of let's say I'm paraphrasing here a caveat. Beware the workers of darkness.

216
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:28,010
You know, and of course, most people use a lot of petroleum products that are all made in darkness.

217
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,250
Yes. And well, their behavior. See, the thing is, it's not just visible light. It's the

218
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:38,370
behavior that's attached to that. You know, years ago, people dealt with materials that

219
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:45,010
were produced in the light. Plant fibers, animal materials, plant dyes, surface minerals,

220
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:51,250
right? Things like that. Things that were usually felt or found on the surface and used.

221
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,670
So the material was garnered from things produced in the light today.

222
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:02,170
It's kind of you'd be hard pressed to interact with any material that hasn't been affected

223
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,650
with anything that hasn't been derived from petrochemicals, which is under the ground,

224
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:13,630
which is derived from darkness. Petrochemicals or petroleum, rock oil, by the way, is made in the

225
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:18,530
dark and it's black. So you're spreading this dark substance everywhere. It's an energetic

226
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:25,430
sense that sources the dark. You know, years ago, the full moon was the new moon. Now it's

227
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:30,890
the dark moon is the new moon. Years ago, you reckon the day at high noon in the light. Now

228
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:41,370
you reckon the day when? Middle of the night. And years ago, the new year was reckoned in the

229
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:46,550
light and springtime in the day. And now when do you reckon your new year? On the darkest month,

230
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:50,170
according to the Pope's work schedule, at the darkest part of the month, the darkest part of

231
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:56,390
the day, the darkest part of the year. Pretty dark. Pretty dark group of people.

232
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:06,330
Now, the spirit being in the light, let's say, gets sick in the dark. And the spirit that is,

233
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:11,290
let's say, maybe intended for the dark, gets sick in the light. Every time you ever hear the term

234
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:17,450
psychopath, psycho, meaning the mind or spirit, and patho, pathos, meaning sickness. And there's

235
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:25,970
a little bit, you know, you know, a discomfort or just, yeah, not the way it should be. There's a

236
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,530
little memes, you know, people, you know, like, remember, years ago, people discussed,

237
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:34,370
oh, this left brain, right brain, man, it's all about that. And then it became

238
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:40,770
flat earth now. No, I keep as the earth round again. Right. And if you ask anyone about these

239
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:43,910
things that they discussed, and especially alternative media years ago, that was back

240
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,630
then we don't really talk about that right now. Well, there's been a lot of talk about

241
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:53,370
not so much now as it was about these psychopaths ruling everyone. Listen, folks,

242
00:23:53,370 --> 00:24:00,650
you're all psychopaths, entire human race, except for those that are want to heal that condition,

243
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:07,110
because you are sick. You're in the dark, you're workers of darkness. This is not a critical

244
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:13,170
point of saying you're bad, you're just sick. People that are sick are not bad. And they're

245
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,850
like, well, what about those that had a conversation recently? Again? What about

246
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,050
those that are ruling? Is there the psychopath? Well, no, here's here's what's going on.

247
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:27,850
People that rule are definitely put there by certain influences. And what they Yes,

248
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:33,710
they could be they're psychopathic, of course, by how we just mentioned it. But they're ruling

249
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:38,310
another group of psychopaths. And those the groups that they're ruling are taught that they should

250
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:44,830
give 90% of their energy to the psychopaths that are ruling them, and stab each other in the back

251
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:50,910
for the remaining 10%. Right? So if you eliminate any of the quote, unquote, psychopaths that are

252
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:55,870
ruling the rest of the psychopaths, you prop up another one of the common psychopaths, and they

253
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:00,450
will behave that way also. And they will tell the remaining psychopaths to give all their energy to

254
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:06,090
them or 90% and stab everyone else in the back for the remaining 10%. So you're all pretty

255
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,590
psychopathic until you realize it, and realize it's something that needs to be addressed.

256
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:17,450
So another moot point regarding the information that people are getting being given. But anyway,

257
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:21,990
they're just being accommodated. It's like the self consuming thing, you know, look at again,

258
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:28,990
with technology. Why don't they just make the same car? No, they figure out how to make it right.

259
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:35,570
Because they have to accommodate vanity, a sick mind, let's say, I'm better because I've got the

260
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:42,550
model. You know, you know, people always want wish well, well wishing to everyone else, I want you to

261
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:49,810
do well. But in their mind, they're like, just don't do better than I'm doing. Right? And even

262
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:56,050
parents, by the way, folks. Yes. Maybe what's uncommon is to talk about things that can be

263
00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:01,530
objectified. Parents stop pranking the children. Stop lying to the children, stop pranking them.

264
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:10,490
All I hear is things like the caveat. Yes, son or daughter, the education system is worthless and

265
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:20,310
damaging. But I went through it. So you have to go through it. So yeah, so you're so the psychopathic

266
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:25,730
starts with the parents, the parents in general, this holds pretty true across the board, except

267
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:33,030
for very, very, very, very few exceptions, down to maybe so few that it's very safe to say generally

268
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:41,310
parents are pranking and lying and harming their own children. Objectively, how dare you say that

269
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:44,770
Greek parents are loving and they bring you into the world? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, all that stuff.

270
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:49,870
I'm not negating that. But let's just look at the picture. Objectively, parents information.

271
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:58,210
Yeah, yes. Yeah. And disinformation. Santa Claus, you know, holidays, telling children what to do.

272
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:05,930
Children ask, they can't answer. So yeah, it's really it has to start with the parents. By the

273
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:11,370
way, you know how you increase the let's say this uses word loosely education level of a society.

274
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:16,670
The easiest way to do it is by educating the women.

275
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:24,410
Focusing on that because the women are the ones that spend most of the time

276
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,850
raising the children to their formative years. And if the women are educated, well read, well

277
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:36,710
versed in many things and give good instruction. The children during their formative years, you

278
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:43,240
know, from when they were born till seven or eight will be exposed to that. So you want to educate

279
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,840
raise the level of a society, raise the level of the women. And I'm not talking about guys dressing

280
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:55,080
like women. Anyway. Yeah. So yeah, these things are very, very simple. And they're not commonly

281
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:03,160
discussed. Why? Because maybe you just talked about psychopaths. So let's go back to the

282
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:09,620
technology. What do you think, Seth? Oh, there's psychopaths, too. Yeah.

283
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:14,460
Well, the technology or tools, man is trying to make better tools. But, you know,

284
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,320
they're tools that look better. You know, there are certain things, by the way, in technology that

285
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,060
are extremely simple, new ideas and the way you get a new ideas by reading a very old book, by the way.

286
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:33,720
Yeah. So, yeah. And also understanding the times, certain times, you know, I had once read a thing,

287
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,340
you know, you remember how inline skates or roller skates were popular even until the 90s,

288
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:43,840
like it was kind of a still see them not as much. But but, you know, you had the quad skates,

289
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,040
you know, the four wheels, you know, two wheels paired up, you know, next to each other. And

290
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,620
they were metal and made a lot of noise in the 50s and all that. Well, in the mid 19th century,

291
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:57,620
the inline skate, all wheels made out of wood or rubber were put together by a fellow in the

292
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:03,380
mid 19th century. And he wanted to show this thing off or introduce it. And he was at a soiree,

293
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:08,380
you know, people of, let's say, a certain society. And during the the ball or the

294
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,000
dance, there was a break and he comes out rolling inline skates and he was so excited.

295
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,040
He, I guess, had a little mishap and he went through the French doors over the balcony

296
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,380
and was killed. Bad accident. And they all said, oh, that was a really, really bad idea.

297
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:29,300
Let's never do that. I did not know that. That took about 150 years to be revisited.

298
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:37,780
So, yeah, a lot of these things that we discover are and I want to just yeah, well, I was going to

299
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,980
talk a little bit about Frank Chester's comment on the difference between a discovery and an

300
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:46,840
invention or inventing and discovering. Inventing typically you find when something is, quote unquote,

301
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:51,000
invented, you find there are several parties throughout the planet or a place in society

302
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,400
or many societies that are working on the same thing unbeknownst to each other.

303
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,100
And so, yeah, there's a lot of things that we discover where discovery is something very unique.

304
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:03,600
When someone makes a discovery, it's just one person or one individual that makes it and that's it.

305
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,860
So there's an interesting thing. I just want to credit that to Frank Chester,

306
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:14,920
which if anyone wants a good, relaxing, mind-opening way to look at things that are called

307
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:20,840
geometric forms in relation to other things, look up Frank Chester as if Chester drawers,

308
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:26,560
C-H-E-S-T-E-R, that is Chester Hedren, a seven-sided figure. Very interesting.

309
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:32,940
Just a little fun there. He considers himself to be a master teacher and I would agree he is.

310
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,800
Yeah, if you master these.

311
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:43,000
Seven-sided shape with equal area.

312
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,980
Equal area but not equal, right. So it is lawful, yes, in terms of area.

313
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,600
And I like him because he discusses what's lawful and unlawful.

314
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,920
In terms of his, I like his discussion based on

315
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,260
things should be proven out. By the way, when things are proven out, they're considered lawful.

316
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,900
But no one cares about lawful, right. You're talking to a group of psychopaths that are

317
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:13,500
immoral. Anyway, I shouldn't get into that. But yes, there are four or five people perhaps left

318
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,900
that might want to consider something lawful.

319
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:23,960
So yeah, so technology here, we're making tools where we, whoever we is, the corporate we,

320
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:32,840
collective we. And based on the mindset of vanity, people, if you tell someone something is so,

321
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:38,280
so many times before they get it, they establish that it's so, and then when they get it, it's so,

322
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,800
even though it's not. Well, what did he just say? How many times have you heard,

323
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,200
the new phone is coming out in three months? Oh, wow, it's going to do all these things.

324
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,380
It's the greatest thing. Everyone's waiting and waiting. Now, if you objectify it and look at it,

325
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:57,060
it's a piece of crap. But you know, you've been told so much that it's so great and so advanced

326
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,140
that when you get it, you just don't care anymore.

327
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,800
They haven't made one of those that works right yet either.

328
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:08,600
Yeah. Yeah. But you see, you see what's going on, how you're set up for it. And you still have

329
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,180
people saying, well, we're so advanced now, man. You can't look at all this other stuff yet.

330
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,720
Yeah. Yeah. The psychopath speaking, you know, the sick mind is addressed. See, you address sick

331
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:27,720
people differently than you address people that are healthful. Right. So, you know, how many times

332
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,960
have you heard? Well, if you've ever been in this situation, you know, you know, your little sister

333
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,180
didn't feel well today. She stayed home from school. She's six, you know, so when you come home,

334
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,480
you know, it's a different setting, you know, your sister sleeping. Don't wake them up. Right.

335
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:49,740
Right. Either they need their rest. Yeah. So they rest. So the way most people rest is by

336
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:56,280
enduring this self-consuming consumerism. By the way, the consumption was known as TB.

337
00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:02,560
Tuberculosis was a disease, by the way, when you talk about consumption or the consumer.

338
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:11,100
Someone had the consumption was a consumer. That means the end, right? Yeah. Con, with, and

339
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:18,500
summation would, you know, some being the root there, the end. Right. And the consumer would be

340
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:25,940
the end user of something that's produced. I would say with, you know, and like you just

341
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:31,960
leaning towards the mass production aspect as well, a lot of what is considered, you know,

342
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:38,660
higher technology and stuff like that is more readily available to a larger population.

343
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,640
I'll be it. I mean, the population is currently larger than it has been in

344
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:52,140
a easily accessed recorded history. So I suppose that's some of it. But the

345
00:33:53,350 --> 00:34:05,230
easy access to potable water is one thing. Indoor, you know, not indoor plumbing itself, but the

346
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:11,280
indoor pressurized water, although that's been around for, you know, millennia.

347
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,840
Yes. Multiple story buildings have running water in ancient days. Yeah.

348
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:22,580
Yeah, absolutely. It was it was done. But on the level that it is, you know,

349
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:27,080
with everyone having, you know, the faucets in their homes and things like that, easily,

350
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,880
easy to it's not it's not a new technology. It's just something that's been made more widely

351
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:40,280
available in different forms. But as far as being, you know, new or novel, it's really not.

352
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:46,139
It's just the the newness of it is the ease of access for a greater number of people.

353
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:54,820
It's one of the things that is overlooked a lot by the, I guess, the naysayers of how

354
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:59,240
how terrible everything is, is the fact that there is it's currently

355
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,080
easier to access clean drinking water on this planet relatively than at any other time.

356
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,580
Yes. So even though water is still not really understood, speaking of which, by the way,

357
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,940
you know, the Romans were known, let's say the most recent when you speak of ancient times,

358
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,920
the most recent ones would be the the Romans. There's a lot of references. And by the way,

359
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,420
there's no such thing as the Roman Empire or the Roman this or Roman that it's all Greek,

360
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,820
by the way, it's a splinter that broke off from the Greek society. So that's,

361
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,760
you know, when you hear a lot of people badgering, this is Rome, right? All this other stuff.

362
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:40,920
What about Romulus and Remus and that wolf? And yeah, sure. Well, let's look at it. But,

363
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,540
you know, look at other societies, you know, like if you go to Sicily, for example, you know,

364
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,140
it's all Greek, right? You look at all the old writings, it's all in Greek. It was a penal

365
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:53,140
colony, just like, you know, Brazil was a penal colony. Australia is a penal colony. New Zealand,

366
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,480
I guess, maybe not, you know, you know, all these other places that were, you know,

367
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,020
you shoved certain things there, you know, or people to create an alternate society,

368
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:10,420
for example. Say again? 19 crimes. There was 19 crimes you could be

369
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:18,600
sent to Australia for committing. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, good. I haven't heard that.

370
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:25,760
Yeah. So like the states, what they call America is pretty much, you know, they were English

371
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:31,820
subjects predominantly, you know, and the others that came across. So Rome is a splinter group of

372
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:41,300
the Greek Empire, let's say, expanded by Alexander. If you look at a lot of the things

373
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:47,900
of faults and flawed aspects of society that people blame on Rome, let's say you might look

374
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:53,540
at Catholicism or the Vatican, that is nothing but the revival of Hellenistic paganism that

375
00:36:53,540 --> 00:37:00,640
was developed by Simon Magus, incorporating rituals from Babylon and Canaan and Amorite,

376
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,640
basic, you know, the stuff that was considered don't do. And, you know, so it's basically,

377
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:13,440
again, Hellenistic paganism. What they call the laws, those came out of the Athenian democratic

378
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,480
states, you know, and derived through Roman, just like many things now are considered American,

379
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:25,240
but they're actually derived from English. So, but if we look at the Roman, go back to the

380
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,900
water aspect, you know, they had public works projects, where they would have people that

381
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:35,480
were contracted to bring in water sources that would come into the gate of the city or the center

382
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:43,140
of the city. And they would be judged by the leaders of the municipality on their on the

383
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:50,400
quality before it was tied into the network of pipes and culverts and things to deliver it to

384
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:57,020
the people. So what they would do to discern the quality is they would bring out the people and

385
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:04,460
have the water gathered in a well or a large opening where the water accumulated temporarily

386
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,920
for several weeks before they incorporated it. And they would judge the quality by encouraging

387
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:17,180
people to throw coins into the water. And looking at the coins after a certain amount of time,

388
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:22,980
for example, if the coins became encrusted with calcified material and things, they said,

389
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:28,520
well, the water is not very good. Or sometimes they would throw coins into the wells and these

390
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:34,640
open areas, and the coins would dissolve, like that water is not very good. So that's a little

391
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,400
bit of history and where you get the wishing well, you know, people throwing coins into the water,

392
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:44,380
there's an actual practical chemical engineering aspect to it. Just wanted to throw that in there.

393
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:51,080
So you still do a lot of things. And you've been told there for certain reasons. And it made sense

394
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:57,200
that they were considered wishing wells because you wanted the new water source, you wish that the

395
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:03,580
new water source was viable and potable and met the mark of good water, right? What if the water,

396
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,000
the new waters that were being brought in were not fit? Well, you wish they were. So they were,

397
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:13,800
I guess, dubbed wishing wells, right? You wouldn't wish the water to be bad. So yeah, so this is

398
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:21,140
where, you know, maybe certain we'll just throw that in as being an uncommon thought. But yeah,

399
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:26,960
the water aspect. Yes, that was around as well. In many societies, they had multiple story buildings

400
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,620
with water flowing, they elevated water and made the water flow in different ways they understood.

401
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,820
Were they moving it through straight pipes?

402
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:43,700
Actually, they attempted to make it the distance between the distances were, you know, the shortest

403
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:49,160
distance between two points is a straight line. And they attempted to do that basically, because

404
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:55,900
it was less work and less material. But the actual pipes themselves, for example, in certain places,

405
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:02,720
they were slightly tapered cones that one fit into another with a pressure fit, right? And by virtue

406
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,680
of it being a cone created an undulating motion. That would almost make it a vortex. Yeah.

407
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:14,140
Yes. As it's flowing through there. Wow. And because they didn't move solid rock and

408
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:19,840
they would rather go around natural formations, they had a more of a meandering line. See,

409
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:25,660
today they'll blast and bore to make it straight, right? Back then, if there was a big boulder

410
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:29,780
somewhere, they'd say, well, let's just go around it. And you got that little bit of meandering,

411
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:36,560
which allowed the water. And also, by the way, if you do build a very long straight line with

412
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:42,560
liquid flowing through it, you will get standing waves and you'll get things wanting to

413
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:48,440
not behave properly. So they knew about that as well. Yes. And they kept it dark and they didn't

414
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:54,580
use ferrous materials. They used wood and terracotta typically and things like that.

415
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:59,900
And the water was more, it was able to breathe more. They didn't have these plastic seals and

416
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:06,420
things and welding devices to make things really tight and shut and very strong pumps

417
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:11,680
to push things, chop the water. It allowed it to flow more naturally in many cases.

418
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:17,760
So yes. So technology regarding water. Yes. I think I've said in the past,

419
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,300
if you've been around in other conversations, I've said that when mankind understands

420
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:26,620
or fully comprehends how to integrate and disintegrate water, he will master the material

421
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:33,720
world. And maybe that's the case why you're still told water is H2O. And maybe that's why

422
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,260
when you go and purchase water, it's in clear containers with flat bottoms exposed to light

423
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:49,120
and warm. Or water should be dark and kept cool. So yeah, we'll do the water thing one day. But in

424
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:56,400
the meantime, folks, if you do use water, by the way, for potability or drinking, make sure it's

425
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,420
not in the light and make sure it's in a cool place, meaning at least 39 or 4 degrees Celsius.

426
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:09,500
And you will find the water quality increases when you do that. That's basically the crux of the

427
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:14,860
matter of keeping water in a quality state. But yes, technology and water are interlinked.

428
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:20,200
What's interesting, by the way, look at the most of the simpleton mind will say,

429
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:25,180
look how technologically advanced. And they're referring to the computing and electrical devices.

430
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:31,000
Right. They require special types of water to keep things clean as well. So again,

431
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:35,460
without this type of deionized, super clean water, they can't make these circuit boards.

432
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,700
Well, they use a lot of other synthetic chemicals also, but it's very important that they have

433
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:47,900
extremely clean water for certain things. But for technology, folks, it's just a matter of tools.

434
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:55,540
And I would consider the vanity aspect of it. You know, here's the thing also, even with the

435
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:00,960
computer thing, you know, that's the phones, which are now, you know, smart phones, I guess,

436
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,740
because, you know, they never say the user is smart. You ever notice that?

437
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,640
How about dumb phones and smart people?

438
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:16,240
There's an idea. Yeah. So but but nonetheless, again, they're doing the thing with the vanity.

439
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:22,180
Let's just contemplate the matter and make it correctly. But no, they've got to have a new phone

440
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:27,700
every year, every year, which starts in the darkness. So the people are kind of in the dark

441
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:35,020
about their own vanity. You know, vanity, vanity, everything's vanity.

442
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:40,340
Yes, yes. You know, I want everyone to do well, but just don't do better than I am doing.

443
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:47,820
Right. So this is your typical mind set of the prevailing mindset of the species.

444
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:57,660
Let's just say. Yeah. So I guess with the technology aspect, what more can we say?

445
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:01,900
I mean, objectifying it to a certain degree is the best way to do it.

446
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:08,080
Absolutely. Instant communication. Nearly instant.

447
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:13,980
Oh, yeah, it sure is. Skype is an interesting thing. There are several things that appear to

448
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:20,980
be instant, no time delay. I would say, yeah, that's for for all practical purposes. It's

449
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:33,860
it's been achieved now just needs to be slightly more consistent and reliable.

450
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:41,080
Yes. But, you know, there's there's an interesting thing about that, you know,

451
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,540
something called a utility, you know, the public utilities you subscribe to it. Right.

452
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,500
It's the subscription office that's mucking things about, you know, they've got to create

453
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:57,860
again, because there's vanity and gluttony and greed in humanity. You can't give them free

454
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:03,360
access to everything because they're just not going to be as conservative about it.

455
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:07,980
You know, what do you think people are going to do when they find out all the utilities,

456
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:10,820
water, phone, all that stuff is already being paid for?

457
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:16,660
And what the reason they're being billed every month is so it kind of like regulate them?

458
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:22,500
You know, if they had a different mindset, it would be understood, by the way, when you

459
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,580
deal with I want to bring up utilities. All of these things are public works. You know,

460
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:32,160
the water, electric, gas, phone, those are paid for already. But the only what they've

461
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:39,280
done, the legal society is behind the scenes, they know human nature. And they're like, well,

462
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,420
we tell people it's all paid for. They'll leave the house with the water running and all the

463
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:48,440
lights on and everything going in the windows and doors open. And if you ask them, you know,

464
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:53,280
why are you doing that? Well, I don't care. It's paid for. Right. This is your average

465
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,880
surface-dwelling human. Now, not in all cases, but average meaning look up what the word average

466
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:07,960
means, by the way. And so what they do is they the only way they well, predominantly,

467
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:14,800
the only way to use that word loosely, is that the people have access to these utilities is by

468
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:20,640
first going through what's called the billing, billing subscribing office. So when you interact

469
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:25,600
with the water, gas, phone people, you're not really interacting with those that are providing

470
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:30,880
the service over put the thing together, interacting with a very specific group or an

471
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,540
office that was set up, whereby contract, you now become a subscriber that has to be billed for,

472
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:42,820
and for it. And if in somewhere loosely, it defines it never really defines that if you don't,

473
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,240
quote, unquote, perform on the bill, they'll cut it off, you know, or short you have that.

474
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,100
So but it's kind of like commonly known that, you know, parents, they prank the children who

475
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:56,840
you've got to get a job so you can pay the bills. Well, you know, well, you know,

476
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,440
this is your parents, folks. But anyway, what's interesting about this is that it's all paid for,

477
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:10,360
but you can't tell the people that. So yeah, these, it's very slight of hand ish. You know,

478
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,080
if you look at some of the legal aspects of paperwork regarding this, they'll tell you that

479
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:20,060
you have subscribed as a billing billable subscriber. That's why you're in the situation

480
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:26,680
you are. So the key folks is to how do you gain access to these public utilities that are paid

481
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:32,900
for, by the way, how are they paid? Well, it's credit. How do you gain access to it without

482
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:37,660
going through the subscription office, and they make it very, very, very difficult.

483
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:43,520
That's why if you've ever looked at a utility bill, wherever you are, it's never within the

484
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:48,600
jurisdiction that the services are rendered to. So if you are any particular city or town,

485
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,940
you'll always notice, if not, I'm going to say always, 99% of the time,

486
00:47:54,200 --> 00:48:00,280
you're supposed to send the payment of that bill, quote unquote, to some place that is not near you.

487
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:07,880
It's always somewhere far away. There's a reason for that too. So yeah, but no one's paying

488
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:12,660
attention. And I think I've described in the last show, we wanted to maybe talk about how the money

489
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:18,520
system works, but people will never understand it. And this is prophetic, by the way. In the future,

490
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:24,200
it is written that the reason why the money system will not be sustained is not because the people

491
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:29,820
will comprehend it or understand anything about it. It's because they somehow and wholesale decide

492
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:37,780
not to use it anymore. Right? These merchants will go away because the people decide not to

493
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:43,360
use it. It never states that they will understand it. And when I say never, never is not really far

494
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:50,320
away from here, by the way, never meaning the way things are, as you consider today. But it

495
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:56,340
doesn't mean that we can't just bring up certain descriptions of the credit system. So because

496
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:01,300
that ties in a lot with technology. Typically, you ever notice how the newer technology always

497
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:08,600
costs a little bit more, you know, because it's a little better, supposedly. So whenever you bring

498
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:14,780
up anything like that, how the transactions are being mitigated or done these days is through a

499
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:20,380
credit-based economy. And people are still saying that it's debt-based. Well, because some, maybe

500
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:25,520
they were told that it's debt-based. So they just say that it's debt-based. But do they spend five

501
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:32,300
seconds looking at its credit? No, they don't. Why should they? But hopefully the four listeners

502
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:38,360
that we've got maybe will. And I think they're beginning to realize it. So that, you know,

503
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,780
many things, again, I think somewhere it was written that money could pretty much solve all

504
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:48,860
things, right? Or many problems can be solved with money, paraphrasing. We'll be more in the

505
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:56,040
intralinear version. But I would say that maybe could it be because there's no money and many

506
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:01,630
problems aren't being addressed. They were preemptively done through the credit-based

507
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:07,870
economy. And by the way, as we before, you know, we're almost done with the first hour here,

508
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:15,670
but I'd like to just say that you couldn't, let's just say underscoring with the financial

509
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:22,970
community is reliance on technology. They go hand in hand. And you have people that are so

510
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:29,310
oblivious to anything real that they're still discussing wiring money. Have you ever heard of

511
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:36,590
someone saying that the money's being wired? Yeah. It's like, yeah, we're going to call the

512
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:40,370
restaurant, Seth, you know, I'm kind of hungry right now. Maybe you are too. And I'm going to

513
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:45,270
have you a sandwich or maybe some hummus wired over to you. Does that sound about right?

514
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:47,450
Wonderful. That would be wonderful. Thank you.

515
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,690
That sounds about right, doesn't it? Yeah.

516
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:56,310
Yeah. Wait until people, well, no, they're not going to find out how it works, but

517
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:00,050
yeah. And by the way, they talk about still, let's just throw this in there. I'm not

518
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:04,050
in defending the Federal Reserve or apologizing for them, which by the way, defend and apologize

519
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:13,230
means the same thing. It's redundant. Yes. Yes. They're just brokers. The people are being screwed

520
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:24,030
by their own local bank branch, right? That was bass backwards, but yeah. It's where you, the

521
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:28,550
little shop that they call a bank, it's not the Federal Reserve. They're the ones that are doing

522
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:34,490
the funky stuff, right? And they're acting independently. They're all little trusts that

523
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:40,030
have certain regulations. And if you maybe unregulated to a certain degree. Yeah. And by

524
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:45,750
the way, there is no Federal Reserve Bank that was shut down in 1933. What's being operated as

525
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:52,790
the Federal Reserve system, right? Yeah. It's a system. The system of the signature is where

526
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:57,570
the credit is garnered from. So for example, if you go down and see common folk on the street,

527
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:03,970
they throw litter on the floor. But if you, let's say, tell the common folk, I want to take a pen

528
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:08,270
and sign the name that you use on the litter before you throw it on the floor. Does it change it?

529
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:14,350
And they're all going to say, no, it's still litter. It's just garbage, man. So what? I

530
00:52:14,350 --> 00:52:18,490
signed the name on it, right? But here comes a limousine with a bankster in there. And if he

531
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:23,730
sees someone sign the name on a bubblegum wrapper, they tell the chauffeur to slam on the brakes and

532
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:28,250
grab the bubblegum wrapper, put it in the pocket because that is worth a lot of credit.

533
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:34,410
You see, that's why people will never understand how the money system works. That's why you got

534
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:40,650
to tell them little stories like the parents do. It's debt-based, man. Or it's going to crash every

535
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:44,990
month. Yeah, every month. Just keep telling them it's going to crash. The dollar is going to crash.

536
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:50,710
Yeah. Yeah. But fortunately, it never is not too far away. So, yeah.

537
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:59,110
That happened like a hundred years ago, wasn't it?

538
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:06,510
Well, yeah, about 33 for sure. 33 to 39 for sure. There is no dollar. The interesting thing here is,

539
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:11,050
you know, we talked about instant communication. It seems to fall apart when anything

540
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:15,170
validatable comes up because that was over 80-some odd years ago,

541
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:20,530
and yet people still haven't noticed. So, we could accurately and very precisely say there

542
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:25,730
is an 80-year time delay when it comes to comprehending how the credit system works

543
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:33,020
with people. So much for instant communication. All right. We'll be right back.

544
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,520
Yes. And with more instant communication in a few minutes, folks.

545
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:48,200
Welcome back to Uncommon Sense here at American Freedom Radio on Americanfreedomradio.com.

546
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:57,280
You can find contact information for the program here, the broadcast, at uncommonradio.com.

547
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:06,240
If you'd like to email us, the Greek and I, or get into contact with us or find easy links to

548
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:15,060
past broadcasts and things of that nature, that's the place to start. So, uncommonradio.com.

549
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:20,560
Yeah. And the current chat and Ustream are easily found on that uncommonradio.com,

550
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:29,320
www.uncommonradio.com. It's easier to put in the .com and the www because that's a very common term.

551
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:34,380
And if you do a general search on the browser, you'll get many other things. We

552
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:39,780
kind of have that set up just as a calling card, because years ago, people asked you,

553
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,840
you did something. I said, you got a card? And you're like, oh, no, I don't, man. Well,

554
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,240
yeah, you just go to a printer and get some cards. Now, today, if someone asks you,

555
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:50,240
where can I find out more about this? Say, well, do you have a website? And you're like,

556
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:53,400
well, no, I don't, man. Well, you also, yeah, we don't say that. We say, yes, we do.

557
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:59,100
The only reason the website is up is we're not asking for subscriptions. So we get beer money,

558
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:04,940
and we're not asking for this or whatever. And there's nothing secret. There's no secret area

559
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:11,400
in there. It's just a common courtesy. If someone asks, what's the site? There it is.

560
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:18,480
But speaking of getting beer money, we are being broadcast through American Freedom Radio,

561
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:24,100
and they are relying on donations and things like that. So you know what to do, folks.

562
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:30,780
There are, I want to thank a few folks out there that do it. Because of Uncommon Sense,

563
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,860
the Greek and Seth Michael, there are a couple, I think, that consistently donate because of this

564
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:44,000
venue here. You know, they know for sure they can tune into Uncommon Sense and American Freedom

565
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:54,560
Radio and have a dummy load, two hour free dummy load per week sonic experience. And of course,

566
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:59,340
for the rest of the week, you can be dummy loaded, you know, but you know, for at least they know

567
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:04,700
for two hours a week, there will be no dummy loading. And yeah, it's pretty and they do

568
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:10,900
appreciate it. And we appreciate you for helping out the crew at American Freedom Radio. Yeah.

569
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:17,420
Absolutely. If you would, we've had a couple of people express interest in,

570
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:23,800
I guess, donating, giving us a little bit of something just as a thank you for broadcasting,

571
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:27,700
things like that. If that's something you're interested in doing, just email us.

572
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:37,640
Yes. I can. It can be done with relative ease. But yeah, so just email us. You can

573
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:45,880
uncommonradio.com www.uncommonradio.com. Like I said, I do this because I enjoy the conversation

574
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:54,140
and it's a conversation. Whereas even if we were talking about some of the same subject matter

575
00:56:54,140 --> 00:57:00,660
that is being discussed elsewhere, it's certainly done in a different manner and with different

576
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:06,600
content. You don't hear the things being discussed the way that they're discussed here anywhere else.

577
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:11,980
That's part of the reason why we do it publicly. The Greek and I have had conversations, many,

578
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:19,480
many conversations broadcast and the relative privacy of not being broadcast over the land.

579
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:27,720
I enjoy the conversation, the ability to learn, to contemplate and to talk about things in a way

580
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:35,400
that is just not available elsewhere. And seemingly you don't need, I mean,

581
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:40,180
as long as it exists, you don't have to have many saying these things. You just need them said.

582
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:45,020
There's an old saying, perhaps that, I think it was one of the, I think it might have been Socrates.

583
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:53,800
He said that a fool has to say something, but the wise have something to say. So if you tune in,

584
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:58,720
by the way, anywhere at any time, you'll see there's a lot of people that have to say something.

585
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,760
Have you heard that before? We have to do something, man. We got all these problems. We

586
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:09,600
got to do something. It's like, uh, yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. How's that working out for you?

587
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:17,620
And there's a lot of interest in the problem, right? But there's very little interest in the

588
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:21,540
solution because once the solution is given, you can't philosophize the problem anymore.

589
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,140
Oh, I'd say it's, there's a lot of interest in the symptoms of the problem.

590
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:27,960
Yes.

591
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:35,240
Talking about the problem, whatever that may be. There's many, many symptoms that are discussed,

592
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:42,140
sort of like treating the symptoms in the, what they call the medical community, things like that.

593
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:47,740
If it's not, you know, for immediate trauma care, I recommend avoiding them.

594
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:54,600
Yes. And the trauma care is information and technology or skill that has been gathered

595
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:59,640
for thousands of years from the battlefield. By the way, folks, you can do that on your own.

596
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:07,140
And yeah, yeah. The avoid, and the most of these entitled classes, we kind of harp on them,

597
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:14,220
deservingly so. All of your entitled classes pretty much are there to be self-serving and

598
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:20,980
to pretty much keep the greed and gluttony and vanity of society at bay or in check.

599
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:23,960
Absolutely.

600
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:32,380
Yeah. If you look at the scientific, religious, medical, legal society or education societies,

601
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:37,200
they're just pranking you. And, you know, I'm kind of being known as the guy always just talking

602
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,940
about the pranksters, you know. But yeah, it's a prank. There's a lot of people out there looking

603
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:46,420
for quote unquote medical solutions from the medical society. You're not going to get that

604
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:50,960
because they're not there to do anything but prank you. You're not going to get solutions

605
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:56,200
with the legal society because they're just pranking. You know, same with the scientists.

606
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,600
I came on to the AFR chat before the show started and I want to say hello to Dylan

607
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:08,340
out there if you're listening. Hello, Dylan. As he said hello and he said Dylan posted

608
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:14,360
before we came on. Ninety eight percent of all science scientists or science is false

609
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:19,380
and 95 percent don't even know it. And there's some wisdom, folks. Thank you, Dylan.

610
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:24,560
Yes, that is pretty accurate, pretty correct. The numbers may be floating around a little bit,

611
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:31,420
but yes, pretty much the majority of it is bull. Yeah. And by the way, if anyone wants to

612
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:36,540
investigate that on their own, that infinite bastion of information, the Internet, there's

613
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:43,340
quite a few articles or commentaries, I'd say things being written about scientific fraud,

614
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:49,720
by the way, and not just from critics or people deciding to throw rocks or being stoners, by the

615
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:55,100
way, behind the scenes, I was once in a conversation with some other radio hosts and I said, I'm just

616
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:59,860
doing the radio show to throw stones, throw rocks. And someone said, you're a stoner. And I'm like,

617
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,380
no, I'm not. I'm like, oh, yeah, that was a real good one that got me.

618
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,860
And speaking of stoners, by the way, I just kind of like here's a pop curry.

619
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:13,660
There's a lot of talk about the legalization of cannabis, right? I bring up the stoners.

620
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:20,600
How many of them actually research what they're talking about from an objective point of view?

621
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:27,160
Well, if you said none, you're correct. Actually, there are a couple. Yeah. Up in the northwest,

622
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:33,680
but a couple meaning like the four or five listeners, right? A few, very few. But most

623
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:38,900
people are hinging on the legal society. And if you actually go and study the legislation

624
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,600
regarding illegalization of certain things or prohibition of certain things, you'll find that

625
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:51,760
it's in almost all cases, it doesn't apply to those that are outside of the administration and

626
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:59,740
or it's been repealed. So all this crying about legalization of cannabis is just

627
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:07,060
a typical human tripe against that. I think it's the perceived the perceived

628
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:15,600
persecution or prosecution of the pranking of such things. Yeah. There are a Greek guy. Yeah.

629
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,680
A Greek guy had all this. That's their job is to prank people because of that stuff.

630
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:25,360
Yes, exactly. Yeah. I had all this pot, man. And the cops came in and beat me up and took it.

631
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:28,880
What do you do about that? You know, it's like, well, they're they're not operating under

632
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:37,980
any law. Anyone. There's this is interesting. I'm not going to give too many specifics. I don't want

633
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:42,780
to sound pedantic, but there is several companies, local companies. And you could find on the

634
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:46,920
Internet, you know, like a local pizza shop, for example, or whatever. And sometimes on the website

635
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:51,020
they say, well, hiring. Right. And then you go down there and say, you know, application, click on it.

636
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,280
And they give you a little caveat. They say, well, the hiring is done according to this code,

637
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:59,600
right? U.S. code, whatever, whatever, you know, Right to Work Act, whatever, whatever.

638
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:05,140
And then you click on it and start reading that code. Oh, no, no. He's telling us to study. Yeah.

639
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:11,200
Just five minutes, folks. If you start reading the code, it actually tells you that in order to work,

640
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:19,800
you need this type of paperwork or whatever the attorney general finds to be acceptable.

641
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,280
That's a really big or who the hell is this attorney general guy making the decision?

642
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:29,880
And if you don't have the quote unquote paperwork that they list, which by the way, by the way,

643
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:33,540
if you research that paperwork, it cannot be used in the way they're telling you it should be,

644
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:38,100
by the way, by their own definition. But who is this attorney general guy? Go, go say,

645
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,700
well, I don't have that paperwork. I'm going to go talk to the attorney general.

646
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,920
Do they ever want to talk to you about it? No, no, they don't. This is all pranking, you know,

647
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:50,660
all of it, not some of it. And I just gave I'm not going to be pedantic and give the

648
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:55,480
codes and all this. Right. But go, go research the right to work acts and things like that and

649
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:59,420
start reading it just a little bit. I know you don't want to. You know, most people hate that.

650
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,000
They don't want to look at what things mean and they don't want to look where things come from.

651
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:09,400
Right. Because whatever reason I don't want to get into why it's because we just talked about

652
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:16,100
the pathos of it. But, yeah, you'll be you'll be scratching the head and you're wondering,

653
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:22,900
what the hell is going on? Well, we're discussing here on Uncommon Sense what is going on

654
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:28,860
objectively, which most people don't want to hear. If you've been subject to pranking,

655
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,700
that's all you know. That's all you're going to resonate with. For example,

656
01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:40,360
if you make a tuning fork from scratch to resonate at a certain frequency,

657
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:48,420
when all the making is done, that's the frequency it's going to resonate at. So, you see, and how

658
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:53,900
would one do that? I'm never mind. I'm sorry. I almost digressed. Well, you know, you could take

659
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:59,080
a block of aluminum, a block of sheet, some aluminum stock or metal stock and start cutting

660
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:03,940
it away. And, you know, you know, the tuning fork, right. It's a typical kind of image when

661
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:13,340
you say that it's length and how would you find that that that a four thirty two or or, you know,

662
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:18,080
four forty five. How would you use something? Yeah, you'd use something else. There's another

663
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:24,240
way to have a reference, right? Yes, exactly. Measuring reference. And in this case, it would

664
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:29,360
be Hertzian, right? You know, the sinusoidal form, things that kind of convey that in an analog

665
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:33,200
manner that you can interact with. Right. Because some people can just hear it and they can't

666
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:39,300
objectify it. Right. But if you have, you know, I could hear it like if I had a tuning fork and

667
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:44,120
then went to make another one, you know, or something. But I would have to have that note

668
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:50,900
to begin with in order to like even if it wasn't a visual thing, like I would have to hear the sound

669
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:55,720
and compare the sounds as it was being done. And I don't know how accurate, probably within a cent

670
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:01,140
or two of accuracy. But from scratch, I couldn't I couldn't make a tuning fork from scratch.

671
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:07,420
Yeah. Well, unless you made the first one and then you would spend a lot of time referencing

672
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:13,200
what it did and then anything else would be measured against it. Right. Yeah. Now,

673
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:20,800
that'd be an interesting project to set upon making a tuning fork from nothing.

674
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,460
So, yeah, I digress. I'm sorry. Or some stock, metal stock, let's say metal is pretty good

675
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:30,080
for a quality. You can make it out of any material, but it won't react the way that we

676
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:36,120
commonly discuss a tuning fork. But the interesting thing is right now, people are acting as if

677
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:40,680
everything is just new and nothing. There's nothing old, old is discarded. So they really

678
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:46,740
don't know. Just like the tuning fork. Right. But here's the thing. If you've been made

679
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:54,160
socially, culturally, mentally, spiritually, in your family, in your society, whatever,

680
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:59,980
to be subject to pranking and the pranking is good or the pranking is the way that it is.

681
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:03,980
Right. And you're motivated by penalty. That is what you resonate with.

682
01:07:05,300 --> 01:07:09,240
And that's very simple. And this is the common trait that you find.

683
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:14,340
One thing that we like to discuss is that pretty much people are now motivated through penalty.

684
01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:20,100
You know, if you ask people why they do certain things other than like touching themselves and

685
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:24,980
things that feel good, right, eating when they're hungry is because if I don't do it,

686
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:28,980
you know, X, Y, Z will happen. It's usually X, Y, Z is something bad.

687
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:32,820
And they're motivated by penalty. And they've been pranked.

688
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:38,940
And if you ask them, they've been tuned. That's what they they are tuned to resonate with. That's

689
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:45,440
sounds proper to them because that's they have been like an instrument, a string, a note,

690
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:51,520
anything. They've been they've been tuned. Very. That's an enlightening way of looking at it,

691
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:55,860
I suppose. Good. That's a good analogy. Yes. Yes. They've been tuned to resonate

692
01:07:55,860 --> 01:08:00,740
with the lie and the prank. So, you know, so I don't know where these guys in alternative media

693
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:08,540
or mainstream or these people that want to make things better are using as their launchpad or

694
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:16,760
their reference, because until you start looking at the nature or object of the way things are from

695
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:22,060
an objective point of view, removing yourself from it and admitting that you're in a sick state in

696
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:26,920
the society, meaning any society, doesn't matter if you're in Russia or Iraq, South America,

697
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:33,560
let's say Venezuela, U.S., Canada, doesn't matter, China, Korea, you're all sick. Pretty general.

698
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:39,279
Yes. Speaking of which, by the way, we got I got a lot of crap on a quote unquote Skype group.

699
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:46,140
One guy came on and he said, where do you get off, man? You talk like you sound like you know

700
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:52,140
everything. Right. And I said, well, wait, hold on a second. Hold on a second. You know,

701
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:58,260
how do you know that? Did you hear the show? And he's like, oh, yeah, yeah, I did. I did. I did hear

702
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:02,760
the show. I said, well, then if you heard the show, then how could I be the only one that knows

703
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:10,740
everything? Now you do, too. Right. So it's not good to play with humans. I mean, they're just

704
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:17,040
silly creatures, but you see the point there. So, you know, yeah, this is funny. Well, if you heard

705
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,880
it, you know, you know it, too. Now you're it, too. You're it. Yeah. You got the cooties now,

706
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,300
too, man. Yeah. Anyway, people are just. Yeah. So just don't don't make fun of them. Yeah,

707
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:30,160
it's just it's kind of hard. It's not. Well, the thing is, you've got to have fun

708
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:35,720
because they get so ramped up and, you know, they like to they have this.

709
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:43,020
Well, it's what they're tuned into. You know, you've got a strong adds new new meaning to the

710
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:50,859
concept of being high strung as well to give an analogy within an analogy. OK, you have someone

711
01:09:50,859 --> 01:09:57,140
who is tense all of the time, right? There's an. Yeah. Yeah. These are all armored tuning.

712
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:04,340
It can be, you know, it can be felt, it can be heard, it can be seen. I don't know about tasted,

713
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:12,820
but yeah, they're tuned into it and they cannot return without great difficulty or inconvenience

714
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:18,520
to the mind. They by the way, folks, if you're this is more addressing the four or five listeners,

715
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:22,920
but you ever notice that when you speak to your average surface dwelling earth inhabitant,

716
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:28,380
those that are enlightened or awake, if you start wanting to discuss the or bring up the points of

717
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:32,500
what things are really based on, you know, reference things that are tangible or validatable,

718
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:39,180
they try to discount it by telling you, oh, that's an opinion or that's your opinion. Right. So that

719
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:44,600
somehow makes it go away. Right. Or and the other thing that they like to say, by the way, this is

720
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:49,020
a caveat to the four or five people out there. The other thing they say is, well, I don't agree

721
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:52,440
with that. Like for some reason, because they don't agree with it, it's not true.

722
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:58,320
This is the kind of stuff you have to put up with when you're dealing with the average. Yes,

723
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:04,240
look up what the word average means. Surface dwelling earth inhabitant, the typical psychopath

724
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:09,560
or whatever. By the way, again, I just want to bring up something that was brought up in

725
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:17,680
conversation recently, talking about also people making excuses when you bring up how things are

726
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:22,860
the way they are, because they can be easily referenced and explained. People jump out of

727
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:26,420
the woodwork and say, well, well, it doesn't you see what people have been so preconditioned.

728
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:30,080
I'm like, yeah, yeah. So what you're making excuses for them. Are you like the attorney

729
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:34,240
for the human race now? Whether they were conditioned or whatever is irrelevant. We're

730
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:40,180
explaining what is going on, you see, and what is going on right now. People are talking about

731
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:44,140
they've been conditioned and dumbed down. Well, again, here's your time delay, folks.

732
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:51,560
The dumbing down ended a long time ago. You've been in the numbing down. And I brought that up

733
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:57,960
and someone in conversation recently said, yeah, got apathy. You know, you remember that got milk

734
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:02,660
ad, you know, it was a black background with the Gil Sands font got milk. I want to do the maybe

735
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:09,040
the shirts and the hats and put them on the website. And it'll just be a black cap or black

736
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:14,740
T-shirt. And it'll be, you know, the Gil Sands, you know, font is a got apathy question mark,

737
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:20,900
you know, can it can it if they're going to be on the website, can it be have apathy question?

738
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:27,280
Or have. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. I have apathy. OK. Yeah. So this is where this is where you're at.

739
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,920
You know, you know, it's an opinion, man. Or that's I don't agree with that.

740
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:37,420
All right. OK. It's the tuning bit. If you if you speak just one one note out of tune.

741
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:43,300
And if you look at if you know what we are able to exist, you know what we are able to perceive

742
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:49,220
before we look at that is how it's referenced, you know, as being a verse, right? A verse in a song,

743
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:55,700
piece of piece of music there. There are chords involved even on on a single instrument. You know,

744
01:12:55,740 --> 01:13:01,440
if you have one one string that's tuned out of scale with everything else,

745
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:08,660
then it's going to sound incorrect. So the the concept and the idea of good information being

746
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:15,380
shared with and reacted to poorly by those who have been tuned to bad information,

747
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:22,500
you know, it's just it's a dissonant. Yeah. Yeah. It's become. Yeah. It hurt. It can it can

748
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:27,940
cause physical pain. You know, emotional pain is physical pain. You know, it can cause distress.

749
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:37,300
Old old wine and new wineskins, you know, kind of idea and retuning can be done. It can be done.

750
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,440
But you have to like I was saying, you know, I couldn't build a tuning fork

751
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:49,480
from nothing. I would need something to reference. So in order to to retune or to

752
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:53,640
tune to a different scale or a different note or a different chord structure,

753
01:13:54,360 --> 01:14:02,120
you have to have something to resonate with to adjust the tuning. So it's just I don't know,

754
01:14:02,180 --> 01:14:09,180
I kind of ran away with that analogy. But it's it's very I'm you know, I or access to a large

755
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:17,060
part of my perception of this plane of this world around me. And so having having that it's

756
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:21,860
something that I understand a little bit differently or comprehend a little bit differently than a lot

757
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:26,540
of the physical world and being able to translate a lot of what's going on in the physical world

758
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:35,300
to, you know, something less complex in my own mind, I suppose, to music that's very it's an

759
01:14:35,300 --> 01:14:40,560
apt analogy. And it's it will come in handy in describing things to a lot of the people that I

760
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:49,000
that I talk to. So I like that. And chords also used in geometry regarding circles and things and

761
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:57,180
that can be rationalized mathematically or geometrically. Perhaps maybe what we're trying

762
01:14:57,180 --> 01:15:05,280
to do is rationalize a certain type of thought that might bring some relief. Like, for example,

763
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:13,100
you'll never hear being discussed here to make the world a better place, because it Yeah, anyway,

764
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:19,400
we're not going to get into that at the moment. But that, by the way, is a big mistake for those

765
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:24,980
that have skill. If you ever noticed, by the way, anyone who, let's say a discoverer or inventor,

766
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:30,340
that publicly goes out and says, we have to make the world a better place, they meet a very bad

767
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:36,980
fate very quickly. And that is because of the divine nature of things as well. So if you are

768
01:15:36,980 --> 01:15:42,820
skilled in as such, and you can make the world a better place, just do it, don't say it publicly,

769
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:48,920
and don't promote it as such, but you will be flattened out like a bug. If you do, you know,

770
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:55,680
cosmically meaning of the world and from the divine as well. Here's the thing, folks, and this

771
01:15:55,680 --> 01:16:01,320
is the best thing for the young. Today is a little bit worse than yesterday, but not as bad as it's

772
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:09,880
going to be tomorrow. Think about it. Okay. It's very gradual, like the frog being boiled in the

773
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:14,400
pot analogy, right? If you turn up the heat too much, he jumps out. But now let's follow through.

774
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:20,420
If he jumps out, now you have to put him back in the cold water. All that time that was spent prior

775
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:26,420
has to be, you know, thrown away and you restart. So if you're like five minutes away from boiling

776
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:31,000
him, and it took three hours to get there, if he jumps out, you can't just put him back in the hot

777
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:36,360
water, he'll jump out again, you got to start all over again. So yeah, so today's just slightly worse

778
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:40,280
because if it was much worse than yesterday, everyone would stop and address it, you know,

779
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:46,740
and you're not getting anything that's going to be this is an assurance, folks. When you tune

780
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:52,880
into alternative media or mainstream or university, or all your little funny stuff you guys like to do

781
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:59,820
generally, you're not getting anything. All that discussion is tripe, folks. I mean, it's just

782
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:05,900
wasted time dummy loading hamster wheel stuff. You know, that's why when you speak to people that

783
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:10,100
are in the business, mainstream and alternative, they're like, if you bring up the question about

784
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:16,350
how come this stuff is so dumb, like, oh, it's just entertainment. Okay, there was actually

785
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:21,070
a court case regarding this in conversation, I didn't get all the details. But there was someone

786
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:27,550
being sued or suing Fox News. Because Fox News apparently said this person did such a thing or

787
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:33,190
was bad or whatever. And they repeated it several times. And the person, I guess, lodged a suit

788
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:38,610
against this media company. And the judge ruled in the favor of the media company saying that

789
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:44,190
because they're a media company, it's all entertainment. So you don't have a case against

790
01:17:44,190 --> 01:17:51,610
them. So from that point of view, when you tune into anything that you're tuning into, folks,

791
01:17:51,690 --> 01:17:55,470
and this is a general broad brush. I mean, there's some good things on the internet, like,

792
01:17:55,550 --> 01:18:00,010
you know, I have several conversion websites, like I want to go to Fahrenheit to Celsius, let's say,

793
01:18:00,010 --> 01:18:05,950
you know, where I want to look at water vapor or like seismic reports, or, you know, maybe a

794
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:10,590
periodic table of elements. Yeah, there's some decent things you can do instant telephony and

795
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:19,450
internet, you can do emails, you know, but your articles in your media. It's resonating, by the

796
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:24,890
way. So yeah, so what the reason we get together? Yeah, we might sound a little arrogant, a little

797
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:29,650
haughty to say this. But when you come to Uncommon Sense, you're going to get two hours. Troy,

798
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:32,030
you're going to get two hours. And we try to sweep the floor clean of all that other crap

799
01:18:33,710 --> 01:18:38,570
that is available. And hopefully, we're delivering that to the four or five listeners,

800
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:43,270
and whoever else who might randomly come across and get really upset on hearing what they're

801
01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:47,270
hearing because they don't resonate. And yes, by the way, if you listen to us, and you think

802
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:55,950
that we know everything, well, guess what? If you heard it, you do too. So it's kind of like the old

803
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:07,270
radio and heavy artillery have in common. Oh, once you hear it, it's too late. That's right.

804
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:14,310
So, you know, you're going to come across many things that you like, but it's just remember,

805
01:19:14,410 --> 01:19:18,190
you're being entertained, and you're going to get whipped up into a frenzy whipped up into a

806
01:19:18,190 --> 01:19:26,290
lather. And you're just going to walk away saying, you know, I very often see on various chats all

807
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:30,990
over the internet, I hear a lot of the stuff that's being discussed. And the people put in

808
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:37,390
great show after that. And I'm like, really, I'd hate to hear what a crappy show sounds like.

809
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:48,410
But anyway, so this is I mean, two hours, I think is enough a week. If we could get just a few

810
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:53,930
people to hear it, even though it might be too late for most if they do. Yeah, folks, just look

811
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:58,290
around you and look at trying to figure out what things are based on. And by the way, speaking of

812
01:19:58,290 --> 01:20:04,710
what things are based on, you've got to know how many times we discussed time, right? There's many

813
01:20:04,710 --> 01:20:10,390
ways to discuss the same thing. It's just series of events. And what we call time is just nothing

814
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:15,310
more than the recordation of those events, past, present and future. The present is very hard,

815
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:20,510
by the way, to discern. Because you can, you know, the moment is very difficult to grasp.

816
01:20:20,510 --> 01:20:24,670
That's why a lot of this sets, correct me on this. Is it solipsism?

817
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:34,390
Solipsism, I don't have the etymology pulled up. But the concept is viewing oneself as the

818
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:40,370
universe, essentially, like you are viewing the entire ever all of existence, only through how

819
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:49,210
it affects you directly, I think. It's like the concept of is this all a dream? Versus is this

820
01:20:49,210 --> 01:20:56,310
all my dream? Like my dream would be solipsism. That's where the people that come in that say,

821
01:20:56,430 --> 01:21:00,730
well, it doesn't really matter. It doesn't really exist. That's your opinion. Or I don't agree with

822
01:21:00,730 --> 01:21:06,470
that. This is not the type of place that you will get that kind of stuff. We speak about things that

823
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:11,430
will direct the mind hopefully to do a little bit of study and study as a noun and a verb. By the

824
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:16,510
way, I was looking at that because I tend to look at that. And by the way, people hate studying,

825
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:21,130
meaning looking at what things should be, or what they're based on or validating things.

826
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:26,310
And they hate knowledge and they hate the truth. And why do I say that is because I take really

827
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:32,770
good notes when I go into conversations with people. And I find in person that they either

828
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:38,930
gloss over or have the you know, beyond the the initially when you start discussing what things

829
01:21:38,930 --> 01:21:45,490
are based on, they have the deer in the headlights expression look. But if you continue, then they

830
01:21:45,490 --> 01:21:50,950
have the expression of a baby seal right before it gets clubbed look. You know, like now I'm lost.

831
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:56,610
And what are you doing? And why are you doing it? But I don't know what you're doing kind of look.

832
01:21:57,010 --> 01:22:02,190
So there is a point in history, by the way, because by the way, how many times have we

833
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:06,930
mentioned that there is another intangible society, intangible meaning, physically many

834
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:13,470
levels known as the gods, right? And they have a hierarchy. And that aspect and by the way,

835
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:18,170
folks, when we talk about the gods, and we're using that term colloquially, what so we can

836
01:22:18,170 --> 01:22:22,830
communicate, we're not discussing any of the ridiculous religions on the planet at the moment.

837
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:28,350
And ridiculous meaning that accurately, because fortunately, the gods of ridicule,

838
01:22:28,670 --> 01:22:34,490
yes, worthy of ridicule, absolutely. But they're just accommodating the people, right? Just like

839
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:39,210
when you see a big service station or a gas station in the middle of the desert. It's because there's

840
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:44,670
a million cars passing by. They're accommodating them. If those that highway is closed, that

841
01:22:44,670 --> 01:22:49,150
station has to go because you know, coyotes and scorpions don't aren't going to serve it and go to

842
01:22:49,150 --> 01:22:56,930
that business very much. But anyway, when we discuss this, we're not discussing it in any of

843
01:22:56,930 --> 01:23:01,170
the context that most people are familiar with. We're not talking about Santa Claus and all the

844
01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:06,430
other ridiculous stuff that people worship. Yes, you do worship it, even though you're kind of

845
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:10,350
schizophrenic and psychopathic to say, we all know it doesn't exist, but we do it anyway. Well,

846
01:23:10,370 --> 01:23:16,970
that is the mark of a true sick person. Brief aside, what is worship? That's a that's a word

847
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:21,450
that is commonly used, and I would say rarely understood or comprehended. Let's look it up.

848
01:23:21,530 --> 01:23:27,050
Let's bring it up. Isn't it mean to give something to or perhaps so let's let's look, look at it,

849
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:33,530
would bring it up. Admittedly nation, I'm gonna have to bring it up. Yes, let's see.

850
01:23:34,330 --> 01:23:42,970
I have, you know, held a conceptual idea of what it is, but the history of the word itself comes.

851
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:51,830
The verb comes from the noun Old English water keep condition of being worthy, dignity, glory,

852
01:23:51,970 --> 01:23:59,850
distinction, honor, renown from we are worthy. Skip a reverse supernatural reverence paid to a

853
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:06,130
supernatural divine being. It's first recorded in the 13th century. That's interesting.

854
01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:13,310
Some years ago, check this out. In most cases, the divine beings that people are quote unquote

855
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:16,850
worshiping, if you push them into a corner, they will tell you it doesn't exist anyway.

856
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:23,770
You ever noticed that? In most cases, not all cases. Like I know in the Western society,

857
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:27,310
during the darkest time of the year, they worship the Santa Claus.

858
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:32,030
Cats. Well, Greg, that sounds ridiculous. We don't worship. Oh, really? But I'm not looking

859
01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:38,650
at what you're saying. I'm looking at what you're doing. Right. Actions speak loud. Yes. Yes. Which

860
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:42,470
is really Moloch, the revival of the human sacrifice. You know, that's why you put the

861
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:47,530
child on the red, red hot creature, you know, make a wish of prosperity. Ask him what he wants.

862
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:53,610
Yeah, pretty sick bunch of people. Psychopaths. Can anyone say that? Psycho meaning it's all done.

863
01:24:53,610 --> 01:25:02,170
It's all done in parody now, like it's not, you know, the I'm yeah, it's all done. It's all done

864
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:09,230
in parody. And it's the parody is not acknowledging of the history. It has to. It's something that has

865
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:14,710
to be kind of dug into to actually find where these customs and these traditions come from

866
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:22,610
and what they're actually saying. I don't necessarily recommend the idea of doing it.

867
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:29,430
It's been. You won't. It's not one of those things that will make any friends. No, no,

868
01:25:29,510 --> 01:25:34,670
you won't make friends. Yes, that's why. That's why I recommend getting a furry little friend.

869
01:25:35,950 --> 01:25:42,970
Social upheaval at home and in public. Yes. Yes. That's the other thing at home. See,

870
01:25:43,050 --> 01:25:46,970
the thing is, when people come together, I think we've discussed what love is to a certain degree.

871
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:51,270
And folks, you don't know how to love. You don't even know what it means. You don't know what it

872
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:56,350
is. You have to learn how to love, by the way. And yes, a lot of people do take offense to that.

873
01:25:56,510 --> 01:26:00,210
And by the way, could it be that if someone is offended, they're not seeking the truth?

874
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:06,270
The truth of the matter is, you're a subject to external input. And what you think love and hate

875
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:11,750
is, is what you've been told. You should think it is. English is a horrible language for discussing

876
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:17,270
such things as well. Oh, yes. The limitations. And unfortunately, it's the only one I speak

877
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:24,570
with fluently enough to think in. So it's yes. So the thing is, you know, I speak to younger

878
01:26:24,570 --> 01:26:28,650
people, they mean relationship. And I'm like, what, what do I do? What's this about? What about

879
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:33,950
that? I was like, learn to love each other. You have to learn to love. Because if you look at the

880
01:26:34,910 --> 01:26:40,670
would you say malevolent entities, see things that are malevolent and fraudulent and untrue,

881
01:26:41,590 --> 01:26:47,070
and harmful, potentially always present themselves as being the real deal or not. So

882
01:26:47,850 --> 01:26:53,730
I like very rarely can someone take a crayon and a dinner napkin, and write 100 on it and say it's

883
01:26:53,730 --> 01:26:59,090
a banknote and go to spend it. They have to go through great lengths to mimic what you see.

884
01:26:59,490 --> 01:27:04,910
So what's going on is regarding love, by the way, and we won't make friends.

885
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:10,010
Yeah, you can have to learn how to love. I've kind of discussed that a little bit in parents.

886
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:14,750
You've got to have to learn how to love children. And this is what I tell, by the way, the biggest

887
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:20,030
mistake an inventor, let's say, quote, unquote, inventor, and a parent can make is to fall in

888
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:24,650
love with their invention or their children. I've seen inventors fall in love with the invention,

889
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:29,690
and then they can no longer objectify it. And I've seen parents fall in love with children,

890
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:34,810
and they can no longer objectify what's going on. You know, and as a matter of fact, they can fall

891
01:27:34,810 --> 01:27:39,050
in love with children to the point where they favor one over the other. You might have heard of that.

892
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:45,250
They referred, I think that the reason they call it falling is because it is disorienting.

893
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:45,990
Yes.

894
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:50,530
For anyone who has ever experienced it, it feels like you were,

895
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:52,810
like the ground has been removed from under you.

896
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:54,510
Yes, yes, exactly.

897
01:27:56,310 --> 01:27:57,630
It's very strange.

898
01:27:58,910 --> 01:28:04,450
Yes, and yeah. And when you understand the displacement of things, how things change,

899
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:08,530
we're discussing things about how change is required. It kind of keeps life going.

900
01:28:10,210 --> 01:28:15,570
You know, don't be rigid. But by the way, we just wanted to mention, when we discuss these things

901
01:28:15,570 --> 01:28:19,690
and what they're based on, and the parodies going back to the worship of this Moloch creature,

902
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:28,890
Moloch, M-O-L-E-C-H, I believe, you're not going to make friends, familial or ordinary people.

903
01:28:29,310 --> 01:28:33,890
So look for things where you might get an unconditional attention, what you consider love,

904
01:28:33,890 --> 01:28:37,410
feeling good, which is a little furry friend, maybe a cat or a dog.

905
01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:43,350
They tend to have short attention spans. They tend to develop vocabularies. Most,

906
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:49,970
for example, dogs or cats can develop 50 to 100 word vocabulary and recognition, right?

907
01:28:51,210 --> 01:28:56,170
Come, sit, food, eat, no, yes, bark, don't bark, right? These types of things.

908
01:28:56,410 --> 01:29:02,190
So if you're going to pursue some of the things that are discussed on Uncommon Sense,

909
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:07,510
I recommend getting a short attention span furry creature in your presence.

910
01:29:08,370 --> 01:29:11,650
Absolutely. That's solid advice right there.

911
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:14,810
That's right. We do give advice as well. So yes.

912
01:29:14,970 --> 01:29:23,870
I would say that you'll find some people will be tolerant, but it's discordant to a lot of

913
01:29:26,270 --> 01:29:27,770
people, places.

914
01:29:28,210 --> 01:29:32,210
Yeah. And you don't want to press the issue, by the way, any topic matter. Yes.

915
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:37,910
And any topic matter, any subject you can look into and find out what it was based on the history

916
01:29:37,910 --> 01:29:45,670
of the thing and how do you validate it. If you run into your average surface-dwelling earth

917
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:51,090
inhabitant and start discussing it, they might get a little disoriented or discordant, right?

918
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:55,550
But if you keep pushing the issue, you can actually, if you can read one's body language

919
01:29:55,550 --> 01:30:01,210
and facial expressions, you're going to have to stop or get away from them because there are

920
01:30:01,210 --> 01:30:05,010
precursors that you could recognize where they actually want to bring physical harm to you for

921
01:30:05,010 --> 01:30:12,570
continuing on such a discussion, by the way. And I have seen this in person, that if you,

922
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:16,830
many people want to engage in debates or discussions regarding certain things.

923
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:21,110
And if you stick to what thing, the history of the thing or what it's based on and how it can

924
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:27,970
be validated, if you pursue it, they do want to bring physical harm to you, right? And this is,

925
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:33,330
you know, could be familial or friend or just ordinary occurrences, you know, in public or

926
01:30:33,330 --> 01:30:37,710
whatever. So you have to be very, very careful. You got to understand, we also say the earth is

927
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:46,250
a very dangerous place. It's a very violent place. And the level of order that people are enjoying

928
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:53,750
is just that. There is a level of order, so you can have enjoyment, you see, you know, and some

929
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:58,230
peace. But I want to go back to this kind of brought up all the gods, the gods don't act in

930
01:30:58,230 --> 01:31:02,490
futility. And what you will be getting, and this is a little bit of the current events, right,

931
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:06,910
we brought up some kind of European Union thing going on, maybe with England and such.

932
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:12,830
You're going to get a perfect society in the next decade or sort of around that time.

933
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:18,070
Because later on, this way, you'll be without excuse, the last thing the gods want to hear

934
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:24,590
is a whining human. We never had a chance to have a perfect society or world peace and

935
01:31:25,910 --> 01:31:29,790
knowledge, freedom, prosperity. So you'll get that for a short time.

936
01:31:30,850 --> 01:31:34,250
Yep. And you're gonna have to watch the seasonal aspects of it as well.

937
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:39,610
Things are planted in the spring, they grow in the summer, and they are torn down in the fall.

938
01:31:40,530 --> 01:31:45,790
So, you know, right now for the certain part of the world, geographically, it's summertime.

939
01:31:46,330 --> 01:31:49,670
So when you look at the quote-unquote current events, you will find that

940
01:31:50,170 --> 01:31:54,830
it's a growing time. The events that are put in front of you are things that are being,

941
01:31:55,090 --> 01:32:00,890
agendas that are growing, expanded on. And soon after this season will be the fall,

942
01:32:00,990 --> 01:32:06,450
will be a tearing down time period. And by the way, folks, regarding things that

943
01:32:06,450 --> 01:32:13,870
are discussed, the real stuff is always done in quiet. Where the noise is, typically,

944
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:18,170
is a distraction. So the stuff that's being brought to you and discussed both

945
01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:23,130
mainstream and alternative, that's just echoing the noise, the distraction.

946
01:32:24,170 --> 01:32:29,210
So when you start to look at how things are, what things are based on and referencing things,

947
01:32:29,270 --> 01:32:32,770
you will see that the truth is still very, very, very quiet.

948
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:37,410
Like an example would be kind of like harping on the financial commentary.

949
01:32:38,230 --> 01:32:43,290
Whenever you hear someone discussing what's called financial or economic or money,

950
01:32:44,110 --> 01:32:49,590
keep in mind that it is a credit-based economy. So look up what credit-based economy means,

951
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:54,990
and then contrast that to the entertainment that you're being, that's being thrust upon the ears

952
01:32:55,570 --> 01:33:00,150
or visual. And you're going to have to laugh, and you're going to have to realize that you

953
01:33:00,150 --> 01:33:06,310
are being entertained because it's bogus crap, all your financial commentary.

954
01:33:06,830 --> 01:33:10,590
Now, when you listen to the quote-unquote medical community regarding health

955
01:33:11,290 --> 01:33:18,350
on your whatever media you might so choose, you ever notice it's all chemical-based, typically.

956
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:22,350
I shouldn't all, but yeah. And how many times they discuss that you should

957
01:33:22,350 --> 01:33:28,390
pretty much eat seasonally or the food hasn't, the quality of the food has an effect

958
01:33:28,390 --> 01:33:34,050
on the body based on the environment, seasonally very, almost none, almost never.

959
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:40,330
How many times are you told in discussions of health and from the medical society,

960
01:33:40,430 --> 01:33:44,530
mainstream alternative, that the body absorbs things, this ridiculous thing

961
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:49,110
could be said about the body, like you're a filter bag walking around and

962
01:33:49,110 --> 01:33:54,010
hopefully you're not leaking everywhere, like things are leaking into the body,

963
01:33:55,010 --> 01:34:01,330
ridiculous stuff. So yes, it is entertainment. You're being entertained. And I hope you're

964
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:07,230
being entertained. But I call it just being dummy loaded. A lot of people go and I see

965
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:12,290
what they call the pagan weekend or the Pope's work schedule. There's lines around movie theaters.

966
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:17,510
It's like, what are you doing? You're just sitting in a chair, paying about 20 bucks these days,

967
01:34:17,630 --> 01:34:23,550
15 bucks, 10 bucks to sit there and be dummy loaded for two hours visually. Yes, it's dark.

968
01:34:23,550 --> 01:34:28,530
And there's pretty pictures on the screen. I found out this is what people like. They like

969
01:34:28,530 --> 01:34:35,870
being entertained. They like tuning in. Yeah. You ever hear that? Tune in, right? To what?

970
01:34:37,190 --> 01:34:42,790
If you have a group, you've heard the reference to someone changing their tune, right?

971
01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:44,510
Yes, yes, exactly.

972
01:34:45,230 --> 01:34:51,470
Changing the narrative. There is a question here, speaking of entertainment for nothing else,

973
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:57,350
in referencing something that we spoke of last week. And that is,

974
01:34:58,470 --> 01:35:03,850
I have a question for the host. They have the time. In the last week's show, you talked about

975
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:10,130
the realm of the gods. My question is, do shamans go to the realm of the gods or are they simply

976
01:35:10,130 --> 01:35:15,950
hallucinating due to the fact they use psychoactive plants or different methods to put them into a

977
01:35:15,950 --> 01:35:22,610
trance? Thank you. So there's a question. What of shamans, Greek?

978
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:33,580
Interesting. That's a real big one. Let's look at the quality of it. Use and contrast the

979
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:40,240
economic commentators. They go on there talking about financial collapse or this or that or the

980
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:47,040
other. Do they ever bring up it's a credit-based economy? Never. Almost never. On the other hand,

981
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:55,400
when you look at these shamans, do they actually introduce what they're doing from a more than

982
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:59,760
relativistic point of view, but from a referential point of view that they are dealing with,

983
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:04,560
let's say, non-cosmic forces or divine forces and there's a hierarchy. Do they ever talk about

984
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:09,380
the hierarchy? Do they ever talk about the quality of what they're doing? Very rarely.

985
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:16,380
You ever notice that? Yeah, most of what's described that I have come into, that I've

986
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:26,800
heard or read the description of, tends toward the idea of the lower imps and whatnot, just kind

987
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:35,700
of messing with people. I've heard the stories of people that have had life-changing experiences and

988
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:42,200
stuff like that at the direction of such people, but I have no experience with it other than the

989
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:48,320
secondhand. And like I said, I can only comment on what is reported as it's not something that I have.

990
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:53,740
Well, I've met people who have been in what's called an automobile accident and had the head

991
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:59,220
go through a windshield and told me that was a life-changing experience as well. Certainly.

992
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:07,600
Typically, let's go back to a lot of the discussion. If people are resonating with

993
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:13,560
the prank and the lie, if the shaman comes up with something that's true or beneficial,

994
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:21,370
will it resonate? The answer is no. It will be dissonant. So they're going to have to, again,

995
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:25,930
accommodate. Now, I'm not saying that all the shamans are like that, but yeah, as a general

996
01:37:25,930 --> 01:37:30,350
rule of thumb, the ones that I've encountered that are self-proclaimed shaman or whatever,

997
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:34,970
yeah, they are dealing with things that they don't even know about. Just like your economic

998
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:40,030
commentators or the people in the legal society or people in the medical side,

999
01:37:40,050 --> 01:37:46,570
they don't know what they're doing. There's many gods, right? Many, many gods.

1000
01:37:47,630 --> 01:37:53,990
Yes. The thing is here, it's the quality of the issue. There's very little discussion regarding

1001
01:37:53,990 --> 01:37:59,710
quality these days. When I say these days, I mean, why should there be? Because we have all this

1002
01:37:59,710 --> 01:38:09,210
technology, right? We're so technologically advanced. No, I hold that in very low regard

1003
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:17,990
because they don't really give you anything that is, would you say, fundamental? Perhaps

1004
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:23,430
if you run into these quote-unquote shamans, it's taken for granted that it's something good,

1005
01:38:23,690 --> 01:38:27,690
let's say. How many times have you ever heard that in conversation? I'm a shaman,

1006
01:38:27,690 --> 01:38:39,010
or I went to a shaman, oh, that's good. Really? What? So, no, personally, I hold that very low

1007
01:38:39,010 --> 01:38:46,810
regard. I don't even regard it as much. But on the other hand, yeah, do they know what they're

1008
01:38:46,810 --> 01:38:52,850
doing? Probably not. In most cases, no. Are they accommodating the audience? Absolutely.

1009
01:38:56,490 --> 01:39:02,590
Do they have, most of these people, quote-unquote shamans and gurus, do they have a need for food,

1010
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:07,610
clothing, and shelter? And do they wonder how they're going to get the means to provide food,

1011
01:39:07,690 --> 01:39:12,910
clothing, and shelter? Yes. Do they charge you what they call money for it, usually? Yes.

1012
01:39:13,110 --> 01:39:18,230
Yeah, some of them do it for free or whatever, but so what? You've got to look at the whole

1013
01:39:18,230 --> 01:39:23,910
picture here. By the way, if anyone is interacting with a shaman, these people are

1014
01:39:23,910 --> 01:39:30,630
so spiritual, oh, man. Ask them to define soul and spirit. Watch their eyes roll in their head

1015
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:44,480
like a Vegas slot machine, right? Typically. Yeah, don't, off the record, everybody cover

1016
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:53,350
their ears. Don't poke fun at stupid people. Yeah, leave them alone. But yeah, I would say

1017
01:39:53,350 --> 01:40:00,710
it's a very, very difficult aspect to engage in. But what they're doing is they're engaging in the

1018
01:40:00,710 --> 01:40:05,750
realm of fiction. Here, I'll leave you, maybe we have a few minutes left or maybe three-quarters

1019
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:10,590
of the way through. There is a fictional realm that is there for entertainment. There's a

1020
01:40:10,590 --> 01:40:14,090
fictional realm that's there for pranking. There's a fictional realm that's there for,

1021
01:40:14,470 --> 01:40:18,290
that could create general inquiry. There's a fictional realm, again, for entertainment, right?

1022
01:40:19,710 --> 01:40:28,790
What's going on very much right now with the discussion and the conversation is using words,

1023
01:40:28,990 --> 01:40:35,530
using time, and just concepts, concepts and ideas and things, but nothing much gets done

1024
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:40,630
because you can see, don't listen to what's being said, look at what's being done. And you can see

1025
01:40:40,630 --> 01:40:46,510
there's a lot of stability in it. But I wanted to bring up, there's a campfire scene, right?

1026
01:40:46,510 --> 01:40:52,550
And there's a, they're out in the desert, people, some people are called cowboys and the other ones

1027
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:57,230
are called Indians, and they're fighting each other. And it's nighttime, and they're sitting

1028
01:40:57,230 --> 01:41:03,310
around the campfire. And finally, they said, let's take a break from fighting. And the cowboy tells

1029
01:41:03,310 --> 01:41:06,590
the Indian, he says, Well, you know, I'm getting tired of fighting you guys, I'm going to get a

1030
01:41:06,590 --> 01:41:11,370
battleship and come out here and blow all you guys up with the battleship. They're sitting out there

1031
01:41:11,370 --> 01:41:15,930
in the desert, right? Campfire. Anyway, then the Indian says, Oh, really? You're going to do that

1032
01:41:15,930 --> 01:41:22,770
with a battleship? Well, I'm going to get a submarine and sink the battleship. Cowboy looks at

1033
01:41:22,770 --> 01:41:25,910
him, he says, Well, where the hell are you going to get a submarine out here in the desert? And he

1034
01:41:25,910 --> 01:41:32,110
says, Well, the same place you got your battleship. Right? So this is basically the nature of most

1035
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:37,670
conversation that is going on right now. What will happen is a topic is brought up. And it's

1036
01:41:37,670 --> 01:41:45,050
unfounded, typically, and it's based on nothing, of course. And the discussion begins. And usually

1037
01:41:45,050 --> 01:41:50,110
the host or the guest or whoever is starting the discussion is pausing and searching to see what

1038
01:41:50,110 --> 01:41:54,250
kind of agreement they can get from their audience. And then the audience gives a little bit of

1039
01:41:54,250 --> 01:42:00,850
feedback and from all the nonsense, and then the discussion continues. And that's what's called a

1040
01:42:00,850 --> 01:42:09,910
great show. Anyway. Or a great conversation, or a great movie, or a great whatever. So you're being

1041
01:42:09,910 --> 01:42:15,990
baited into this very stable, you're in a very stable condition, by the way, on what's going on,

1042
01:42:16,030 --> 01:42:21,670
if you understand what was written about this time from the past, you will see that it's very stable.

1043
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:30,380
Everything is the way it should be. So did we mention, did we ever mention set that there's a

1044
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:41,260
coming Middle East Union? I seem to recall that. Yes. Yes. Right. And what does that mean? By the

1045
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:44,820
By the way, oh, yeah, it's just words, man. It's just it's your opinion. It's your idea. Well, you

1046
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:52,560
know, when you organize a most powerful, let's say power base, culturally, economically, judicially,

1047
01:42:54,360 --> 01:43:00,300
religiously, that the world has ever seen in throughout known history, in the near future,

1048
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:04,460
there's a lot of things that are going to be changing. But you know, it's gonna seem very

1049
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:09,620
natural when it comes across, by the way. So and the reason bringing this up is perhaps if you look

1050
01:43:09,620 --> 01:43:13,620
at the quote, unquote, date of this show, or whatever, and the current events, supposedly,

1051
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:21,680
what they call England is no longer part of the European Union. So yeah, well, why? Well, if you

1052
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:26,800
look at events, and you comprehend fully, that the entire Western world and Asian world, you know,

1053
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:33,360
meaning East Asian, is going to play second fiddle, or be second in importance to the coming

1054
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:41,060
Middle East Union, things start to make sense. And there's not many surprises. So consider that,

1055
01:43:41,220 --> 01:43:46,080
folks. You know, I had gotten maybe one message in three years that someone once said, well, you

1056
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:50,840
know, it's really exciting to know that there's going to be a Middle East Union, I could see it

1057
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:57,260
now. And I'm kind of looking forward to its coming, even though it's going to be end up very

1058
01:43:57,260 --> 01:44:03,440
horrifically, for most, I should say, even though while it's being while it ends up horrifically,

1059
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:10,880
most people will see it still as being good. Sounds kind of complicated. But yeah, there are

1060
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:14,860
very few that want to acknowledge these things. And you must know the past and you must know the

1061
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:23,780
future. And you will, if you listen, and do a little bit of research. And there's different

1062
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:28,840
types of pasts and different types of futures, meaning how at what level of veracity do you want

1063
01:44:28,840 --> 01:44:32,820
to go into these things? Again, we just stated, not recommended, because you will not make any

1064
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:41,010
friends. People don't want to hear this. They want to be entertained. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. So the

1065
01:44:41,010 --> 01:44:46,990
thing is, by the way, folks, learn to provide, learn to be happy, provide meaning food, clothing,

1066
01:44:47,090 --> 01:44:52,710
shelter, you know, be comfortable. Have a you have a body, you're animated through the body, the

1067
01:44:52,710 --> 01:44:58,370
spirit and the is animated through the soul and the body. So you want that to be in fairly good

1068
01:44:58,370 --> 01:45:04,510
shape and not putting discomfort on you. You want to be safe, the earth is a very violent place.

1069
01:45:06,170 --> 01:45:12,550
You want to be able to recognize that your typical surface dwelling earth inhabitant is not doing

1070
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:18,290
very well. And you want to provide help when possible, but set yourself apart from them

1071
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:24,790
as much as possible as well. Because they are very full potential of great danger.

1072
01:45:25,430 --> 01:45:31,550
So and well, coming in that danger comes through pranking, by the way, because if you look at the

1073
01:45:31,550 --> 01:45:39,690
reason why people do things, they really is no reason at all. So bring comfort, be set apart,

1074
01:45:39,930 --> 01:45:45,690
consider there are things that there's more than meat that meets the eye. Consider that

1075
01:45:47,450 --> 01:45:52,630
everything was not created 10 years ago or 100 years ago, there was a little bit more going on

1076
01:45:52,630 --> 01:46:02,930
back then. Consider that there's things to learn. Good food, good drink, good company,

1077
01:46:03,110 --> 01:46:12,790
good conversation. I recommend all of those things. Yeah, things in moderation. Yeah, good sonic

1078
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:17,410
experiences, good visual experiences. Now we're not going to say that uncommon sense is a good

1079
01:46:17,410 --> 01:46:23,210
sonic experience. I mean, it could be good for some and bad for others. Fortunately, not many

1080
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:27,170
people are listening. And unfortunately, not many people are listening either way.

1081
01:46:28,190 --> 01:46:35,370
I just recalled a question that one of the emails that we received that uncommon sense

1082
01:46:37,730 --> 01:46:43,890
was asking about dreams. And I know we don't have much time left in the broadcast, but

1083
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:53,630
someone was asking specifically what they think that they're being shown things by a couple of

1084
01:46:53,630 --> 01:46:58,490
different entities in their dreams and just curious as to what they think they are. They're actually

1085
01:46:58,490 --> 01:47:03,290
bidding. We pull it up right this second. Well, that's five weapons in the head that basically

1086
01:47:03,290 --> 01:47:07,910
are they aware getting from an external source that's typically messing with you?

1087
01:47:09,130 --> 01:47:12,590
Are they? I mean, that's I mean, I'm kind of answering with a question,

1088
01:47:12,590 --> 01:47:18,250
if you know what I mean? Yeah. Typically, when you find out what dreams are, you stop dreaming,

1089
01:47:18,430 --> 01:47:25,010
folks. Yes, you do. A lot of the in paganism, by the way, which just means ignorant.

1090
01:47:26,270 --> 01:47:31,690
They stress dreams a lot because see, they don't the typical pagan mindset does not

1091
01:47:32,970 --> 01:47:39,170
considered quality discernment. So discern quality, folks, and I guess that's it.

1092
01:47:39,170 --> 01:47:46,130
Uh, for this week. Thank you all for listening. Thank you, Seth. Thank you, AFR. All those in

1093
01:47:46,130 --> 01:47:53,230
the chat. Uncommon radio.com. American freedom radio.com. Thanks for being here and listening.

1094
01:47:53,870 --> 01:47:54,830
Yes. Thanks again, folks.
