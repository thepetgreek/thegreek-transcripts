00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
Greetings, everyone. You're listening to American Freedom Radio.

2
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:08,090
And fortunately or unfortunately for you, you have tuned in to Uncommon Sense.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,390
And greetings again, everyone. This is the Greek.

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:16,830
And we might be joined with Seth probably momentarily or later or not at all today.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:20,330
So, again, everyone, if you've made the effort to be here,

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,130
maybe some of you can't help it being on this planet.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,370
Well, we're here, and it's Uncommon Sense.

8
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:31,810
By the way, you can contact us at www.uncommonradio.com.

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,450
And I suggest putting in the www.uncommonradio.com

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,970
because Uncommon Radio in a general search does show a lot of other results.

11
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,330
So you're on American Freedom Radio,

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,370
and American Freedom Radio would appreciate for you guys to do the right thing.

13
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,230
You know what that is.

14
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,410
There's a lot of stuff going on about people needing donations.

15
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,570
And, yes, they are needed here as well, here meaning American Freedom Radio,

16
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:59,450
which I'm going to play something about being here in a little bit.

17
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,550
But, yes, so do the right thing.

18
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:06,750
Go to the homepage and help out the crew and the entire venue that is providing you Uncommon Sense.

19
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:12,030
It's the only two hours every week that you will get that I assure you is dummy load free.

20
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,210
Now, always kind of bring up the concept of a dummy load.

21
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,310
It's really an engineering term.

22
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,290
It's a synthetic load that's put on a system before it's put in the field to see if it will work in the field,

23
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,570
what kind of a load it can take.

24
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,130
For common vernacular, let's say a dummy load would be a hamster wheel,

25
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,610
like spinning your wheels and going nowhere.

26
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,910
And that's why, quote-unquote, mainstream and alternative radio,

27
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,530
when you push any of them to the corner, it is considered to be entertainment.

28
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,890
Now, just like if you run into someone who is into being physically fit,

29
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,510
they will say, I ran five miles today.

30
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,470
I said, well, where did you go?

31
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,910
He says, well, I didn't really go anywhere.

32
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,990
I ran it on a treadmill.

33
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,650
That treadmill represents a dummy load.

34
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,850
And the reason I bring up the dummy load on occasion is because as people,

35
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,470
let's say semi-cognizant beings, you have a desire to learn.

36
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,130
And any time there's a desire,

37
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,810
there's a certain amount of energy that's put behind it to accomplish that or seek it out or perform it.

38
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:14,870
And typically, people like to learn things.

39
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:20,690
Now, the quality of what they want and what they're aware of is put aside for a moment.

40
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:27,990
But people like to dedicate time to hear, like, for example, that television show they call the news

41
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,070
or the radio show they call the news, things like that.

42
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:36,950
They like to at least satisfy the feeling of being informed.

43
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:44,350
And in order to, let's say, satisfy a feeling, perform on a feeling or a desire,

44
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,110
one has to dedicate a certain amount of energy to it.

45
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,150
And people use this energy to seek out.

46
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:55,190
Various venues of information, talk, visual, whatever, what have you, whatever medium.

47
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,770
It used to be mostly in pulp, meaning paper.

48
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:03,010
And now it tends to be either terrestrial broadcasting or Internet broadcasting.

49
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,610
And I assure you, it's all dummy loading.

50
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,050
Why?

51
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:13,090
Well, if you look at what's called current events, the way that, let's say, the quote-unquote stories,

52
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:21,630
the facts, or let's just say some truth of the matter is presented, lacks substance, lacks quality, lacks depth.

53
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,910
You might say, well, you know, we know that.

54
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,130
Yeah, there's corporate media.

55
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:25,890
They're controlled.

56
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,690
Yeah, the government's whatever, and this is whatever.

57
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,850
But, you know, ultimately it boils down to one thing.

58
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,490
You have to accommodate the patron.

59
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,030
You have to accommodate the audience.

60
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,050
And you have to accommodate who you are presenting the goods to.

61
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,610
And I always give the metaphor, you know, a couple of guys I ran into got a few million

62
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,910
and they want to open this business.

63
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:46,670
I said, where is it?

64
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,710
They said, in the middle of the desert.

65
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,690
And I'm like, you've got to be kidding.

66
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,230
Yeah, but, you know, Interstate 10 is right there,

67
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,850
and there's almost a million cars passing every day on a weekday.

68
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,690
I said, oh, that's a really good business.

69
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,270
So you're there to accommodate the past survivors, you know.

70
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,850
Well, what happens if that highway closes?

71
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,350
No one to accommodate.

72
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:04,550
So, you know, there's an effort that's always being made to accommodate.

73
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:10,570
That scorpions and coyotes don't do well purchasing things at a convenience store in the middle of,

74
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,570
let's say, the Mojave Desert or so, or adjacent to it.

75
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,950
So on many levels, you're being accommodated on many levels.

76
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:26,070
And I would say that pretty much all levels, if you look at what's put out there.

77
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:33,690
Now, there's an effort that's always being made to accommodate the patrons and the clients.

78
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:41,170
So when you hear about people complaining or, let's say, making comments on this is, well,

79
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,030
mainstream media everybody knows is controlled or whatever.

80
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:49,290
Well, if you actually study their purpose, they're doing it for themselves, first of all.

81
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,630
It's a financial venture.

82
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,590
And second of all, they're doing it to accommodate a certain mindset.

83
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:59,630
If you look at alternative media, which pretty much strictly piggybacks on the mainstream media,

84
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:05,330
I wouldn't quite call them a parasite yet, you know, when an animal feeds off of another.

85
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,750
Because I don't think they're really going after the host as much as a typical parasite.

86
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,750
But they are parasitical in nature, alternative media, by the way.

87
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:20,710
And the reason I'm saying this is because when you listen to Uncommon Sense,

88
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,310
you got to pretty much put everything away and you're in a new place.

89
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,110
By the way, if you're visiting this planet for the first time,

90
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,330
it would behoove you to tune into Uncommon Sense at two hours a week.

91
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,230
We will give you a pretty much objective lowdown of what's going on.

92
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,830
We may not be the only ones being able to objectify what's going on,

93
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,290
but I'll tell you for sure we're the only ones that are speaking out on any form of media

94
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:47,370
that are doing it right now in wholesale, pretty much covering every topic.

95
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,490
So if you like, yes, and if you don't like what I just said, that's really too bad.

96
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,030
It might reflect on your lack of awareness.

97
00:05:53,250 --> 00:06:00,710
But here on the other side, you might want to say that, well, if I'm just visiting this planet,

98
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,070
it's such a simple place and the simpletons that inhabit the surface are so simple

99
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:08,970
that it shouldn't take you more than 15 minutes to figure out what's going on here.

100
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:13,250
So we're kind of giving you an hour and 45 minutes beyond the pale there.

101
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,670
But anyway, Seth, I wonder if you've got your setup going.

102
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,730
And greetings, if you can hear me.

103
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,070
And let's see if we can hear you.

104
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,110
Greetings.

105
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,590
Hello.

106
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:22,150
Shalom.

107
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,310
Thanks for bringing me in.

108
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:29,850
Sorry, I was dealing with some new equipment that I'm working with.

109
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,630
So hopefully everything is sounding as well as it should.

110
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,050
Oh, yeah.

111
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,770
And speaking of new equipment, Seth is looking to, how would you say, forward

112
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,610
or advance the collection of little technical things like microphones, wires, and things like that.

113
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:51,390
So if anyone wants to contribute to Seth, that would be through what's called, well,

114
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,490
demanding for lawful money per Title 12, Section 411.

115
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,170
You've got to throw that disclaimer in there.

116
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:01,470
But through PayPal, perhaps through the e-mail, which would be, what would be the e-mail, Seth,

117
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:04,850
for direct contribution to Mr. Seth Michael, let's say?

118
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,370
Dearredshoes at gmail.com.

119
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:14,550
It's D-E-A-R-R-E-D-S-H-O-E-S at gmail.com.

120
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:17,930
So you spell it like it sounds, all one word, at gmail.com.

121
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:18,830
Dearredshoes.

122
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:19,570
Yep.

123
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:29,630
That comes from a band that I played with for several years that is now semi-defunct, I guess.

124
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,190
Now we're playing a couple of the same players, but different name.

125
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:44,670
And part of the wanting or the desire to acquire some cables and mics and things is I'm working on setting up a home,

126
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,290
like a project studio here at the house.

127
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:56,170
And I have recently been able to, through the kindness of others, been able to acquire a couple of key pieces of equipment.

128
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:05,810
So now it's just some sundry things that I'm needing to acquire to have the ability to record, produce, and mix for ourselves.

129
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,690
For those of you listening out there probably are aware, but if you're not, I play music.

130
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:16,390
That's one of the things that brings me quite a bit of happiness here on this rock.

131
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:28,330
So I'm working on doing that independently as I've met with frustration at having others in their attempt to help.

132
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:40,230
It's an art, and so when you're reliant upon others for a type of art, it's kind of disheartening.

133
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:49,010
So the idea is to be able to do it essentially all on our own and with the ease of accessibility to technology that we have currently.

134
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:53,310
That's something that's actually feasible if you have the equipment to do it.

135
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,290
That was not necessarily the case 20, 30 years ago.

136
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:06,290
And it just became easier and easier in distribution and everything like that for an artist such as a musician.

137
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,850
The Internet is one of those things that has made that relatively easy.

138
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,430
You no longer have to be picked up by a record label to have your music distributed worldwide.

139
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,370
You can do it with a few clicks of the mouse.

140
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,870
I want to touch on that just for a moment from some thoughts and things that I've brought up.

141
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,230
Folks, you are living in a society that's going to be going through radical changes.

142
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,690
And oh yeah, Greek, yeah, yeah, we know that.

143
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,690
But what you don't know is the specifics.

144
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:42,410
And one of the specifics is that this medium known as the Internet, whatever you want to call it, the World Wide Web, whatever, whatever, whatever,

145
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:49,470
will be increasing in its veracity in terms of being inexpensive, accessible, and consistently available.

146
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:50,830
Why?

147
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:53,230
I mean, well, we'll get to the why in a moment.

148
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,290
In other words, think of it this way.

149
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,570
You might have food shortages, housing shortages.

150
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:03,370
You might be pranked by the legal society, the government agencies, the religious society.

151
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,990
We'll continue to prank you into misery.

152
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:17,090
But the ability to get free, we'll say access or access if you don't have it, someone you know does, is going to be increasing.

153
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,630
You may not have water to drink, but you'll have Internet.

154
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,010
Why?

155
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:27,790
Because one of the prerequisites by the end of the next decade is that everyone on the planet, pretty much seemingly everyone,

156
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:32,910
bears witness to certain events that are going to be happening in, let's say, real time.

157
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,930
And the only way you can do that, spread out over the planet like that, is through some device.

158
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:47,410
So this is more than just a secular thing, meaning just technological.

159
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:54,010
Stop touching yourselves and feeling good about how wonderful you are with this technology, like a simpleton.

160
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,570
What you are experiencing is divine intervention.

161
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:03,050
It is imperative that everyone on the planet witness certain events that are going to be happening in the future.

162
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:10,250
So I just wanted to throw that in there because, yes, one of the side notes, perhaps, or side benefits, one might call it,

163
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:17,030
is now you can publish or publish, I guess you could call it, music as well as anything else pretty readily,

164
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:23,290
where before it was limited to a bunch of shysters known as recording studio managers and recording studio companies.

165
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:31,690
So I think that thing that you just mentioned, Seth, about being simpler,

166
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:42,970
many things that are attached to communication are going to be accepted as being for granted, not even thought about.

167
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,050
But I know you don't – well, from our conversations, you are very appreciative.

168
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:54,890
So again, if anyone wants to contribute to the venture, it's dearredshoes at gmail.com, and it's just how you spell it.

169
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,890
So with that said, Seth, I had a couple of thoughts.

170
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,710
Some people gave – well, we got a couple of emails.

171
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,210
Someone – I could just paraphrase.

172
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:17,530
And also we have – I'm reckoning roughly the end of the second week of the fifth month, roughly the 16th day of the fifth month.

173
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:24,030
So – but these people at this part of the world are considering it just to be a holiday weekend,

174
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,450
according to the work schedule that they run by, right?

175
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:33,710
And there were a couple of thoughts, and they said, like, well, you know, when you think of a country,

176
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:42,230
especially when you go west to what's called the Americas, the most objective way to look at what's going on would be –

177
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,070
let's say one of the most objective ways.

178
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:50,130
Imagine a really large store, I mean a very large store, like a commercial venue.

179
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:56,330
And it's open for business, but the customers don't really go home.

180
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:01,870
Once you enter this venue, this store, you kind of like sleep on the floor.

181
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,810
And the next day you're still there.

182
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,010
You're at the store 24-7, let's say.

183
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,230
That's America.

184
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,150
It's not a nation.

185
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,070
It's not a country.

186
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,390
It's a place.

187
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,410
It's a large store.

188
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,710
That's why when people kind of complain about how politicians are operating,

189
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:27,650
you ever notice like in a bar or a store they have entertainment, you know, background music or a television monitor or whatever?

190
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,970
That's what your political system is.

191
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:30,690
It's very simple.

192
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:36,710
And it's also by divine intervention, because here, folks, the more evil the society, the more evil the leadership.

193
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,850
And that conversation ends right there.

194
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,650
It's very simple.

195
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,290
Crappy people, crappy leaders, vice versa.

196
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:55,350
And also there's a little bit of fortunately people know not to bring ridiculous stuff to me or uncommon sense, like, hey, how about them Mets?

197
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,610
How about them Yankees?

198
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:58,710
Right?

199
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,370
How about them Yankees?

200
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:00,670
Yeah.

201
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,550
Hey, how about that Trump?

202
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,470
Hey, you got any political interests?

203
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,750
Yeah, none of that.

204
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,910
We don't get any of that, folks.

205
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,150
But I do get it somewhat in passing, because they know better.

206
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,230
They ask ridiculous questions like that.

207
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,330
Or what did Santa Claus bring you?

208
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:13,650
Right?

209
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:17,270
You know, this is the stuff that this society is all about.

210
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:19,170
They will die for this stuff, by the way.

211
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,970
This is how ridiculous they are.

212
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,550
But I assure you, folks, if you have what's called an election.

213
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:37,170
Now, if you think you're going to vote in an election, I would recommend taking some really strong psychotropic pharmaceuticals, because the mind is obviously not working at all.

214
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,350
And you might be in danger to yourself and others.

215
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:41,530
Voters vote.

216
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,470
Electors elect.

217
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:49,690
So if you're going to go vote at an election, you've got some serious mental problems, and you're going to have to review things.

218
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:55,930
But then we just wipe the floor with 350 million people.

219
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:01,530
But anyway, from that respect, your next leader is going to be worse than the one you have now.

220
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,310
That's for sure.

221
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,490
Who it is, it doesn't matter.

222
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,190
What they say and who they are doesn't matter.

223
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:06,890
It's what they do.

224
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,370
And that's an assurance.

225
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,570
And the leader after that one is going to be worse than the one before.

226
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,650
And that is an assurance.

227
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:20,070
You can take that to whatever you call the bank or safekeeping and reflect on that.

228
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:26,170
But speaking of which, a little bit about monetary stuff came up again, Seth.

229
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:32,530
And I think we've said on here before, people will never understand the monetary system.

230
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,810
Now, fortunately or unfortunately, never is not that far away.

231
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:40,650
Meaning everything is as the way you consider it to be or think it will be.

232
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:46,890
And prophetically, people stop using it simply because they just stop using it.

233
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,150
There is no indication people will ever comprehend it.

234
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,390
They just stop using it.

235
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,870
It's kind of like walking instead of taking the car.

236
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:02,590
You know nothing about a car, how it works, other than the ritual of getting in and pushing one pedal and turning a wheel and rolling down the window.

237
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,890
But you stop using it and you walk from now on.

238
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,250
That's exactly how the monetary system is going to be interacted with with humanity.

239
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:16,870
And so when I say society at large and most people at large and private as well,

240
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:23,990
if you talk to 100 people, 99 and a half will not understand the money system ever.

241
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,990
In the ever that we consider the current society.

242
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:32,650
But it doesn't mean that it can't be brought up as a reflection, maybe just poking fun.

243
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,030
Not at the people.

244
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,550
See, I mean, not at the monetary system, but at the people,

245
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:42,730
because there would be no monetary system as such unless the people were accommodated by it.

246
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:47,470
Anybody tells you about Illuminati or Federal Reserve and all that,

247
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,730
it's the local branch and the local contracts you get involved with that are screwing you.

248
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:57,670
Go to a local bank, any one of you, and ask to tell her if they have Federal Reserve notes.

249
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:00,170
Watch how she gets confused.

250
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:01,850
Hold on a second.

251
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,369
Let me get the manager.

252
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:08,569
And she or he are handling this every day and they don't know what it is.

253
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,690
That's why I mentioned earlier, if you just came to this planet,

254
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,829
you could listen on Common Sense, you'll get a lot.

255
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,130
You'll get a lot more than anywhere else, that's for sure.

256
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,910
But on the other hand, we're here for two hours.

257
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:22,990
If you come from another planet and you've got half a brain,

258
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:25,869
you could figure out this entire society in 15 minutes or less.

259
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:36,270
So with that said, I want to play a skit from Abbott and Costello, 1940s, 1950s comedy stand-up group.

260
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:42,270
And this one, it's from that infinite bastion of wisdom called YouTube.

261
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,670
Yeah, all you guys who love YouTube, right?

262
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:45,090
Yeah.

263
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,430
Well, it's from a YouTube video.

264
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,750
It's Abbott and Costello.

265
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,530
You're Not Here is what it's called.

266
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:55,430
I think the channel is Top Ten Cats or something, but you could find it on a search.

267
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,790
It's Abbott and Costello, how you want to spell it.

268
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,710
And the skit is called You're Not Here.

269
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,810
It's three minutes long.

270
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,750
And I want to play another skit after that.

271
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:07,090
And the next skit after that is called Loan Me 50 Cents.

272
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:11,950
But I want to play the You're Not Here one because this is how the pranksters are operating.

273
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,490
And you folks love it, by the way.

274
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,370
How do I know?

275
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,710
Well, I just go out.

276
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:19,410
I have shoes, good walking shoes that I could run in.

277
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,410
And I talk to people here, there, and everywhere, digitally as well.

278
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,390
And, yeah.

279
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:26,950
So what do you think, Seth?

280
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,570
Want to let it rip?

281
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,870
Absolutely.

282
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,410
Okay, here we go.

283
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:31,930
It's starting.

284
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,190
This is an excerpt from the movie.

285
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,790
Oh, I see you're ready for bed.

286
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,570
Why lay down?

287
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,490
Not until I get ready.

288
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,270
I'm ready.

289
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:41,410
I'm ready.

290
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,810
That goes for you, too.

291
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,810
And get this.

292
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,790
No noise while I'm here.

293
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:47,950
You're here?

294
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,090
Yeah, I'm here.

295
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,450
Who said you were here?

296
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,110
What do you mean I'm here?

297
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,090
Of course I'm here.

298
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,230
You wouldn't want to bet on it.

299
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,090
You want to bet me that I'm...

300
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,330
Are you crazy or something?

301
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,410
I'll bet you you're not here.

302
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,690
You want to bet me money?

303
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,150
Ten dollars says you're not here.

304
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,350
Well, that's a bet, chump.

305
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,450
Come on, put it up.

306
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,810
Hey, hey, you can hold it, too.

307
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:08,110
Ten dollars.

308
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,790
Bet you're not here.

309
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,710
All right, all right.

310
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,030
Well, I'll prove it that I'm not here.

311
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:12,450
What?

312
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,990
You're not in Chicago, are you?

313
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,350
Why, certainly not.

314
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:15,570
No.

315
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,490
You're not in Philadelphia, are you?

316
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,430
No.

317
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,990
No.

318
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:21,230
You're not in St. Louis, are you?

319
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,530
Of course not.

320
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,450
Well, now, wait a minute.

321
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,470
If you're not in Chicago, you're not in Philadelphia, and you're not in St. Louis.

322
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,610
You must be someplace else.

323
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,450
That's right.

324
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:30,910
That's right.

325
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:31,150
All right?

326
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:31,510
Yeah.

327
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,810
Well, if you're someplace else, you can't be here.

328
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:34,830
No.

329
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:35,970
That's all.

330
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,050
Hey.

331
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,870
That's a good one.

332
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:43,510
Yeah, yeah.

333
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,590
Yeah, I'm gonna pull that on my boss.

334
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,150
Sure.

335
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,050
He needs a little humor.

336
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:47,670
Sure.

337
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:48,850
That's all right.

338
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,390
You know what?

339
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:49,970
Let's do it.

340
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,930
Hey, does the boss know about this?

341
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,390
Oh, he don't know anything.

342
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,150
He don't know anything?

343
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:56,750
No.

344
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:57,850
I'll pull it on him.

345
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,330
Go ahead.

346
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,470
Hey, you.

347
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,430
Get up out of there.

348
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:03,990
Hey, get up.

349
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:04,610
Get up.

350
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,190
Come out.

351
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,950
What you got in there?

352
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,390
I want to bet you $10 that you're not here.

353
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,970
Hey, come on.

354
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,510
What's the matter with you?

355
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,570
I want to make you a bet.

356
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,610
I'll bet you $10 that you're not here.

357
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,430
You want to bet me $10 that I'm not here?

358
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,070
That's right.

359
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,170
Chance will make some money.

360
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:22,550
Come on.

361
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,740
All right, put it right here.

362
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:26,600
Here's mine.

363
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:30,850
There you are.

364
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:31,610
Are you ready?

365
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,030
Yes, sir.

366
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,550
Now, I'm going to prove to you that you're not here.

367
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,330
Go ahead.

368
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,570
Now, you're not in Chicago, are you?

369
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:37,410
No, sir, but I got an anthem.

370
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,130
No, no, no.

371
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,090
You're not in Chicago, are you?

372
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,490
No, sir.

373
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,470
And you're not in St. Louis?

374
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:40,970
No, sir.

375
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,030
And you're not in Philadelphia?

376
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,690
No, sir.

377
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,910
Now, if you're not in Chicago, and you're not in St. Louis, and you're not in Philadelphia,

378
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,550
then you must be someplace else.

379
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,030
That's right.

380
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,130
And if you're someplace else, you're not here.

381
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,670
Yes.

382
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,190
That's right.

383
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,630
Hey, give me back my money.

384
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,430
Who took your money?

385
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,390
That's my money.

386
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:56,990
Who took your money?

387
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:57,330
You did.

388
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:58,910
I took your money?

389
00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:59,530
That's right.

390
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,130
Now, just a minute, big boy.

391
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,470
Yeah?

392
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,110
Didn't you say that I wasn't in Chicago?

393
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:03,710
That's right.

394
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,370
That I wasn't in Philadelphia?

395
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:04,790
Yeah, yeah.

396
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,890
And that I wasn't in St. Louis?

397
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,590
That's right.

398
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,550
Well, if I'm not in Chicago, St. Louis, or Philadelphia, I must be someplace else.

399
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,030
That's right.

400
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:11,950
Well, if I'm someplace else, I couldn't be here.

401
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:12,730
Is that right?

402
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:13,190
That's right.

403
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:13,550
Yeah, yeah.

404
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,770
Well, if I'm not here, how could I take your money?

405
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,090
There you go.

406
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,310
That's exactly how the banking system is doing it, folks, if you get it.

407
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,350
You ever get a bill from the electric company?

408
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,710
That's what they're doing.

409
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:31,470
They're not.

410
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,490
You ever get a bill from...

411
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:32,710
Yep.

412
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:33,850
Yeah, exactly.

413
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:35,750
And you love it.

414
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,850
Santa Claus is in here.

415
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,410
Yep.

416
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,550
All that stuff you're told about to believe in is not there.

417
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:43,510
Never was.

418
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,400
Let that sink in for a little while.

419
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,380
Get this on archive and listen to it again.

420
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,460
Now, let's go a little bit more into the money system.

421
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,480
Now, first of all, we said earlier that people are never going to understand the money system.

422
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,540
So I'm not...

423
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,360
This could be viewed as two ways playing these skits.

424
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,420
One is like poking fun at how stupid people are.

425
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:06,100
And the other thing is just showing maybe a metaphor.

426
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,360
There might be some humor that it's all about pranking.

427
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,600
But remember, folks, that when I say pranking, you're being ruled by pranksters.

428
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,380
And you are pranksters yourselves to allow it.

429
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,760
But at this point, pranks sound like fun, but many people can also...

430
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,280
We're talking about pranks that you are killed in as well.

431
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,760
Just like there was a film in the 70s called Rollerball.

432
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:34,100
It's a sport, you know, and it was all right to fight to the death, right?

433
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,060
But that's all right because think about it this way, folks.

434
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,880
It's called Planet Earth.

435
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,280
No one gets off alive, right?

436
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,980
Well, anyway, Seth, I want to play the next one.

437
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,700
This one's two minutes and 16 seconds.

438
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,760
It goes kind of fast.

439
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,140
It's called Abbott and Costello, Loan Me 50 Cents.

440
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,520
So I was thinking of playing it twice, but I think just playing it once.

441
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:59,900
And if anyone goes to any kind of search, just put in Abbott and Costello.

442
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,720
Just Abbott and Costello, Loan Me 50 Cents.

443
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,620
And you'll get it and watch it a few times.

444
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,000
And, yeah.

445
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,920
All right, so here we go on this one.

446
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,260
Listen, I've got to get you a job.

447
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,380
I've got to use the telephone.

448
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,120
Loan me 50 cents.

449
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,820
Abbott, I would like to loan you 50 cents, but I can't do it.

450
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,600
All I've got is 40 cents.

451
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,140
40 cents?

452
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:17,360
Yeah.

453
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,640
All right, give me the 40 cents and you owe me 10 cents.

454
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:19,940
Right.

455
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,440
All right?

456
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,780
Wait a minute.

457
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,300
What's the matter?

458
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,260
How come I owe you 10 cents?

459
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,160
What did I ask you for?

460
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:24,640
50 cents.

461
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,360
And what did you give me?

462
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,220
20 cents.

463
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:26,980
So you owe me 10 cents.

464
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,800
How come I owe you 10 cents?

465
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,600
Now, wait a minute.

466
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,100
Now, listen to me.

467
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,060
I think all that money I had in my pocket, I gave you 40 cents.

468
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,920
Are you going to argue with me again?

469
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,360
No, no, no.

470
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,180
You owe me 10 cents besides.

471
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,880
I asked you for 50 cents.

472
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,180
All I had was 40 cents.

473
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,220
So you owe me 10 cents.

474
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,380
How come I owe you 10 cents?

475
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:38,920
Now, take it easy.

476
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,460
Take it easy.

477
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,880
40 cents and 10 cents is how much?

478
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,500
That's, everybody knows.

479
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,560
It's 50 cents.

480
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,300
Oh, no, no.

481
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,240
25 and 25 is 50 cents.

482
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,300
Give me that.

483
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:48,540
All right.

484
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,600
Here's your 40 cents.

485
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,740
Give me back the dime you owe me.

486
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,120
Okay.

487
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:51,540
Now, we're even.

488
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,240
Now, we're even.

489
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:52,640
Okay.

490
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,700
That's my own fault for asking you for a loan of 50 cents.

491
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,740
You tricked me too much into this.

492
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,760
I shouldn't have asked you for 50 cents.

493
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,940
How come I owe you 50 cents?

494
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,640
All I got left now is 30 cents.

495
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,980
Now, loan me the 30 cents and you owe me 20.

496
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:04,920
Okay.

497
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:05,920
Now, look.

498
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,900
I can start everything over.

499
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,820
You owe me 20 cents.

500
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:08,920
Now, make it clear.

501
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,700
It's clear to you.

502
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,260
Am I right?

503
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,960
How come I owe you 20 cents?

504
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,600
Since I gave you all the money I've got in the world.

505
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,400
All right.

506
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,760
I can't owe you that kind of money.

507
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,360
Here's your 30 cents.

508
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,700
Give me the 20 cents you owe me.

509
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,200
Okay.

510
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,240
There we are.

511
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,520
Now, we're all set.

512
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:25,900
We're all set.

513
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,440
We're all set.

514
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,120
Now, what are you hollering about?

515
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,500
I'm not.

516
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,640
I don't understand this.

517
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,400
You don't understand what?

518
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,260
It's not a transaction.

519
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:31,940
What do you mean?

520
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:32,760
Don't call me.

521
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,880
You started asking for 50 cents and I gave you 40 cents.

522
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,640
I gave you 30 cents.

523
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,040
My friend, it's the last time I'll ever ask you for the loan of 50 cents.

524
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,180
All right, but you got me all mixed up.

525
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,220
How come I owe you 50 cents?

526
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,680
All I got left now is 10 cents.

527
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,620
Is that all you got left?

528
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,460
That's all I got left.

529
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,760
Now, wait a minute.

530
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,480
Don't get excited.

531
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,580
I don't understand these transactions.

532
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,160
You're ruining my calculations.

533
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,520
You're ruining my finances.

534
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:53,500
Wait.

535
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,380
I'll tell you what I'll do with you.

536
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,480
What did you have?

537
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,860
I have 40 cents where I started.

538
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,160
Just a minute.

539
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,720
You want to take an I owe you for the 40 cents?

540
00:24:59,180 --> 00:24:59,540
Is it good?

541
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,780
Well, certainly it's good.

542
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,340
Well, that's business.

543
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,400
I mean, after all, you've got a bank.

544
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,040
You've got to do that.

545
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,540
I do everything strictly business.

546
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,100
Well, that's all right.

547
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,580
I'll take I owe you.

548
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,460
You got a pencil?

549
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,280
Yeah, a pencil.

550
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:07,740
Give me a pencil.

551
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,120
I'll put I owe you on my piggy bank.

552
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:09,920
That's right.

553
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,600
Now, here.

554
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,440
I owe you 40 cents.

555
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:16,880
There you are.

556
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,620
Now sign your name.

557
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,760
You lose.

558
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,060
Customer.

559
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:21,720
Go.

560
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,820
There you are now.

561
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,940
See, everything is legal.

562
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:24,660
Here, here, here.

563
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,600
There you go.

564
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,620
So, long and the short of it, folks, is when you go to a casino, you go and get chips,

565
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:31,920
right?

566
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,500
Otherwise, you can't play in the casino.

567
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,500
When you're born into a credit-based economy, you're given a credit line from the treasury

568
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,400
and certain government agencies, right?

569
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,340
A credit line.

570
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,720
And you might want to call it social security number or whatever, whatever.

571
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,120
It's identified by the name and the number.

572
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:57,400
And the key is to not let you know that you hold all the credit because you're full of greed

573
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,300
and gluttony, typically most people are.

574
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:05,100
But all the agencies, the banks, the attorneys, the doctors, the hospitals, the schools,

575
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,820
the water company, everyone that you do transactions with that has what's called a CAGE code,

576
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,720
C-A-G-E, Corporate Government Entity.

577
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,040
They know you have all the credit and they've got to get it from you without you knowing that you've got it.

578
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,720
And this is what's going on and it all comes out of the signature.

579
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,600
All they need is a signature.

580
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,900
And that's how it works.

581
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,880
It's very, very, very simple.

582
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:36,280
And it's also, there's a lot of divine intervention there because once I believe I read somewhere,

583
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:43,260
it said that it's the love of money that is the root of all evil, not money, the love of money.

584
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:50,260
So what the gods did was they eliminated money, lawful money, and now the only thing you're left with is credit,

585
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,440
which is not money, and you're all pursuing it simply for the love of money.

586
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,200
Why?

587
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,060
Because there will be no excuse later when you're confronted on this.

588
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:00,880
Yes, later.

589
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,820
So with that said, I think that's kind of a wrap up, first 30 minutes now,

590
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:12,520
a little bit of poking fun at the inhabitants on the surface here and a little bit about the credit system.

591
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,460
But I'd say, Seth, that these two chumps, Abbott and Costello, summed it up really well.

592
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,700
Yeah, very well in an amusing manner.

593
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:33,360
But it's an accurate representation of the mode of economic operations.

594
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,380
Yeah, yeah.

595
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,300
Like, for example, if you're arguing the – by the way, folks, just a little bit more.

596
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,160
You don't get a mortgage.

597
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,960
Actually, people are so unable to communicate.

598
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,920
I've actually seen advertisements about getting a mortgage.

599
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,760
You give a mortgage.

600
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,720
And if anyone has ever gotten involved with any kind of transaction like that,

601
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,320
they tell you that you hold the property fee simple.

602
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,100
What is it called?

603
00:27:59,220 --> 00:27:59,620
JESCA?

604
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:09,940
It's the Muslim tax, that if you're not Muslim, you pay a very strong tax, by the way, for privilege to live there.

605
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,080
Your property taxes are like that too, all that stuff.

606
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,800
All the taxes you pay are privileges.

607
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,720
They don't pay for anything, by the way.

608
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:23,120
If you folks are ever conveying on the streets and there's street work, it says bonds are paying for things, not taxes.

609
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,560
But anyway, if you look at what's called a mortgage, you give a mortgage.

610
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:33,420
And if you look at all of this stuff that they're doing, it's exactly like the Sabbath and Costello skit.

611
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,380
Exactly identical, identical to the point where it's scary and it goes beyond the pale of being comic.

612
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,460
It goes into the pale of being pranking.

613
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,620
And you will be killed by the pranksters.

614
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,680
Welcome to planet Earth.

615
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,240
You are being pranked.

616
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,980
This is known as the place of the prank right now.

617
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,540
And you're accommodating it.

618
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,180
The society at large is accommodating it.

619
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:06,980
So anyone that says, what are we going to do to make society better, that does not access or address the level of pranking that is going on is just a waste of time.

620
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:14,100
And what I mean by waste of time is such a fool has to say something, but the wise have something to say.

621
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:21,100
How many times have you tuned into any media and they say, we have to do something, we have to say something.

622
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,960
That is the mark of a fool with a capital O, folks.

623
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,880
So that's why we are here.

624
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:34,060
So you have two hours a week on the Internet where you might get some sanity.

625
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,220
And there's many ways to get sanity.

626
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,440
But the first way is to learn to separate yourself from what's going on and everywhere.

627
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,520
Because, folks, let me just throw this in about the pranksters again.

628
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,760
And this is kind of a repeated theme that we do here every two weeks because I guess repetition is important.

629
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:54,380
The first group or individual to prank you is the parents.

630
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:55,840
Yes.

631
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,500
Think about it.

632
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,900
You're being pranked.

633
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,940
So, you know, here you are.

634
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:11,140
You're going through your formative years and you're being pranked by the gods you are living with, meaning when you are very, very, very young and still in formation as an infant,

635
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:17,000
the parents represent not only large people, but they also represent almost a godlike status.

636
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,240
You have no concept of anything beyond them.

637
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,860
And they are pranking you.

638
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:25,500
So you have pretty much been imploded by pranking from the beginning.

639
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:31,900
And you go on from there and you can examine it objectively as you wish.

640
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:39,100
But, you know, we will disclose these realities to you on Common Sense.

641
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,080
So with that said, Seth, any interesting words for this week?

642
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,600
Onomatopoeia.

643
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,500
Oh, OK.

644
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,320
Word that came up.

645
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:56,880
I haven't actually done the etymology on it, but it is the most interesting word I've heard in the last couple of days, I suppose.

646
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:05,800
But now just we got, you know, a couple of e-mails.

647
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,880
I figure we might address one of those.

648
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,960
Is it?

649
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,880
We want to keep them anonymous.

650
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:17,860
I have one cut and pasted for me by our administrator.

651
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,980
A fairly recent one.

652
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,780
It's pretty long.

653
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,900
Hey, Greg, just wanted to start by saying thank you for the words you speak.

654
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:39,280
You have saved me lots of time rounding around in circles trying to chase this dummy load.

655
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,660
Is that the one maybe?

656
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,860
That's one of them.

657
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,360
OK.

658
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,760
I had a mentor recently passed away.

659
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,940
He's an old Catholic priest.

660
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,380
Figured out what really was about and turned away other way.

661
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,300
Basically, like what you described, set himself apart.

662
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:58,120
Now, by the way, when you folks are you folks out there that profess to being Christians, that's Catholicism.

663
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,880
There's about one hundred and something.

664
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,420
Set aside what you profess.

665
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,000
Being a million.

666
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,620
Jump up and down like a little child screaming about.

667
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,440
Set that aside for a moment.

668
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:20,080
That came out of the formation of the Catholic circus or church, which was initiated initially first, second, third, fourth centuries.

669
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,420
Its founder was a magician known as Simon Magus.

670
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,320
And you heard of all these church fathers.

671
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,740
By the way, when you use the word church, that means circus.

672
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,720
You may not like it.

673
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,660
You may not believe it.

674
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,900
But sorry, that's not my problem.

675
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,280
He was a magician.

676
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,540
He was very crafty, very wealthy.

677
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,060
Imagine a Houdini with Bill Gates's budget.

678
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:43,960
OK.

679
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,640
Even more.

680
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,740
And Simon, by the way, is translated into Peter.

681
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,980
I don't know how to get that.

682
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,600
Peter Piper, whatever.

683
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,600
That's when they talk about St. Peter.

684
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,960
That's Simon Magus, the magician.

685
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:02,740
And what what was finally settled on by the fourth century with Constantine and all these other guys.

686
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,180
By the way, it has nothing to do with the biblical text.

687
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,460
If there's any discussion with the biblical text, you're insane.

688
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,660
Just like the Constitution and American law.

689
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:24,400
But anyway, what they did was they settled on reviving Egyptian and primarily Hellenistic paganism, Greek paganism, as the liturgy.

690
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,160
I mean, as the function for the congregations, for the masses.

691
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,460
And they had a hierarchy of priests and bishops and so forth, all the way up to the pope himself.

692
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:46,020
And that hierarchy is involved in something else, which is a revival of the old Canaanite, Phoenician and Babylonian rituals of human sacrifice and parodies of that.

693
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,340
And that's all it is.

694
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,600
You've got a hundred and somewhat denominations of Christianity.

695
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,860
They all come out of that.

696
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,760
In other words, they're all the same.

697
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,940
They have the church.

698
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,300
They have this guy nailed to a cross, whatever.

699
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,080
None of that ever happened, by the way.

700
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:05,620
And also, there's a lot of people that I've noticed, Seth, in the past that have gotten into discussions and they agree.

701
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:12,060
And I find out these morons, their minds all of a sudden go to this Urantia book or other things stupid like that.

702
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:20,659
So what I want to say here, because I'm prefacing, the fellow in this email asks how to identify the Christ.

703
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,440
And I want to preface before I get into it.

704
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:28,500
Any biblical character you will discuss or think about is still completely secret.

705
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,500
And everything that's in the mind is false, by the way, folks.

706
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,060
I'm not a mind reader.

707
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:33,980
I don't have to be.

708
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:37,500
I've been on this planet for enough decades to realize what's going on.

709
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:46,020
So when you hear Abraham or Adam and Eve or the serpent or the Christ or this or that, get that out of your head.

710
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:55,560
Because if you actually go and research historically and biblically, you will not find what you're thinking about and what you've been told at all, at all.

711
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,620
But if you have to have the ability to read out of information, not read into it.

712
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,480
In other words, if you're bringing into what you've been told when you're studying these things.

713
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,720
Oh, no, here's he said that word study.

714
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,300
Oh, no.

715
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,060
Yeah.

716
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:16,220
You're not going to see it again because these things were designed to be hidden in plain sight for a later time.

717
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,480
So right back to the email.

718
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,880
So basically, I have let's say no one else turned to I know of the grain of knowledge at this days.

719
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,040
Thank you again.

720
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,100
When the day comes where we enter the family, is that OK?

721
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,500
Then he gets about mankind.

722
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:39,060
And also, if you could explain more about who the Christ was or is it would really mean a lot to me.

723
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,380
OK, I'm just paraphrasing bouncing around here, folks.

724
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,900
Sorry about that.

725
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,160
Where does the three in one concept come from?

726
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,860
That's the circus, the three ring circus.

727
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,060
By the way, that's something that they did put in.

728
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:54,020
If you ever see a Trinity or Father, Son, Holy Spirit type thing in your King James Bible,

729
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,560
and if you're spending too much time with the King James Bible, you'll get a disease.

730
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,020
It's called King James, King James version syndrome.

731
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:02,880
It's a syndrome.

732
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,200
I don't know what the cure for it is other than complete abandonment of those things.

733
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:15,840
But so he gets into these things that most people think are in the realm of religion.

734
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:21,000
And believe it or not, Seth, I think you and I in public here and other places, other sonic events,

735
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,820
have fully disclosed what's going on.

736
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:32,920
But you've got to remember that if a secret is designed to be secreted or hidden in plain sight,

737
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:39,120
you can actually point it out and explain it and it will still be secret because of the duration of it being in such a condition.

738
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:45,120
And fortunately, people are so conditioned or unfortunately, either way, that they won't see these secrets,

739
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,920
meaning that mankind didn't design this to be secret.

740
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,360
Which, by the way, when I asked you about the word, I wanted to bring up this thing.

741
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:57,740
I was talking to people this week about how they're functional or dysfunctionally functional

742
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:04,980
or how someone who wants to go vote in an election is somehow functioning but they're insane.

743
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,680
So what do they call that when you're functionally insane, I guess?

744
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,720
Even a society that has descended into complete chaos is still functioning somehow

745
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,720
because food, clothing and shelter is acquired.

746
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:27,320
So the word function, noun, one's proper work or purpose, power of acting in a specific way,

747
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,760
middle French, function, directly.

748
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,140
Okay, let's get a little more to it.

749
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:39,480
A performance and execution, to precipitate a particle sum of fungi, perform, execute, discharge.

750
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,760
So basically, to use, destroy, meaning official ceremony.

751
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,140
So it's all over the place.

752
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:50,960
So functionary, one who holds a certain office, functional, pertaining to a function.

753
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,940
So function is one of these things, I guess, that requires action, would you say, Seth?

754
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:04,400
And, yeah, these actions that you folks are getting involved in are not healthful, which, by the way,

755
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:16,400
it's a testament to the, I guess, durability, stamina and strength of the human body and mind.

756
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:24,540
How can a being be subjected to such disastrous surroundings, meaning not catastrophic,

757
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:32,980
but in a way that is just so functionally wrong, whether it's your religion, your science,

758
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:41,880
the way you raise children, all of it, every single aspect of it, in such a way,

759
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,760
and still be able to live and breathe?

760
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:50,660
It's a testament to the strength and vitality and veracity of the human body, is what I see it as.

761
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,480
That you could put up with a lot of crap and still breathe and be alive.

762
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:04,800
It's almost like a pressure test or a stress test on the being known as humanity, on what's going on.

763
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,020
There are many ways to explain it.

764
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,220
I just thought I'd bring that up.

765
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:18,400
So, any comments on, he was asking, essentially, about the Christ.

766
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:28,240
I think he mentioned a verse in particular, Way, Truth and Life, that were mentioned in that email as well.

767
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,160
That's really, you want to dig deep?

768
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:42,800
Those things, believe it or not, Way, Truth and Life, are defined by other books.

769
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,660
And those things have to be harmonized.

770
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,900
If that makes sense.

771
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,440
And that's really a large topic.

772
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,860
There are specific things as well.

773
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:05,080
That is a reference to, as you just said, things that are described in other books, collected in the same text.

774
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,300
Let's say a few things that are not being said anywhere else,

775
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,480
and maybe not been said for 2,500 years or 2,000 years.

776
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,020
And that is this, folks.

777
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,860
When you look at what's called the scripture or the biblical text,

778
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,620
and if you want to reduce it to 30 words or less, that is about two things.

779
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,820
Life and death.

780
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,200
It has nothing to do with religion.

781
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,420
Nothing to do with all these things that you've made it into.

782
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,980
Yes, it has a lot of things regarding those things in there as well,

783
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,600
things you do regularly and whatever.

784
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,620
But what people have done with it, just like anything else,

785
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,160
is completely removed from the source material.

786
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,780
It is about life and death.

787
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,940
So the purpose of the Christ is very simple.

788
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:49,080
Let's just lay out the secret, because if you want to hide something, put it in the public library.

789
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:54,280
If you want to keep a secret, get on a minor Internet radio station and start talking.

790
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,320
That's how you keep secrets, right?

791
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,260
So the secret is very simple.

792
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:02,520
The Christ came for one reason and one reason only,

793
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,400
and that is to prove that man is no longer subject to death strictly.

794
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,420
In other words, that the next level has been demonstrated.

795
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:19,700
He came to be a prototype before the mass production goes into effect.

796
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,340
That's it.

797
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,460
It's a complete secret.

798
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,960
Now, by the way, folks, all you guys out there, there's a lot of commentary,

799
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,960
oh, the God of the New Testament is different than the God of the Old Testament.

800
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,600
This, that, and the other.

801
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,480
Oh, boy.

802
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,520
Oh, boy.

803
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,380
Which one?

804
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:36,980
Yeah, exactly.

805
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:37,580
They don't even know.

806
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,080
I mean, this is just bizarre stuff.

807
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,940
But let's just go into another aspect.

808
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:48,740
But we've explained why all these things are similar, and pretty much it is continuous.

809
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,120
But this is, for the New Testament, only morons.

810
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,180
And by the way, you've been told to stay away from the other one

811
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,660
because you might figure things out, and then how is the prankster,

812
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:02,440
you know, these people that are priests, pastors, popes, ministers, deacons,

813
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:05,940
people that graduate from biblical school or divinity school,

814
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,900
these are all pranksters, all of them, every single one, folks.

815
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:12,140
They may not know it, but it doesn't mean that they're not a prankster,

816
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,200
even though they may have good intentions.

817
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:18,400
But they're wearing the uniform and saying the things that the pranksters have designed.

818
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,180
And the pranksters don't want you to figure out what's going on

819
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,820
because how are they going to get stuff from you.

820
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,820
But here's the point.

821
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,500
It's very, very, very simple.

822
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:33,520
And the whole thing coming around, and it goes around as this.

823
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:37,220
If you have no knowledge and you're really young in the subject,

824
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,920
let's say five- or six-year-olds or whatever in kindergarten,

825
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,660
and you sit in, let's say, graduate-level physics class.

826
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,000
Now, the young person would be the average person that's quote-unquote believer,

827
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,540
and the graduate-level physics class is the New Testament.

828
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,600
You could sit in that class for a day, a week, or a year.

829
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,820
And when it comes time to asking questions about what you're being exposed to,

830
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,400
all the children lift their hands up immediately,

831
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,620
and the question is, you got any candy?

832
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,500
And that's exactly what you're going to hear from someone who adheres to the New Testament

833
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,640
and knows nothing else.

834
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,460
You got any candy?

835
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,360
You know, I mean, and there is subjected to this a graduate-level, all the New Testament.

836
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,400
You will not find, by the way, anything that's in any religion

837
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,460
in any of the texts that they allegedly subscribe to,

838
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,420
including Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism, by the way, and Judaism.

839
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:36,300
Judaism will strictly tell you, we don't go by the Bible.

840
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,600
We go by other things.

841
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:38,900
They're honest.

842
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,160
And if you pressure anyone in the field of the Christian field,

843
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,960
they will tell you, we do not go by the Bible.

844
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:46,840
We go by church tradition.

845
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,740
And the same with Islam.

846
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,980
We don't go by the Koran.

847
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:54,520
We go by these other books that were written to interpret the Koran.

848
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,040
The same thing with the legal society.

849
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,300
We don't go by the law.

850
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,380
We go by what you said, what you signed.

851
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,840
The doctor says, well, I don't go by that.

852
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,520
I go by whatever I'm going to prescribe you.

853
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,820
So this is the level of pranking that you folks on this planet are subject to,

854
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,800
which will, by the way, if you have a clear mind and you just visited this planet,

855
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,040
you'll figure this out in 15 minutes.

856
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,740
So anyway, Seth, go ahead.

857
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:22,300
You were going to interject something there about kind of drifted away again.

858
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,200
About the physics, about got any candy.

859
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,560
Yeah, it was the last thing I, you know, and it's deliberate, by the way.

860
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,240
If you want to keep, let's say you've got a five-year-old,

861
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,140
and you want to keep him dumb for the rest of his life,

862
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,600
the only thing you're going to subject him in the first and only, let's say,

863
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,240
form of study is fifth-year graduate physics books.

864
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,180
That's all you're going to give him.

865
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,500
And he doesn't even know how to read.

866
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,120
He barely knows what the alphabet is.

867
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,240
He will not ever learn anything, right,

868
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:55,280
because you missed all the progression and the building up.

869
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,740
And that's what you folks are getting out of the New Testament.

870
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:58,460
Here's the thing.

871
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,620
There is no such thing as the New Testament, by the way.

872
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,260
That's all in the stuff that's been given to you.

873
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,120
So there's a big level.

874
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,900
So here, just to go back to the email and answer that with veracity

875
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:07,900
and answer it directly,

876
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:13,240
the Christ is a prototype to show that death can be put to death.

877
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,460
And if death is put to death, there's no more death.

878
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,420
And if there's no more death, there's only, you get it?

879
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,620
Double negatives work in certain ways.

880
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,120
Yeah, one of those books towards the end,

881
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,220
I believe death is actually put to death.

882
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,020
Mm-hmm.

883
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:29,980
Yeah.

884
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,420
And if death is put to death, there's no more death.

885
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,260
And if there's no more death, there's only, you guys can say it.

886
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:36,880
Yeah.

887
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,680
It's very simple as nothing going into an ancient sex temple.

888
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,380
By the way, folks, if you brought last week,

889
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,640
we spoke about technology and bringing someone from the past

890
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,740
and what they would probably be most amazed at is after 15 minutes

891
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,620
or a couple of days is how much and how proficient

892
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:57,600
and how well skilled you are as a society to spread tar everywhere,

893
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,760
known as asphaltic roads.

894
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,640
That would be the hardest thing to get over, right?

895
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,280
And if you brought an ancient into a Western society

896
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,560
and you walked down the street, he'd be saying,

897
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:14,280
hey, I didn't know you had a sex temple in your neighborhood based on the way it looks

898
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,780
and the architecture that we all know.

899
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,020
And guess what he'd be pointing at?

900
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,760
That why is there a giant phallus on top of it?

901
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:21,300
Yeah.

902
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,140
And not only that, it's the shape of the doors and the rooftop and all that

903
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,000
and the way the interior is set up.

904
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:27,540
Yeah.

905
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:32,260
Just like if you right now walk down the street and there's no sign on a store,

906
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,900
you could recognize an ice cream parlor.

907
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,840
You see all these refrigerators with glass and people with scoops, right?

908
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:41,320
Or you'll recognize a shoe store or whatever or a pawn shop.

909
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,080
You know they have the three large balls outside.

910
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,240
You bring an ancient into modern society from any society in the ancient world,

911
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:51,660
they will point at your local church or your place of worship as a sex temple.

912
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,040
Yes, folks.

913
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,280
Sorry.

914
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,980
And you should be sorry yourselves.

915
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:01,900
But anyway, yeah, that's very uncommon to say that and very uncommon to think it,

916
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,620
and it's actually a very common thing to know.

917
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,880
And you ever wonder why you have bad things happening.

918
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,800
So with that said, any other email that we could keep anonymous perhaps

919
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,260
and interject in here or do you think you want to just dwell on this one for a little while?

920
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,860
We can continue on with that one.

921
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:33,320
The other one that I was referring to is one that we began to address at the very end of the program last broadcast.

922
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:34,280
Okay.

923
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:40,940
And it's just a listener out there who's been listening to the program as we've been broadcasting,

924
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:49,020
and he's just curious about dreams for kind of a personal reason.

925
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:55,040
And so I figured I would bring that up because we didn't really get to address it much,

926
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,240
although we have numerous times in the past.

927
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:06,500
But as we've kind of discussed between ourselves, repetition is not necessarily a bad thing,

928
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,100
especially when it comes to information.

929
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:13,380
Information should be shared.

930
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,300
But it also happens to be hated, by the way.

931
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,040
Yes, absolutely.

932
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:25,540
With a lot of people just don't like it.

933
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,100
So go ahead.

934
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,140
So about dreams, yes.

935
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,760
The long and the short of it is that your dreams are not your own and you're being plugged.

936
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:40,580
It's a form of input that is being played on a screen in the mind, and you're experiencing it.

937
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:48,540
And it just goes to show you or shows to go you how much of what you are, what you think you're thinking, is exposed.

938
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,220
And who's plugging it?

939
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,380
The other side.

940
00:48:53,200 --> 00:49:00,540
Various minor gods, imps, and demons, angelic beings, but of very low ranking on that society.

941
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:09,960
If you're going to get a dream from a high ranking being, benevolent being, they identify themselves as such typically.

942
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:18,340
And they tell you what's going on, where the low ranking ones, you know,

943
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:21,980
kind of bring in things that you think you're being entertained with,

944
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:26,020
whether it's experience A, B, C, or D, or whatever experience you have in life,

945
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,440
or whatever they want to plug into you.

946
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:35,280
And then hopefully you will get up and say you had this dream to someone else,

947
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:39,040
and they're laughing their asses off, high-fiving each other.

948
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,260
Hey, look, we plugged this guy pretty good.

949
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:41,700
Look at him.

950
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,380
He's talking about it, and he doesn't even know what's going on.

951
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,380
And I had seen a question, by the way.

952
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,460
If you know what dreams are, then why do you keep dreaming?

953
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,680
I think that was from Dylan on chat.

954
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,240
Hello, Dylan.

955
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:54,980
Very interesting.

956
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:58,980
Well, you know, just because, you know, the police are like private security guards,

957
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:06,580
doesn't mean they're not going to stop and give you a ticket and harass you, right, or whatever.

958
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:14,460
Just because, you know, there is no have any law whatsoever, you go to what's called a court.

959
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:18,780
They're not saying, well, the law is, and if you bring it up, then they're like, oh, we don't go by law then.

960
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,360
So these are adversarial, in other words.

961
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,740
So one way to, let's say just to address, well, if you know what dreams are, how can you keep dreaming?

962
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:35,260
Here's an interesting comment that we've gotten on, I believe I've gotten on IM and Skype.

963
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:43,560
He said that I had done a sonic experience with another host a while back, a few months ago,

964
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:48,980
and I spoke about dreams, and this person was very eager to contact me and tell me that when he heard that,

965
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:54,740
he stopped dreaming, but then the dreams came back even more vivid, right?

966
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,840
So that doesn't mean that it invalidates it.

967
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:05,840
Yes, you are being plugged by spiritual beings that are not you, and they're enjoying it,

968
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,920
and they'll bring you things in private also.

969
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,560
That means that you really can't do anything in private, right?

970
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:16,440
So, yeah, just because you know how they work, in some cases the dreams do stop

971
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,620
because it startles them on the other side also.

972
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,320
They're like, crap, man, I kind of figured out what we're doing,

973
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,820
and a bunch of other guys there on their side are probably saying, well, so what?

974
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:29,580
He's just a human. Just keep plugging away. Ignore him.

975
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:37,900
I would add that these entities seem to be – they're disingenuous.

976
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,940
What is shown is generally not accurate.

977
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:48,220
If you look at it as being tricked, that's – generally that involves some falsehood,

978
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,120
some deceit, or just plain lies.

979
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:59,980
I know of people that have dreamt of – like were actually –

980
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:05,820
what they thought were being visited by relatives who are at rest.

981
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,840
How are you going to be visited by someone who's at rest?

982
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:16,600
But in their dreams and after a conversation and listening and contemplation,

983
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:24,500
in the dream it happened again, but knowing that they actually mentioned it,

984
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:32,040
kind of a lucid sort of circumstance in a dream, and it changed dramatically in the dream.

985
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:34,800
I believe you told me this.

986
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,620
They turned into a pile of chopped meat instead of the dead relatives, right?

987
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,620
Yeah, it was –

988
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:40,900
Or something like that, yeah.

989
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,840
Yeah, they just disintegrated.

990
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:46,000
Yeah, because these were – yeah, they're sensory junkies.

991
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:49,400
The ones that are employing dreams into people's minds are sensory junkies.

992
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:55,640
Just like on the low level of human society, the lower ranks, social ranks,

993
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,360
people are generally sensory junkies.

994
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,140
I don't care how cheap that liquor is.

995
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:05,660
I just need some weed to smoke, or I just want to lay in front of the TV.

996
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:09,680
This is the level of spiritual beings that are plugging the dreams.

997
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,660
By the way, dreams are very significant in pagan cultures, and pagan just means ignorant.

998
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:19,980
I'm actually kind of happy to hear lately there's more and more people professing to be pagan.

999
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:20,760
Have you heard that?

1000
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,780
I've heard it in public.

1001
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,460
Well, I'm a pagan.

1002
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:24,900
I don't do any of the –

1003
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,540
Yeah, and I'm like, oh, great, man, finally people admitting they're ignorant.

1004
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,520
Yeah, that's good.

1005
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,760
That's a good level of honesty.

1006
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:39,160
In a colloquial sense, it brings to – makes people think of like – what specifically?

1007
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,580
Like Wiccan and things like that, but that's not where the term originates.

1008
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:49,540
The term originates – I believe it was first used as a semi-derogatory term by the Roman military

1009
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:56,460
and Roman society as just referring to those that were like the country bumpkins,

1010
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:00,640
uneducated, not part of society.

1011
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,660
Yeah, and not interested to be either.

1012
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,720
Well, here's our first hour, man.

1013
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,140
Let's carry this thought over.

1014
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:07,780
What do you think, Seth?

1015
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,140
I think I cut out there a little bit, but I'd –

1016
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:11,300
You did.

1017
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:16,480
They're essentially just referring to, as you said, the uneducated.

1018
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,480
I'd say nation as opposed to ignorant.

1019
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:26,120
When they were using it, they were generally referring to those that were not necessarily even like outside of society,

1020
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,960
but country bumpkins.

1021
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,980
Let's carry it over on the next hour.

1022
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:35,100
Let's carry this whole thought over, the dreams.

1023
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:36,120
All right.

1024
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,720
This is the first hour of Uncommon Sense.

1025
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:39,580
We'll be back.

1026
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,440
You're listening to American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com and UncommonRadio.com.

1027
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,940
And we're back, hour number two.

1028
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:48,800
Seth, are you with us?

1029
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,640
Yes, yes, I am.

1030
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,060
There is quite a storm going on outside.

1031
00:54:53,060 --> 00:55:01,360
So if I'm interrupted in my ability to broadcast because of that, all those listening, as well as you, the Greek, have my apologies.

1032
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,260
But we'll keep going until that happens for certain.

1033
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:05,500
Okay, great.

1034
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,300
You know, everyone is typically talking about the weather.

1035
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,220
When is someone going to do something about it, right?

1036
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,780
Remember that thing with Samuel Clemens?

1037
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:16,520
Yeah, that's another subject we could get into, the weather.

1038
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:22,860
And, yeah, the reality of the weather and what people are discussing about it is just there's no comparison.

1039
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,220
It's like voting at an election.

1040
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:29,660
Anyway, so we're on this topic of dreams.

1041
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,060
And you brought up a few good examples, Seth.

1042
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,320
Do you want to recap some of those?

1043
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:40,940
Because I believe that, you know, just myself plugging away sounds pedantic after a while.

1044
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:41,620
So go ahead, please.

1045
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:49,300
Yeah, this being the beginning of a new hour, we can – I'll just start by saying we received an email.

1046
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:58,960
And it was someone asking about dreams because this person is being affected by them.

1047
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,380
And it's not a pleasant experience.

1048
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:15,320
And so I wanted to share personal observations as well as, you know, what I've seen through conversing with others and whatnot.

1049
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,540
What dreams are, very similar thoughts.

1050
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,880
We've spoken about thoughts here on the program as well.

1051
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:33,120
And what is commonly or collectively understood is that, you know, our thoughts are our own.

1052
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:37,120
And I, you know, would say that that's not the case.

1053
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:46,820
I'd say that our thoughts are coming into us from many different places, directly from sources and indirectly from a lot of sources as well.

1054
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:54,760
That can be demonstrated with – very easily with technology, although it's not all quite so mundane.

1055
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,100
But –

1056
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,440
In other words, hold on.

1057
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:02,040
It's where you tune into, and then there's bandwidth and all this other stuff, right?

1058
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:06,140
Where bandwidth might be someone who's considered very proficient or, quote-unquote, smart.

1059
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:12,200
And where you tune into are the things that people are focused on, like a station, let's say.

1060
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:17,960
And very much like an Internet where you have a browser that you do a search, it's similar as well.

1061
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:22,220
And all the memories in a cloud and so on and so forth, et cetera, et cetera.

1062
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:22,720
So go ahead.

1063
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:23,980
Yeah.

1064
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:30,540
So, you know, the obvious examples being television and things like that.

1065
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,620
Those are thoughts that are being taken in.

1066
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:40,660
If you're sitting there contemplating an idea or concept that has been presented to you by a television or by a radio program or by a newspaper,

1067
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,500
those are all thoughts that are being transmitted to you through one medium or another.

1068
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,860
Like I said, that's very mundane.

1069
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:54,320
I would also suggest that these thoughts, being that thoughts are generally intangible,

1070
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:59,980
that there are sources that are not readily acknowledged, readily acknowledged as well.

1071
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:07,940
So dreams being a type of thought and something that is coming into us, not just originating within ourselves,

1072
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,860
then you have to look at, OK, the source of such things.

1073
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:24,940
So if you're being distressed by these dreams, realize that these are communications that are coming in and not necessarily quality communications.

1074
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:33,460
Just like a television program is not necessarily a quality communication just because it is coming to you on the television.

1075
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:43,220
And if it's something that is causing you distress or adversely affecting the way that you feel emotionally or physically,

1076
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:48,920
which are basically one and the same, then change the channel.

1077
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:55,280
Step back and realize that you do have some control over it.

1078
00:58:55,360 --> 00:59:02,480
It's not perhaps as easy as using a remote control for the television, but the concept itself is still similar.

1079
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:08,520
And if you can take and dwell on these thoughts and ideas, specifically, like I said,

1080
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,880
we got an email from someone who is obviously being distressed by their dreams.

1081
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,700
It's the second email even.

1082
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:23,420
So that's the why of bringing it up and addressing it in an uncommon manner.

1083
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:29,700
There is a, as you were saying, Greek, there are a lot of cultures and a lot of subcultures, even currently,

1084
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:37,960
that's put a lot of weight on dreams and the meaning of their dreams and things like that.

1085
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:49,820
But it's one of those things that is very, it's easily referenced material because most dream in one manner or another and to one extent or another.

1086
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:59,440
And so it's something that's used to hoodwink people out of their common sense, I would say, through personal experience.

1087
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:07,020
But being made aware of something is a good step towards addressing it,

1088
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:10,800
specifically if it's causing any sort of problem or discomfort.

1089
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:18,520
You know, you can walk around with a tack in your shoe all day and complain about the discomfort.

1090
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:26,480
But until you realize that you're going to have to sit down and remove the shoe and take the tack out, it's still going to be there.

1091
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,420
So, you know, it takes. It's difficult.

1092
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:33,020
Yeah. And sometimes you could be like, you know, going down a flight of stairs and you can't do it right there.

1093
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:38,480
You're going to have to wait a little bit. But I want to reiterate a few things real quick.

1094
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,120
Yes. These are the malevolent entities.

1095
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:46,200
And in order to pass off as a good counterfeit, you have to look benevolent if you're malevolent.

1096
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:56,280
Right. Right. And I believe that this people's bullet, by the way, malevolent beings can do healings as well and show you future events as well,

1097
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:04,340
because there is a place where all of our paths are are set and can be communicated to them, but not to us, for example.

1098
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:09,260
So, yes, if and let me just preface, people say they're listening,

1099
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:14,820
but honestly, most people are honest enough to say that they just heard something, which is good.

1100
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:19,880
Now, if you're hearing things, that's fine. But if you're other thing now, if you're listening,

1101
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:30,240
you'll find out that what's been said here is that the concept of counterfeiting is to make some to pass something along of lesser value that appears to have higher value.

1102
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:40,600
So the malevolent beings or indifferent beings that are interacting with mankind or let's just say they are of low social rank in their community.

1103
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:45,800
They are the ones that are plugging mankind with dreams. If you're listening.

1104
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:53,320
Now, the second part of that is if you're going to get a dream from a higher ranking member of that society,

1105
01:01:53,580 --> 01:02:01,260
they will identify themselves that you are being you're getting a message imparted from a higher rank or being and they usually will impart themselves as such.

1106
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:08,420
And the thing about the caveat on this is that guess what? Malevolent beings will do that sometimes as well.

1107
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:18,400
They will actually mimic something that you've heard. But typically it won't be a higher ranking being as it is in reality,

1108
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:25,160
but as it is in a religious text, like some being might come to you in a dream and say that they are a J.S.U.S.

1109
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:30,440
and they have long hair and they're telling you all the stuff that you're being told in Christendom or Christianity.

1110
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:34,580
And that is obviously a malevolent being, obviously, if you've done your homework.

1111
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,740
It looks like a hippy.

1112
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:37,920
Yeah.

1113
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:38,800
Sorry.

1114
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:45,660
Yeah, no, exactly. So, yeah, which is unlawful, by the way. So the thing is, it's very – is it simple? No, it's very complex.

1115
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:52,500
It's a heist. It's a job. They're pulling off a heist. And in order to pull off something, they think it through.

1116
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:54,360
They've got lots of time to think things through.

1117
01:02:54,360 --> 01:03:00,800
Now, going back to, Seth, how you were finishing up the thought of the persistence of the thumbtack, let's say,

1118
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:08,800
being removed in order to bring some comfort back, I can give you several parallel experiences that when people –

1119
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:15,400
it was suggested to people studying what these things are and approaching, let's say, higher ranking thought,

1120
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,960
level of thought, and who these higher ranking beings really are, not what you're being told through religion,

1121
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:27,960
but actually the source material that the religions are supposedly based on, you will stop dreaming almost immediately, typically.

1122
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:38,480
Sometimes if people approach these documents and they're reading out of it, their dreams get worse, you see,

1123
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:47,420
because what's happening is that they're making an attempt to make the dreams go away, but they're falling into the counterfeit stuff.

1124
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:53,640
Like, for example, you pick up a King James Bible, and you start reading that like that's really what the scriptures are,

1125
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:59,520
you're going to get pranked like you wouldn't believe. Your dreams will get worse, almost. I assure you of that.

1126
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:14,380
So you're going to have to do a little bit of work on yourself and do a little bit of work, not by yourself, but by yourself to meditate on these things.

1127
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:20,780
So if you pick up something, and it says it's a version, or it's an extract, or it's not cheese, it's a cheese product, right?

1128
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,420
What are you looking for? Are you looking for real cheese that should be made of milk?

1129
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:33,100
If you're looking for the scriptures, let's say, and it says this is a version, and the only reason it's printed this way is for marketing purposes,

1130
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:41,020
and you see that stuff like, my name is the Lord, I am your God, well, right there, you're being pranked like you wouldn't believe.

1131
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:46,360
This is no such thing. It doesn't say that anywhere. That's just what's being delivered to you.

1132
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:57,060
So there's so many layers of pranking going on that, yeah, it's going to be difficult for the individual or individuals that are having difficulty with the dreamscape world.

1133
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:07,240
But what I've, from parallel experiences, what I've noticed is people that have been, have taken the suggestion that go and study what really is going on on the other side,

1134
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:17,560
without listening to all that God and Lord stuff, and get some, stop reading into things and read out of it, your dreams will stop.

1135
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:23,580
One way to do it is by admitting that you want to pursue the truth, and there is truth to be known.

1136
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:26,720
You may not like it. As a matter of fact, I assure you, you won't like the truth.

1137
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:33,500
Think about the truth that, this is the truth, folks. It might sound dogmatic, but it's too bad.

1138
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:44,080
It's too bad that when you were just a little toddler, the gods around you, a.k.a. your parents, because that's all you knew, pranked you consistently.

1139
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:46,660
That's a really rough existence.

1140
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:54,440
So, nonetheless, not everyone, but mostly everyone, been subject to some sort of prank by their parents, right?

1141
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:58,740
We want you to do well, son or daughter, but just don't do better than us, is what they're thinking.

1142
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:04,060
So, there's many levels to this. This is a very, very difficult place.

1143
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:11,820
Well, it's a challenge, and like I said earlier, it's a testament to the virility and the durability of the human body and the human spirit to put up with this stuff.

1144
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:19,120
So, other than studying and admitting that you're pursuing the truth, and, well, let's just say, let's not even use that truth word,

1145
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:25,460
because everyone's been mopping the floor with that, from academics all the way down to the basic moron on the planet.

1146
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:29,620
Let's just stay away from that word for a moment, because it's been hijacked.

1147
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,420
Change the channel, right?

1148
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:38,080
It's just like, for example, if someone says, well, you know, I'm not feeling well, and I don't know why.

1149
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:47,420
Well, you're the only one who really does know why, because the way you're feeling is based on your behavior and what you like to do.

1150
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:50,900
So, the easiest way to – it's a condition based on behavior.

1151
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,500
So, the easiest way to change any condition is by changing the behavior.

1152
01:06:54,500 --> 01:07:00,580
So, if you don't like the way you're feeling, let's say physically or whatever, make a list of all the things that you're doing and like to do,

1153
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:07,260
and then make another list, contrary to that, all the things you don't like to do and don't do, and then switch them.

1154
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:13,320
Do the things that you haven't been doing, and nine out of ten times, if not ten out of ten times, the condition will change.

1155
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:16,700
So, yeah.

1156
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:24,400
These are just simple matter-of-fact things, and that's why it's called uncommon sense,

1157
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:30,140
because if you just landed on this planet, you'll notice the ridiculousness here.

1158
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:33,640
So, anything that's not ridiculous is strictly uncommon, folks.

1159
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:38,180
So, let's stay on the dream thing for a little bit more, Seth.

1160
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:38,940
What do you think?

1161
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:42,040
Do you want to pursue that a little bit more?

1162
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:43,580
Yeah.

1163
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:44,300
You're still there?

1164
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:44,560
Yeah.

1165
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:45,540
Yes, absolutely.

1166
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:53,300
Anything else on any of the emails regarding dreams, but they're pretty much the context and the message is similar, you think?

1167
01:07:54,320 --> 01:08:03,860
Yeah, absolutely, and I would suggest that if the listener out there in particular would like to email me back.

1168
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:09,040
I did reply to one of the emails, but I'm not certain that it went through.

1169
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:17,520
So, email me directly at deerredshoesatgmail.com, D-E-R-R-E-S-H-O-E-S at gmail.com,

1170
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:28,380
so that I can make sure that the response is going, because if you're after something any more specific than that, if I have the time, I'll respond.

1171
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:36,439
The only way to communicate what's going on is generally, because the specifics are just as specific as each snowflake being different,

1172
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:42,620
even though they all seem the same, just like each spirit of each individual, each person that manifests,

1173
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:46,880
each man or woman that manifests on this plane is very unique.

1174
01:08:48,859 --> 01:09:00,180
Yeah, so the specifics, the ultra-specific, the high-specific that will be most effective is up to whoever gets the basics down, right?

1175
01:09:00,979 --> 01:09:03,160
It's just like, for example, a sport like baseball.

1176
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:09,960
Let's say you have the pitcher's mound, and based on the rule book and based on the game, the pitcher does certain things.

1177
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:14,399
But if you look through history and what's being communicated in any baseball game,

1178
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:22,840
every time there's a different pitcher, there's a different pitch, there's a different style, different efficacy, different effectiveness, right?

1179
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:30,979
So the position of the player might be held as being the same, but the actual individual makes the game,

1180
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:34,439
makes that pitching function very different every time.

1181
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:39,340
So everyone's dreams are very different every time, but there are a lot of similarities.

1182
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:46,100
Typically, the dreams, obviously, they could be rendered or judged as being a good dream or a bad dream,

1183
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:52,240
good meaning however the individual sees it as being good, and bad, again, however the individual sees it as being bad.

1184
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:55,040
But typically, they're telepathic in nature.

1185
01:09:55,260 --> 01:10:00,300
If you ever recall a dream and there's a conversation or someone speaking at you or with you,

1186
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:02,640
you'll notice there's no movement of the mouth.

1187
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:10,180
There's just a face, and there's colors and things don't really come through sometimes.

1188
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:16,040
The textures of things that you're familiar with, with the senses, are not revealed.

1189
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:21,540
It depends on the dream maker, and literally, there are dream makers.

1190
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:31,040
So, yeah, I don't know how more specific, other than giving as many generalities as possible,

1191
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:34,660
just like if you're going to a restaurant to eat lunch, they have a menu.

1192
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,200
You're not going to eat everything on the menu.

1193
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,740
You might want to pick one or two items, and that's all you can handle at the time.

1194
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:45,380
So maybe just putting out a lot of specifics in a general way will allow people to pick

1195
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:48,820
and choose what they think applies or doesn't apply.

1196
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,320
But these things are simple.

1197
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:52,380
We're not making this up.

1198
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,460
Anyone and everyone has access to what we're discussing.

1199
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:01,800
If you stop reading into information and just read out of it,

1200
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:05,600
when you're given a piece of information, can you objectify it?

1201
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:09,940
Can you have it validated?

1202
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,400
Can you see the history of the thing?

1203
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:15,180
Like, for example, I think, Seth, you brought up there's a lot of people adding significance

1204
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:18,580
to the nature of dreams in the pagan reality, let's say.

1205
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:24,620
There's a lot of Internet stuff on that, alternative radio stations that have hosts

1206
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:27,780
that talk about these things like as if there's really –

1207
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:36,540
as if the reality of the dream experiences are something else that they're projecting,

1208
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:39,340
of some significance that doesn't exist.

1209
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:42,500
So, you know, well, occasionally, fortunately,

1210
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:44,860
people know not to come here with that kind of crap and say,

1211
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:50,240
well, this person said the dream is real and it's really your subconscious

1212
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:53,840
or your dead relatives coming back.

1213
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,080
I'm like, look, that's just – you know, get away from here.

1214
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,820
You know, that's the marketing aspect.

1215
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:02,800
You know, this is – fortunately, we don't get too much of that.

1216
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:10,320
We don't get too much of the reincarnation crap and the Jesus lived in India crap

1217
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,960
and the – yeah, yeah, all this other stuff or Anunnaki stuff

1218
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:21,260
or little gray ETs coming through the wall, yeah, or flat earth and things like that.

1219
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:24,920
So we don't get the ridiculous stuff that people engage in.

1220
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:31,480
We don't get questions regarding elections, yeah, and things like that.

1221
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,660
So that's very fortunate that way.

1222
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,660
But what else about the dream, Seth?

1223
01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:41,000
Anything else you think we can expand on if you're still there?

1224
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:43,840
Or you might be muted. Okay.

1225
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:45,860
Muted, apologies.

1226
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:47,060
Yeah, that's fine.

1227
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,320
I'm saying yes, I'm still here.

1228
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,620
And rightly so because of what I think.

1229
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:59,040
But, you know, the dream is also there's a concept of past, present, and future events being used in dreams.

1230
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:03,800
You've got to realize there's something called vantage point, folks.

1231
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,260
Let's just apply this directly and indirectly.

1232
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:14,600
When people are given future events in dreams, it's very natural to assume –

1233
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,680
let's be presumptuous, but it's more than that –

1234
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:23,880
that in the spiritual realm they have a different vantage point that mankind does not have.

1235
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:29,680
And that would be the analogy of the parade where, let's say, you and your buddies are standing on the sidewalk

1236
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:34,300
and it's a long parade, a four-hour parade, and you're wondering what the last float is.

1237
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:37,800
And you have to wait four hours to see what it looks like.

1238
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:41,680
But if you have a friend in a helicopter, you could get on the cell phone and call him

1239
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:44,760
and ask him what the last float looks like.

1240
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:45,100
Why?

1241
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:48,860
Because let's say several thousand feet up in the air,

1242
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:54,640
they could see the front of the parade and the back of the parade all in one view.

1243
01:13:55,260 --> 01:14:00,060
And they could report down to you that the last float is a green pig with purple wings.

1244
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:06,700
So you tell all the buddies on the sidewalk that in four hours you will see a green pig with purple wings.

1245
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:09,580
And they're like, oh, Greek, I don't believe that.

1246
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:10,820
And you're like, oh, yeah, so what?

1247
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:11,680
Yeah, da, da, da.

1248
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:12,220
Right?

1249
01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:16,620
Four hours later, here comes the pig with the wings.

1250
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:20,860
Because you're able to get information from a higher vantage point.

1251
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:29,060
So there is a very simple, maybe oversimplified way to how people are getting information about future events

1252
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:35,820
through dreams, even though they are of lower social ranking in their world, spiritual world.

1253
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:41,520
Yes, typically malevolent, but not all things malevolent appear to be as such.

1254
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:47,640
Stop watching the Hollywood stuff where the good guys wear white and the bad guys wear black and they have fangs.

1255
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:49,680
That's not how it works.

1256
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:54,140
Think about malevolent and benevolent as how counterfeiting is being done.

1257
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,980
You can't take a dinner napkin and a crayon and write a hundred note on it and go and spend it.

1258
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:08,680
You know, as a counterfeiter, you know, they have to, they actually go through tremendous efforts to make it look like the real deal.

1259
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:14,060
But in this case, what's interesting about dreams is that no one even knows what the real deal is.

1260
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:22,220
It's just something they know that if they sleep, they experience and they, well, you know, pity the inhabitants on this planet

1261
01:15:22,220 --> 01:15:24,920
that have fallen through the pagan standard.

1262
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:30,160
Oh, yeah, your dreams are blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1263
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,060
Let me tell you what those mean.

1264
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:33,840
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1265
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,300
Now, there is dream interpretation as well.

1266
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:39,560
And dreams are, there's many reasons why they come.

1267
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,220
But you have to understand what they are first.

1268
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:45,480
And this somehow has escaped everyone.

1269
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:47,400
It's like the money.

1270
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:52,220
I don't care as long as I go to the store and get something for it.

1271
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:54,500
I don't care if it's unlawful.

1272
01:15:54,560 --> 01:15:56,140
I don't care what it is.

1273
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,380
Or, you know, we've got to say something.

1274
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:01,000
We've got to do something.

1275
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:01,700
Yeah, really?

1276
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:02,260
Uh-huh.

1277
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:02,640
Yeah.

1278
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:14,540
Reminded of a few occurrences that have been recorded where the dreams of kings were interpreted by slaves, actually.

1279
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:15,840
Mm-hmm.

1280
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:19,800
Yeah, there's what they call the Book of Genesis.

1281
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:21,640
There's a significant one there as well.

1282
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:30,220
Now, you've got to realize that the social ranks on Earth are also administered very similar like the social ranks on the spiritual world.

1283
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:34,100
And, by the way, the spirit, when you, hmm, how do we say this?

1284
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:34,940
As above, so below?

1285
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:36,760
I don't like to give too much credence to that.

1286
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:44,100
But nonetheless, you know, what's below, what's above, you know, it's kind of like proving that you're not here, that Abbott and Costello thing, right?

1287
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,720
Because you're attached to everything.

1288
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:55,000
But the point is that if you look at all the military, for example, ranking systems throughout history and through all the nations, they're all very similar.

1289
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:59,400
It's because they're copying the military ranking system from the other side.

1290
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:04,020
I had a discussion with a moron known as a scientist a while back,

1291
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:10,120
and he was trying to explain to me that all these basic tools and things that mankind is engaged in is just basic science.

1292
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:17,980
And I'm like, no way, because most of them had come into fruition very quickly without the type of experiment we like to engage in.

1293
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:24,280
And, by the way, folks, when I bring up science, there's no such thing that's a very recent establishment.

1294
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:33,160
Prior to that, they were known as natural philosophers or natural philosophy, which used to pursue natural events and things.

1295
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:40,960
But if you look at a lot of the things that mankind used back in the ancient days, that was all given to them.

1296
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:45,240
And, yeah, it might sound kind of crazy because you're so technologically advanced right now, right?

1297
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:50,140
But also, folks, I just want to throw a few things in here as an addendum to the dream concept.

1298
01:17:51,180 --> 01:18:01,720
Stop reading into the – when you look at things that were memorialized from a long time ago, stop reading into it all the crazy stuff that you're being told by the

1299
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:03,520
quackademic establishment.

1300
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:10,340
Like how many times – one of the things there – have you ever heard of an ice age or a bronze age or a stone age or an iron age?

1301
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:11,480
There's no such thing, folks.

1302
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:19,600
There might be an iron society or a bronze society or a stone-based society, right?

1303
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:27,500
Like, for example, now there might be some nation somewhere on the continent of Africa that doesn't have the technological stuff, right?

1304
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:31,000
Like iPhones, as prevalent as they are here, right?

1305
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,740
They might be more of a wired society instead of a wireless society.

1306
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,020
These are all parallel.

1307
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:38,480
All of these things were in parallel.

1308
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:49,100
You could read in ancient texts where a certain group had chariots made of wood and bronze, but the other society had chariots made of iron, wholly made of iron, right?

1309
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:54,060
So there's – yeah, there's no such thing as Neanderthal man or caveman.

1310
01:18:54,060 --> 01:19:03,180
This is stuff that was invented by the crazy people at Oxford and Cambridge because they wanted to get into the booming archaeological business.

1311
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:06,240
They wanted to – the academics always want to get in there.

1312
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:11,380
Like look at all the stuff that's being touted about computer technology.

1313
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:17,120
The universities kind of missed out on it other than what they developed as communications amongst themselves.

1314
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:21,020
Most of the technology that you see, by the way, is not developed in universities.

1315
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,440
It's in someone's kitchen or backyard.

1316
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:25,780
But back to the cavemen, there's no such thing.

1317
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:35,740
Neanderthal men, all those bones and things that have been played around with, the skulls and the jawbones and teeth have been reset to make it look more ape-like.

1318
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:41,080
But what you're looking at, those large skeletons that are anthropomorphic are people that lived for centuries.

1319
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:46,620
They had a lifespan that was several centuries, if not more than several centuries long, and you're being lied to.

1320
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:51,640
I'm not asking anyone to believe what's being said here, but just make a note of what's being said.

1321
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:54,380
It's not important that you believe in what we're saying.

1322
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:58,340
It's important that you make a note of what we're saying and file it away for later.

1323
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,380
That's very uncommon.

1324
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:05,520
With a good little note of thunder there from Seth.

1325
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,600
So speaking of thunder, have you got any more thunder, Seth?

1326
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:12,520
Oh, I don't know.

1327
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:30,520
I'd say that's about it on dreams without going into anything that – it's one of those things that's kind of difficult to converse on with specificity once we're talking about something that has been recorded.

1328
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:36,700
You could throw out a lot of specifics in a general fashion like a menu and see what applies.

1329
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:39,440
But let's just address one more thing.

1330
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:54,780
If you cognizantly, in your being, really mean it when you kind of bring up the desire to not have dreams, whether they're good or bad, don't fool yourself.

1331
01:20:56,240 --> 01:21:06,520
What I mean by don't fool yourself is you're going to have to get some quiet time, slow down the body because when you slow down the body, the mind gets active, and sort things out just like rearranging a sock drawer.

1332
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:06,900
Yes?

1333
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,700
It takes a little bit of time.

1334
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:18,560
And make a little bit of an effort to discover things that have been memorialized about the truth because as time goes on, you've been distracted.

1335
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:25,040
Because remember, whatever country you're living in, whatever traditions you have have not really benefited you much.

1336
01:21:26,780 --> 01:21:36,860
I think, Seth, you and I have been on various sonic experiences during the years and we had certain people touting the benefits of Egyptian science and spiritualism and Greek philosophy.

1337
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,500
And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a second.

1338
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:44,740
If all that stuff was so good and so readily accessible, how well has it served anyone?

1339
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:54,240
It seems to have served some pieces of, I don't know what, the oligarchy, the aristocracy.

1340
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,180
You got to remember the oligarchy and what the elite are, they're hands off.

1341
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:03,340
They have the pranksters as a buffer zone, you know, the guys with college degrees.

1342
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:13,260
You ever come up with a really good remedy and discuss it in public or discover a really good remedy and someone in the group will say, and where did you get your medical degree?

1343
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:17,740
You know, as if like if you don't have a medical degree, it washes everything that you say away.

1344
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:23,040
Or if you bring up anything regarding any ancient text, a biblical word, where did you get your degree in that?

1345
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:26,660
There's always the people are supporting the pranksters.

1346
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,460
You're being ruled by pranksters, right?

1347
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:33,080
Anybody who's ever been into a judicial court, you will know that it is run by pranksters.

1348
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:37,060
Anyone who's been to a doctor, a medical doctor's office, you'll know that there are pranksters.

1349
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:44,060
If you've ever been to a religious building or ceremony, you know that you're being pranked.

1350
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:45,760
It's all pranking.

1351
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:54,280
Now, typically, the people don't know that it's a prank, but if you've just visited this planet taking notes, that's the only thing that you could record it as being.

1352
01:22:54,280 --> 01:23:06,960
Because you cannot have a society functioning as it does, based on things that are based on nothing, without it being an intended prank.

1353
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:13,160
So, yeah, and it sounds very, very matter of fact, but do your own research on this.

1354
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:19,620
We have to give these reports because, well, you know, otherwise, if we don't, we'll just sound like everybody else does, heaven forbid.

1355
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:26,960
You know, searching on what news article or what kind of a guest to bring on to talk about things that don't exist.

1356
01:23:29,380 --> 01:23:36,840
So, regarding dreams, I think we've pretty much summed it up with enough specifics that can be generally picked from.

1357
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:42,440
Anything else, any other communications that you think we could publicly discuss?

1358
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:53,000
Those were the, we kind of addressed the two that were more, you know, after information than commentary, I think.

1359
01:23:53,000 --> 01:24:13,540
The one talking about the actual personages of the Meshach and the Christ, as opposed to what is traditional, as well as the idea of the Trinity, the circus, the three-ring circus.

1360
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:25,660
By the way, if you do study ancient stuff, there is a Trinity, but it's not discussed, unless it would be the creator.

1361
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:29,840
It would be the interceder of the creator, and then mankind.

1362
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:35,720
That would be a form of a Trinity, but it's not discussed because it's not, yeah.

1363
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:43,700
Yeah, and speaking about the Christ, by the way, how can we present, here's the thing, everybody shut your ears for a moment.

1364
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:45,240
Seth and I are going to have a private discussion.

1365
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:55,880
How can we present something that is not difficult to discover, but difficult to comprehend in public, that's been held overtly in secret for over 2,000 plus years?

1366
01:24:57,320 --> 01:25:02,340
You know, it's like plastered on billboards, or everyone has access to it, but no one sees it.

1367
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:05,620
And how can you discuss this? Are we the only ones that see it?

1368
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:09,500
No, there are others, but is it very few? Absolutely.

1369
01:25:10,260 --> 01:25:14,160
Are we the only ones speaking out with such precision on the matter?

1370
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:25,880
Yes, at the moment that we know of, and if anyone out there has any idea of anyone else speaking about even this specific topic with such precision, please let us know.

1371
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:38,580
I would say, being that this is a private discussion just between the two of us, I would say that the best way would be to present a simple description,

1372
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:47,600
and not necessarily a simple description that you would give to someone who has convoluted concepts of what's being discussed already,

1373
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:55,720
but as if you were describing it to someone who has no convoluted concepts of what it is already.

1374
01:25:55,820 --> 01:26:00,760
It's someone who has just read a word and is asking, what is this in reference to?

1375
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:04,980
Who is this person that's being referenced when this is being…

1376
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:13,600
So, if you were describing this personage to someone who's been on the rock for, let's say, I mean…

1377
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:15,360
Or uncorrupted.

1378
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:22,020
Yeah, someone who's uncorrupted, like what we would think of as a foreigner or an alien to this society.

1379
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:24,640
Okay, a simple way to do that is…

1380
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:33,300
They see the word, the Christ, and they ask you, so what's this? To whom is this being spoken?

1381
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:38,960
Well, what's interesting to identify the purpose, it would be like, what's the purpose of this, right?

1382
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:43,340
There was something that had to be done to be shown to mankind,

1383
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:49,520
because mankind had known that what they all have in common is that they all die, okay?

1384
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:51,340
And they're subject to death.

1385
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:56,460
And in order to show mankind that there was a promise and there was a premise

1386
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:02,960
that there will come a time where he's no longer subject to death, they had to prove it.

1387
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:11,720
Remember, the Christ only came for this sole purpose, was to prove to those who knew.

1388
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:13,980
That's why when you read the text, it's very interesting.

1389
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:17,320
It's spoken of, this was a promise to people, certain people.

1390
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:21,700
Not everyone knew this, that this would be proven out.

1391
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:27,460
And a divine being manifested in the flesh to be put to death,

1392
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:32,040
to show what happens when death is put to death as a prototype.

1393
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:34,000
It's very simple.

1394
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:37,600
That's why his identity, per se, is still secret.

1395
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:42,880
There are no imagery, iconography, or any story that even comes close in public

1396
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:48,600
to how he lived and who he was.

1397
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:51,280
And the way you get how he lived and who he was is by reading the scripture,

1398
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,340
and also historical context.

1399
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:59,120
But if you go to what you will conveniently find as religious context, all of it is false.

1400
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:00,800
Not some of it, but all of it.

1401
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:03,700
You can't even figure out what day it is.

1402
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:13,920
So we have a very interesting thing, that the Christ being a who is not as important as being a what.

1403
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:17,980
That's why he defined himself as the truth, the life, and the way.

1404
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:18,620
Those are whats.

1405
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:23,720
He had to show that these whats can be manifested.

1406
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:27,200
And his personage, who he was, is actually a secret,

1407
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:30,860
because that's secondary to the things that had to be done.

1408
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:35,660
It's kind of like, think of people that are in special forces.

1409
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:41,720
They go into a society to perform something for another society in secret.

1410
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,300
And their identities are never known.

1411
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:48,840
But the acts are actually done.

1412
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:53,900
I mean, there are special forces guys that are trained to be dropped into a society

1413
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:56,540
in their pajamas to take down the grid in 24 hours.

1414
01:28:57,780 --> 01:28:59,380
You never know who they are.

1415
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:05,540
And when you see them, you don't recognize them as that being their purpose.

1416
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:13,360
So this is basically a tough thing to discuss, even in private as we're doing right now, Seth,

1417
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,880
because it is a secret.

1418
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:17,300
But you can know a lot about the secret.

1419
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:20,600
Most of it cannot be discussed openly, even though you can know it,

1420
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:25,040
because the situation and the circumstances regarding it,

1421
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:30,900
the truth of the matter is very contrary to what is held in tradition and in the culture established.

1422
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:34,820
And what I mean by that, established all the way to the brick and mortar, right,

1423
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:40,880
and the iconography and the culture, the film, what people have on their minds.

1424
01:29:41,060 --> 01:29:42,840
You're not going to be able to go against that.

1425
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:48,940
It's kind of like having, I've had certain discussions with pretty high up people in various societies,

1426
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:50,940
legal society, religious society, and such.

1427
01:29:51,020 --> 01:29:57,040
And when I bring up certain realities that can be confirmed within their own memorialized works

1428
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:00,100
or writings, they always stop right here.

1429
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,140
And I don't want to go any further.

1430
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,160
And by the way, who are you going to tell this to?

1431
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:10,680
You know, what that means is, in other words, we've got everybody by the balls, folks.

1432
01:30:11,720 --> 01:30:15,040
Anybody figures out, no one's going to believe you anyway.

1433
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:17,960
This is the established tradition.

1434
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:18,460
We're good.

1435
01:30:18,860 --> 01:30:19,320
Go for it.

1436
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:20,160
Yeah, yeah.

1437
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,820
You think you're going to go out and tell, no one's going to hear you anyway.

1438
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:23,480
And you know what?

1439
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:23,940
They're correct.

1440
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:27,020
And by the way, this is why we do Uncommon Sense for two hours a week,

1441
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:29,980
because I assure you this is the only two hours a week you will find anywhere

1442
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:32,560
with these things discussed with such veracity and accuracy.

1443
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,600
And Seth and I have got lots of things to do.

1444
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:39,300
They're meeting here regularly every week.

1445
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:42,280
And if you think that anyone else out there is discussing these things

1446
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:47,760
and bundled up with such accuracy and just so much in two hours,

1447
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:51,020
just let us know because we'll just refer everyone who is listed,

1448
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:55,420
the four people that are listening to this Uncommon Sense radio to that.

1449
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:57,720
Give us a link.

1450
01:30:57,860 --> 01:30:58,340
Give us whatever.

1451
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:01,320
And by the way, the reason I'm bringing this up being kind of sarcastic is

1452
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,360
because I have gotten a few things like that.

1453
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:05,560
It shows me people are not listening.

1454
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:06,300
They hear things.

1455
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:06,980
They hear sounds.

1456
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,920
You know, they hear like the word the or is or was,

1457
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:12,480
and they think that we're saying that, yes, we are saying the word the.

1458
01:31:12,860 --> 01:31:17,260
But outside of that, no, there isn't anyone else discussing these things in one place like this.

1459
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:20,960
And I believe that they have to be done.

1460
01:31:21,540 --> 01:31:22,540
And we're doing it.

1461
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:32,620
So, yeah, it's very similar to maybe renaming this the show that never happened.

1462
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:36,240
And by the way, I believe this is the 15th Sonic episode we have.

1463
01:31:37,060 --> 01:31:41,520
And we said that this was going to be a limited excursion, perhaps three more.

1464
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,380
The number 18 seems to work well.

1465
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:48,780
And then maybe we'll take a pause and start another Sonic excursion,

1466
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,620
if all things are in place or willing to do so.

1467
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:58,680
But maybe the next Sonic episodic venture could be called the show that never happened,

1468
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:03,520
because this is exactly what this is.

1469
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:08,720
You're hearing things that never happened in your mind because we're discussing things,

1470
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:13,860
whether it's regarding the human body, the legal society, the religious society, life on Earth,

1471
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:21,800
all of these other things in a way that you've never seen it in the culture and tradition that you've experienced.

1472
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:27,440
So because what we're saying is not memorialized in the traditions that you're used to

1473
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:30,140
and the cultures that you're used to, it can't be.

1474
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,220
So thus, the Greek and Seth getting together and speaking on these things never really happened.

1475
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:39,740
Just don't listen to these guys or who do they think they are?

1476
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:45,980
Everything that we're discussing can be accessed by anyone if you just take a little bit of time.

1477
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:51,940
But we've also discussed you will not make friends in the matter of a family in the matter.

1478
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,260
It will tear your family apart, I assure you.

1479
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,640
And if it doesn't, you're very, very, very rare.

1480
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:01,820
You are so rare that you're up there in the astronomical odds.

1481
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:04,900
So with that said, welcome to planet Earth.

1482
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:08,340
How many times have we said that, welcome to planet Earth?

1483
01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:11,480
That means we're not addressing the people that are used to it here, right?

1484
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:18,100
So there could be people where they are, though.

1485
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:22,040
Some seem to lose sight of that every once in a while.

1486
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:27,180
Sometimes when I'm surprised, I have to tell myself, well, you are on planet Earth.

1487
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:31,940
And it's like, oh, yeah, I shouldn't be surprised by this, of course.

1488
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:33,380
Yeah, yeah.

1489
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:34,640
Here's the thing.

1490
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:43,080
The applicability of this statement is very high, by the way, that if you were sleeping wherever you were sleeping last night

1491
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:50,480
and no one came into the room where you were sleeping to tear the liver or kidney or body organ out of your body, you're fortunate.

1492
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:54,280
So if you think you've got problems, you're taking that for granted.

1493
01:33:54,280 --> 01:34:02,640
And by the way, if you had confronted them while they were there to rip your organs out of the body, the organs your body is using,

1494
01:34:02,980 --> 01:34:08,760
and you asked them why they were doing that, they'll say, we don't need any reason because I feel like it.

1495
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:11,400
And this is how it is to be on planet Earth.

1496
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:13,320
So stop taking things for granted.

1497
01:34:13,460 --> 01:34:15,080
It's a very violent place.

1498
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:22,620
And if you bear that reality in mind, you will not be taking things for granted.

1499
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:27,120
And you maybe might want to look up what voting means and what electing means.

1500
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:31,740
You might want to look at what the religious societies are thrusting on you.

1501
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:38,220
You might want to look at what the legal societies, the medical societies and the scientific societies are thrusting on you.

1502
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:42,960
Is it as bad as having a body organ ripped out of the body while you're sleeping?

1503
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:44,100
No, not as bad.

1504
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:45,540
But is it done in the same spirit?

1505
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:46,080
Absolutely.

1506
01:34:49,320 --> 01:35:01,100
It's good to know what those things are, to have a different perspective than what is commonly held when viewing such things.

1507
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:15,100
Because these societies are very much the various priesthoods that are in control of common thought, common perception currently.

1508
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:17,760
Where did you get your degree from?

1509
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:22,100
What gives you the authority to speak on such things, etc.?

1510
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:26,160
And they all have their different garb.

1511
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:27,780
Some of them wear black robes.

1512
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:29,240
Some of them wear white coats.

1513
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:35,600
Some of them wear that symbol around their necks.

1514
01:35:36,340 --> 01:35:37,440
Some wear pinstripes, right?

1515
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:39,580
Right, absolutely, pinstripes.

1516
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:42,360
Some, yeah, nice shiny shoes.

1517
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:43,560
Some are barefoot.

1518
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:50,960
But yeah, so take these things for what they are.

1519
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:59,880
And if you're not certain what they are, look at them really hard and don't believe what you're told something is.

1520
01:36:00,060 --> 01:36:01,580
Look for what it really is.

1521
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:09,540
One way to structure a functional belief is that belief should be based on something that happened if you believe in something in the past.

1522
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:12,220
Or something that you know is going to happen in the future.

1523
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:19,760
Like, for example, if you have to go to the bathroom, you believe that if you go to the bathroom, you will be in the bathroom, right?

1524
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:20,620
Right.

1525
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:22,940
That's a pretty good belief, right?

1526
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:33,620
So in other words, or another belief would be like you know that if you walk X amount of distance because you saw something on the map that was X amount of distance on the map, you will find it there, right?

1527
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:35,280
You have something to go by.

1528
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:44,260
And while you're walking to where you're going that you saw on the map, if someone asks you what you're doing, I believe I'm going to this store here that I saw on the map.

1529
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:46,780
That's a fairly good belief because others can reference it.

1530
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:47,300
And you know what?

1531
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:48,060
You're going to get there.

1532
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:52,060
But when you confront most people and say, well, that's what I believe in.

1533
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:53,060
It's good enough.

1534
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:57,840
And I don't need to research it or I don't need to know anything else about it.

1535
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,420
Now you're talking to a Muppet.

1536
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:03,880
And the difference between a Muppet and a puppet is the workmanship.

1537
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:10,500
Like a Muppet, you could pretty much go into a sock drawer, stick your arm in the sock, put a couple of buttons.

1538
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:11,920
You got a Muppet.

1539
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:15,080
Now a puppet usually requires a little more skill.

1540
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:20,600
You've seen them, you know, performed and they're usually made of wood and clay and plastics and they're animated.

1541
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:33,820
So you're really in bad shape when you run into people that are that lazy that they can be reduced to Muppet-dom or Puppet-dom.

1542
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:41,960
And this is pretty much what you're dealing with with the majority of the people on this planet when it comes to terms like belief or faith or things like that.

1543
01:37:43,420 --> 01:37:44,720
And it's really sad.

1544
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:55,960
And by the way, when we have another 15 minutes or so, when we depart from the two hours that we do here every week,

1545
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:59,660
pay attention to what you're listening to everywhere else and you will see what we're talking about.

1546
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:02,940
It comes in many varieties, many forms.

1547
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:08,860
So what else can be uncommon, Seth?

1548
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:18,340
Anything else that we could discuss perhaps from the listeners or those that have reached out to message?

1549
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:20,920
No.

1550
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:26,120
Like I said, we pretty much addressed the two that stood out in my mind particularly.

1551
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:29,760
And I think that we addressed them in an acceptable manner.

1552
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,580
Again, the dreams is a difficult one.

1553
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:41,760
We could keep plugging away at that because, by the way, folks, just to bring it up again, is that if you are having issues with dreams,

1554
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:46,340
like in other words you want them or don't want them or whatever, you want to deal with them, it's not that easy.

1555
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:50,140
It's going to take a bunch of work to deal with it.

1556
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:58,240
But I think what we've discussed in the recap would be study what the truth is about the dreams and what you want to do with fortitude.

1557
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:02,920
Put some strength behind it spiritually, meaning with the mind, and you will see the change.

1558
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:09,400
It doesn't mean that they may not come after you because these critters, these spiritual beings are just as different as people.

1559
01:39:11,020 --> 01:39:17,120
Like, for example, you could be traveling along the road minding your own business and you're stalked by a car with flashing lights

1560
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:23,800
and they want to kill you or give you all kinds of things and show up in front of a court with a priest with a black robe and all this.

1561
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:31,860
Or the same person, another person could be going down the road and a stalker with flashing lights comes up to him and says,

1562
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:34,060
Oh, just be careful next time. Have a nice day.

1563
01:39:35,300 --> 01:39:38,740
You don't know what these situations, there's no consistency.

1564
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:48,760
But what is consistent is basically the framework that we gave that you are being plugged by outsiders, outside other spirits other than your own.

1565
01:39:50,950 --> 01:39:51,990
I think that enough.

1566
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:55,090
The knowledge of it, you know, how does it go?

1567
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:58,050
The avoidance of a trap is knowledge of its existence.

1568
01:39:58,830 --> 01:40:04,350
Now, if dreams, whether they be good or bad or trappings, that is up to the individual to decide.

1569
01:40:04,910 --> 01:40:13,260
Because we, again, preface that most societies on the pagan side or the nation, how would you, again, please define pagan or paganism for us?

1570
01:40:15,870 --> 01:40:16,950
The uninformed.

1571
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:21,490
That's a very accurate single word.

1572
01:40:21,690 --> 01:40:22,630
That's another word.

1573
01:40:22,690 --> 01:40:23,650
It's just the uninformed.

1574
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:29,490
And by the way, like I mentioned earlier, there are quite a few people coming out these days, meaning past few years.

1575
01:40:29,670 --> 01:40:34,050
They're quite proud of being that in a way, which is fine, by the way.

1576
01:40:34,370 --> 01:40:40,130
I'm not certain they're aware of what the word that they're using means.

1577
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:42,750
But that's, you know, shouldn't be surprising, I suppose.

1578
01:40:43,630 --> 01:40:43,930
Yeah.

1579
01:40:44,130 --> 01:40:44,570
Right.

1580
01:40:44,610 --> 01:40:45,050
Exactly.

1581
01:40:45,190 --> 01:40:45,930
It's just, yeah.

1582
01:40:46,450 --> 01:40:48,030
I just find it amusing.

1583
01:40:48,190 --> 01:40:51,170
I mean, you might want to call it part of the personal entertainment.

1584
01:40:51,830 --> 01:40:52,270
Right?

1585
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:53,730
I guess.

1586
01:40:55,830 --> 01:41:05,450
Years ago it was, you know, maybe some soft shoe tap dance, maybe somebody juggling on a street corner, you know, maybe a card trick here or there, someone telling a good joke.

1587
01:41:05,530 --> 01:41:08,410
Now the best entertainment I get is people calling themselves pagans.

1588
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:09,130
But anyway.

1589
01:41:11,670 --> 01:41:14,290
So it's, yeah, it's just beyond belief.

1590
01:41:14,490 --> 01:41:16,010
But, yeah, if you – yeah.

1591
01:41:16,150 --> 01:41:16,730
So anyway.

1592
01:41:18,710 --> 01:41:19,990
So, yeah, that's the thing.

1593
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:23,950
Oh, the other thing I wanted to bring up perhaps in passing, just got into the mind.

1594
01:41:24,650 --> 01:41:49,050
You ever notice that when there are social changes, typically things that are considered abominable, deviant, or unlawful, when they're established and integrated into society, those that don't agree with their establishment in society are known to be phobic of that particular existence or condition.

1595
01:41:49,050 --> 01:41:49,930
You ever notice that?

1596
01:41:51,410 --> 01:41:57,850
Like, for example, I'll bring up – there's something called – if you are speaking – I'm not – this is just a general comment.

1597
01:41:57,950 --> 01:42:05,710
I've been seeing this a lot, the LGBTQ, RSTUV, whatever community stuff that's being thrusted in society right now, right?

1598
01:42:06,470 --> 01:42:15,350
If you are speaking out against it, those that are either indifferent or for it call you a homophobe, right?

1599
01:42:15,470 --> 01:42:18,670
Like you're afraid of it or something, right?

1600
01:42:18,670 --> 01:42:21,290
Like an arachnophobe, right?

1601
01:42:21,790 --> 01:42:25,330
So if you don't want spiders in the house, you're arachnophobic.

1602
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:32,230
Phobic, by the way, folks, means fear or phobia, to be afraid of.

1603
01:42:33,430 --> 01:42:35,350
Can we get a definition on phobia, by the way?

1604
01:42:35,410 --> 01:42:38,010
It's P-H-O-B-I-A.

1605
01:42:38,430 --> 01:42:40,950
How about agnostophobia, fear of the unknown?

1606
01:42:41,870 --> 01:42:43,650
But, you know, be careful, folks.

1607
01:42:43,770 --> 01:42:53,610
Watch what's being thrusted on the moronic society, that when there tends to be a disagreement with a certain agenda, you're phobic now of it.

1608
01:42:53,870 --> 01:42:59,990
So that means that there is no rational conveyance or rational thought or discussion.

1609
01:42:59,990 --> 01:43:13,090
You're branded as a phobe or fear because you don't feel or understand or want to rationalize the acceptance of a certain group or action.

1610
01:43:14,050 --> 01:43:15,910
It's because you're afraid of it.

1611
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:22,070
There is no more rational discussion of the matter, whether it's lawful or whether it's moral or proper.

1612
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:24,130
You're just strictly phobic.

1613
01:43:24,910 --> 01:43:26,010
Watch out for this stuff.

1614
01:43:26,010 --> 01:43:29,930
This is very interesting, and people kind of go along with it.

1615
01:43:30,190 --> 01:43:42,390
It's kind of interesting to see how the word phobia is being thrust on those that are looking to engage into some kind of a rational discourse regarding a subject.

1616
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:46,290
And if it immediately is contrary to that subject, you're a phobic.

1617
01:43:47,410 --> 01:43:48,130
It's very interesting.

1618
01:43:48,550 --> 01:43:51,850
I just, yeah, it's an abandonment of rationale here.

1619
01:43:52,690 --> 01:43:59,230
And they're very quick to brand, just like if you bring up a notion that is part of a particular society, they ask you if you have a degree.

1620
01:44:00,130 --> 01:44:02,130
Otherwise, you have no business speaking on it.

1621
01:44:02,190 --> 01:44:05,610
It's like the hijacking of rational discourse.

1622
01:44:08,050 --> 01:44:10,170
But anything else on the word phobia?

1623
01:44:11,950 --> 01:44:28,070
Directly from Greek, panic, fear of, from phobos, which is simply fear, became widespread popular use with native words from about 1800.

1624
01:44:29,470 --> 01:44:31,290
Phobic, being related.

1625
01:44:33,290 --> 01:44:35,790
Irrational fear, horror, or aversion.

1626
01:44:38,330 --> 01:44:50,370
So how do they – I don't understand the homophobic thing, because here comes a very feminine guy wearing lipstick and a purse and high heels with a hairy chest and a beard, and he's acting like a woman down the street.

1627
01:44:50,870 --> 01:44:51,810
Everybody run!

1628
01:44:51,950 --> 01:44:53,490
We're total fear of him.

1629
01:44:54,550 --> 01:44:55,810
Does that make any sense?

1630
01:44:57,590 --> 01:44:58,090
No.

1631
01:44:58,090 --> 01:45:00,370
That doesn't make any sense to me.

1632
01:45:00,790 --> 01:45:04,750
But that's what's being thrust as the label.

1633
01:45:06,410 --> 01:45:16,210
I don't understand – well, this is what I do understand, is that the prevention of rational discussion is paramount.

1634
01:45:17,950 --> 01:45:20,910
It's got to be what group – what do you believe in?

1635
01:45:21,850 --> 01:45:23,150
Hey, what's your political view?

1636
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:24,250
Hey, how about the Mets?

1637
01:45:24,270 --> 01:45:25,250
How about the Yankees?

1638
01:45:26,150 --> 01:45:33,950
If it's anything outside of that, wow, man, you've got to be thrust into a category of something that is not even relevant.

1639
01:45:34,490 --> 01:45:36,270
How can there be rational discussion?

1640
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:39,710
It's almost to be avoided.

1641
01:45:41,230 --> 01:45:47,670
And, of course, if you've just come to this planet and you've been here for 14 minutes, maybe in the next minute you'll figure that out.

1642
01:45:47,690 --> 01:45:48,990
That's what's going on here, folks.

1643
01:45:48,990 --> 01:45:59,710
And for the four or five listeners that we have, they pretty much tune in to hear or listen to what's being said here as well to maybe garner something,

1644
01:46:00,410 --> 01:46:05,070
so they can see that there's very little rationalization of anything going on.

1645
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:07,350
But, yeah, I just wanted to bring that up.

1646
01:46:07,390 --> 01:46:08,650
Thank you, Seth, for looking that up.

1647
01:46:09,190 --> 01:46:15,970
Just keep in mind, folks, any kind of agenda that's thrust onto you, and immediately if you're not – if you're looking to look at it more rationally,

1648
01:46:15,970 --> 01:46:16,830
you're considered a phobe.

1649
01:46:18,210 --> 01:46:23,450
Let's just add that to the list of ridiculous things that are being done here on this planet.

1650
01:46:25,090 --> 01:46:36,570
There's an interesting list of the various words commonly used using the word-forming element phobia at the end of them.

1651
01:46:38,690 --> 01:46:41,090
Philophobia is an interesting one.

1652
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:43,970
Okay, fear of friends.

1653
01:46:46,630 --> 01:46:47,430
Or plants.

1654
01:46:48,630 --> 01:46:50,510
Feto would be plants, yeah.

1655
01:46:53,610 --> 01:46:54,010
Agnostophobia.

1656
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:56,830
Is that one there, agnostophobia?

1657
01:46:57,810 --> 01:46:59,550
Because if you know a little bit – yeah.

1658
01:46:59,690 --> 01:47:03,570
Yeah, it's a word-forming element, so essentially you can add it to another word.

1659
01:47:04,010 --> 01:47:06,050
Yes, you can make these up all day.

1660
01:47:06,390 --> 01:47:07,170
Yeah, absolutely.

1661
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:09,530
Can I list a Greek prefix?

1662
01:47:10,630 --> 01:47:11,290
Say that again?

1663
01:47:13,450 --> 01:47:14,170
Triskaidekopphobia.

1664
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:16,370
You're the number 13.

1665
01:47:17,370 --> 01:47:17,890
Oh, okay.

1666
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:26,410
That one comes from Trice and Deka, three and ten.

1667
01:47:27,870 --> 01:47:29,050
Yeah, and phobia.

1668
01:47:31,170 --> 01:47:31,890
Phonophobia.

1669
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:40,450
Probably not going to speak to many phonophobes through the radio, but phono being sound.

1670
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:42,570
Yeah, anything else that's unusual.

1671
01:47:46,900 --> 01:47:49,220
Absolutely. There's a lot of fears out there.

1672
01:47:49,420 --> 01:47:53,860
How about aletheophobia, which is fear of the truth?

1673
01:47:54,040 --> 01:48:01,700
Yeah, alethe meaning truth in Greek, or emet in Hebrew, or truth in English,

1674
01:48:02,460 --> 01:48:05,560
or cierto or verdad in Latin or Spanish, right?

1675
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:06,920
Veritas.

1676
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:13,720
So, yeah, I think fear of the truth is – people hate the truth, by the way,

1677
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:15,500
and yes, if you're listening and you hate the truth,

1678
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:17,860
it's going to make you feel very uncomfortable to hear that.

1679
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:22,580
You know, I think I mentioned – by the way, Seth, I was recently in a conversation

1680
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:25,800
with someone who got all heated and saying that,

1681
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:29,960
I don't get any knowledge from a book, I get it from experience,

1682
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:35,160
and I just love to hear stuff like that because it just confirms why we do this show.

1683
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:41,780
Speaking of doing this show, I guess we're going to call it two hours or so,

1684
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,460
and Seth, thanks for coming and listening.

1685
01:48:44,460 --> 01:48:50,840
Yeah, again, thanks for the slight tardiness, but yeah, we'll be back doing it again next week.
