1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Yes, welcome to yourself as well everyone and Seth and

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,880
Doing okay still on this rock with everybody else and we're here again. Hopefully as promised to give you a dummy load free

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,220
two hours

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,480
It's been about a week as they call it and speaking of a week. I'm reckoning the

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,640
Third week of the fifth month lawful timekeeping and I know there's maybe four people out there that know what we're talking about

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,600
That's all that's needed. Perhaps it'd be five

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,960
Everyone else is kind of like wondering what these guys are speaking about

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,120
How come they're not talking about all this other stuff that everyone else is

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,560
In so on and so forth. Well, yeah

10
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:45,840
Maybe that's why it's called uncommon sense because maybe any sense at all or good sense is uncommon

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,760
Don't you think?

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,480
absolutely

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:56,760
Yeah, and and you know, I think this is roughly according to archives perhaps of 13th or 14th

14
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,560
Episodic sonic experience and

15
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,360
all these things are limited try to keep them limited as

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,740
Presentation can go, you know Seth. I was thinking a little bit this week. It's like why bother right?

17
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,700
There's many there's many

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,980
Attachments one can look at attachments being you know, what one perceives and it's like why bother have you have you been well

19
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,780
Let me just ask this again to everyone you guys listening to what's going on out there

20
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,260
I mean in all media whether it's I don't hunt many people don't do print

21
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,640
Most of it is digital, especially if you're listening to us right now. You're probably

22
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,580
Getting a lot of your stuff on what's called the computer digital format. But so let's just maybe discuss that. I

23
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,440
Just find it to be astoundingly ridiculous. I mean

24
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,400
There's it's just there's nothing to really grab on to it seems like things are just being thrown around

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,460
there's no merit to what's being said and

26
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,140
On and on. I mean, I don't know. Do you want to just touch on that for a moment?

27
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,520
Why do you think the?

28
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,100
Forget about what we think what can be observed?

29
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,460
You know, what can be observed about what's called media?

30
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:15,740
Let's let's just limit it down to the Internet. I mean, you've got some major and minor Internet radio stations

31
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,760
You've got websites that give what's called the news

32
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,700
Got lots of people doing various interactions social media

33
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,720
What have you and it all just seems like a big load of crap

34
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:34,080
I mean look if you're a flower or whatever, you know, you need that stuff. That's what makes flowers grow

35
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,300
crap rain and sunshine, but I wish sometimes that enough rain and sunshine would come in to wash the crap off the Internet, but

36
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,840
Anyway, that's not like a little mini rant perhaps to start off

37
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:54,060
So, yeah, well we are being subjected currently I mean in any more it's it's very overt the

38
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,620
You can look at it as social conditioning

39
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:03,160
But if we're looking at the Internet in particular or any sort of broadcast media in particular, we're looking at

40
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,780
You know

41
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:12,620
Programs essentially and you know, what's it? What's a program if you look at our interaction with the existence around us?

42
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,880
It be that you know electronic or

43
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,120
more more overtly physical

44
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,120
We're simply running programs through our operating system. Yeah

45
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:31,720
Programs and the programs that are offered anywhere and anywhere. I don't even have to pick on anything

46
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,500
Everywhere across the board. They're just of a very low quality low

47
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,680
You know low effectiveness rate it's not

48
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,960
It's certainly not proper most of it is completely and totally baseless

49
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,620
And the basis that they do provide for things if you actually go and follow

50
00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:03,480
Follow the the web to the center. It's there's nothing there. It's all it's all baseless. So we are observing the effects of

51
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:11,020
Not poor information distribution but distribution of poor information and poor quality and poor

52
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,040
Yeah, yeah, it's it's

53
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,560
You know, we've discussed and let's just say it again for those who are hearing maybe you're listening this time

54
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:26,060
the what you're experiencing with electronic media aka the Internet and all all the things that encompass that is

55
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:32,400
There's a divine influence behind it, by the way, and it's a beta test for

56
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,260
Something that's going to be necessary

57
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,560
in the future and that's pretty obvious to see

58
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,120
Because I mean look at what's going on out there

59
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,080
I mean, it's really piss-poor, but then again, how can you expect it?

60
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,440
Let's put the Internet aside

61
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,760
If you walk out the door and walk down the street and in start interacting with your average surface-dwelling earth inhabitant

62
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,220
Let's just discuss that for a minute what comes out of their mouths. What do you think is going on between their ears?

63
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,840
Piss-poor quality again. So of course it's going to somehow end up

64
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,340
in this form of communication. I

65
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,700
Think it's just what you know garbage in garbage out

66
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,400
So again, you know at one point it's like why bother? Well, you know, why bother Seth?

67
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,300
Do you think the you know, we kind of jokingly say there we have about four or five listeners, right?

68
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,000
And and you know, it's yeah, you know, yeah, I get some messages. Yeah Greek you have more than four or five

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,740
Yeah, but you know, there's I mean, there's a lot of people hearing this but are they listening, you know?

70
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,940
Are they really listening what to what's being said, you know?

71
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,860
so I but you know from that perspective, I think that getting together for two hours a week and

72
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:49,680
Revealing things that might be considered secrets that have been held for thousands of years that are secreted in open plain sight

73
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:56,940
Discussing them on this minor internet radio venue for two hours a week. It's actually not a bad cause

74
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,480
You know

75
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,460
Yeah

76
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:08,120
Yeah, that's it's one of the more worthwhile things that I am doing with my time certainly

77
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,440
Then mainly because most of what I do with my time is

78
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,380
You know go to work and complete jobs for a company

79
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,320
Right literally jobs. Yeah

80
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,680
Basically, but yes, I don't write much down but

81
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,300
Yeah, yeah, so yeah with that said, you know, there's a couple of topics

82
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:34,660
we of course, we'd like to a couple of topics we could get into today and also there's a we like to

83
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:41,760
Communicate overtly and anonymously with people that message us. I think it helps the the the entire mindset of

84
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:49,480
ourselves and the the audience very often if we respond back personally, which I stopped doing I prefer to pretty much

85
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,200
Do it on on air

86
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,500
So it's not this little private thing because if it continues to be let's say private communications

87
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:04,800
Answering things. Let's say or attempting to answering things. I think it's going to lean into jokingly what I call billable hours. So

88
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,240
In that case, let's just keep the thing open and free and just discuss certain things anonymously

89
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,340
and

90
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,000
Openly, but yeah that that topic

91
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:18,980
of

92
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:26,020
Being topical, you know what what to discuss the thing also by the way speaking of information, you know

93
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,820
We we don't have guests. It's basically the Greek and Seth discussing because I don't know who we'd have a get as a guest

94
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:37,200
I think anyone that I found interesting or actually brought some really good stuff

95
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:44,020
Imparted to human society was dead. I think most of the people that are worth listening to have died. They're gone

96
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,040
and

97
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,540
That's the funny thing too and believe it or not when I most of this

98
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:55,720
Media is formatted a meet mainstream and alternative on you have a host with guests and it's like

99
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:02,080
Yeah, it's just a show. It's it's like the dog and the pony or the pony and the dog

100
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,000
I haven't found anything really to be

101
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,060
Worth listening to and I know that might sound like harsh criticism

102
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,180
Why is he saying that but I think I'm speaking out for most of the people as well

103
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,340
There's just nothing going on anywhere at all and I mean anywhere so

104
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,460
Yeah, it's just

105
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,200
It's entertainment. Yeah, and when you press a lot of the people in

106
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:33,740
Mainstream media and alternative media about like it dude. Why are you saying this? You know, it's like, you know, it's not true

107
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,520
You know the person that you've got as a guest is a moron. Oh, but you know, it's entertainment

108
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:46,620
But but when they're coming on they're doing whatever they're doing it's like that it's packaged as if it's you know, I actually go to

109
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,100
Well, I used to look at a lot of the chat groups

110
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,080
Just to see what kind of feedback, you know, because you want to look at the audience, you know very often

111
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,800
You know if you go to a performance

112
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,880
Whether it's a film or play music

113
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,820
Everyone's always focusing on what's going on the stage. I like to turn around and look at the what the audience is doing

114
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,780
That's where the real interest that shows you what the interaction is, right?

115
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,500
It's it's interesting. I like to put the camera on the on the audience while the show is going on

116
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,480
You know, it's like they used to back in the day

117
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,700
We remember in the older films when they go in the film

118
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,420
They put the camera on the audience and the two people having dialogue

119
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:30,640
But you know what I've noticed is a lot of these shows they have chats and listening to the show

120
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,860
I'm like, okay. This is definitely you know, this is why we do the show and rant about how bad the Internet is

121
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,820
And I'm just gonna make a comment here

122
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:45,200
Which is a comment on a comment and very often I see people posting in great show and I'm like great show shit

123
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,080
I'd hate to see what a crappy show

124
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:55,420
What do you mean great show I mean, so so it's basically the accommodation factor here, I mean are the people just

125
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:04,420
Have they lost it? I mean, I don't know. Yeah, I mean actually I do know that's why we we discuss and rant about it

126
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,340
Yeah

127
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:08,880
Yeah

128
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,820
All right. So what do you think Seth? Um, you know one of the there's a few topics. I just want to throw in

129
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,260
We don't well, we don't really discuss what they call the news

130
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,920
But I don't know if this is true piped or whatever, but you know, I haven't really looked at any deeper

131
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,480
But so I throw this in there's some some blurbs coming out today about

132
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,640
American dip Americans

133
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,860
Expelling Russian diplomats and vice versa Russians expelling American diplomats

134
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,600
Isn't this what Pete the disaster that people have been waiting for since the 50s?

135
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:42,900
You know, maybe they'll have an international incident start killing each other. Isn't that what people want?

136
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:49,020
I mean look at look at the literature the film and the video games and the mindset and all this and

137
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:55,740
Isn't this what happens when you put a lot of stupid people together just bad things happen or

138
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,380
They call it bad, but they love it

139
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:04,640
Yeah, they didn't they wouldn't make video games and movies and stuff about war death and destruction. I

140
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,620
Don't know. I just it's not gonna happen. By the way, you know, there isn't gonna be

141
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,600
Mass level of mayhem if the Russians and the Americans go to war

142
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,700
Okay, you know occasionally a war here a war there. It's a theater

143
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,280
So but but anyway, it's just interesting

144
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,060
I had to bring it up because you don't see things like that in passing too much

145
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,720
You know the Russians expelling American diplomats and vice versa

146
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,640
You know, but don't get your hopes up too high got a lot of things that are going to be happening in the future and got

147
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,440
nothing to do with

148
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:35,900
ww3

149
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,380
You know, right

150
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,720
Sounds like World Federation, you know wrestling. What's that play wrestling what acting whatever?

151
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,140
Yeah

152
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,940
One of the things Seth this is just kind of bouncing around is you know how we bring up in passing

153
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,100
the weather

154
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,000
You know, I know I'm kind of hitting you with this

155
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,860
On a bridged or I just actually non prefaced and we kind of say jokingly. I think it was

156
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,030
Samuel Clemens Mark Twain who said everyone's talking about the weather. When is someone going to do something about it and

157
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,480
I

158
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,190
want to play a short audio we've been getting into playing little audios here and there and

159
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,240
What I'm thinking of doing

160
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,400
Is an homage or honor someone?

161
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,960
His name is Trevor James constable folks

162
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,880
Another man you might want to be

163
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,560
Familiar with is

164
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,040
Wilhelm Reich or Wilhelm Reich now, I

165
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,820
know if some people listening might have heard of this these people already and have been

166
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:52,520
Keyboard warriors and they end up looking at all the crap online about it everything from

167
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:54,760
Ether

168
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,920
Which is not crap by the way, but just the way it's explained all the way to these little

169
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,260
things called organite where they they mix

170
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,540
I'm just jumping here around

171
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:10,500
Resins with metals and people swear how well it works and all that and kind of that's not what we're talking about

172
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,560
and I'm gonna maybe play a short audio clips about three minutes and

173
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,920
This was an audio clip from a tape that was done in the early 90s where Trevor was going around to Oh

174
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,320
Heads of state it was an introductory

175
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,200
introductory videotape on how to

176
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,660
Let's say do weather engineering and by the way

177
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:39,060
No one what you're when you're doing weather engineering or someone like Trevor or Wilhelm Reich and such. They're not making the weather

178
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,540
They're creating the conditions that allow for certain weather

179
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,280
patterns and events to occur

180
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,280
It's dealing with primary. So what do you think Seth? I want to display this. I don't think this is on the Internet

181
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,520
this is a discussion on primary energy and

182
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,240
I have possession of it. I have it in digital format and I'm just gonna play the first three minutes

183
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,840
Which is an introduction that Trevor gave to people who were perhaps interested in alleviating drought and things

184
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,440
What do you think I should just go for it for about three minutes go for it. Absolutely. Okay

185
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,280
There's a lot of talk about

186
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,300
Weather, so here we go. We're gonna cue this thing up and we'll see here in just a few seconds

187
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,210
Okay

188
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:35,750
The World Meteorological Organization the WMO

189
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,730
Published these two massive volumes

190
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:46,050
Subsequent to their conference held at Honolulu, Hawaii

191
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,630
In August of 1985 there's almost

192
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,930
700 pages here a

193
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,670
monumental academic labor of

194
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,690
the subject of weather modification

195
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,470
the weight of

196
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:05,030
Their scholarship is enough to terrorize anyone

197
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,190
anyone that is

198
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,410
Except me

199
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:24,380
Heavy reading my name is Trevor James Constable

200
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,560
And I have been in weather modification for about 17 years

201
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:37,660
But you will not find any paper of mine on that subject in that compendium

202
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,860
that I just pitched on the deck and

203
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,520
There's a good reason for that

204
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,980
My approach to the subject is unorthodox. I

205
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,960
Do not follow

206
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,640
recognized rules

207
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,820
Nor wholly except orthodox concepts

208
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:04,170
Now the kindest thing that orthodoxy might say about me is that I'm one of those guys that's

209
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,000
Way out there in left field

210
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:14,740
Out where there are a lot of loose things lying around that nobody has bothered to investigate

211
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:22,040
They couldn't get any money to investigate it or the local professor was against investigating it

212
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,680
There's all kinds of things like this

213
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,960
in the borderland of nature

214
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,600
Where I have been rummaging around

215
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,740
for the past 30 years or so I

216
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,760
carry out weather modification

217
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,940
via the ether

218
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,120
E-T-H-E-R and

219
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:49,620
That is certainly not a concept that is accepted by orthodox science

220
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,520
Nevertheless

221
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,880
With my associates I have hurdled over all the theoretical controversies in

222
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:05,920
Gone to work and technically accessed the ether and I'm going to show you on this tape

223
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,960
that it can be used to

224
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,520
control and

225
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,960
engineer the weather

226
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,280
Now since I am working so far from recognized and established principles

227
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,520
I'm going to ask you to sail along with me for the next hour or so

228
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,560
with three basic new assumptions and

229
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,540
With the aid of these three new assumptions, you'll be able to see for yourself

230
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,440
How these things work even if you do not fully understand them

231
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,520
All right. Here are the three assumptions that you need to make

232
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,520
Number one

233
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,860
There is a primordial mass free energy

234
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,800
That underlies the atmosphere in all its workings

235
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,400
Number two

236
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,860
That ether is technically accessible

237
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,820
with the aid of simple

238
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,200
juxtaposed

239
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,740
geometric forms

240
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,080
These are for the most part

241
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:22,140
Cylinders and cones and you're going to see these translators right here on the tape

242
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,300
Number three

243
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,440
I want you to assume

244
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,160
That the ether is like the ocean

245
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,700
It has tides

246
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,940
flows

247
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,060
that are specific to

248
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,080
latitude season and other factors and

249
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,720
That we attain weather modification by opposing

250
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,760
Our translators to the tide or ether flow

251
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,700
Now you aren't going to see the ether on this tape

252
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,880
What you are going to see is

253
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,500
the reactions of the ether

254
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,540
Translated into the atmosphere

255
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,820
into the realm of ponderable

256
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,340
Objectifiable

257
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,720
meteorological happenings

258
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,140
You are going to see these events take place from zero

259
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,100
We aren't going to do it just once

260
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,680
Give you a flittering glimpse or anything like that. We are going to do it repeatedly

261
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,940
Press down and running over

262
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,540
then at the end of the tape

263
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:36,760
You

264
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,120
Will be able to judge

265
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,360
Whether or not there is an ether you

266
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,500
Will be able to judge whether or not it is technically usable

267
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,140
For the purposes of weather engineering and weather control

268
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:02,580
You will know these things and be able to judge of them because you will have seen them happen

269
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:08,820
Now that's all the theory that I'm going to give you before I take you to sea

270
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,860
Along the way, I'll be able to fill in a lot more of how all this is done

271
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:21,620
Without of course giving away the central commercial secrets, which are invaluable

272
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:29,120
Let's go now aboard an ocean-going ship of the United States merchant marine as

273
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,060
she plies her trade route in the North Pacific and

274
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,400
one more thing

275
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,740
Whether you're a scientist watching this

276
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,780
Or just a plain intelligent lay person

277
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:55,790
Conceptually and perhaps emotionally you're really going on a trip. Let's go to sea now

278
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,190
Okay

279
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:07,010
That's from Trevor he's he passed away recently a few months ago, so I figured I'd just play that

280
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,850
Now that he's gone

281
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,210
Maybe some other people might want to look at his work

282
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,630
So, what do you think? What do you think Seth? What do you think about that?

283
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:23,930
I would like to use a piece of that clip actually for

284
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,950
the intro into a

285
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:32,330
Song that's that right there. That's information. You're not going to find being shared

286
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,910
on the internet anywhere

287
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,470
No, it's

288
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,550
Relatively it can't there are bits and pieces

289
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:41,730
that

290
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:45,550
You can find where it's it's talked about

291
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:46,570
but

292
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,130
yeah, that's

293
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:54,250
I'm glad that you had that one pulled up to play. I think that's probably my favorite clip that you've played so far

294
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:58,010
Good. I'm gonna pull up something that's more objective

295
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:02,490
There was a and by the way folks when you start looking online about all this stuff

296
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:08,030
We're not talking about organite or cloud busters and things like that. This is something different

297
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,850
along those principles and

298
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,950
you'll find a lot of stuff about organite and

299
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,510
Just listen to the people pushing that stuff

300
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,850
wholeheartedly in the yeah, just

301
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:27,250
There's no it doesn't translate much and I'm going to play an objective video of what can be done

302
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:35,930
In this kit, by the way, this cannot be done by getting a cupcake mold and pouring epoxy and metal filings in it with crystals

303
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,330
So I'm gonna play something

304
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,130
Here and just just for the mind a little bit

305
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:47,790
To show you what capacity there's nothing to do with harp and all that other ridiculous stuff people screaming about

306
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:52,790
All these things and but anyway, we'll just play something else here

307
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,890
this is from a

308
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:58,090
few years ago from Dutch Dutch sense

309
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:05,650
Everybody Dutch sense here 10 o'clock p.m. Central Time on Friday, October 25th

310
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,950
2013 and

311
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,550
I've got you over here on my website

312
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,890
We had an earthquake today

313
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:17,530
7.0 move it forward a little bit and I'm gonna go ahead and show you where the earthquake occurred to do that

314
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,990
Let me turn off the rings on this

315
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,050
And we'll zoom in

316
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:30,350
And here's our 7.2 magnitude earthquake off the eastern shores of Japan and it started out as 7.6

317
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:34,710
Now downgraded to a 7.2. Okay, listen up now over on my website

318
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:39,050
I've been keeping track of the tropical storm situation and hurricane situation this past week

319
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:40,310
now

320
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:48,770
Take you over and show you the current tropical storms. You're gonna see two that are blatantly missing that were there last night

321
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:52,210
And they're now gone. Okay, what did he just say?

322
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,810
I'm gonna play that back just for a second here

323
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:56,970
to

324
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,890
Tropical storms super typhoons. Okay that were there the night before and now are gone

325
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,270
Okay, I'm just gonna play that just for one second here just for the

326
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,730
This is not done with little cupcake molds and metal filings folks

327
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:16,770
Tropical storms, you're gonna see two that are blatantly missing that were there last night and they're now gone

328
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,210
And that was typhoon. Lekima

329
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,690
category three and

330
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:25,030
Tropical storm Francisco off the eastern shores of Japan

331
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:29,250
Now, let me go ahead and show this to you. Okay. All right, so

332
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:34,790
You know, I just wanted to bring that up about the weather it's got nothing to do with harp and chemtrails and all this other

333
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,130
stuff and

334
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,410
There's interest about it

335
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,570
somewhat in the world, but again, it's

336
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:48,070
Misdirection disinfo and if you think you're gonna go ahead and get some cupcake molds and pour some resin

337
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:54,890
With metal filings and do anything like that. You're dreaming. So anyway, we discuss what dreams are about also

338
00:24:54,890 --> 00:25:00,250
So I just want to throw in a couple of things like that in a rant ish us kind of way that we do things

339
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:05,690
Here, but I just wanted to bring in a few things about the weather plenty of stuff people to bite on and by the way

340
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:13,250
I just want to digress for a moment back to Wilhelm Reisch and Wilhelm Reich a lot of people use that pronunciation potato potato

341
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,330
He got into the atmospheric work

342
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:20,090
after he discovered something called bionds, which is

343
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:27,890
Materials that are supposedly inert that when sterilized and under the most strict conditions

344
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:32,770
Started to emit living creatures. Yes, and he thought he could

345
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:35,250
contain them and

346
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,910
Maybe change the conditions and see if they still happen

347
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:42,690
So he put it in a Faraday cage, which was wrapped with metal and he noticed that when he did that

348
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:45,590
experiment under a Faraday cage the

349
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:50,550
Activity increased and he noticed that if you did layers of metal and nonmetal

350
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,870
Known as what he called an orgone box or an orgone accumulator

351
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:01,390
He noticed that certain events in the natural world were amplified

352
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,130
and then one day

353
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,230
being out on the property in northern Maine or

354
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:12,610
The inmate let's say with the state of Maine in America. He noticed that during a construction

355
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:14,470
Project he

356
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:18,230
noticed that pipes and water would affect the atmosphere and

357
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:23,090
Gradually associated that with the biological experiments tied it all together

358
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:29,910
But the problem with Wilhelm Reich and others it will have right met a terrible demise just like others

359
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:37,350
He had started to profess that this form of observation or science is needed to be advanced to what?

360
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:42,010
Make the world a better place folks if you've got something that is good

361
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,190
Just do it. You can discuss it

362
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,570
But the moment you start saying we have to do this to make the world a better place

363
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:52,450
You're going to be put between the hammer and the anvil. So just avoid those terms

364
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:55,170
So anyway

365
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:02,130
Just to go on so we'll digress from the weather a little bit. Just wanted to throw a couple of evidentiary

366
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:10,670
little clips in there and just to maybe I think it'll confuse a lot of people because when they go and

367
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:15,450
Become keyboard warriors and start researching what we just discussed. They're not going to find

368
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:20,310
What we just discussed in the direction that we discussed it in

369
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,730
You're going to be thrown off with

370
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,070
You know

371
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:31,890
various discussions and websites everything from making cupcake molds with metal shavings all the way to

372
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,150
putting metal tubes and water and

373
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,150
As yes

374
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,510
Yeah, anyway, so let's be objective

375
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,990
There's more to this than meets the eye. There's definitely more than what you were

376
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:51,530
Discovering on cursor research is on the internet and the weather is not empirical. It's ephemeral meaning it can be changed

377
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:53,290
and

378
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,170
That's my story and I'm sticking to it

379
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,590
All right, so let's digress from this for a minute Seth. What do you think?

380
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:05,930
What else should we get into that was kind of like a opening its topic and I'm just closing it or walking away from it

381
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,350
Again, what do you think?

382
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,650
Yeah, absolutely, we've got some interesting things in

383
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,890
chat as well off topic a little bit and

384
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:22,490
You mentioned a couple of the emails as well that we can get into. Yeah. Yeah, I've got I've got some here

385
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:28,510
What say you I mean in terms of grabbing on to the next thing here. Do you would you like to?

386
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:33,710
You want to go more at the matter at hand, which perhaps is the chat

387
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,610
Let me see if I can as the AFR chat perhaps

388
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:42,790
Anything pertinent or is it dribble? Oh, we can we can go anywhere. I'm always

389
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:50,730
You know willing to listen about the weather as well because it's as you as you said, you know

390
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,730
One's always talking about it

391
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:58,990
When someone gonna do something about it, I think that's Samuel Clement, right? Yeah. Yeah, I believe so

392
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,130
Yeah

393
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,590
Yeah, yeah, there's just no information

394
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,330
there is a again just to kind of

395
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,390
Mall about a little bit more. I mean, so maybe you know might have said we walk away from it

396
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,290
Excuse me. There's a

397
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:19,310
Lot of discussion, of course, it's in the typical mindset again about

398
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:20,910
geoengineering

399
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:26,770
Now whether they have I don't know who these people are discussing this the way they are

400
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,670
There's quite a bit of it

401
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,730
But I'll tell you they're

402
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:37,270
They're on the whiner on the whiner side, you know, like hey, they're gonna kill us all or

403
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:40,950
Yeah, it's just

404
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:45,570
Yeah, it's just not the yeah typical human mindset

405
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:51,410
Again, you're not getting you're not gonna get any rational discussion now is what speaking of rational discussion?

406
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,810
I was brought into several groups. There was an attorney and one of them

407
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,050
It's kind of explaining the legal matter of

408
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:01,630
Something that can be referenced by anyone and the person who was an attorney didn't want to even look at it

409
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,990
He says well, that's just your opinion

410
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,610
They they have a what an evil sort. I mean, you know

411
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:13,130
And and they just and people buy into that. Oh, yeah, that's just his opinion

412
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:17,210
We don't need to listen even though they can look up anything that was said

413
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:21,870
You know, so you got to realize when we discuss things like this

414
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:25,860
People have already gone down a path of ridiculousness and

415
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:31,750
You're not going to get them off it, but it doesn't mean that you can't provide something proper

416
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:37,750
Now what makes it proper? Is that it's rational and let just like I said

417
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:41,670
two typhoons do not disappear off the coast of Japan with

418
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,070
cupcake molds and resin and metal shavings folks

419
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:49,670
Yeah, if you think that does anything

420
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:55,830
There's a padded room with a cherry flavored lollipop for you. So nonetheless, let's just

421
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:01,630
We can discuss the weather as we've threatened to discuss water

422
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:07,450
And let's just maybe continue back we'll just jump off the

423
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:12,230
Those two topics for now, especially the weather that we opened up and maybe jump on to

424
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:17,110
Some emails or that or the chat if it seems to be rational. What do you think?

425
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,350
Yeah, yeah

426
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:26,650
The you mentioned dreams as well we got or I received another response in the

427
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:33,770
On that subject as well so we can we can get into that and even perhaps we've got plenty of time left

428
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:39,230
But yeah, if you would like to go address the chat, it's certainly going to move a lot faster than the emails will

429
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:40,990
Oh

430
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,930
Either way, it's not about moving faster

431
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:48,490
Maybe is there anything at hand on the chat that do you might use that screams out that should be talked about perhaps?

432
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,510
Yeah, yeah Nathan is

433
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:58,450
In the in the chat room there. I assume he doesn't mind me referencing being that that's his name in the chat

434
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,350
But let me see if I can find

435
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:09,690
Oh, oh, I see it. He's in a little bit of a panic. Maybe we'll leave it alone

436
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,130
It's a bit of it there. Let's just leave that alone

437
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:21,310
Yeah, I I would suggest leaving it alone. I mean, it's just too much to address. It seems like a there's a parallel dialogue here

438
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,710
Unless you anything like I said jumped out that we could address just momentarily

439
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,490
Yeah, we instead of following the whole thing. We can just go with the

440
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:31,710
He

441
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,550
When you're speaking about the the weather

442
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:40,350
He said I'll just read the read the comment here says alleviating drought question mark

443
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:46,910
How about we submit the deity sovereign over the weather rather than trying to work the system with our dams crop?

444
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,170
rotations and geoengineering

445
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:55,670
well, it's kind of backwards if you study and what's been memorialized about the sovereign and

446
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,050
the other gods

447
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:02,470
We were handed over this entire environment as stewards

448
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:09,610
All right, so he'll make things grow you've got a still so you've got a plow so and reap, right

449
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:16,560
There's a lot of parables about the lazy man watching the ants, you know

450
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,780
Yeah, this environment. Here's what people understand

451
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,120
We'll throw this in and this is what they're going to find out later

452
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:27,280
the earth was quite happy being the earth until it was time to pretty much decide that

453
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:32,660
The spirit or the mind that force could could be animated through material and

454
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,780
There was a big division in that

455
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,240
godlike realm

456
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,800
The division part of it was about well, you know, it'll materials corruptible

457
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,180
So if the spirit is solely animated through material that's going to be corrupt

458
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:52,460
But the other part was let's do it because it's the highest form of creation

459
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,440
right and

460
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,880
Where are we going to put them? Well, you know, they went out and

461
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:02,400
saw the earth which was inhabited by non corporeal beings and

462
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,220
terraformed it

463
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,900
To the scale that we see today

464
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:13,900
So you've got an atmosphere and or water and what's called a food chain and symbiotic relationships and things

465
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,739
Yep, the earth would be quite happy shedding the entire atmosphere and going back to a pretty smooth black rock

466
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,000
Laboring to keep this entire thing going the arrogance of mankind is oh look we're damaging the earth

467
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,639
No, you're not doing anything of the sort. I mean you are but

468
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,699
It's the way you behave to each other the earth can't stand

469
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,300
Am I speaking for it? No, I'm not speaking for the earth. I'm not speaking for anyone

470
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:45,440
I'm just trying to objectify what's been memorialized to a society that has no ears and no eyes

471
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:50,820
But you will find this out later. Yeah saying it pretty confidently because it's pretty confident

472
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:53,420
If the information is

473
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,980
Well worth speaking in a confident manner

474
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:00,220
So, yeah, it's about stewardship

475
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,240
Not working with the weather is like saying well we need to grow food

476
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,020
So let's just stand by the earth and watch what grows and eat it. That's fine, too. But there is

477
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,540
Lawful agriculture, right, right

478
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:19,480
Yeah, I mean you could forage, you know what grows naturally, but you are allowed and given permission

479
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,960
Let's say from higher authorities to

480
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,640
objectify stewardship

481
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:25,680
Right

482
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,820
Yeah, but the thing is, you know, it's just like the political scene, you know, look at all these people

483
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:39,320
mainstream and me and alternative complaining about the current political system and financial system and

484
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,920
oligarchy

485
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:48,940
Would you want those people complaining to be those in power? I would I think the people in power now are doing just fine. I

486
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,380
mean, they're horrible and evil

487
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,560
but

488
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:58,000
You ever walk out your door anyway, yeah

489
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:05,120
Yeah, I mean when I say horrible, I mean it's like what's being reported, you know, they're pretty hands-off believe it or not

490
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,400
Most of the oligarchs on the power base that runs the planet

491
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:18,360
They have a lot of in between errs. You call them entitled. Well, they're called the entitled classes. Those are degrees

492
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:24,720
Oh, do you guys love that? Yes, you do. Come on fess up. You love all that dumb stuff

493
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:26,740
So

494
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,420
Maybe we'll just jump into an email

495
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,570
Seems like the chat. We have a pretty

496
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:41,610
Aggressive text going on there and there's quite a bit going on. But okay, let's let's go into

497
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,230
It's just kind of like stay, you know

498
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:48,590
Cuz we're trying to structure the show here in a way one of the emails we've gotten anonymously is a hello Seth and Greek

499
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:55,370
It's numbered actually, I kind of briefly looked at this up. Can you offer any pointers for conducting research?

500
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:02,630
There's a lot of information to sift through and it's hard not to become tangled up in ideas that may

501
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:09,850
Seem lawful or valid initially, but over time turn out to be nothing more than wasted power making the hamster wheel turn

502
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:10,910
Yeah

503
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:18,570
Pretty much answered it right there. Well, how do you how do you do the research objectively with rational thought?

504
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:26,350
Think once it was said that takes a sane mind to think clearly, but an insane mind can think deeply

505
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,140
Start looking at

506
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,640
things objectively

507
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,040
If you read a book

508
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,820
about a subject

509
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:46,180
That someone wrote about who read another book that someone else wrote that someone else wrote that someone else wrote

510
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,720
You're not going to get it, especially if these people are academic

511
00:37:54,580 --> 00:38:00,580
One question there would be do you mind drinking water from a street puddle or

512
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:06,780
Do you mind drinking water from a river where all the birds and fish want to poop in or do you want to drink water?

513
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,320
from a spring at the mountaintop

514
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,900
So what the spring would represent the source?

515
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,120
So go to the source very simple

516
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,600
Anything on that Seth anything else would you like to add or take away from that?

517
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,180
About research

518
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,600
Old libraries go find some old books

519
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,420
You know, what's interesting by the way, I've heard several

520
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:37,420
consistent reports the big library in New York City the ones with

521
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,560
It's kind of like this. It looks like a temple of marble and stone and there's two lions outside there. I think it's on

522
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,480
Fifth Avenue 42nd Street used to have it's a beautiful building and

523
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:50,600
a

524
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:56,880
Lot of old stuff. I've heard that over the past decade or two a lot of the old stuff's been removed

525
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,840
And by the way, the FBI does have a book seizure list

526
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,260
Folks and one of those things the most recent

527
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,200
Project was dictionaries

528
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,460
Yeah

529
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:17,900
Dictionaries around September 2001 there was a particular word that

530
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:21,340
Needed to have its definition modified

531
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:32,480
Go figure it out. So old libraries, you know, by the way years ago in libraries

532
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,840
All reading was encouraged to be done out loud

533
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:41,640
so when you built a library, it was quite a project you research some old libraries and

534
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:47,240
Documentation about them. You'll find that there were actually click construction large construction and maintenance crews

535
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,340
as part of the building

536
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:56,540
Because when you got your reading material you went and sat down a little booth and you read it out loud by yourself

537
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:05,220
So there's lots of doors lots of hinges that need to be fixed lots of cleaning out cleaning rooms and maintaining stuff

538
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,520
Yeah, this is a reading silent thing is a fairly recent occurrence

539
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:19,360
You brought up libraries for you to throw that in. Yeah, the internet only has what the internet has

540
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,620
It's become commonplace to rely on it solely for information

541
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,040
at the

542
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,340
other end of

543
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,920
experience I suppose so

544
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:39,000
You know, it's definitely a tool that can be used but it only has what it has

545
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:46,320
It's self-consuming though. If you have people that are ignorant of many matters or if all matters approach a venue

546
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,240
That

547
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:52,740
Venue in order to be successful has to accommodate that mindset

548
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:01,000
Right. So then it becomes a self-consuming. What do you call it perpetual? You know, what is it like when something?

549
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,480
Gets into a feedback loop and it can't break out of it

550
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:05,720
right

551
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,580
so in order for the internet to have the success that it does it has to put up a lot of stupid shit because there's

552
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,080
A lot of stupid people going to it

553
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,680
So then how does anything get better it doesn't

554
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:23,180
It's still there the if you know how to sift through it, but you have to remember it's accommodated

555
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:29,620
It's accommodating its audience. No one goes out into a venture that leads to success

556
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,680
without wholly and solely considering

557
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,640
Accommodating their patrons clients or audience

558
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,960
It's very rare that someone goes out and does anything

559
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,300
Without considering how they're going to accommodate those that are participating so

560
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:57,400
Yeah, but what that said, let's go is he's got number two. Can you go into any more specificity in regard to lawful timekeeping?

561
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:58,920
Oh

562
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,120
boy

563
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,900
Yes, what about this so-called equinox

564
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,960
All right, let's back up

565
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,660
Lawful timekeeping. What is time people still don't you know Seth?

566
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:16,220
I found that I've been saying this for over a decade and people still don't want to hear it forget about listening

567
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:23,300
You still have people saying well, there's no such thing as time, you know, it's relevant. It's relative

568
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,960
And I think we've played the Fox and the grapes before by the way

569
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,940
Aesop's fable ties into that

570
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:36,020
Right. Yes, we should probably play that again because

571
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,860
If you don't mind, we've got about 15 minutes. It might be good. Let's see if we could bring this up

572
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,440
Any any subject matter that

573
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,500
is brought up for public discussion that

574
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:55,500
It's not popular to comprehend. By the way, it is I've noticed them a

575
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,760
social norm that if people when they're when they're presented with some information and

576
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:06,380
they look around before they they delve into it and see how popular that information is or what the

577
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,500
Accepted responses to it. You ever noticed that

578
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:15,360
I'm not talking about when you talk to someone and their eyes start bouncing up and down like slot machines and things like that

579
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:20,040
Talking about when you bring up the notion of definitions the notion of what's lawful

580
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:26,680
They immediately pause and they're wondering in their minds what everyone else thinks about that topic

581
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:33,480
Yeah, that's Gustav Le Bon's the crowd mentality, by the way, but

582
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,890
I'm gonna do the Fox and the grapes because

583
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:44,390
This is what you encounter most of the time especially I mean there are people that have entire careers

584
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:46,870
I don't know how well they do on the internet with websites books

585
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:50,630
memberships and all this stuff based on the concept of

586
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:53,990
The Fox and the grapes and they don't know it obviously

587
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,810
But what we do

588
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:04,690
Yes, and we're gonna maybe play this short little audio. It's from children's books. Let's see how it goes up a hungry Fox

589
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,970
Came across a rich and luscious grapevine

590
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:13,330
A bunch of ripe grapes were hanging from a height a

591
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:15,630
Good way above the ground

592
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:23,060
The Fox made several attempts to jump up and pluck the grapes

593
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,720
But his efforts were in vain

594
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:33,880
Tired and hungry he walked off grumpily and murmured I

595
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,360
Am sure those grapes were nasty and sour

596
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,180
I'm glad I could not reach them

597
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:43,340
They were definitely not worth eating

598
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,260
It is easy to belittle what you cannot obtain

599
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,220
The Fox spoke badly of the grapes

600
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:59,160
Only because he could not reach them and was forced to go away hungry

601
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:05,230
To lessen his disappointment of not getting what he wanted

602
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:11,010
He comforted himself with the idea that the grapes were sour

603
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:12,430
There you go

604
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:18,830
many times if you try to have a discussion privately or publicly with people and they're like, oh

605
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:25,750
That's just a work of fiction. Oh, that's your opinion. Oh, that's that's the Fox and the grapes

606
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:29,890
Yeah, I don't get it it must be horrible

607
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:37,410
Well, you want to set yourself apart and just contact these surface-dwelling earth inhabitants only when necessary at this point

608
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:40,950
Did I just say that yes, I did

609
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:48,350
Okay, which could be quite often on occasion if you open a lemonade stand, you're going to be contacting them quite often

610
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:52,320
so

611
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,840
lawful timekeeping

612
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,180
Let's just give another way to explain it. Well, we just gave the preface on that

613
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,300
Let's let's look at this

614
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,940
At one point society was in the light and at another point society is in the dark

615
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:11,320
Let's describe what we mean by that at one point society garnered all of its materials from

616
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,660
materials that were produced in the light plant fibers

617
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:16,460
animal products

618
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,620
plant inks surface

619
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,040
minerals

620
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,220
Right things that were in the light

621
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:30,040
They started their day in the light at high noon solar noon. They started their year in

622
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,180
the light at the beginning of spring and

623
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:37,480
The new moon was the full moon which was full of light

624
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,820
Well, there's another society

625
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,460
that

626
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,520
Garners everything from the dark

627
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,800
If you look at something called crude oil

628
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:54,280
It's formed in the dark. It's black and it's been used on everything

629
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,480
plastics materials dyes

630
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,100
things made or

631
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:00,860
connected

632
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,360
Encoded with byproducts from this dark substance that is formed in the dark

633
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,060
their day

634
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,120
starts

635
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,560
the darkest part of the day

636
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:13,500
their year

637
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:21,250
starts the darkest season darkest month darkest week darkest day darkest everything and

638
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,960
Their new moon is dark

639
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:26,620
Should we say anymore

640
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,140
How can anything

641
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,000
Doesn't relate to darkness be accepted by such a society

642
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,290
Think about that for a moment

643
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,780
Hasn't always been that way. It's now. Yeah

644
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,880
Yeah, there have been societies in the past

645
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,240
that

646
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:55,280
You know, that's that's what they did they it was they kept time with the with the daylight with the light of the moon

647
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,740
Light of the Sun the light of the Sun. Yeah, absolutely

648
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,180
Yeah, what do you?

649
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,620
Look at that. For example when you say societies

650
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,920
By the way, just just to bring this up

651
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:13,920
I was in a sort of like a Skype call recently and there were quite a few professional people

652
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,220
they're highly educated older and

653
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:19,800
they were using the term academic quite a bit and I said, why don't we go and look it up and

654
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:26,460
They didn't know how to do that it took them about 10 minutes and they still couldn't get the etymology dictionary up online

655
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:32,520
Pull it up. My comment was it sounds like a pretty typical human group. These were like professionals people

656
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:38,060
They they were there there were censored to the point where they couldn't even look up the word academic

657
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:39,960
which by the way means

658
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:47,470
Theoretical impractical never leading to a conclusion pretty dark

659
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:49,610
lawful timekeeping

660
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:51,010
What is time

661
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:57,470
It is nothing more nothing less than the recordation of events. It's a form of communication of

662
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,490
recording events

663
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:06,530
Now that's another subject because the recordation of events has become so corrupt your history and your academic

664
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:09,930
Information is all false, by the way

665
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:16,630
And that would be history meaning recording previous events. So you've been so mind-plugged

666
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:20,390
About things being memorialized

667
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:25,250
That right now is most of society just actually truly believes that everything

668
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:28,310
Sprang into existence less than a hundred years ago

669
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:35,030
What I mean by that is if you ask one of these surface-dwelling earth inhabitants that they'll say of course not

670
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:40,690
But everything they engage in is pretty much can't go back more than a hundred years or so

671
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:44,610
And most people not even 10 or 15 years very difficult to

672
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:51,670
So time is nothing more than their recordation of events what makes it lawful is that you're not dependent on one thing

673
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:59,530
That you have to purchase or subscribe to or even if you were that thing is not fiat

674
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:01,790
Fiat means it's based on nothing

675
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:10,310
Currently, let's just discuss currently the world has accepted the Pope's work schedule. Yes. I'm going to say it one more time slowly

676
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:16,130
The Pope's work schedule is what's called the Gregorian calendar. What well, what does that mean?

677
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:19,030
it means that

678
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:26,230
For papal subjects, they know when to go to work and when to take days off. It is a work schedule

679
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:28,790
it has absolutely nothing with keeping time and

680
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:36,690
The the saddest thing is people that want to break away. They they do like certain study groups and they still follow it

681
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:41,910
And I'm just saying if they shouldn't I'm just saying it's sad to watch on one hand

682
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:45,670
They're professing to be the bastion of truth and facts and knowledge

683
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:50,110
And on the other hand, they start talking about things like Saturday

684
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,170
and Monday

685
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:54,950
Lost me folks

686
00:50:56,090 --> 00:51:02,630
That's work schedule. It can't keep time with it proof of that. Let's pull up one of these ridiculous calendars today is what they call

687
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:05,470
7 9 2 0 1 6

688
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:13,390
I guess that would be I don't know. What is that? July 9th 2016 and it's what they call a Saturday

689
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:17,130
So let's go back in 2016

690
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:23,750
Okay, July 9th on 2015

691
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,750
Was what they call a Thursday or a Thor's Day

692
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,330
All right, you want to go back? Let's go back one more time just to

693
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:33,810
Wear this out just a little bit

694
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:36,330
On what they called

695
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:41,390
2014 July 9th was what they call a Woden's day or a Wednesday

696
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:42,950
All right

697
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:44,530
Everybody stop

698
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:50,370
So is July 9th a Woden's day a Thor's day or a Saturn's day?

699
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:55,550
Anybody answer that you can't you know why because it's not a timepiece

700
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:58,130
The earth doesn't go around the Sun in

701
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:01,570
364 and a quarter days no such thing

702
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:04,670
Can't keep time with the earth going around the Sun

703
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:11,630
knowledge of the earth going around the Sun or the earth bouncing around like an 8-ball in the corner pocket on a billiard table or

704
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,610
the earth being flat or triangular or

705
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:19,530
The shape of a boar's penis or anything like ridiculous like that is irrelevant

706
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:26,070
What's relevant? Are you mastering its movements with your feet on the ground? What do you perceive and have you mastered?

707
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:31,670
What you've perceived and applied it to your physical world to better your life and the answer to that is no

708
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:34,230
The rest of it is irrelevant

709
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:36,090
so

710
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:42,290
The worst thing by the way is you have quite a few people not as much anymore as I used to hear

711
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:45,090
Bad-mouthing the Vatican the papacy Rome

712
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:47,290
All right, ask one of these morons

713
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:49,230
What day is it today?

714
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:54,450
Now you didn't ask the day and the date you asked the day now the date and the day are two different things

715
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:57,490
We're not playing around with words here, but

716
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:01,230
And they'll give you a date based on the Pope's work schedule

717
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:08,150
So on one hand, they're bad-mouthing the papacy and on the other hand, they're admitting with their own mouth be intimately

718
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:10,190
They're a papal subject

719
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:14,370
So the next time you hear someone bad-mouthing the papacy

720
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:17,270
Interrupt them and ask them what day it is

721
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:20,890
If they respond with what's on the Pope's work schedule

722
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:25,010
There's someone that's headed for a padded room with a cherry lollipop

723
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:29,870
Eventually, so what is lawful timekeeping?

724
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,750
Well something everyone can access and it's based on something

725
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:36,770
Maybe we'll stop right there

726
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:40,470
greetings and welcome to uncommon sense again, you can find us at

727
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:44,450
www.uncommonradio.com

728
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:45,810
Put in the

729
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:52,770
www.com around uncommon radio because there's it's a common term on the browser and there you will find a way to

730
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:57,640
contact the Greek and Seth Michael and various other courtesies on that page and

731
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:01,830
So on and so forth. So you are listening to American Freedom Radio

732
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:06,410
We thank the crew at American Freedom Radio for having us on

733
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:08,850
and

734
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:12,670
You know what to do American Freedom Radio just like many other venues

735
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:17,450
Requires your participation and when I say, you know what to do go to the home page and

736
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:20,790
Make a donation. So with that said

737
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:24,410
Let's proceed. Let's see if Seth will join us again in a moment and

738
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:28,990
Maybe continue on a particular message that we got from a quote-unquote listener

739
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:34,790
We were discussing about lawful timekeeping and the nature of time and what its purpose is

740
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:39,550
Outside of this solipsism that nothing matters

741
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:41,770
You know people

742
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:43,130
are

743
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:44,850
engaged in this

744
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:52,350
grandiose idea that opinions are things to hinge one's belief on and

745
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:54,790
discussions if you ever been in a

746
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:57,130
discussion as I have

747
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:02,890
Typically electronic brought into a group and you'll hear someone just talking about the most ridiculous stuff

748
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:09,130
With five people standing around agreeing or not saying anything now typically instead of steamrolling the guy

749
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:10,050
That's just talking

750
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:15,550
I kind of want to get into the people that are around him saying this guy is obviously fallen on his face

751
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:21,710
Spiritually or mentally and no one's helping him get up. You're all just sitting there watching him muck and mire and

752
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:24,170
his own fecal matter and

753
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:26,790
There is a lack of support

754
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:35,050
That is persistent in society and it part of the thing is that somehow

755
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:36,470
somewhere

756
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:39,650
Opinions were given significance

757
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:42,150
So when you think about that

758
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:46,330
For a moment, let it set in because it is very contrary to what is lawful

759
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:51,090
You know, what is what things should be based on that means like what anyone can access

760
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:56,650
You know, we the going back to the the email here that we were reading

761
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:03,730
It was about can we get into more lawful timekeeping? It's it's very simple. Are you keeping time with something that is based on something?

762
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:05,650
Right now

763
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:12,230
We talked about the Pope's work schedule aka the Gregorian calendar with your work week and weekend

764
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:14,750
That is nothing more than a work schedule

765
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:17,530
Now you also have what I call the wind-up toy

766
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:19,630
It's a mechanical clock

767
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:22,490
These things are

768
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:30,870
hmm, I would say more navigational instruments than anything else if you know a rate of travel and you have a

769
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:38,190
Mechanical beat to it. You can determine according to that mechanical beat or the wind-up toy or whatever

770
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:40,610
a

771
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:45,410
Form of communication that will give you a time of arrival as long as everyone is using that system

772
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:48,590
But it is not lawful because these things can change

773
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:56,910
So so I hear an echo by the way, by the way back. Sorry. Yeah. Okay, and and

774
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:04,270
All right, so the the other thing here the just to continue on a lawful timekeeping we we have given this much in the past

775
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:05,710
Let's just give it again

776
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:08,790
Solar noon is when the day starts folks

777
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:13,790
Where you're at, you know, so if you put aside what you think, you know about reaping

778
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:19,070
Relevant a relative. Yes where you're at a solar noon put a stick in the ground

779
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:22,870
you'll notice in the morning prior to noon the shadow goes to the west and

780
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:26,890
You'll notice that afternoon the shadow goes to the east but there is a point

781
00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:28,850
Where if you're on the northern hemisphere

782
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:34,110
The shadow is straight up and down or slightly to the north on the southern hemisphere be slightly to the south

783
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:41,230
All right, that's that's your time and you could actually divide time down to as many decimal places as you want

784
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:46,270
Depending on the the length of the shadow and other things if anyone is interested on an elaborate

785
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:48,170
aspects of

786
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:50,090
It's not a sundial

787
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:51,230
but

788
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:53,150
Solar timekeeping

789
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:55,650
Do a browser search on?

790
00:57:56,490 --> 00:57:57,910
Sun clocks of India

791
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:03,190
They still have some quite elaborate ones in public parks and things. Some of them are three stories tall

792
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:11,810
Now you'll also notice if you do markings that are indelible with these solar markings as the year goes around

793
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:16,590
That particular day the marking is slightly off and that's a way to dictate the year

794
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:20,290
but again, if you want to go to your

795
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:28,290
Timekeeping authorities there used to be a prominent page on Julian calendar date on the Naval Observatory, which is the American timekeeping

796
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:31,930
Authority and on Julian calendar date on their web page now

797
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:36,570
I've heard I haven't gone there recently, but I've heard that it's been since taken down. It states that

798
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:44,370
For scientific and astronomical purposes the day starts at solar noon, but for the people it's civil midnight

799
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:49,170
So that's a good example of how the old dictionaries were written

800
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:52,870
Where you looked up the word oats?

801
00:58:53,910 --> 00:59:00,730
It was defined as what they feed horses in England, but the staple of the people in Scotland

802
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:03,510
Kind of a put-down indirectly if you ask me

803
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:06,310
But solar noon is when the day starts

804
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:11,050
And then we could jump to weeks you have four

805
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:12,310
Divisions

806
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:15,450
Four weeks per month and the month is ruled by the moon

807
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:17,950
That's why for thousands of years

808
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:24,650
People settled their debts with the new moon, which was the full moon, which you can see and measure

809
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:29,450
Today, it's conventional that people get a monthly bill

810
00:59:30,810 --> 00:59:32,430
For utilities and things

811
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:33,710
contracts

812
00:59:35,470 --> 00:59:37,410
There's a reason why they call it monthly and

813
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:39,070
And

814
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:42,850
The full moon is the new moon folks, by the way, there's a long history and how

815
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:48,450
Astronomers and astrologers have gone into the it's actually convoluted history, but essentially

816
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:55,770
It has shifted to the dark moon as being new which you cannot really do any measurements on it's so gradual

817
00:59:56,490 --> 01:00:00,750
There it casts no shadow. There's no marking. There's nothing that can be done for it

818
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:03,550
Then again, we talked about a society that's based on darkness

819
01:00:03,550 --> 01:00:04,670
Now

820
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:14,080
Let's just give one little account a general account on why the new moon is the dark moon back in the

821
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:16,400
Egyptian and Babylonian Convention

822
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:24,480
These solar the solar the Sun and the moon. Let's say were important for timekeeping and recordation of events

823
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:28,430
practices regarding worship and other things and

824
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,440
When the moon was dark

825
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,720
People, you know, we're wondering if it stays dark

826
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,160
We won't be able to reckon time

827
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:41,300
so we need our leaders to be

828
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,680
Confined we can't have them traveling around

829
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,440
Not only leaving the border of their jurisdiction

830
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:54,400
Let's say the Kings and what-have-you the priests, but maybe we should they should just stay within their palace or their homes

831
01:00:54,400 --> 01:01:01,080
till the moon reappears because if they leave and we have the people that lead us leave and travel and

832
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,920
The moon doesn't come back. What are we to do?

833
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,840
So they waited until the sliver was sighted in the West

834
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,060
Took a little while nothing much to measure

835
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,960
just visual and

836
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:16,560
it freed up the

837
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:17,820
authorities again

838
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:19,560
for mobility

839
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,600
Very interesting. That's why if you look at some ancient texts

840
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:28,040
There was a group of people that left Egypt and it was around the dark time of the dark moon

841
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:36,700
But the pursuit of these people did not commence until the moon was sighted it was actually several days later that the pursuit began

842
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:44,900
Put that together with what I just said, what's that? Well, maybe you've might have heard that something relating to that story

843
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:53,840
So your your timekeeping is based on things that are exist

844
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:55,580
It's not fiat

845
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:03,380
We just kind of evidenced that you can't keep time with the Pope's work schedule. We just did something with what's called July 9th

846
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:05,160
2016

847
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:08,860
Showed you that it occurs on different days of

848
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:15,200
The week every year. So which one is it? Is it July 9th, or is it a Woden's day a Thursday or a Saturn's day?

849
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:17,220
It's neither. It's none of them and

850
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:20,700
You folks are operating like everything's just hunky-dory

851
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,440
Right because who cares?

852
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,120
But some people do care so

853
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:33,880
So Seth, let's continue on this a little bit about timekeeping which we've kind of done over and over I think you

854
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:39,720
Mentioned something about repetition once I think we're kind of experiencing it

855
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:41,160
Certainly

856
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,400
Anything else you want to add to the so far the Sun and the moon that we've discussed

857
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:55,180
There's interesting the book of Enoch was mentioned in chat earlier and it's just there's interesting references to

858
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:00,410
Accurate timekeeping in Enoch as well

859
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:09,400
We've never let's just spill this out the book of Enoch and the book of Jasher Yashar or the book of the upright

860
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,980
Are chronicles that were written by the temple priesthood?

861
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:14,860
at the time

862
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:21,400
They were there were chronicles in other words things notes that a certain group of people took

863
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:23,640
and

864
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:27,300
They were dubbed, you know one the book of the upright book of Yashar or Jasher

865
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:33,760
There's no letter J by the way before 1500 so mind that folks and also the book of Enoch

866
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:40,200
Yeah, it's not it was not written by Enoch and such so so I mean here

867
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:46,280
You know, I'm just putting this out as a very strong presumption assumption and probably some of the most accurate information

868
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,020
You'll ever get on those two

869
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,190
texts so

870
01:03:53,150 --> 01:03:54,030
All right now

871
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:57,210
We talked about the Sun and the moon in the years

872
01:03:57,210 --> 01:04:04,680
We're gonna leave alone because that's kind of like more than addition and subtraction, you know, but here folks

873
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,560
How can how can you how can it be the year?

874
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:14,960
2016 and you turn on a show regarding the dinosaurs and you notice how they always plug in 60 million years ago when they say

875
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:15,500
dinosaurs

876
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:18,700
Why isn't it the year 60 million?

877
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:25,550
2016 then I mean you're so far removed from anything rational at this point

878
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:32,130
I think going to discussing how the years work. Oh, let me just plug this in about the years by the way

879
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:39,810
You ever hear about this thing called the Jubilee and I think last year all these morons were making a big stink about it

880
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:45,130
You know one moron says something and then they all grab on to it

881
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:52,090
You know what? I mean by that or imbecile look up Gustav LeVon le bon the crowd

882
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:58,820
I'm not promoting the book, but it's got some good commentary on it. So

883
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:00,640
Yeah

884
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,520
These things can be determined and no it was not last year

885
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:12,000
Yeah, the Jubilee happened around 18 years ago folks, and you all missed it as usual pretty much miss everything

886
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:18,290
So let's go on. What do you think Seth?

887
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:20,470
Next thing is about the equinox

888
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:24,450
What about this so-called equinox? Well, think about it folks. It's just

889
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:31,670
Equally means equal and knocks means night. So it has to do with something about being equally measured at night and

890
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:33,170
you folks

891
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:34,950
Have been told

892
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:37,650
That it's equal daylight and equal night

893
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:45,210
It's real simple I think when they people are looking for the equinox to be equal daylight equal nighttime

894
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:50,090
I'm envisioning seven billion people finger painting on the wall with chocolate pudding

895
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:55,000
That's the level of maturity

896
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:00,040
Word means actually something measured at night and that's pretty much New Year's

897
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:05,820
What is what does that mean? Well, if you'll notice that the Sun takes a path through the sky

898
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:10,140
Equatorial perhaps and

899
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:16,080
This the path that the Sun takes through the sky in the summer is

900
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:20,720
The path that the moon takes through the sky in the winter and they switch places

901
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:27,240
Across the year, but during the spring and the fall typically

902
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:35,200
For one day the moon and the Sun will go traverse the

903
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,620
Path in the sky identical

904
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:44,840
To each other in other words the way that can be determined is by measuring shadows

905
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:49,060
And it's funny once I was discussing this with an academic

906
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:52,600
And I said well if the equinox has to do with measurement at night

907
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:56,200
How are you going to measure the shadow of the moon?

908
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:03,240
This is this is this is where this is where you're pranking your children folks

909
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,200
You're you're putting together all these credits and sending

910
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:12,020
Children to these morons known as University or college all of them are by the way, not some of them

911
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:15,000
right and

912
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,480
And this moron asks

913
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:21,080
How do you measure the shadow of the moon at night right this is this is the level of

914
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:28,140
Rationale right now. I don't know if anyone's been out during the full moon at night and the shadows are razor-sharp

915
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:36,220
So so there you go, that's your equinox and that will happen at the beginning of the year at the end of the year

916
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:43,800
Usually in the first month and usually in the seventh month I noticed a question in the chat about intercalation

917
01:07:44,940 --> 01:07:47,940
Seth we've been discussing these things for several years together

918
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:52,040
And I believe you've experienced properly calling an intercalation

919
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:55,880
Which is a 13th month right once it was a couple of years ago, wasn't it?

920
01:07:56,540 --> 01:08:00,540
Yeah, yeah properly calling it that means that I'm not going to get into that

921
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,640
Because it's more than just adding and subtracting

922
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:08,340
You know it's just beyond the pay scale of those that just want to hear about the subject

923
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:13,300
But it's definitely should be included on those that want to actually live it or delve into it

924
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:14,460
and I don't think that

925
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:20,800
Doing two hours a week on a minor internet radio station getting into minutiae as such

926
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,979
Especially things that are lawful like that is valid

927
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:28,779
But there will be another place that these things can be discussed hopefully in the future, but in essence

928
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:35,260
The intercalation is where you have a 13th month, and it typically happens three times every decade

929
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,520
So there goes your

930
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:42,580
You know argument of other 360 or 360

931
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:49,600
For or 365 days in a year because you can have it a year with 393 days

932
01:08:51,229 --> 01:08:54,490
Okay, or 396 I've measured

933
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:57,770
almost 400 days in a year sometimes

934
01:08:59,029 --> 01:09:02,350
So this has to do with things that you are not

935
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:09,050
Made privy to because it has nothing to do with going to work and so-called paying taxes

936
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:18,479
It has absolutely nothing to do with that so it has nothing to do with most people, but it has a lot to do with

937
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:27,700
Learning about what lawful things are about so that gets I think very complicated

938
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,300
to my son

939
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,399
Where does one research that?

940
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:35,140
Where does one find lots of research?

941
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:40,399
Direction earlier, it's an certain. It's a topic. That's not discussed

942
01:09:40,979 --> 01:09:42,120
really any anywhere

943
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:47,160
Yeah, yeah, how does one research societies that don't exist anymore?

944
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:48,560
precisely

945
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:52,200
Yeah, and by the way when I speak of that

946
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:57,020
There's no such thing as a bronze age and iron age or a stone age by the way that is

947
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:03,980
And there's no such thing as neanderthal man by the way and chromatic all this other stuff you folks are

948
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:05,100
Yeah

949
01:10:06,980 --> 01:10:07,860
Beyond pale

950
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,780
You can have a stone society or a bronze society or an iron society

951
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:17,680
Right, but there's no such thing as an age where everyone

952
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:22,740
Was banging rocks together, and then they figured out how to work with bronze and then iron

953
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:27,860
You're kind of being laughed at but you know at this point if you go to these places

954
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:29,840
of academia

955
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:33,240
Kind of like tying this into societies that don't exist anymore

956
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:40,580
Because what the reason I'm bringing this up is because what people think exists or it had existed doesn't never existed at all

957
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:48,020
So it's like a double whammy to go back and study societies that don't exist anymore because they're going to go into this

958
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:51,000
Iron Age Bronze Age Stone Age crap, right?

959
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:54,200
But if you look at

960
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:59,720
Academia that tends to pump this garbage out. They believe it also

961
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:04,300
They have to you know at this point because in order to move up that

962
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:10,100
academic ladder, you're actually going lower and lower in intelligence, but

963
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:11,700
I

964
01:11:12,260 --> 01:11:13,960
gave an example the other day of

965
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:17,780
Go to a circus and you see a bear doing a trick

966
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:22,580
That's a really smart bear to the people you throw that sucker back into the forest man

967
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:25,160
It's gonna get laughed at by all the other bears

968
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:35,370
What the hell is standing on a ball and juggling oranges have to do with being out here in the forest dummy, so

969
01:11:36,410 --> 01:11:40,450
This is how things are done. It's a dog and pony show and

970
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:47,330
Yeah, enjoy the show isn't that what they say about shows great show

971
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:51,390
Hate to see what a crappy show was like. But anyway, yeah

972
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:56,610
So your equinox is about measuring at night. So, you know, here's the the thing

973
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:59,430
How many times can it be said that everything that?

974
01:11:59,990 --> 01:12:06,550
Pretty much people engage in think believe in is false. So how many times can one say that and not be true?

975
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,210
Hardly ever it's always true seemingly

976
01:12:16,860 --> 01:12:17,260
statistically

977
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:18,680
Yes

978
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:23,860
Statistically, we can't say a hundred percent because then we have to go and recount everything again, and I don't want to do that

979
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:29,080
So maybe we'll say ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine and leave the other

980
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:32,340
Point zero nine's out in case someone is in doubt

981
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:38,000
They can go and count all the grains of sand on the beach again. Make sure the numbers, right?

982
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,020
Absolutely

983
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:46,640
All right. Well, he says here about the equinox. I just

984
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:53,600
What about this so-called equinox are supposed to be equivalence in measurement between daylight and absence of light

985
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:57,800
Something is obviously wrong here. But once again who's paying attention?

986
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:04,080
Wow man a little attitude there, I wonder where you got that from just joking

987
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:14,110
So, I think we got the equinox and lawful timekeeping again cursory overview

988
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:20,630
It's like a smooth stone you want to pass your hand over not break out a chisel on a hammer

989
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,570
Start chiseling away at it and showing how it can be formed into

990
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:32,470
Things that people can use I think it's kind of scary when you start bringing people into what's lawful and unlawful

991
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:35,390
I mean lawful meaning it's based on something

992
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:38,360
Yeah, there's

993
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:44,340
there's practical applications that are

994
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:45,880
Present

995
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:54,340
in being set apart and and how you interact with the environment around you, but trying to

996
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:56,980
Explain these things

997
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:57,980
to

998
01:13:57,980 --> 01:13:59,840
others is

999
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:04,020
It's very difficult and it will not necessarily improve

1000
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,680
What do they call that public relations?

1001
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,460
No, no, and they're not used to explanations there. They want descriptions

1002
01:14:11,460 --> 01:14:18,980
They're used to descriptions all of their science and the ridiculous matters that people tend to pursue are based on description

1003
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:21,940
There's very little explanation

1004
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:27,280
Very little at all the why or the how

1005
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:33,340
You know the why maybe but the how yeah, there's not much on that

1006
01:14:33,820 --> 01:14:38,800
It's kind of like there's a film. I think called idiocracy. You know, what's what's why do you what's Brondo?

1007
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:41,540
What's got electrolytes? What are electrolytes? It's in Brondo

1008
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:51,920
Yeah, so what's that, you know, what are all these things what's electrons man the electrons moving down the wire, you know, really

1009
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:52,500
Okay

1010
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:56,160
So if I cut this wire live wire

1011
01:14:56,160 --> 01:15:00,700
I should be equipped with a really small dustpan to sweep up all the electrons that fall on the floor

1012
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:07,340
Yeah, but things that flow in a conduit don't they the conduits broken don't they kind of like come out of the conduit?

1013
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:10,540
You know, don't ask any questions. Who are you? Where'd you get your degree?

1014
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:13,340
Yeah

1015
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:16,640
You know, we're the ones doing the pranking here

1016
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:22,120
The green that's a that's a

1017
01:15:24,740 --> 01:15:26,480
What a deodorant, right

1018
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:33,680
Yeah, that's right because they do stink. Yeah, and and there's people still encouraging the children to go and become pranksters

1019
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:40,260
Go to college man, so you could get a good job. And yeah, the children are like wait a second, you know

1020
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:46,120
You've been pranking me all my life. And and now I got to go and be a prankster. Yeah, that's right

1021
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:47,320
Welcome to planet Earth

1022
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:50,820
Feel sorry for the young people. I really do

1023
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:52,960
But anyway

1024
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:55,840
We'll change the subject

1025
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,840
Here a number three. Can you elaborate on the nature of voltage?

1026
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:04,960
It seems to be analogous to density perhaps more or less lines of electrical force

1027
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:08,700
Well, let's let's look at that objectively. I'm not going to do it now because I

1028
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:14,840
Don't want to sound pedantic. But if you do some research on what voltage or volt means it

1029
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:20,040
Goes something like this and I'm paraphrasing. It's the at the rate at which a magnetic field

1030
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:22,240
Appears

1031
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:32,410
Is produced or disappears or is dissipated in an electrical circuit. I'm not going to repeat that. I just paraphrased it

1032
01:16:33,470 --> 01:16:36,690
and your devices that measure voltages were

1033
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:42,250
Very similar to all of your measuring devices of pressure devices. What I mean by that is

1034
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:45,430
for a very long time people use

1035
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:51,400
gauges and devices to measure movements and forces based on pressure a

1036
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:56,560
the simplest one would be a balancing scale you put a weight on one side and

1037
01:16:57,560 --> 01:17:02,180
Then an equal weight on the other side will balance the scale if the weight is higher or lower

1038
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:04,840
The scale is higher or lower respectively

1039
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,400
based on pushing or

1040
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,820
Pulling which is very similar

1041
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:11,000
but

1042
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:19,200
This is what your measuring devices are. They're based on pushes pulls things like that. They don't measure quality

1043
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:25,280
And various other phenomenon and I can almost say that quality is a phenomenon these days

1044
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:27,600
It's not being discussed again

1045
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:32,340
Like when I look at some of these internet chat groups and they say great show I'd hate to hear what a crappy show sounds

1046
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:32,900
like but anyway

1047
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:36,380
Yeah, where's the gauge of quality? There is none

1048
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:38,860
I

1049
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:42,060
Guess filling up two hours with no pauses makes it a great show. So anyway

1050
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:49,820
Voltage difficult to define you have to define what magnetism is and all these things by the way

1051
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,800
the in the nature of electricity

1052
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:59,400
Discussing this is difficult because of course we've just mentioned it's very plausible that everything

1053
01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:02,140
Was created less than a hundred years ago

1054
01:18:02,780 --> 01:18:06,280
And we're modern and we're so technologically advanced and we're so smart

1055
01:18:07,060 --> 01:18:10,420
Well, if you look back behind that hundred-year veil

1056
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:14,640
You'll find that there was no such thing as science that were called natural philosophers

1057
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:21,400
And if you keep looking and looking and looking and especially looking for those books that have all been taken out of the libraries

1058
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,720
Oh, no books. I

1059
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,820
Don't get my knowledge from a book. I get it from experience anyway

1060
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:34,680
You'll find out that by reading some of the people Galvani Volta

1061
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:36,980
Hertz

1062
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:39,440
people before that

1063
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:46,640
Even in ancient times that electricity was known to be a phenomenon or an occurrence that happened with biological beings

1064
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,640
It was hand in hand with things that are alive

1065
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:54,780
Even today I have heard several doctors in passing state

1066
01:18:55,700 --> 01:19:00,680
That the movement of the intestines and organs is an electromechanical function

1067
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:07,740
This is your regular. Dr. Moron, you know the ones that you know, dr. Moron, dr. Moron calling dr. Moron

1068
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:13,960
Yeah, but where is their electrotherapy if they self-admit that

1069
01:19:14,740 --> 01:19:16,440
The body is

1070
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:20,280
electromechanical at least functions of intestines and organs are

1071
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,260
Why are they just prescribing pills?

1072
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:30,420
Where's the electrotherapy? Oh, yeah. Wait a second. They do provide electrotherapy in some cases, don't they?

1073
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:34,500
So can be

1074
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:37,220
called therapy

1075
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:41,400
I'm sure that there are those that do but yes, well, here's the thing

1076
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:46,580
It depends on which side you're on if you're on the receiving end. I wouldn't call therapy

1077
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:49,600
But if you're the psychopath meaning the sick mind

1078
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:52,640
Administering it it might be therapeutic for them

1079
01:19:53,480 --> 01:20:00,370
So anyway, by the way psychopaths just means sick spirit

1080
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:02,450
Yeah pain

1081
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:07,490
Yeah discomfort. Yeah, so if you've been on this planet for more than 15 minutes

1082
01:20:07,490 --> 01:20:11,810
This is the planet of the psychopaths folks. You just have different qualities

1083
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:19,710
You have the psychopaths up top and then all the psychopaths following the difference is when the psychopath is up top

1084
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:23,750
He commands that all the other psychopaths

1085
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:29,390
Give 90% of their energy to him or his organization or her organization

1086
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:32,830
And then just stab each other in the back for the remaining 10%

1087
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:38,010
Now you could take any of the other psychopaths and put them in that position and it all assumes very much fine

1088
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:45,030
So when you hear a lot of discussion about being ruled by psychopaths or 2% of the population psychopathic now folks, it's ninety nine point nine

1089
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:45,850
nine nine percent

1090
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:53,330
So and that's a fact you may not like it, but most people don't like facts anyway, so okay

1091
01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:56,810
So that's the thing about the spiel about voltage

1092
01:20:57,890 --> 01:20:59,250
There's too much confusion

1093
01:20:59,250 --> 01:20:59,350
Okay, so let's move on to the next question

1094
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:04,930
There's a fellow named Eric Dollard if anyone wants to research Eric dollar do

1095
01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:06,670
LL a RD

1096
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:11,650
Interesting individual he's come across many things that he's

1097
01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:13,130
Talked about over the years

1098
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:17,370
You can find him on the internet research look at some of his videos

1099
01:21:19,090 --> 01:21:23,610
He professes and I profess also by looking at it that all electrical engineering

1100
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:27,910
Pretty much ceased about 80 or 90 years ago

1101
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:34,810
In terms of developing new weight ways and ideas and by the way folks this thing you hear about the electron

1102
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:39,870
That was propagated that was almost abandoned by the way by the 30s and 40s

1103
01:21:39,870 --> 01:21:46,770
But it was heavily propagated by Walt Disney the atomic model the planetary atomic model spent millions of his own

1104
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:49,910
Credits Walt Disney Walt Disney. Yes

1105
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:56,550
Yes, he has a temple called Disneyland that you all worship at not all but enough people do

1106
01:21:57,690 --> 01:22:01,770
Yeah, he's the one that propagated that and why it's stuck today. So

1107
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:10,440
And here continuing the answers higher potential to ground. Well, you know, here's interesting thing

1108
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:15,340
We started off by discussing something about the ether and weather engineering now

1109
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:18,540
This is one thing if anyone is interested in dabbling or pursuing this

1110
01:22:18,540 --> 01:22:22,980
The ether is completely imponderable and it goes from a low to high potential

1111
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,540
You've been taught that all potentials go from high to low

1112
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:28,680
This goes from low to high

1113
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:30,380
it's like kind of like

1114
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:37,480
Difficult to wrap the mind around if you could turn your head inside out like a sock you'll get a grasp on it

1115
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:45,440
So here higher potential to ground well the ground also has a potential which is moving somewhere else

1116
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,620
So that's a we'll leave this alone

1117
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:49,420
Subject of electricity

1118
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:58,000
Much of the concept of comprehension of the thing known as electricity or the phenomenon known as electrical phenomenon

1119
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,220
Are difficult to discuss without hours of prefacing?

1120
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:05,620
The nature of what can be observed objectively

1121
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:14,640
Objectivity is where it's at like for example if you had real education real schooling or anything like that in any field

1122
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:19,080
Whether it was in the spiritual arts

1123
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:22,340
engineering medicine, what have you

1124
01:23:23,060 --> 01:23:31,380
90% of these schools or educational facilities would focus on objectivity and the last 10% would be focused on the topic at hand or

1125
01:23:31,380 --> 01:23:32,960
the matter that you were subscribing to

1126
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:45,140
Think about that for a minute. Okay, how to think versus what to think?

1127
01:23:45,860 --> 01:23:48,340
Yes, and you're gonna have to learn how to learn

1128
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:51,610
Think about that

1129
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:58,110
Yeah, remember folks you may this might sound a little obtuse, but you're only gonna get this for about two hours a week

1130
01:23:58,110 --> 01:23:59,090
And it's kind of limited

1131
01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:03,830
and you know after we're gone you go back to all the other stuff that you guys are

1132
01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:06,630
like listening to or

1133
01:24:07,230 --> 01:24:12,810
participating in so yeah, so remember this is just if it's out if we sound rather obtuse or

1134
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:15,490
Not in line with what you're used to

1135
01:24:16,330 --> 01:24:20,070
Good. Yeah, you might need a little nudge here and there

1136
01:24:21,010 --> 01:24:26,410
You'll most of you will forget everything you've heard here. Anyway, I'm not being condescending. I'm just being objective

1137
01:24:27,650 --> 01:24:31,970
And if you can prove me, otherwise, I'd be glad to listen. So here in the email

1138
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:39,670
He also goes back and writes. Oh, I'll shut up. But okay. Well, hopefully you will provide a tiny tiny spoon feed

1139
01:24:39,670 --> 01:24:42,570
Oh, maybe we did. Thank you both for all you do

1140
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:45,210
Thank you enough

1141
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:55,630
Well, I guess that's enough of a thanks a little gratitude I guess so that was that email it covered several subjects

1142
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:58,170
I think they were worth garnering the time for and

1143
01:24:59,290 --> 01:25:01,310
I'll kick it to you Seth. What do you think?

1144
01:25:01,970 --> 01:25:06,690
So far, we've got you know, two hours a week here and we're not looking to fill things, you know

1145
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:09,110
For the two hours. We're not looking for filler

1146
01:25:09,110 --> 01:25:15,670
We're just looking for what can we say we have four or five people that are publicly listening and what can we make?

1147
01:25:16,130 --> 01:25:20,090
The highest order and the highest use of this opportunity

1148
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:25,890
I mean, there's there's many things that we'd like to say. I think they're for not at this point

1149
01:25:25,890 --> 01:25:28,050
I think the timing will be more

1150
01:25:28,050 --> 01:25:33,810
apropos in the next couple of years to discuss a lot of the things that people will be questioning, but

1151
01:25:35,150 --> 01:25:39,490
Yeah, let's take a pause for a moment here something. What do you think so far?

1152
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:44,090
Objectivity is

1153
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:49,950
Rare uncommon about that extremely uncommon

1154
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:55,770
We can we can move from that to

1155
01:25:56,450 --> 01:26:00,430
Another email. I'm not certain that this I think this one came directly to me, but it was in

1156
01:26:01,090 --> 01:26:02,030
response to us

1157
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:08,910
Speaking about dreams and again, this is more of a singular case as opposed to something that is really common

1158
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:10,890
But it's it's something we can get into

1159
01:26:10,890 --> 01:26:15,450
Oh, you mean we can just preface by saying you're beginning to feel very sleepy

1160
01:26:15,450 --> 01:26:20,430
That's you're just you're feeling sleepy the power of suggestion, right? Okay

1161
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:26,130
Absolutely, I'll just I'll just read read through some of it

1162
01:26:26,130 --> 01:26:31,530
It's it's a little bit lengthy, but I can I can get through to a question relatively quickly

1163
01:26:31,530 --> 01:26:34,750
I think and anonymously and anonymously. Yeah

1164
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:38,690
Hello. Thank you for bringing up the question that of the dream

1165
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:43,190
And some good information came out of it, unfortunately, I already understand

1166
01:26:43,190 --> 01:26:48,430
Most of what was said is the Greek said it was mostly a broad outline in my own opinion

1167
01:26:48,430 --> 01:26:52,990
It is very hard to settle with this being simply a pranking intent

1168
01:26:52,990 --> 01:26:57,290
As I said, there is much quality in my dreams more than this creation

1169
01:26:57,290 --> 01:27:01,230
Nothing is hazy or unclear and I do feel sensations including pain

1170
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:08,510
For example, I was stabbed in a dream recently and it was real to me that pain the feeling of adrenaline from blood loss

1171
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:09,290
the fear

1172
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:15,710
Begging this being standing over me to please stop. There's too much quality for it to be a prank

1173
01:27:15,710 --> 01:27:21,650
It would be futile. All of my dreams are not negative and some are very enjoyable simply from peaceful state of mind

1174
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:27,090
This being the case from an objective point of view. It's hard to discount this technology of communication

1175
01:27:27,090 --> 01:27:33,870
there must be more of an importance to it because it may be the easiest form of communication to the other side and

1176
01:27:34,510 --> 01:27:37,150
it's dangerous for anyone to pass it off simply because there's

1177
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:39,570
More lies than truths

1178
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:48,330
That is just my opinion and I could be completely wrong but there is most likely something else behind dreams

1179
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:49,970
I know I'm not the most

1180
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:53,950
Knowledgeable person but like nature nothing is futile in creation

1181
01:27:53,950 --> 01:28:00,330
I've actually been listening since the psychohistory program. So I'm quite familiar with the public broadcast, but I just can't help

1182
01:28:01,590 --> 01:28:07,010
But feel so much is not being said and parts of truth easily get misinterpreted

1183
01:28:07,150 --> 01:28:11,970
But I apologize. I'm not sure what kind of answer I was looking for and that's yeah

1184
01:28:12,510 --> 01:28:15,930
They answered a lot of the stuff himself there is stated its opinion

1185
01:28:15,930 --> 01:28:22,090
So we know how what we think about that and on the next level the quality just because it's vivid and clear

1186
01:28:22,090 --> 01:28:23,370
I mean, I just mentioned there's

1187
01:28:23,810 --> 01:28:28,330
Looking at a lot of these internet shows I go to the chest to see what kind of feedback they're getting and I mean these shows

1188
01:28:28,330 --> 01:28:30,610
Are just total crap and the people are like great show

1189
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:35,130
So I'm like what's what makes it I mean, where's that, you know

1190
01:28:35,130 --> 01:28:41,010
So if you think something is quality go to a McDonald's and people are just so glad to be there and eat that, you know

1191
01:28:41,010 --> 01:28:43,010
I'm not putting that corporation down or anything

1192
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:47,390
You know, but you know, there's quality is very subjective

1193
01:28:49,010 --> 01:28:54,230
So this is extremely subjective, but I'm glad you read it. I'm not discounting it or pushing it aside

1194
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:59,510
I do appreciate the communication because obviously as a strong effect on this

1195
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:07,430
Individual but no, I I don't find it to change much or add or take away much. I think it's just one's experience

1196
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:09,010
I think it actually

1197
01:29:09,810 --> 01:29:12,190
Underpins everything that we've discussed you yeah

1198
01:29:12,190 --> 01:29:17,410
Yeah, and that's that's kind of what what I got from it and what my response would be as well

1199
01:29:17,410 --> 01:29:23,750
I didn't actually respond to that email, but it's someone who listens to the program with fair regularity

1200
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:27,230
so yeah, and actually listening and it's

1201
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:30,550
The quality and vividness just

1202
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:35,530
You know as you said underpins though, it's a clear form of communication

1203
01:29:36,730 --> 01:29:37,850
That's that's still

1204
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:42,110
What's what's going on and what is behind it?

1205
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:43,610
well, I mean

1206
01:29:46,110 --> 01:29:49,410
Sometimes you sometimes you just want it. Well, I

1207
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:53,890
Shouldn't say it like this, but if it's better to make it go away than to figure out who's behind it

1208
01:29:53,890 --> 01:29:55,650
You may not want to go that way

1209
01:29:55,650 --> 01:30:01,390
Yeah, because we're talking about on their side the lowest being still have an IQ around a million

1210
01:30:03,370 --> 01:30:06,210
So you can try before going to sleep?

1211
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:13,510
Standing up opening your the the door, you know the front door to your domicile and yelling get out

1212
01:30:14,230 --> 01:30:18,630
Really loudly and then slamming the door. Yeah, good. See give that a shot

1213
01:30:19,230 --> 01:30:25,310
Yeah, they get the message. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but nonetheless it's it's yeah

1214
01:30:25,310 --> 01:30:27,310
Well, by the way, we do appreciate that

1215
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:33,270
That means that you're doing more than hearing you're actually listening to what's being said and reporting back

1216
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:34,850
your experience

1217
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:38,610
Which is one of many I guess it's like a snowflake

1218
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:43,380
you know in a snowstorm you can examine a snowflake and it's quite unique and

1219
01:30:44,270 --> 01:30:46,370
just like most people you will have

1220
01:30:47,630 --> 01:30:48,130
a

1221
01:30:48,990 --> 01:30:54,290
Unique way of interacting with this reality, but nonetheless it's still a snowstorm

1222
01:30:55,310 --> 01:30:59,050
And at cursory view it all looks the same and it piles up everywhere

1223
01:30:59,930 --> 01:31:01,270
and there's lots of

1224
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:06,090
quote-unquote accounts that people can deliver and communicate, but essentially

1225
01:31:07,350 --> 01:31:09,390
it's external the

1226
01:31:10,030 --> 01:31:16,130
The input is external the the understanding of headquarters. I call headquarters the soul

1227
01:31:16,890 --> 01:31:22,910
The spirit and the body which is saying the breath the mind and the body. That's what animates

1228
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:25,230
The being at this point

1229
01:31:26,650 --> 01:31:30,690
And by the way still I am still met personally by the way in discussion

1230
01:31:30,690 --> 01:31:34,490
With just being a mint resistance to defining any of that

1231
01:31:34,490 --> 01:31:39,330
I mean the body they kind of like don't want to discuss it seems obvious even though it's not and

1232
01:31:40,130 --> 01:31:46,370
You bring up the soul man. Oh, wow people get so upset you try to define those things. I

1233
01:31:46,370 --> 01:31:48,790
Had a discussion someone the other days

1234
01:31:50,650 --> 01:31:55,330
Recently talking about how effective a blowgun is right, you know the dart through the tube kind of thing

1235
01:31:55,330 --> 01:31:59,330
I'm saying oh, I got a nickname for that. We'll call it the soul gun, right?

1236
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:00,930
so

1237
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:07,830
It's so practical. I think people still have an extreme resistance to practicality and

1238
01:32:07,830 --> 01:32:14,830
Accessing technically accessing at least in their mind what I mean technical access is you be able to communicate it with words accurately

1239
01:32:15,470 --> 01:32:17,170
pretty much anything in reality

1240
01:32:18,930 --> 01:32:22,110
They they still don't want that and I could see why

1241
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:23,670
ultimately

1242
01:32:24,490 --> 01:32:26,150
you know the last thing that

1243
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:33,870
You might want to have to keep this place under control of seven billion people that are aware and knowledgeable and can communicate that

1244
01:32:33,870 --> 01:32:35,330
awareness and knowledge

1245
01:32:36,570 --> 01:32:37,350
You know

1246
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:42,450
You think about it because then you won't no longer have stupid people in large groups

1247
01:32:42,450 --> 01:32:47,090
The danger kind of goes away, and you might act rationally

1248
01:32:47,090 --> 01:32:56,920
Too rationally, so yeah

1249
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:03,760
Those dreams things keep coming back don't they or dream stories or dream concepts, but Seth

1250
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:07,220
You know I just want to throw this in we haven't pretty much discussed this in a long time

1251
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:12,340
If anyone does a little bit of homework, they'll discover when they hear the word soul

1252
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:20,040
It means the word breath, and it's pretty material, but immaterial like wind you don't really see

1253
01:33:20,700 --> 01:33:25,400
The wind you see its effect you don't really see the soul you see its effect it animates

1254
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:30,940
It's a pulsing action, and you do share the same salt soul with everything else that breathes

1255
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:37,660
Right like in other words something known as resuscitation or CPR or?

1256
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:42,940
You know you can resuscitate an animal by putting your soul in its body and breathing in it

1257
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:47,340
I know this is making most people cringe because you know they don't want to look at it

1258
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:55,020
But that's whenever you hear in the Greek influence the prefix PNU new like pneumonia pneumatic

1259
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:58,360
Pneuma in Greek that Pneuma that means

1260
01:33:59,220 --> 01:34:00,260
breath simply

1261
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:05,520
Inhaling and exhaling put a piece of glass or a mirror up to the mouth and nose and exhale

1262
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,960
And you will see it fog up that is your soul or the soul you're using

1263
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:16,260
And the spirit is the mind in Greek. It's the psyche or the psyche so whenever you see a PSY

1264
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:18,280
prefix psychology psychotic

1265
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:23,900
Psychic psychology all that PSY it means the mind

1266
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:30,440
When you go to a psychiatrist he's dealing with the mind and by the way anyone who wants to go see a psychiatrist should have

1267
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:32,180
their head examined, but nonetheless

1268
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:39,220
People will fight you if you discover this by the way to be the way

1269
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:41,740
It's communicated you will not make any friends

1270
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:44,680
No one wants to talk to you, but you will have a deep sense of satisfaction

1271
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:52,360
You're getting a grip on communicating technically and accurately what is going on with headquarters meaning yourself

1272
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:59,400
You have a mind you have a soul you have a body and no folks. They're not interchangeable and

1273
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:06,580
When you go into something called a concordant definition that just means an accepted term of its use like

1274
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:09,320
Concordantly the word nice means pleasant

1275
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:11,920
Or good

1276
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:18,040
Etymologically and what the word really means is foolish senseless and stupid

1277
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,200
So let's just say this. This is not a nice show

1278
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:23,320
hopefully

1279
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:26,020
And if it's a great show

1280
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:31,740
That's yet to be discovered. Please folks. Don't ever put in the chat. This is a great show

1281
01:35:31,740 --> 01:35:34,900
You got to come up with a different word because that doesn't mean much

1282
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:36,780
But anyway concordantly

1283
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:40,400
So there you go if you want to make people cringe

1284
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:46,000
especially the people in the New Age movement those talking about the spirit and the soul and Ascension and

1285
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:51,440
Peace and love and making the world a better place and all this stuff you usually hear

1286
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:54,900
When you hear talk like that I

1287
01:35:55,500 --> 01:36:00,320
Kind of listen to it a little bit because I'm thinking the next thing that they're going to discuss with seriousness is advanced

1288
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:02,240
nose-picking and underwater basket weaving

1289
01:36:06,970 --> 01:36:09,870
Advanced advanced nose-picking. Yes

1290
01:36:09,870 --> 01:36:14,330
They yeah, it's just bizarre folks. So yeah, here's your you know

1291
01:36:14,330 --> 01:36:21,750
Here's your commentary on what's going on and you will find it to be true. By the way, let's just throw this in

1292
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:26,390
If you're looking at any ancient text in the Chaldean Hebrew

1293
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:33,670
Aspect of it even ancient Egyptian you will find the Nef what's any any F phonetically Nef?

1294
01:36:34,470 --> 01:36:40,830
Is the breath that's why sometimes if you read some stuff out of ancient Egypt, well, you probably won't but anyway

1295
01:36:41,550 --> 01:36:47,890
You'll see that fish have an F also, you know, so they breathe and birds have an F doesn't mean spirit

1296
01:36:47,890 --> 01:36:52,410
They'll translate that as spirit as the mind to confuse just reverse it, you know

1297
01:36:53,070 --> 01:36:56,470
Instead of but if you want to prank someone who doesn't know where they're going

1298
01:36:56,470 --> 01:37:00,750
They ask you where they want to go. You it should be they should make a right hand turn up ahead

1299
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:06,450
You just don't make a left. Why cuz you like pranking? It's so simple. It's just say left instead of right and

1300
01:37:07,050 --> 01:37:09,370
You know that they're going the wrong way very simply

1301
01:37:10,690 --> 01:37:17,190
So when you when you look at any of the ancient languages in the Middle East area or eastern part, you will see Nef any F

1302
01:37:18,190 --> 01:37:20,590
as meaning breath and that's all it is and

1303
01:37:22,110 --> 01:37:24,890
Rook or Rook means spirit or mind

1304
01:37:26,530 --> 01:37:28,150
So when you come across that

1305
01:37:28,750 --> 01:37:29,610
And we're not playing

1306
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:32,170
word games here where

1307
01:37:32,690 --> 01:37:37,950
You know here rook, you know, like maybe the chess piece or something like that. It means the mind. It's something else but

1308
01:37:39,050 --> 01:37:40,010
Yeah, so you could

1309
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:45,250
Pretty much land those definitions and technically access the information held within

1310
01:37:46,070 --> 01:37:48,550
But if you go ahead and look at your concordant

1311
01:37:49,710 --> 01:37:53,090
Hmm definition shall we say very loose. They will always switch

1312
01:37:54,390 --> 01:38:01,550
Spirit and soul definition not almost well almost always right Seth you look up spirit in

1313
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:07,790
most I mean the text that I'm familiar with that have concordance I

1314
01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:09,790
Would say that there are

1315
01:38:09,790 --> 01:38:12,410
rare instances where it's

1316
01:38:12,410 --> 01:38:16,210
Accurate, but that only leads to the confusion

1317
01:38:16,210 --> 01:38:17,150
because

1318
01:38:17,150 --> 01:38:19,470
They're not consistent

1319
01:38:20,490 --> 01:38:24,510
With translating one word into one and one into the other

1320
01:38:24,510 --> 01:38:28,030
They will it's that's how confused that is

1321
01:38:28,030 --> 01:38:29,950
that even in

1322
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:31,950
one passage where

1323
01:38:31,950 --> 01:38:40,290
You know Nefesh is translated as soul. There will be a later passage where it is translated as spirit

1324
01:38:41,010 --> 01:38:47,690
Into you know English, which is what I'm familiar with. But yeah, so it's just leads to leads to the confusion

1325
01:38:47,690 --> 01:38:49,110
That's why I suggest

1326
01:38:49,870 --> 01:38:54,350
Anyone looking at stuff like that, you know, there are tools available

1327
01:38:55,050 --> 01:38:57,090
Readily if you have access to the Internet

1328
01:38:58,090 --> 01:39:00,790
that make looking up the

1329
01:39:01,530 --> 01:39:02,670
memorialized text

1330
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:03,950
relatively easy

1331
01:39:04,570 --> 01:39:10,010
It can still lead to confusion. I suppose but right for singular words

1332
01:39:10,010 --> 01:39:16,050
I mean you can it's relatively easy to do a word search and find each instance of that word and

1333
01:39:16,050 --> 01:39:21,590
What is being described in context and whatnot that can provide a little bit of clarity

1334
01:39:21,590 --> 01:39:26,450
so yeah grabbing the hold of the definitions of

1335
01:39:26,450 --> 01:39:28,350
prefixes and suffixes helps

1336
01:39:29,370 --> 01:39:30,170
as well

1337
01:39:30,910 --> 01:39:36,350
And you'll see how overt these things are. But then again, this is just an opinion. That's your opinion, man

1338
01:39:36,350 --> 01:39:41,170
Yeah opinion just washes everything away. You know folks when you are in discussions and

1339
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:48,690
Something is either propped up or discounted or agreed with as an opinion or because a group of people are agreeing with something

1340
01:39:48,690 --> 01:39:49,890
Makes it true

1341
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:57,070
You're all you know what you're really doing that is a group of space heaters you are just heating up the room

1342
01:39:57,930 --> 01:40:02,610
There's no purpose there. What's going on? So snap out of it folks

1343
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:06,310
I've been brought into several discussions through

1344
01:40:06,310 --> 01:40:12,910
Several periods of time and I hear someone just talking about the stuff. That's just unfounded rubbish and

1345
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:16,170
a

1346
01:40:16,170 --> 01:40:19,250
Bunch of people come out of it and say I agree with that and all of a sudden

1347
01:40:19,890 --> 01:40:24,620
The topic is done and it's closed and it's true because they agree with it

1348
01:40:25,130 --> 01:40:26,230
All right. Now we'll

1349
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:29,720
go to the store and buy a whole bunch of space heaters and

1350
01:40:30,830 --> 01:40:31,950
Put on one of them

1351
01:40:32,290 --> 01:40:33,110
You know

1352
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:38,750
The moon is made of cheese and then put a label on the other three space heaters

1353
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:45,030
Let's say I agree with that and that's objective what I am objectifying in conversations here

1354
01:40:45,870 --> 01:40:47,810
Stop being a space heater folks

1355
01:40:49,230 --> 01:40:50,790
Snap out of it

1356
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:53,290
Anyway, I just thought I'd throw that in as a mini rant

1357
01:40:54,150 --> 01:40:57,590
So I think some people do take offense by the way

1358
01:40:58,150 --> 01:40:58,670
describing

1359
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:05,390
People as morons or imbeciles or idiots, maybe we'll just switch over to space heaters. I mean, does that sound a little better?

1360
01:41:06,970 --> 01:41:08,670
It's less derogatory to

1361
01:41:09,270 --> 01:41:16,130
To shoot then some of the other terms are yeah. Yeah, and by the way, they're not they're not sheep. Oh, they're goats

1362
01:41:16,130 --> 01:41:21,350
You know sheep have a very very particular diet goats will eat anything, right?

1363
01:41:22,370 --> 01:41:24,090
Yeah, boy. Yeah

1364
01:41:24,970 --> 01:41:28,370
So yeah objectified people if you can

1365
01:41:34,270 --> 01:41:34,870
Yeah

1366
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:37,790
discernment discernment is

1367
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:38,950
important

1368
01:41:39,990 --> 01:41:43,130
In you know taking in any sort of information

1369
01:41:44,870 --> 01:41:51,850
They're not validating anything, you know, there's a level of comfort though, you know, that's the other thing that can be discussed

1370
01:41:53,110 --> 01:41:56,150
They're the the physical body and the soul

1371
01:41:56,150 --> 01:41:56,290
The physical body and the soul

1372
01:41:57,370 --> 01:42:02,930
Tend to create the the background for the mind if the you notice if the body

1373
01:42:02,930 --> 01:42:07,330
Well, let's say let's go in reverse if something disturbing enters the mind

1374
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:13,410
There's a change in the soul in the physical body, you know, like if you get bad news or threatening news

1375
01:42:13,410 --> 01:42:20,170
The breathing pattern the soul changes and the body becomes tense. Let's say or changes and vice versa

1376
01:42:20,170 --> 01:42:26,890
If the body becomes uncomfortable and the breathing pattern and the soul change the it's expressed through the mind as well

1377
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:27,730
communication

1378
01:42:28,850 --> 01:42:29,450
so

1379
01:42:30,950 --> 01:42:35,730
One should kind of consider this tripartite existence

1380
01:42:36,910 --> 01:42:38,630
And it's a balancing act

1381
01:42:38,630 --> 01:42:44,330
It's very hard to have a clear mind if the soul or the body and the breath are suffering

1382
01:42:44,890 --> 01:42:45,930
or enduring

1383
01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:54,130
Something traumatic or challenging and vice versa if the mind endures something a bit of information

1384
01:42:55,190 --> 01:43:00,930
It is expressed through the breath and the breathing. Let's say of the individual or being and the body as well

1385
01:43:00,930 --> 01:43:04,910
So we've never really gotten into the juggling act between those three

1386
01:43:06,990 --> 01:43:09,550
Because you can actually just command one aspect

1387
01:43:10,090 --> 01:43:13,550
Like slow down your breathing that would be slowing down the soul

1388
01:43:13,550 --> 01:43:17,210
It has an effect on the mind and it has an effect on the body

1389
01:43:17,910 --> 01:43:19,170
Or just strictly

1390
01:43:19,730 --> 01:43:21,070
affecting the body, you know

1391
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:24,390
Elevate the body or you know rapidly move

1392
01:43:24,390 --> 01:43:29,370
The body has an effect on the breathing and on the mind or then on the mind think about this

1393
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:32,930
It'll have an effect on the breathing and effect on the body. So either

1394
01:43:34,010 --> 01:43:35,590
Affecting each individual one

1395
01:43:35,590 --> 01:43:40,670
We should be strictly the mind the spirit or the soul of the breath or the body will have an effect on the other two

1396
01:43:41,230 --> 01:43:43,830
So it's a juggling act, you know

1397
01:43:43,830 --> 01:43:56,300
in essence and we've never really gone into the details of that, but who wants to talk about juggling in detail anyway, so

1398
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:01,700
And by the way, I'm just going to reiterate one of the things since we're talking about juggling acts

1399
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:04,600
there's something interesting about

1400
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:07,940
beliefs now one way to look at

1401
01:44:09,120 --> 01:44:12,820
an interesting way about how beliefs can or should work as

1402
01:44:12,820 --> 01:44:17,600
A belief is a process of technically accessing communication

1403
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:24,000
Of something that has happened in the past or something that will happen in the future

1404
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,320
What I mean has happened means it's tangible

1405
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:31,900
Like a belief for example rational belief can be that you had a grandfather

1406
01:44:33,120 --> 01:44:36,740
Or a grandmother or a great-great-grandmother because you're here now

1407
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:42,480
There is a certain biological interest in line that continues through that even though you may not have met them

1408
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:44,640
It's very plausible that you did

1409
01:44:45,180 --> 01:44:46,580
Right or something, you know

1410
01:44:47,260 --> 01:44:52,200
Also another belief in the future would be like for example if you said you're going to meet someone tomorrow

1411
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:53,880
And they're going to give you a silver coin

1412
01:44:53,880 --> 01:45:00,900
Well, it hasn't quite happened yet and between now and that event happens if someone asks you where you're going

1413
01:45:00,900 --> 01:45:05,160
You're saying that you believe you when you meet this person you will get a silver coin

1414
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:09,100
It's based on communication information and something that is tangible

1415
01:45:10,020 --> 01:45:15,140
Now what you will come across typically in society is when people discuss beliefs

1416
01:45:16,120 --> 01:45:23,940
It'll be an unfounded irrational thought and they're kind of like winking and waiting for a response whether someone agrees with them or not again

1417
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:27,380
Like that makes it real. So this term of belief

1418
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:33,000
Has been thrown around in society again and has become

1419
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:39,280
Part of the poetry or prose that people are engaged in which again has

1420
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:42,560
Dropped fall of dropped flat on its face

1421
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:43,960
people

1422
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:48,140
being able to technically access rational communication

1423
01:45:48,760 --> 01:45:53,220
and all of a sudden there's an entire industry based on belief that the things that

1424
01:45:54,220 --> 01:45:56,660
Pretty much might defy the the term

1425
01:45:57,420 --> 01:46:00,640
Have we ever discussed that? I think we've discussed that in passing stuff

1426
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:04,080
Perhaps what beliefs might be and what people believe in?

1427
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:06,340
Yeah, not in-depth

1428
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:08,060
not broadcast

1429
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:10,920
Yeah, so when you hear about people

1430
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:13,800
bringing up beliefs the mind

1431
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:16,960
would behoove the mind to

1432
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,080
Go and see

1433
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:25,500
If what they're discussing is rationalized in any fashion or any form, you know very often, you know

1434
01:46:26,600 --> 01:46:30,040
There's a way to address people that are spiritualists

1435
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:33,980
or people in the spiritual community about beliefs and they will

1436
01:46:34,700 --> 01:46:41,500
Also lack the rational comprehension of what they're discussing. See when you ask questions in any quote-unquote religion

1437
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:47,760
About either the those that are part of the group or leading the group what their beliefs are based on

1438
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:49,420
They will try to emphasize

1439
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:55,420
That it's about belief and when you try to find out what they're believing in they don't know much about it

1440
01:46:55,420 --> 01:46:58,220
So it's a term that's been hijacked. I think it's an emotional

1441
01:46:59,980 --> 01:47:02,100
Place that people go to hide

1442
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:09,400
it's been accepted and I think that once that term is is grabbed on to and looked at as

1443
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:15,340
Being a form of you know, trying to rationally communicate something. I don't think people will be able to hide behind

1444
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:21,520
The concept of a belief or belief system and I'm kind of waiting for that day

1445
01:47:22,160 --> 01:47:25,720
To come and it will be coming by the way in the future

1446
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:30,560
There will be a time where people will not be so lazy and hide behind this amorphous

1447
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:37,580
Irrational word. Well, that's you know, my belief and it's fine when they cannot describe or explain anything rational about it

1448
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:42,480
And I it's a it's a human cop-out. I call it and

1449
01:47:43,700 --> 01:47:48,780
Stop doing it folks. And when I say that it's probably only four or five people listening anyway, so

1450
01:47:51,580 --> 01:47:56,140
Either you four or five that are listening. Yeah, be careful when you use the term belief

1451
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:03,640
So I believe that these two hours are now over and we will probably be here next week

1452
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,000
Thank you, Seth. Thank you everyone

1453
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:08,160
See you again. Pleasure
