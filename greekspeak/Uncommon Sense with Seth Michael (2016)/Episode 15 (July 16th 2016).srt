1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,390
Welcome to Uncommon Sense. Hey Seth, go for it.

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:11,050
Greetings and welcome. Uncommon Sense here on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:18,410
My name is Seth and as well we are broadcasting with the Greek. Welcome.

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,770
Yeah, hi. You know, you said my name is Seth. Names are just sounds that people answer to

5
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:31,210
and if you're going to go to another language as written, it better sound the same.

6
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:35,810
In other words, names are exempt from language. So if your name is Tom,

7
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:42,630
no matter what language it's written in, when it's sounded, it better sound like Tom.

8
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,030
Otherwise, it's not the name. It's another name.

9
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,750
So it's very interesting how these things work.

10
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,650
I want to get into a few things on how things work or maybe how they don't work

11
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,830
and how they're working when they don't work. Got that?

12
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:07,330
One of the things, Seth, I wanted to discuss is how people get a lot of description but no explanation.

13
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,250
And it seems like when the explanations try to be brought forward,

14
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,270
everything gets lost because they're not used to it. They're used to descriptions.

15
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:25,190
So, for instance, you know, the cat is black. The house is red. You know, the sky is blue.

16
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,170
But when you get into why the cat is black, why the house is red and why the sky is blue,

17
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,690
you've lost everyone. When I say everyone statistically.

18
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,070
So I guess that comes with listening versus hearing things. Are you hearing things, Seth?

19
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:42,910
Yes.

20
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,470
Okay. Occasionally, right? Yeah.

21
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,590
Yeah.

22
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:51,830
Yeah. It's best to listen. So now that we're here, also check your audio, Seth.

23
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,530
You're a little fuzzy there. It sounds like you're speaking between some fuzzy dice.

24
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,730
So, yeah, this is another episodic sonic adventure.

25
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:12,190
And by the way, folks, if you want to contact Seth or the Greek, it's www.uncommonradio.com.

26
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,610
It's good to put the www in front of the Uncommon Radio and then .com after it

27
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,750
because Uncommon Radio on a regular browser search is very, very common.

28
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,990
No pun intended.

29
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,550
But, yeah, I was mentioning before we started the show that, you know,

30
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,070
partly when we did this adventure here on American Freedom Radio,

31
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,150
it was kind of like maybe structuring it mentally and, you know, sonically,

32
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:44,090
like the previous sonic adventure done here, making it kind of topical.

33
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,670
Discussing topics and things like that are edifying.

34
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,990
One can say they do help individuals,

35
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,910
and I'll give a long and a short list about what the future holds on this.

36
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,110
And, you know, discussing very specific topics.

37
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,450
But during the week of doing that, you know, this was weeks and weeks before,

38
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,070
I was listening to various forms of media, alternative and mainstream,

39
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,870
and just looking at what's on the Internet and even looking at print, you know,

40
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:16,230
going to a kiosk, going to a university library, for example, discussing with people things.

41
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:26,270
And the contrast between the mindset that's required to impart pertinent information,

42
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:32,050
contrasted to the mental state of humanity at large,

43
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:38,290
is so far that I decided subconsciously or without saying it, I'm saying it now,

44
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:44,390
not to be topical on many of the episodes because people have just lost it.

45
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,950
When I say people, I mean all of humanity across the board.

46
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,750
That's why I started off by saying people just want to hear descriptions.

47
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,850
They can't listen to explanations.

48
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:04,590
And before we get into any more of that, would you say it has something to do with discernment?

49
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,650
Would you say it has something to do with paying attention?

50
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:13,650
Would you say it has something to do with just paying attention or looking at what's obvious?

51
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,430
I mean, is it possible?

52
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,190
You know, give an example.

53
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,990
Lawfully, it appears to be the last week of the fifth month.

54
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,510
Now, I want to bring this up again.

55
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:30,930
I've been speaking about this for over a decade, but I don't even know how to keep time.

56
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:38,230
You are on, you, whoever is listening, have associated with people or in fact yourself,

57
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:45,290
have wholeheartedly accepted the papal work schedule known as the Gregorian calendar as a timepiece,

58
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,090
and it's not.

59
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,690
The same way you've accepted little pieces of paper as money when it's not.

60
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,230
The same way you've accepted little pills that you take as medicine, and it's not.

61
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:03,030
The same way you've accepted entitled classes to help you, and they're nothing but pranksters and predatory.

62
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,030
So here's the point.

63
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,010
I want to bring this because I had someone bring up a question.

64
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:18,530
Today, according to the Muppet World, Muppets and Puppets, it's July 16th, 2016.

65
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:19,890
Okay.

66
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,150
And it's what they call a Saturday.

67
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,250
Okay.

68
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:28,870
Now, let's go back to what they call 2015 on Muppetdom.

69
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,990
And July 16th was on what's called a Thursday.

70
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:34,630
Okay.

71
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,170
Now, let's go to the Muppet year of 2017.

72
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,350
No offense to Muppets, by the way.

73
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,040
And let's see what they call July 2017.

74
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,180
The 16th is on what they call a Sunday.

75
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,240
All right, folks.

76
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,700
Let's just be reasonable.

77
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,420
No, no, no.

78
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,220
Actually, it's a lot.

79
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,840
Let's be semi-reasonable.

80
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,840
Just a little bit, incy-wincy, teeny bit reasonable, please, with sugar on top.

81
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,680
Just be a little rational, please, just for a minute.

82
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,820
By the wind-up toy known as the clock.

83
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,060
Let me ask you, is July 16th a Thursday, a Saturday, or a Sunday?

84
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,920
Nobody got an answer.

85
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,520
You know why?

86
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,440
Because there is no answer.

87
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,080
It's what you are told.

88
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,340
Anyone's old enough, you remember when the new year came around,

89
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,340
according to the Pope's work schedule,

90
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,140
we got to go to the harvester and get a free calendar,

91
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,520
or the card shop and get a calendar so we know what day it is.

92
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,760
Yep.

93
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,480
And you know what, Seth?

94
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,460
No one, and I mean no one, is talking about this at all.

95
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,600
It seems to escape everyone.

96
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,340
Obvious.

97
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,900
Now, why is it obvious?

98
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,860
Well, I just showed you why it's obvious.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,080
Just five minutes' worth of research, if you could call it that,

100
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,100
which research means to search again.

101
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,720
So, you know, first of all,

102
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,780
most of the people today are so numbed and dumbed down that they'll tell you

103
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,820
time doesn't exist, it doesn't matter, that's fine.

104
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,980
That's why there are plastic brooms and reflective vests

105
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,440
and toilet brushes and things like that.

106
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,500
And, you know, there's lots of work that needs to be done to maintain stuff.

107
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,180
You should be doing it.

108
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:31,620
But those people that want to understand the structure of how things work,

109
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,560
not just by description or explanation,

110
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,540
need to realize that there is something called lawfulness and unlawfulness.

111
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,220
So this is just one example.

112
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,520
Just like the money system, many people talk about the money system,

113
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,510
but do you endorse it, right?

114
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:51,910
What does that mean?

115
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,290
I had someone ask me, what do you mean by endorse it?

116
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,310
And it's like, you've got to shake your head, you know.

117
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,650
So what's uncommon is the obvious.

118
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,730
The last thing for mankind to discover is what's obvious.

119
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,480
So how obvious can it be?

120
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,710
And what is the obvious?

121
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,350
Hey, what do you think, Seth, should we bring up what obvious means?

122
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:22,770
What is that, etymology online, that's the easiest one.

123
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,990
I'm not really happy at those folks, by the way.

124
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,350
But they do a good enough job, I think.

125
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,450
Like a lot of the Internet, it only has what it has.

126
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:40,169
Church is an interesting one to look up on etymonline as well.

127
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,030
Maybe we can get into that.

128
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,130
I did a little bit of that earlier this week.

129
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:52,790
But obvious, adjective, 1580s, frequently met with from Latin, obvious,

130
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,370
that is in the way, presenting itself readily, open, exposed, commonplace.

131
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,870
From obvium, adjective, in the way, from ob, which is against,

132
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,370
and vium, accusative, via, which is way.

133
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,870
So meaning plain to see.

134
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,490
Yeah, first reported in the 1630s.

135
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,930
Okay, so what's been memorialized as what that word means is not far,

136
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,270
I mean, the way we're using it is pretty accurate, I'd say.

137
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,850
It's not like the word average.

138
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,390
Have you heard of it?

139
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,710
It's just an average joke.

140
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,210
It's just average.

141
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,670
People think it's just like a median thing or something.

142
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:39,770
Actually, average means damaged, which, again, damaged merchandise or goods.

143
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,470
So in many cases, upon more critical, slightly more critical observation,

144
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,750
you would find that to be true.

145
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:52,390
By the way, when things come up during the week or so,

146
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,750
more than a couple of times I do mention them on the show.

147
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,550
And I've heard this, this is the third time I've seen and heard this saying,

148
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,490
and I've got to tell you, it kind of rubs one the wrong way.

149
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,070
And it's something about the only wisdom there is,

150
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,950
is that one knows that they cannot know anything.

151
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:21,440
Now, if that is not a prankster's motto, I don't know what is.

152
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,560
And that's all I'm going to say about that.

153
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,400
But I think that you just watch what people say

154
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,500
and what they adhere to without thinking at all, at all.

155
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,240
And I mean zero thought at all into what's being said or done.

156
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,620
Again, paraphrasing, it says the only true wisdom there is,

157
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,920
is to know that one cannot know.

158
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,340
Now, Seth, you and I have done a little bit of discussion

159
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:48,480
and research on what was memorialized before us, and it's all about knowing.

160
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:55,800
And we've also discussed or myself brought forward the concept of the pranking.

161
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,630
So if that's not a prank, I don't know what is.

162
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:09,630
Now, is it solipsism, where people say it doesn't matter, it doesn't exist,

163
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,830
it's only in your mind?

164
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,850
Again, there's lots of jobs and tasks.

165
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,050
There's highway medians that need to be swept.

166
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,410
There's windows that need to be washed.

167
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,290
There are farms that need weeds pulled.

168
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:29,590
There are bodies, vertical bodies with able hands, billions of them.

169
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,450
We're not talking to you.

170
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,370
We're not talking about what these people think.

171
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,810
We're discussing about what can be said, what should be said,

172
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:43,830
to a rational thinking, rationally acting member of this planet.

173
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,990
Or I hate to say member of this society.

174
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,690
You don't want to be a car – what is it?

175
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,970
The reason you don't want to be a member, perhaps,

176
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,350
is I wouldn't want to be a member of any club that would accept me as a member.

177
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,750
But you guys get the point.

178
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,410
No one is paying any attention.

179
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,790
We've given many examples on how no one is paying any attention,

180
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:04,830
neither do they want to.

181
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,130
Now, what is one to do?

182
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:08,990
Absolutely nothing.

183
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,110
But should one speak about it?

184
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:11,590
Absolutely.

185
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,370
I think it should be said.

186
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:19,990
Again, I think that doing a quote-unquote radio show

187
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:24,930
on a minor Internet radio station for four or five listeners is a bit overdone.

188
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,610
But nonetheless, we're here, and there are many things to be presented.

189
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,930
But, again, just to preface on what I mentioned earlier,

190
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:40,550
making each episode sort of topical in nature and to edify individuals

191
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:46,330
and then looking at the individuals and the mindset that they are engaging in,

192
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:55,410
the contrast is so great that just basically showing up here with Seth once a week

193
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:02,350
and trying to get the cobwebs out, just kind of shake people up.

194
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,670
There was a scene in a film called Moonstruck with Nicolas Cage and Cher.

195
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:12,510
It's a short scene, and he's going on and on about being manic-depressive or something,

196
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,290
and she just walks up to him and slaps him in a New York accent and says,

197
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,690
Snap out of it!

198
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:25,370
So we could slap people around for two hours a week and get you to just snap out of it, folks.

199
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,110
Snap out of it.

200
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:27,690
Pay attention.

201
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,290
I know it takes a little bit of work, but just like going to a gym,

202
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:36,790
you don't expect to go to the gym for the first time

203
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,370
and be in the Mr. Universe context by evening, do you?

204
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:40,970
Right?

205
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,790
So it takes a lot of work.

206
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,190
So maybe if we can get people sore between the ears here, Seth,

207
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,570
what do you think about that concept?

208
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,810
Are you sore between the ears yet?

209
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,710
That's a question for the listener.

210
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,830
Well, if you're not sore now, you're going to be later.

211
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,470
So how does one know?

212
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,410
What is knowing?

213
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,590
Knowledge?

214
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,030
Well, that's interesting.

215
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:15,530
There are several other words in other languages that we are used to when we bring up the definition,

216
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,350
and it's a functional thing, just like fear and love is functional.

217
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,970
You have to learn it.

218
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,670
Can you discern it?

219
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,930
In other words, can you know a lie or do you believe a lie?

220
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,970
If you know a lie is a lie, is that the truth?

221
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,890
Yes, it is, right?

222
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,980
So it's functional.

223
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,860
It's a functional characteristic to it.

224
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,140
Knowledge is something that we could look it up.

225
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,120
Shouldn't we do that?

226
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,200
What does the word knowledge mean and where it comes from?

227
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,680
Actually, I'll do that.

228
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,400
Let's bring it up.

229
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,700
Should we just look up know?

230
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,380
What do you think?

231
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,040
Because there's a lot.

232
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,680
There's gnosis, right?

233
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,040
We're speaking in English.

234
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,080
That's the other thing, folks.

235
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,160
When we're discussing things that have been memorialized in the past,

236
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,380
if we go back far enough, there was no English.

237
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,340
And I like to, if I use a word from another language,

238
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,580
I like to always discuss it in the language, Langua Franca, that we're speaking in,

239
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,960
so people don't brand you as being part of some strange group or something.

240
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,860
There's lots of strange groups I like to use,

241
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,840
especially Hebraic terms and stuff like that when they greet each other and things like that.

242
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,900
And I don't believe in switching languages.

243
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,960
I mean, kind of like stereotyping is brought in when you do that.

244
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,420
So I want to stick, when we bring up something memorialized,

245
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,380
jump around and discuss it in the language that we're speaking in.

246
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,060
But here, knowledge.

247
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,600
Oh, boy.

248
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,000
Gnosis.

249
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
Acknowledgement of a superior honor worship.

250
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,020
For first element, see no.

251
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,820
The second element is obscure, perhaps from Scandinavian.

252
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,180
Okay.

253
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,660
So to know, let's go to know the first element.

254
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,580
Oh, inside information in the know.

255
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,000
Okay.

256
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,480
Oh, that's the noun.

257
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,460
Verb.

258
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,820
It's a verb here.

259
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,480
Boy, there's quite a bit of it.

260
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,320
To perceive a thing.

261
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,100
I'm going to perceive a thing to be identical with another.

262
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,100
Also be able to distinguish, perceive or understand as a fact or truth.

263
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,340
Fact or truth.

264
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:20,640
Okay.

265
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,060
That's, you know, because fact or truth.

266
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,920
By the way, facts can, right, or truth are not the same.

267
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:27,680
Know how.

268
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,040
Okay.

269
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,100
Proto-dramatic, knew.

270
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,860
To know.

271
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:32,960
Okay.

272
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:34,700
Oh, boy.

273
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,920
Boy, do they get into it.

274
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,900
To have sexual intercourse with.

275
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,360
Well, that's what's in the King James, Old Testament kind of stuff.

276
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,480
When someone knew someone else, they're presuming that.

277
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:46,820
Okay.

278
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,260
To know.

279
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:47,760
Okay.

280
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,320
I like the bottom one.

281
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:50,940
Know nothing.

282
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,560
Ignoramus.

283
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,940
That's the one that tells you that wisdom now is being an ignoramus, right,

284
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,900
because there's a saying that's come up that wisdom is to know that you cannot

285
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,380
know or you know nothing.

286
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,560
So wisdom equals ignoramus.

287
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:14,460
That's like war equals peace and ignorance is education and very Orwellian in that sense.

288
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,859
So snap out of it, folks.

289
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,660
Snap out of it.

290
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,859
Get the cobwebs out.

291
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:23,260
You know, get into the leg press or get on the treadmill and, you know,

292
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,440
it is a dummy load, but work the body, man, work that body, mind, body at least.

293
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,300
Pay attention, folks.

294
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,900
Snap out of it.

295
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,200
So what do you think, Seth?

296
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,200
How would you sum up know?

297
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,360
I mean, do you want to read all five paragraphs?

298
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:36,900
I don't.

299
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,660
Basically, it's kind of self-descriptive,

300
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:49,300
but it's not giving us too many outside references to itself.

301
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,050
But there's a term that's bandied around called gnosis, right?

302
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,950
And there is no knowledge in the gnosis.

303
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,970
Anyway, people that use that term,

304
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:06,190
I've studied their work since their groups and, folks, there's nothing there.

305
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,510
It's kind of like going to a bank, you know.

306
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:16,090
Here's one that is relative, I think, to the conversation of anything else.

307
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:22,210
Latin, seer, S-C-I-R-E, to understand, perceive,

308
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:27,510
it's the same basis, science, science, and nations.

309
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,090
Cognizeer, you know, to know, to recognize.

310
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:37,230
So Latin, know would be seer.

311
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:44,370
So that's pretty basic.

312
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,550
I would say that it's to comprehend, not to understand, and implying agreement.

313
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:55,990
Whereas comprehension is more to know, you know.

314
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:06,180
But like most English, it's a little bit obfuscated.

315
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,460
And the way that we use it colloquially can mean a number of different things.

316
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,580
Have you ever heard someone say, you know,

317
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:23,320
reference it in the biblical form as in intercourse, Adam, his wife.

318
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,600
Check your audio, Seth.

319
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:26,780
Okay.

320
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,580
Yeah, another Chaldean Hebrew is it would be, I believe, da'at or ayada, yada.

321
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,960
And also those letters mean things, and you'll see that the aleph is in there, the first letter.

322
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,400
And in one of them it's doubled.

323
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:47,000
So what is knowledge?

324
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,400
Okay.

325
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,700
Do you have knowledge of something as being there?

326
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,080
You know, for example, first have knowledge.

327
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,760
But then if a person can't describe what they've seen, what good is that?

328
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:05,720
I think when you discuss knowledge, there has to be a level of discussion within the word.

329
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,340
Is it knowledge that can be communicated?

330
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,200
Is it knowledge that cannot be communicated?

331
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,620
I've read in places, written in the past,

332
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,600
that people had seen and known things that they could not speak.

333
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,320
You see?

334
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,380
Again, that's why I mentioned earlier, it's one of these functional terms.

335
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,280
It's how are you functioning with the term.

336
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:31,300
Just to kind of loosen things up, we've discussed using the media as an example, but we have to,

337
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,400
because this is where people go, basically.

338
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,760
They're sort of here now.

339
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,420
Things that are thrown in front of people by those with microphones

340
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:46,080
and those that hear them with speakers on the other side, oh, that's fear porn, or that's fear,

341
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,660
or you've got to love and all that.

342
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:51,600
Again, those words like fear and love, those are things that do not come naturally

343
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,020
and are not comprehended naturally.

344
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,380
In other words, when I mean naturally, it's like when you see an animal being born in nature,

345
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,260
they're pretty much ready, most of them, especially the four-legged ones,

346
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,820
are pretty much ready to go within a few hours, and they have a preloaded operating system.

347
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,800
You see, mankind doesn't have any of that.

348
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,680
And at this point, knocking around terms like fear and love and knowledge,

349
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:20,940
without understanding the function and understanding what they're really set up to communicate is for naught,

350
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,800
and it just becomes anything else that you hear going on.

351
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,900
It's just a description, something that evokes a feeling, but there's no substance,

352
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,000
and there's no communication.

353
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,060
Here's something, here's a way to put it up that I've never put it before.

354
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,800
Most of the stuff you folks hear is not worth memorializing.

355
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,040
Think about that for a moment.

356
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,350
Most of the stuff you listen to is not worth memorializing.

357
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,290
What does that mean?

358
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,900
Something that you record so you can go back later and read it or listen to it again.

359
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:02,620
Unless you missed it, and then if you missed it and you pick it up on a memorialized event,

360
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,720
you're like, oh, I just wasted two hours, or it made me feel a certain way.

361
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,400
You get a lot of feeling touching yourself, too.

362
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,880
But anyway, functional, like love, for example.

363
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,440
You have to learn how to love.

364
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,160
Love is not what you think it is, folks.

365
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:28,020
Fear, fear are things that are based on one's strength of mind or spirit and their skill level.

366
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,120
The example I give with fear is that if you don't know how to operate a dishrag or a mop,

367
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,400
you're a lot of fear of a glass of milk spills over,

368
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,760
but if a glass of milk spills over and the person next to you knows how to operate a dishrag and a mop,

369
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,440
then you say, don't cry over spilled milk.

370
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,140
It's no big deal.

371
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,820
Look, I know how to operate a dishrag.

372
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:48,920
I can fix it.

373
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:57,580
So all this stuff about fear that you guys talk about, you know, and it's just like, yeah, yeah, fear.

374
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,160
Yeah, I said fear.

375
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,740
Fear what?

376
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,880
What are you talking about?

377
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,020
Get the cobwebs out.

378
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,480
Pay attention.

379
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,300
What's being said?

380
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,700
Now, most people don't care to know what words mean and don't care about how they use them,

381
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,800
as long as everybody and their friends and everybody around them thinks they know what they mean

382
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,220
or get some kind of a point across them.

383
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:19,900
What's the point?

384
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,500
There's no point.

385
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,220
You're just taking up time.

386
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,440
Stop taking up time.

387
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,880
Make the best use of what you've got.

388
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:37,710
So with that said, anything else about paying attention, Seth?

389
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:42,270
Maybe like what else is obvious that people can discover?

390
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:53,380
Well, I'd say that a lot of what we discuss is relatively obvious in any way that you'd like to take that word

391
00:23:53,380 --> 00:24:00,240
colloquially or directly from the words that it's built from, ob and vm, you know,

392
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:07,480
because it's definitely in the way or against the way, ob being against and, you know, vm being the way.

393
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:14,460
This is definitely against what is perceived as being the way currently.

394
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:23,000
It's, I don't know, water, water, food, shelter.

395
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,320
Those things are all important.

396
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,200
Yes.

397
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:33,540
And, of course, people have lost sight of that as well and have accepted with apathy what there is.

398
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,940
You know, here, let's say we're visiting the planet.

399
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,980
We need to be objective.

400
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,460
We can't go back to the starship and tell the captain we really like, you know, strawberries.

401
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,940
He doesn't want to hear that.

402
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,300
He doesn't want to hear what we like.

403
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,320
He wants to hear about how things appear and what is going on objectively.

404
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,120
What's interesting is if you go to, this is regarding food, by the way, if you go through certain places,

405
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,420
especially the most active concentrated life force places would be like the rainforest, right, very dense.

406
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,620
If you went through the rainforest, you'd notice that the most colorful little creatures and things tend to be poisonous.

407
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:17,920
And what's interesting, then you go into man society where most of the civilized, quote-unquote, world gets their food.

408
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:24,640
You'll notice that in certain places where they have food on shelving, they're much more colorful than the others.

409
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:34,340
And you'll find that that is mostly the food that is promoted for the children, very, very colorful packaging.

410
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:40,380
And if you look at the ingredients, you will also discover it is also the most toxic.

411
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:47,780
Think about that, folks, how things run in parallel and no one is paying any attention.

412
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,650
So just a little commentary.

413
00:25:53,990 --> 00:26:01,110
I think we've also discussed in commentary what would an ancient perhaps or presumably observe

414
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:05,090
and how we would react in this society today.

415
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,690
And I've always said it wouldn't be any big deal.

416
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:13,510
Most of the things that get over in about 15 minutes, a couple of days for a few other things,

417
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,190
and they would be probably in horror other ways.

418
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,950
So pay attention, folks.

419
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,730
What is really going on?

420
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,330
What is really in front of you?

421
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,910
And if you think that nothing matters, well, that's fine, too, because you're not thinking.

422
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:32,890
So there's a shake the cobwebs out.

423
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:42,510
I think coming here for 16 weeks, roughly, or I think a couple episodes were down, but they're on Ustream,

424
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,830
so it's roughly around the 16th time we've come around.

425
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:49,650
It's too bad we've got to come around and just kind of like shake people around.

426
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,230
Between the years, there's a lot to discuss.

427
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:59,350
And what will be discussed in the future, by the way, by the Greek and perhaps Seth and others,

428
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,770
well, let's just say Seth and the Greek, will be things more topical in nature.

429
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:11,050
But you're going to have to approach them with a very, very, very, very, very, very, very clear mind.

430
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,390
I want to bring up a comment, Seth.

431
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,550
We've talked quite a bit about dreams and talk about being topical or not being topical.

432
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:24,630
Well, we've gotten over that pretty much, pretty well, I would say.

433
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:32,930
I noticed a comment back two weeks ago, I believe, where someone was – this is not to put the individual in the corner,

434
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,370
but sometimes you have to.

435
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,910
The individual says, I'm tired of this, all this poo-pooing of dreams.

436
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,710
You know, Pharaoh and Joseph in the biblical text, dreams are very important.

437
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,590
There's an example of someone who's not listening.

438
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:50,290
They're hearing that we're discussing dreams and they're hearing certain things,

439
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:54,510
but the way they strung it together in their mind is not what we were saying.

440
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,990
I can just apologize or defend, say we've never poo-pooed dreams.

441
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,010
We're actually giving the origin of it.

442
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:09,890
Now, very often when you have a high level of misdemeanor or criminality, harsh language is required.

443
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:14,970
So maybe we were kind of harsh about bringing up that you're being plugged by lower level entities.

444
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:15,350
Yes.

445
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:23,710
The reason why it's safe to address the general public as such is because most of the general public is not Pharaoh.

446
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,990
Most of the general public is not in a high position.

447
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,630
And most of the general public is not in the position that Joseph was, as you say.

448
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,510
We're not poo-pooing dreams.

449
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:38,850
We're simply giving the origin.

450
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:45,530
And why the harsh language is necessary occasionally is because wherever you go, high and low,

451
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:54,250
and you will find the information to be not only inaccurate but untrue and so far removed from anything that's been memorialized.

452
00:28:54,330 --> 00:29:02,990
Now, I've noticed there has been a very big trend in the past decade or so to reinvent everything and not look at anything that's come before.

453
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:09,770
So we've all been, I guess, created about 100 years ago and everything before that doesn't matter.

454
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:22,970
So we're kind of putting things together in a way where it might sound a little bit harsh because the level of stupidity that's out there is unusually profound.

455
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:30,290
If you want to know what it is, well, it's everything before everything that comes on after.

456
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,030
So here's the point, folks.

457
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,590
Learn to discern what you're hearing.

458
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,230
And also, Seth, I believe that we do bring up a lot of prefacing.

459
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:50,670
We do tend to preface things quite thoroughly before we discuss them and when we discuss them to the level of it can be done with the mindset that can be perceived in public.

460
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,990
I guess most might be semi-public.

461
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:54,470
This is not terrestrial radio.

462
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:01,330
But nonetheless, there are many, many things that will be discussed.

463
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:09,890
Just to tie it back into what we started with earlier in the future, matters of how the human body works and what you can do about it.

464
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,530
I want to throw in a little testimonial, Seth.

465
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:17,650
We've discussed things about the human body at some extent.

466
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:26,530
Recently, a few weeks ago, someone was wearing short pants and sandals and they got caught in the middle of a catfight.

467
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:31,330
And I don't mean the kind of catfight you hear about in biker bars and things like that.

468
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,970
I'm talking about a real catfight, you know, like a little furry creature.

469
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,230
Pussies, okay?

470
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:45,430
And the person got equal amount of claw tearing on the left of the left leg and on the right of the right leg.

471
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:54,230
And they were very adamant about telling me about this and showing me a week later the injury.

472
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,610
What they said to me was, look at this leg.

473
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,690
It's really scratched up and red.

474
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,850
Now look at the other leg.

475
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,490
You see nothing, absolutely nothing but clear skin.

476
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:10,750
And I said, well, why are you showing me this?

477
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:14,410
Well, they said that both legs had the same amount of injury.

478
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:18,930
The one that you still see the scratches on is the conventional way of treating it.

479
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:25,650
And on the right was the way that you describe on how to treat a wound.

480
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:29,910
And there was not one mark on the body whatsoever.

481
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:34,390
So these things will be discussed very, very simply.

482
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:41,650
I've been in a situation, for example, where I was holding a piece of plastic in the hand and the drill bit slipped.

483
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,570
The drill slipped and drilled into the hand.

484
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,170
Yes, kind of funny to do that, kind of like the cartoons.

485
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,190
You don't feel much while it's happening, but it sure hurts later.

486
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:58,430
I have a medical person, a doctor acquaintance, and a week later we met up and I told him about the situation,

487
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,570
showed him the hand, and there was nothing visible.

488
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:06,330
And the doctor said, funny that, that same day I was working in the garden.

489
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:11,230
And I caught myself and went to the hospital and got stitches, and they showed me the scar.

490
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,910
Very, very, very, very visible.

491
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:20,190
These are the things we'll discuss, folks, things that you can do, practical.

492
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:26,230
I'm not going to talk about politics, all the stupid stuff that you hear everywhere,

493
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:31,190
like what's going on with taxpayer dollars, because there are no dollars and there are no taxpayers.

494
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:33,190
I'm being pranked.

495
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:44,410
I'm not going to talk about Planet X or past lives or if you came from beta reticuli or purple enema juice

496
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:50,010
or all the stuff that you hear about underwater basket weaving and advanced nose picking

497
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:56,630
that will never, ever, ever, ever come from Greek and Seth.

498
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:00,370
So many, many other things will be discussed.

499
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:03,250
One of the things we might discuss is weather.

500
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,830
Mark Twain said that everyone's always talking about the weather.

501
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,790
When is somebody going to do something about it?

502
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:20,330
I remember once being in a place called Houston, Texas, and near the highway you'll see these international symbols,

503
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:27,710
and it was basically a white background with a blue dot and two curved arcs around it.

504
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,530
I guess it's the international symbol for a hurricane.

505
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,870
And I asked the people, I said, what is that?

506
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,930
He says, well, that's a hurricane, and the arrow means get on the highway and leave.

507
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:46,630
And I'm like, so, okay, so when you have a bad storm coming, you mean you all just get on the highway and leave, right?

508
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,410
That's what you do?

509
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:51,110
Did you ever try like laying down and putting brown paper bags over your head?

510
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:52,970
Maybe that works as well.

511
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,930
So we're going to discuss things about that.

512
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,750
The galaxy.

513
00:33:59,290 --> 00:33:59,530
Yeah.

514
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,790
We put brown paper bags over our heads?

515
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:06,530
The Earth will be destroyed in 15 minutes.

516
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,610
Will it help if we lay down and put brown paper bags over our heads, right?

517
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:10,330
It's great.

518
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:11,550
They show them doing that anyway.

519
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:20,550
So if you have the urge to put a brown paper bag over your head, don't even bother, right?

520
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:27,130
We're going to talk about how to do food preparation, and we're going to talk about water preparation.

521
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:28,310
And what is water?

522
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:36,870
Because when you really discover what something is, you tend to not think of it the same way anymore, right?

523
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:45,469
And when you discover how things really work and what they are based on your own observation and rational thought that can be communicated and memorialized,

524
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,469
not all the tripe that you hear and are taught.

525
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:55,929
You will feel cheated, by the way, right, in many cases, right?

526
00:34:55,969 --> 00:35:02,670
If you still think the word nice means something pleasant and you're a rational individual, if you look up what that word means,

527
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:08,850
you might feel slightly cheated, like no one ever told you, and you were made a fool of by using it,

528
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:14,870
but no one really thought of you as a fool for saying the word nice meaning something pleasant, because guess what?

529
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:19,150
You're all surrounded by fools anyway, so there's no contrast.

530
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:26,090
So if you're ready for a contrast, and you're ready to bridge into the realm of explanation,

531
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:34,530
you might want to stay in touch and keep tuning into Seth, Michael, and the Greek.

532
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,450
We'll also discuss things about machines.

533
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,970
No pun intended, Seth.

534
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,470
You work as a machinist.

535
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:54,110
I mean, I don't know how much of spinning metal at super high speed with razor sharp carbide tool bits will help people, but nonetheless.

536
00:35:54,110 --> 00:36:01,530
It gives one a comprehension of precision at a very small level, very minute,

537
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:13,850
and how precision and just being able to apply those same concepts into communication adds, I don't know,

538
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:18,430
at least an idea of what being accurate is.

539
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:23,570
Like you said, a lot of preface goes before what is said.

540
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:31,050
We don't know if someone actually has a Bridgeport vertical mill in their living room or a hard edge lathe.

541
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,450
You never know.

542
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,110
Yeah.

543
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:38,650
I mean, look, I've seen people that are really into cars, car engines,

544
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:44,550
and when the engine is being worked on, it's on one of these engine dollies, and guess where?

545
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,290
They wanted to show me the motor.

546
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,430
Guess where they took me to show me the motor?

547
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,390
The living room right next to the coffee table.

548
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,930
So, yeah, you never, ever know.

549
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,230
But we will talk about machines and cars.

550
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:04,730
Yes, how cars work, how they really, really, really work, folks.

551
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:05,850
Yep.

552
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:12,110
And all those people in Detroit and wherever that design cars, they don't know how the engines work.

553
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,990
They're only there to design a certain part and move along.

554
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,410
How do I know this?

555
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,830
Because I've had discussions with them.

556
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,870
They don't know what's going on.

557
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:27,550
Just like people and your leaders in religion don't know anything about the books that they're supposedly based on at all.

558
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:28,610
Nothing.

559
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,090
Just like doctors don't know anything about the body.

560
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:39,070
Well, this is one thing they do know, speaking to dentists and other people in various medical fields.

561
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:46,270
If you push the issue on what could be done or should be done to the body, on a side note,

562
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,550
they are very forthright to tell you, well, the body will heal it.

563
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,990
Well, the body will heal it.

564
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:52,270
Right?

565
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:53,790
Okay.

566
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,510
So where's your research on that?

567
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,170
And how does it heal?

568
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,250
Yes, I know the description.

569
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,110
You know, it's funny.

570
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:06,710
If you ever bring an animal or someone to the doctor, you call up and you say why you want to visit, let's say,

571
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:09,450
a sprained ankle or an eye infection or whatever.

572
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:15,230
And upon presentation, the doctor looks at it and he's like, oh, you have a sprained ankle.

573
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,550
You're like, duh.

574
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,530
We told you that before we got here.

575
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,210
Because all they can do is describe things.

576
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:25,030
I've seen recently an animal being brought to the vet.

577
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,410
Told them the dog had an eye infection.

578
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:30,470
And this is, let's look at the animal, the dog.

579
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:33,530
And first thing the vet said all startled, oh, it has an eye infection.

580
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:35,050
Yeah.

581
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:37,270
Told you that.

582
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,030
But why?

583
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,030
They don't know.

584
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:41,450
Right.

585
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,310
They're just there to describe things, folks.

586
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:47,670
Give a little bit more than that.

587
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:49,430
Pneumonia is a good one.

588
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:51,550
You have pneumonia.

589
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:53,230
Hmm.

590
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:54,950
Yeah, you have.

591
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,230
Oh, yeah.

592
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:55,790
Told you that.

593
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:55,990
Yeah.

594
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,750
You have pneumonia.

595
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:58,310
What is it?

596
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,170
I don't know, man.

597
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,830
Yeah, it's just a painkillers, antibiotics.

598
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,070
Yeah.

599
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,790
Where'd you get your medical degree?

600
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:06,430
Huh?

601
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:06,830
Huh?

602
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:07,030
Huh?

603
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:09,850
Okay, folks.

604
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,550
We'll talk about going back to the cars.

605
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:20,010
Got stunned on that for a moment because it's so bizarre that how they really work

606
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:23,090
and what you can do about it if you're handy or if you have someone that's handy.

607
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:27,490
You'll be amazed what you can do with an automobile, just reworking what's there.

608
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:28,730
Yep.

609
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,330
Don't want you to know that.

610
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:52,550
Yeah.

611
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:55,810
Yeah.

612
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:55,910
Yeah.

613
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:56,010
Yeah.

614
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:56,150
Yeah.

615
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:56,250
Yeah.

616
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:56,350
Yeah.

617
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:56,450
Yeah.

618
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:56,550
Yeah.

619
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:56,650
Yeah.

620
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:56,750
Yeah.

621
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:56,850
Yeah.

622
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:56,950
Yeah.

623
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:57,050
Yeah.

624
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:02,080
Yeah.

625
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:04,260
Yeah.

626
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:04,420
Yeah.

627
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:04,520
Yeah.

628
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:04,620
Yeah.

629
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,880
just a reminder that I don't encourage people to just stop working and stop just hearing things

630
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:15,300
and repeating things unless you've got lots of carbon paper around.

631
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:25,460
So if you're tired of just listening to descriptions, you might want to stay in touch.

632
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:32,600
You notice we didn't bring up the dummy load and all the other stuff that prevails in society

633
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,820
and the pranking too much.

634
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:41,240
By the way, pranking, yeah we talk about the pranksters, you know who you are, but you

635
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:41,580
know what?

636
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,980
If you want to know who the first people that pranked you were in life, it's your parents,

637
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,380
folks.

638
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:47,840
Yep, sorry.

639
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,140
Not making it up.

640
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,760
So what kind of a start have you had?

641
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,560
Think about it.

642
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:02,580
Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, Gregorian calendar, you got to go to school, I know you're not

643
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:07,660
going to learn anything, but I did it, so you got to do it too, yeah.

644
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,680
And all the motivated through penalty.

645
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,040
If you don't get a degree, you're not going to get a good job.

646
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,320
Oh, hey mommy, why do I need a driver's license?

647
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:23,240
Oh, because if you don't get a driver's license, you're going to go to jail.

648
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,380
It's your parents talking, folks.

649
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,680
Not all of them, but most of them.

650
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,420
Every culture, doesn't matter what culture you're in.

651
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,500
What kind of a footing is that?

652
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,680
So parents, be kind to children, because they are your kind, right?

653
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,140
That emotional crap, by the way, when you talk about your children, doesn't work.

654
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,120
People that are rational.

655
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,080
Oh, I love my children, I really do.

656
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,460
Yeah, right.

657
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,270
Can you please write that down and sign it?

658
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,050
That's as an IOU.

659
00:41:55,410 --> 00:42:01,790
I responded to a post that an acquaintance had made in an internet forum recently.

660
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:08,350
It's not something I do often, but he was talking about current events in general, or

661
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:13,450
at least what the media provides as being those current events, and said, what's wrong

662
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:17,110
with, what did he say, peace, love, and understanding?

663
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:20,330
And I just took it like it was a question.

664
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,410
And so I answered it like it was a question.

665
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:29,430
I said, well, peace is stagnation, love is not comprehended, and understanding implies

666
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:29,810
agreement.

667
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,650
Those are, that's what's wrong with those three things.

668
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:33,330
So.

669
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:34,850
Very good.

670
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:39,350
Careful what you ask for, folks, especially when you're talking or writing the Seth and

671
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:39,730
the Greek.

672
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:40,730
Uh-huh.

673
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:44,430
Everyone, everyone attains peace, at least for a little while.

674
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:46,390
Or a long while.

675
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:47,710
Yeah, or a long while.

676
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:52,910
It's referred to as death.

677
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,850
Some cultures refer to it as hell or the grave.

678
00:42:58,770 --> 00:42:59,050
Or sleep.

679
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:00,450
Yeah, sleep, rest.

680
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:01,510
Greek.

681
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:02,010
Right?

682
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:02,930
Yep.

683
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:10,850
In Greek, to chemise, chemise is the prefix for sleep, and tideo is a place of, a cemetery

684
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,430
in Greek is chemitidio.

685
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:14,490
It's a place where you go to sleep.

686
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:20,090
Chemitidio could also mean like factory or a place that purveys a certain thing specifically.

687
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:28,690
So the word cemetery in Greek, or chemitidio, it's almost taken from Greek, means a place

688
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:30,450
where you go to specifically sleep.

689
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:37,950
And you got 7 billion people trying to search for what happens after you die, and a percentage

690
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:42,550
of society pranking them with all kinds of bull about going places.

691
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:43,990
So anyway, yeah.

692
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:48,630
And he lived 70 years, and then he slept with his fathers.

693
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:50,150
Uh-huh.

694
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:54,630
And every culture tells you you sleep, but yeah, yeah.

695
00:43:54,770 --> 00:44:01,070
But people, you know, it's funny, once I was on a public forum speaking, and after the thing

696
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:04,050
ended, a whole bunch of people ganged up on me and said, how dare you say there's no

697
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,930
such thing as reincarnation and being reincarnated.

698
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:10,070
All of the Asian people, they believe in it.

699
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,210
That means it's true.

700
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:13,550
I'm like, they've been pranked just like you have.

701
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:18,650
It's funny how the Westerners, I mean, it's pretty obvious that they've been pranked to

702
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:23,050
the hilt with Santa Claus and Easter Bunny and all that other stuff.

703
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:27,850
And I don't know, what's the groundhog and all the other gods that they have.

704
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:32,190
And they're running over to the East, Asian religions.

705
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,630
And boy, oh boy, this is one thing that I prefaced in private and I have said in public.

706
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:42,890
In the future, when knowledge is spread and things are acknowledged, the Western world,

707
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:49,110
Western man tends to take things in stride to a point where they're reasonable.

708
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:53,030
But in the Asian cultures, they get really upset, folks.

709
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:54,230
Like, give an example.

710
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:58,490
Like, you know how there's an issue with police here killing people now in the news,

711
00:44:58,690 --> 00:44:59,950
which is total crap.

712
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:02,930
So what if they kill 1,000 people a year in cold blood?

713
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:04,990
The doctors kill 3,000 a day.

714
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:05,790
The police kill 3,000 a day.

715
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:06,090
The doctors kill 3,000 a day.

716
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:08,190
At least half of that in cold blood.

717
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:09,810
I've been around them.

718
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:11,130
I've heard them talk about it.

719
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:12,130
It doesn't matter.

720
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:13,090
We have another one.

721
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:18,150
So you've got over a million being killed by doctors and no one's paying any attention.

722
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:19,250
So forget about the police.

723
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:20,110
Irrelevant.

724
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:29,110
But if you have police brutality in Asia, they don't go to the public square and protest

725
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:31,050
like the morons in the West do.

726
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:35,150
They know where the cop lives and they drag him out of his bed while he's sleeping

727
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:36,230
and club him to death.

728
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:38,850
This is how the Asians roll, folks.

729
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:40,670
Not all of them, but it is common.

730
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:46,870
In the future, when it's discovered, more than discovered and known,

731
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:50,830
that all the stuff that you've been taught in Asia by these little monks

732
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:54,250
that everyone thinks is, oh, so enlightened,

733
00:45:54,870 --> 00:46:02,190
those guys are going to be facing a level of, let's just say, let's not say,

734
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,190
that you have never heard of.

735
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:05,970
They're going to skin these guys alive.

736
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:09,930
All you little monks think you're so spiritual.

737
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:13,610
Their own people are going to do this to them.

738
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:22,090
In the West, what will happen is your average minister, preacher, whatever, whatever, priest,

739
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:24,310
will just deny ever being in that field.

740
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:28,370
He'll just deny it, and people will approach probably and say,

741
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:30,650
hey, I saw you wearing the uniform or the clothes.

742
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:31,430
No, no, that wasn't me.

743
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:33,910
I worked in this profession, you see.

744
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:36,130
They'll just lie about it and get away from it.

745
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:43,910
Where in the East, it's really going to be a lot of carnage because of you.

746
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:46,630
Yeah, so anyway, this is going to be interesting.

747
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:48,490
I just have one of those faces.

748
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:49,170
That wasn't me.

749
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:51,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

750
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,810
So this is not too far away, folks, about a decade or so.

751
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:59,030
And by the way, maybe on the second hour, we're going to recap what we've always been talking about,

752
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:02,570
which is the coming Middle East Union and what leads up to such a thing.

753
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:06,170
And something going on in the news actually over there.

754
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:07,470
Yeah, it's not yet.

755
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:08,510
Yeah, there is.

756
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:11,170
Yeah, it's just we'll preface it.

757
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:17,230
How can you have a union, not necessarily formal or informal, just a union?

758
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:20,310
Now, when I say union, how do you want to think about it?

759
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:24,490
Let's just say a loose confederacy of nations.

760
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:31,550
How can you have that when the alleged grouping of a group, let's say, is very nationalistic

761
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:36,670
and at odds with each other based on proximity or borders or policy?

762
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:40,070
Let's give Europe for an example.

763
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:45,930
How can you have a European Union if France is at war with Germany, Germany is at war with Greece,

764
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:49,450
Greece is at war with Italy, England is at war with Germany?

765
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:58,110
How are you going to have a union when you have highly nationalistic governments?

766
00:47:58,490 --> 00:47:59,470
How can you do that?

767
00:47:59,570 --> 00:47:59,970
You can't.

768
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:02,510
So all the teeth have to be pulled out.

769
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:04,090
Right.

770
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:05,610
So they can't bite each other.

771
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,750
So they all kind of go in the same pen together.

772
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,250
But this is going to be very, very different, folks.

773
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:17,950
And when it comes, when it comes, it'll be wholly accepted because you're being primed for it.

774
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:20,670
And you don't know it because it's obvious.

775
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:23,510
It's been memorialized for thousands of years.

776
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:26,070
It's rational.

777
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:31,270
For example, grandma used to say, all things go around, come around.

778
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:32,390
Right.

779
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:37,450
So we'll talk a little bit more about that perhaps in the next hour.

780
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:41,410
It's a good place to kind of maybe pick up a different topic or not.

781
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:49,370
But what you're witnessing and have been witnessing, by the way, this is a preface to what's coming as the Middle East Union,

782
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:55,410
won't be called the Middle East Union as such, but it will act as one.

783
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:07,010
What you're witnessing is a lot of fires to kind of tear things down there and keep tension going until the timing is right.

784
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:09,150
This is divine stuff, folks.

785
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:10,710
It has to do with the gods.

786
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:11,450
Yes.

787
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:16,650
We're not talking about Santa Claus now or all the other things you folks worship.

788
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:21,570
So we're talking about another society that controls this one.

789
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:27,690
And the rains will come in the next beginning, in the next few years.

790
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,430
They're going to put out all these fires there.

791
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:30,770
It's a metaphor.

792
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:37,690
And you're going to see roughly ten nations, which only nine exist at the moment, working together.

793
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:40,830
And that ninth nation, we've described where it will be.

794
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:43,890
We'll talk about it more in depth in the next hour.

795
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:46,870
We'll also maybe talk about what else to watch for.

796
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:51,610
And maybe a little bit about the Great Deception, which you're all going to fall for.

797
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:58,110
I can say that pretty accurately, all of you, except for a very, very, very, very small group.

798
00:49:58,750 --> 00:49:59,030
Why?

799
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:02,730
Why can one say that most people will fall for the Great Deception?

800
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:08,010
Because the Great Deception is based around, say it, Seth, peace, love, and understanding.

801
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:10,690
Peace, love, and understanding.

802
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:16,890
Yes, and when you get that, you will be told that this is how it's going to be from here on in,

803
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:19,910
and you're going to believe it, because why shouldn't you?

804
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:20,830
It's self-evident.

805
00:50:20,950 --> 00:50:21,490
You see it.

806
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:22,810
It's manifesting.

807
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:28,010
And when the glitches come in, we'll talk about it on the next hour, perhaps,

808
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:35,630
how horrible it's going to be on this planet, not only for the people, but for the bees, the whales,

809
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:39,510
the tigers, the caterpillars, the dogs, the cats, the squirrels, and the fish,

810
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:42,850
and everything that's alive, for several reasons.

811
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:48,450
That we will not get into detail how it will be and why it will be so difficult.

812
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:54,190
But we might in the future, let's just say semi-privately, perhaps.

813
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:59,670
Because, by the way, this kind of information is only going to be viable to be discussed publicly

814
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:01,050
for the next couple of years.

815
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:07,750
There's going to be a major change in public thought and the way things are transmitted, ideas,

816
00:51:08,510 --> 00:51:13,110
starting in roughly the spring, summer, fall of 2018, that year,

817
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:16,130
roughly what you call on the Muppet schedule, 2018.

818
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:19,270
And no one's ever noticing what happened all the years before that.

819
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:24,050
And, by the way, if you start pulling that Anno Domini crap and the Year of Our Lord crap,

820
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:29,370
I don't know what you're talking about, because if it's supposed to be based on the biblical text,

821
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:33,070
it wasn't born on the year zero.

822
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:36,210
It's very specific, the biblical text.

823
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:40,950
I know most of you want to pull the hair out of your head and set yourself on fire

824
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:45,010
and start chanting to yourself, just an opinion, just an opinion, just an opinion,

825
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:46,670
like an attorney does.

826
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:52,890
But when the biblical Christ was born, it can be down to about ten minutes.

827
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:56,330
But how many people care to look into that?

828
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:58,350
If you said none, that's pretty accurate.

829
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:03,350
So, anyway, there's many, many levels to this.

830
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:08,550
And if you're, like I used to tell young children, if you're not disgusted with humanity,

831
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:09,670
you're not paying attention.

832
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:13,690
So learn to pay attention, and you'll get over being disgusted,

833
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,210
and you'll learn how to function in it.

834
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:18,230
And the best way to function is to set yourself apart.

835
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:23,350
So, with that said, we have a few more minutes before this hour is wrapped up.

836
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:27,130
And I think what we wanted to do is sum up why we've been showing up here.

837
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:30,650
Perhaps get the cobwebs out of your head.

838
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:36,010
And the intent was to discuss many, many things, but have not been,

839
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:44,110
because of just the sheer profound laziness, dumbness, and numbness that I see in society.

840
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:49,770
And that doesn't mean that it won't be discussed in the future.

841
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:54,090
We're going to talk about, what is it, planes, trains, automobiles, the human body,

842
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,610
and we're going to talk about, what is it, technology, food, history, things to come.

843
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:59,730
All these things will be discussed in the future over time.

844
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:09,130
But I think what we've done here so far is, for two hours a week, folks,

845
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:12,890
you can have the cobwebs wiped out of the head if you're listening.

846
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:16,790
Now, if you're hearing things, well, that's, I don't know what to tell you.

847
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:19,870
If you hear things, leave some music on in the background.

848
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:24,030
It might distract other things that might be taunting you.

849
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:26,750
But if you're hearing things, I've got nothing for you.

850
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:32,930
We're speaking for people who know how to listen and want to know what things mean

851
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:36,310
and are looking for explanations because they're tired of descriptions.

852
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:43,100
What do you think about that so far, Seth, for the first hour here?

853
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:44,920
I think it's a good preface.

854
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,020
Yeah, I think so.

855
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,060
It's warm here. I'm having quite a bit of a cool drink.

856
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,860
And if you guys hear that.

857
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,320
So here we go, the first hour, and we're coming up on the second hour.

858
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:04,460
We might get into a little geopolitics of where the human mind is going to be going as well.

859
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,240
So stay tuned, folks. We'll see you soon.

860
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:18,080
Hello and welcome back to Uncommon Sense here on American Freedom Radio and AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

861
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,420
My name is Seth.

862
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,840
That's the sound that I respond to most readily.

863
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:27,860
And the Greek will be with us momentarily as well.

864
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:33,840
I would like to remind everyone that American Freedom Radio does appreciate your support.

865
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:43,200
If you enjoy hearing this program, if nothing else, you can go to AmericanFreedomRadio.com and donate.

866
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,080
They make it very simple, very easy to do.

867
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:49,680
Just follow the links through there.

868
00:54:50,240 --> 00:55:00,820
You can find Uncommon Sense on the Internet at UncommonRadio.com, www.UncommonRadio.com.

869
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,160
It's basically just a calling card.

870
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:08,680
You can find an email address to get into contact with the Greek and myself,

871
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:17,940
as well as where to hear the broadcasts and previous broadcasts as well.

872
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:21,760
There's also a blog spot that someone put together.

873
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,100
Thanklessly or thankfully they did.

874
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:34,200
It just shows you that someone is listening and feels that they want to put some of their time towards what's being said because it's important,

875
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,700
not because it's being said by us.

876
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,920
And that is JustGreekSpeak at BlogSpot.com, I think.

877
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:46,700
I think the link was posted in chat, but we'll probably post that on the Uncommon Radio.

878
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,860
And there's also a site, there's also a YouTube channel.

879
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,020
I don't know how well that's going to do.

880
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,240
I'm not a big fan of that.

881
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:58,100
Because sometimes we do use quote-unquote copyrighted material even though we give credit.

882
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,820
There will probably be an iTunes and other ways.

883
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:06,680
There will also be a way to do semi-public, semi-private, however you want to do it,

884
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:11,080
discussions on serious topics that can help people,

885
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:19,440
not about some planet or you came from some other universe or you're going to be reincarnated as a butterfly

886
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,760
and all this other tripe and garbage that you hear.

887
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:30,100
And it's going to be real stuff that you will prove to yourself that these things work regarding weather,

888
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:36,840
regarding automobiles, regarding food, regarding the human body, regarding past, present and future events,

889
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:41,860
regarding the mind, regarding love, fear, knowledge.

890
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:50,460
All these things will be discussed in great detail in a semi-public, semi-private forum yet to be established.

891
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:54,720
Don't know how, don't know where, don't know whatever.

892
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,720
But we know why, because it's not being said and it's just sad, folks.

893
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,460
Just really, really sad, the condition that humanity is in.

894
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:08,220
You're going to be known as the society that had everything

895
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:11,160
and not only threw everything away but ignored everything.

896
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,560
And just to reiterate, I can't believe people are actually writing,

897
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:19,440
the wisdom there is to know that you can't know.

898
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,900
Now if that is not a prank for a bunch of morons, I don't know what is.

899
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,480
Stop being pranked. Learn how to recognize the prank.

900
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:32,020
Learn how to recognize you're being mocked.

901
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:38,700
And learn how to recognize that you're being overfilled with descriptions lacking any explanation.

902
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:46,100
And all those explanations can be provided by just, yeah, you guessed it, searching for what is obvious.

903
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,740
Just like, for example, when you heat or cool a room indoors,

904
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,680
you notice how the heat goes to the ceiling and the cold goes to the floor?

905
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,300
So you have a hot head and cold feet all year round indoors?

906
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:57,400
And you have a cold head and cold feet all year round outdoors?

907
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,280
But this is a secret, folks.

908
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,000
The reason why it's a secret is we're saying it publicly.

909
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:06,520
If I say it, promise not to tell anyone, that when it's hot in the valley,

910
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,180
it's cool up at the mountaintop.

911
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,580
And if you get in a plane or something and go towards the sun,

912
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,940
which is allegedly a heat source, it gets colder and colder.

913
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:19,180
Because in all natural living biological systems,

914
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:27,040
you have an ascending, rarefying cold, and a descending, densifying heat. That's why

915
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:33,520
if you call a medical person and say I'm not feeling well, they ask you why. Well,

916
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,580
you tell them my head is hot and my feet are cold. Well, you're not feeling well, they

917
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:42,860
agree. Well, wait a second here, it doesn't sound right because heat's supposed to

918
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:46,740
rise and cold's supposed to go down. By the way, you bring up this discrepancy

919
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:50,540
between a rising cold and descending heat in biological systems to someone

920
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:55,420
who's gone through thorough quacademic or academic pranking, you watch their

921
00:58:55,420 --> 00:59:00,740
eyes roll back in their head like a slot machine because A, they're going to try

922
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:05,800
to describe, not explain, and then B, they will never ever ever ever ever ever ever

923
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:10,820
admit that they've been cheated and frauded by the quote-unquote system that

924
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:16,720
they have allegiance to. Just like most people can never ever ever ever admit

925
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:21,880
that they've been pranked by their parents. Sorry folks, you're a sick

926
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:29,620
society. Sick minds, as in psycho meaning mind and pathos meaning pain or sickness,

927
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:35,940
psychopathic society. Get over it. Don't have to be that way. Now, you're not going

928
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,960
to change it. Anybody, by the way, who says they're going to change the world or has

929
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:44,900
an idea or group to make things better is an idiot, a moron, and to be avoided

930
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:49,480
because it ain't going to happen. Everything's in a preset path at this

931
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:54,700
point and there is nothing you're going to do to change it. What is being

932
00:59:54,700 --> 01:00:03,420
discussed or at least the conversations that I overhear or that I see pieces of,

933
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:11,420
there's, you know, the fact that it is sick, you know, all of society is readily

934
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:18,860
apparent and but what is what is going on is everyone is picking the symptom

935
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:24,300
of that sickness that they dislike to be vocal about and saying that something

936
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:30,840
needs to be done about this symptom of this sickness and the actual, you know,

937
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:39,840
the root causes are completely and totally ignored. They're not even, the

938
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:44,940
they're not debated. They're just completely and totally ignored. Speak to

939
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:48,780
an older person, folks, anyone over 50 about any of the things that you might

940
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:54,160
have heard or listened to here. You know what they tell you? Generally, 99%. Well,

941
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,480
you know, I kind of bought into these paradigms, too, you know. I mean, what are

942
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,880
you going to do? This is just how it is, you know. I'll tell you what you're going

943
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,380
to do, you old fool. You'll learn how to set yourself apart and start giving some

944
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:09,480
good information to the younger folks. You younger folks, by the way, are screwed.

945
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:15,940
Avoid older people. Been reduced to morons. You're gonna have to go back. You're

946
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:22,020
gonna have to learn how to seek information. But anyway, and speaking of

947
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:27,580
information, that's something that's been communicated, right? I mean, we could say,

948
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:31,840
I mean, information, if you discover it firsthand, you might communicate it to

949
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,740
someone else. Otherwise, it's just something that's inside someone's pea

950
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:38,060
brain. So when you say the word information, it's how things are being

951
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:42,060
communicated. So watch how things are being communicated. And one thing that

952
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:46,800
we've said before is that the real stuff is never happening where all the noise is.

953
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:53,400
The noise tends to be a distraction. And what I mean by that is the noise, when

954
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:58,700
you comprehend and understand and see that it's noisy, let's say over here or

955
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:03,080
over there, and it's by design, there's a structure behind it, whether it's

956
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:07,980
mainstream or alternative media or print or what people are gossiping or

957
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:13,260
talking about or getting emotional about is a distraction. It's they want you to

958
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:19,020
look there because where it's really going on is where it's quiet, right?

959
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:24,900
You could look at, just look at everything pretty much. You know, for

960
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:28,440
example, a lot of people think that they're doing well with the alternative

961
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,780
media. The alternative media is just piggybacking on what the mainstream

962
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:36,520
provides them. You know, basically the mainstream goes up.

963
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:43,160
N-I-C-H-E. Niche. That's what it is. It's just a niche of the mainstream currently.

964
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:47,200
It's not providing different information. It's just commenting on the

965
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:53,100
information that is provided. Now there could have been a good alternative

966
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:57,740
media. There could have been, if a wormhole opened up and some people from

967
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:01,540
another planet, let's say, came through every morning and left, you know, went

968
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:05,760
back home at night, and those people from another, people coming from, let's

969
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,400
say, a wormhole from another place were doing alternative media, I think you

970
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:15,000
would have something worth listening to, folks. But otherwise, just, yeah, okay, I

971
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,260
will get off the alternative media. So because this is an anomaly,

972
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:22,760
uncommon sense is neither mainstream nor alternative nor it's none of that. It's

973
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:27,280
an anomaly. It's like as if it's not happening. It's like you can't, I can't

974
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:31,840
believe what these guys are saying. Yes, if you're listening, you will find

975
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,980
there's lots of stuff to believe in because it's either stuff that's

976
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:41,800
happened or stuff that will happen. So, you know, kind of discussing again, what

977
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:46,180
is the explanation of these things? Can we jump into what we said we'd be

978
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:50,040
talking about on the second hour, which is the coming Middle East Union? What do

979
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:56,440
you think, Seth? Yes, let's. Yeah, I want to bring up something here, folks. I want to

980
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:02,480
show you how no one's paying any attention. I mean, no one. There's this

981
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,520
meme, this thing going on called terrorism, right? It's all terrorism these

982
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:11,460
days. Now, hold on for a second. These are acts of violence, let's say. Now, it

983
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:14,680
doesn't matter if they're staged or false flags. We know that they are.

984
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:19,180
Most of them are because there's an agenda and the agenda is beyond what

985
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:23,980
mankind can control at this point. But just think about it. These acts of

986
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:27,880
violence, think about this for a moment. If you've ever watched any of the

987
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:31,540
Warner Brothers, I think it was Warner Brothers, Bugs Bunny. Remember if you did

988
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:38,160
something to Bugs Bunny that he didn't like? He said, this means war. Remember

989
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:44,580
that? You take out a white glove and smack Elmer Fudd or whatever. He said, this means

990
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:50,380
war. Okay, so yeah. So all this, what happened to this means war? Now it's all

991
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:56,020
terrorism. Yeah, yeah. Well, by the way, folks, if you look at any of the ancient

992
01:04:56,020 --> 01:05:00,340
texts, it does talk about a time where terror will be brought upon people, fear,

993
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:06,160
terror, things like that. And they will be running when there is no fear and acting

994
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:10,960
and emotionally reacting when there is nothing really to fear. The reason why

995
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:16,800
you have it called as terrorism, by the way, is because you're way beyond the

996
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:24,040
level right now where it's nation versus nation. You're in what's called a global

997
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:30,740
setting right now, a worldwide setting. And if anyone has, let's say, done any

998
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:36,720
research or studying about the credit based economy, the statutory laws and

999
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:42,480
treaties, you'll notice there are no more countries. They've legally or lawfully

1000
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,160
been dissolved. I mean, lawfully, they sort of exist because the blood that runs

1001
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:50,800
through the people defined as a nation is still there. But legally, they've been

1002
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,300
dissolved, all of them pretty much. And the ones that haven't been are on the short

1003
01:05:54,300 --> 01:06:01,660
list to be so, like Libya that was, you know, for example. So you're in a

1004
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:07,920
situation now that is worldwide. Forget about this nation thing, you know,

1005
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:13,440
sovereignty and whatever. Because if you look at the way things are supposed to go

1006
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,620
according to the ancients, first, you had events happen to a certain familial group

1007
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:22,420
and then to nations. And then in the end, it's all global or worldwide. Sorry,

1008
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:26,180
flat-earthers, by the way, if you don't like the word globe. You know, you're going

1009
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:30,580
to have to wait until the next stupid meme comes up in society for you guys to

1010
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:38,460
latch on to. But anyway, the concept of terrorism, the concept of Bugs Bunny

1011
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:44,320
declaring war, the concept of all these things is part and parcel of there is no

1012
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:48,660
more sovereign nations and you're being poised and set up for a world leadership

1013
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:52,600
coming out of one group. And I'm not discussing the New World Order. That's

1014
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:57,240
Muppet-puppet discussion level stuff. It has nothing to do with what you guys have

1015
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:03,080
been talked about on and on and on for decades by all these other people that

1016
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:06,440
pretty much got a lead on to what's called the alternative media. They're

1017
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:11,280
known as the granddaddies of alternative media in the 90s and early 2000s. A lot of

1018
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:17,440
New World Order talk, forget about that. That's already down the pipeline and is

1019
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:21,580
ready to be spit out. There's a new New World Order that everyone is going to

1020
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:27,200
welcome. And we'll discuss that and why in many other discussions. But what we

1021
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,380
were going to do is catch up on the second hour is the Middle East Union. And

1022
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:37,620
in order to really get the cobwebs out is why is no one discussing why

1023
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,420
international incidents are now discussed as terrorism and not outright war? Yes,

1024
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:48,080
there are some wars here and there that are called wars. The reason is because

1025
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:53,980
wars are done to protect a particular set-apart group or an isolated group, a

1026
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:58,520
nationalistic, sovereign-type body. But none of that exists anymore, in

1027
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:03,980
wholesale, other than a small specific enclaves here and there. So it has to be,

1028
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:09,100
cannot be called war anymore. It has to be called terrorism, you see, because

1029
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:15,399
you're all going to be following a worldwide scheme. And that worldwide

1030
01:08:15,399 --> 01:08:22,460
scheme is very simply going to originate where it originated. And it's going to

1031
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:29,040
end where it originated, just like a racetrack. If you look at a racetrack,

1032
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:36,680
locate the starting line. Okay, got that in the mind? All right, where's the

1033
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:44,680
finish line? It's the same, same position. So what we're doing here is giving a

1034
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:50,220
little bit of the rationale, because we don't want to talk symptoms, right? So

1035
01:08:51,420 --> 01:09:00,920
very simple way to look at it is, even if you look at the behavior of society,

1036
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:12,680
without, you know, staying on the description end of it, is the beginning of

1037
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:17,080
society in what part of the planet? Is it the Middle East, sort of what's called

1038
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:20,460
the Middle East? You might call it the Levant, it's the center mass of the

1039
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:28,779
Earth. Even in your pre-programmed, pranking, mainstream schooling system,

1040
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:34,800
they tell you that life of mankind's or society started around the Mesopotamian

1041
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:40,880
region. So they've got a little bit of it correct. All of your other historical

1042
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:45,319
records lean that way. Now, of course, we're not talking about the 99% of the

1043
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:49,580
airheads that want to talk about, well, they believe it's this, or they believe

1044
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:53,120
it's that. We're not talking about that. We're not allowed to make things up, if

1045
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:57,520
we're going to have rational discussion. If you like to make things up, watch

1046
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:01,080
little children, they make up little games, and they get very serious about

1047
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:06,500
them, until an adult comes in and starts shaking them up. We're not here to be an

1048
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:11,880
adult to anyone, but this has nothing to do with what's being discussed in public

1049
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:17,860
right now anyway. So you're going to look at that part of center mass. If you look

1050
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:24,240
at a map of the world as it's laid out flat, draw an X across it, and you'll see

1051
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:33,880
that it pretty much intersects in the Eastern Mediterranean, west of Asia, sort

1052
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:38,100
of northern part of Africa, southern part of Asia Minor, or Europe. That

1053
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:43,800
general area is going to be the area of focus. What's been prophesied is ten

1054
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:50,740
nations rising to prominence, where all economic, judicial, political, educational,

1055
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:58,920
entertainment, financial systems, and military will be focused out of. Like, you

1056
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:03,180
might have, let's say, a country with more military might, but it'll do the bidding

1057
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:11,820
of that area. You see, if it sounds familiar to anyone that's American. Now,

1058
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:14,340
by the way, speaking of American, they don't know what they're doing. Don't

1059
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:18,620
blame your quote-unquote government, or you want to call them Satanists, or

1060
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:22,220
whatever, whatever, whatever, or they're incompetent, or it's about money, or it's

1061
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:27,480
about oil. And I mean, you can't blame them. I mean, they already have contracts

1062
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:32,560
to use the credit that the people are not supposed to know about, to make very

1063
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:38,200
expensive single-use items known as weapons. I mean, you'd all do the same

1064
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:42,140
thing. Don't say you wouldn't, because I know you would. If you had access to

1065
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:47,020
unlimited credit, you'd use it also, and you wouldn't be sharing. Yes, yes, I know

1066
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:52,440
it sounds kind of judgmental, but it's a pretty good call. So, the Americans don't

1067
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:56,480
know what they're doing, by the way, but they're doing it. Is it possible to do

1068
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:00,860
something and not know why you're doing it? You know, let's say, an overall large

1069
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:06,540
reason? Yeah, absolutely. Happens all the time. Are they being pranked? Yeah,

1070
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:12,300
possibly. By cosmic, beyond cosmic elements? Yeah, that could be another

1071
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:18,040
discussion. You know, people want to be nationalistic that are in America, but

1072
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:23,300
you're gonna play second fiddle to the society in the Middle East. Sorry, folks.

1073
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,220
The sooner you realize that, the more at peace you will be with what's happening

1074
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:31,040
around you. It's better to know what's going to happen before it happens, and

1075
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,320
trying to rationalize it while it's happening, even though it's biting you in

1076
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:40,080
the ass. Let's say this is the same for Europe. Europe is going to be playing

1077
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:44,940
second fiddle to this, politically, economically, judicially, and everything.

1078
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:49,720
Now, there's another thing that has to come up before we get into any more

1079
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:53,480
discussion about the Middle East. It's the thing about Islam. Get that out of

1080
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:58,840
your mind, folks. In the future, all of the mainstream religions in the world are

1081
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:07,680
going to be kind of put aside. For what? For something called the truth. Yeah.

1082
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:13,220
Simply finding the truth is simply beginning to read and study the text

1083
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:19,820
that your religion is based on. Oh, but I don't need to study, I believe. Yeah, you'll

1084
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:26,100
see. So, there's no way you could call yourself Christian if you read, or do

1085
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,900
what Christians do if you read, the biblical text. No way, unless you're

1086
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:33,620
insane or evil. Same goes for Judaism, the same goes for Islam, if you read the

1087
01:13:33,620 --> 01:13:37,800
Koran. There is no way you will do what the people that call themselves a Muslim

1088
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:42,500
do. I'm talking about moderate, extreme, or anything. The same with the Buddhists,

1089
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:48,680
the same with the Hindus, on and on and on. Right? This is very simple fact. It's the

1090
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:52,580
truth. It might sound dogmatic to someone who is unstudied and looking to

1091
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:57,620
be a prankster. You know, you start talking to an attorney about law, they

1092
01:13:57,620 --> 01:14:01,620
get very upset because inherently they know they're doing that field to be a

1093
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:05,800
prankster. They don't have to do anything and they get all your money, let's say.

1094
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:11,260
Same with the doctors. You start discussing their field, they get very

1095
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:19,060
upset. That's how you know you're dealing with a prankster. So, don't fall for the

1096
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:23,520
mainstream religion causality. And by the way, folks, I've also heard in

1097
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,200
passing, oh, it's the Crescent versus the Cross. Okay, well, first of all, if you

1098
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:30,980
read the biblical text, there is no crucifixion. They could use the word a

1099
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:35,340
hundred times, but rationally there isn't. If you read the text and

1100
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:39,340
understand, the biblical Christ was brought to Pontius Pilate and he

1101
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:45,100
demanded, Pontius Pilate that is, that Judean law was used on him. There was no

1102
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:49,180
crucifixion in Judean law. So anyway, but if you're dabbling in what's

1103
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:53,000
called the New Testament, you will know that's like getting a four-year-old and

1104
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,960
showing them only graduate-level physics books. It doesn't matter if you hold it

1105
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:01,160
right side up or upside down, you're going to get the same out of it. Nothing. Anyway,

1106
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:07,000
so there is no crescent as such. If you go look at the symbol of Islam, you might

1107
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,820
describe it as a crescent, yes, because it looks geometrically alike. But if you

1108
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:17,960
really look at that image, it's an image of an eclipse. It's a dark body eclipsing

1109
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:23,240
a lighter body. Look at it. It's one circle superimposed over another. It's

1110
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:27,920
not a crescent as you would see a moon being partially lit or a sphere being

1111
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:34,460
partially lit. Are you paying attention? Yeah. No, the answer is no, you're not.

1112
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,840
And you're not supposed to because you're not going to have any friends if

1113
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,100
you pay attention, by the way, and your family won't want to talk to you. That's

1114
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,760
how you know you're doing it right. You're pretty much rejected across the

1115
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:52,890
board to some degree on most things. So there's a mindset that needs to be put

1116
01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:56,610
in place or realized, and everyone will realize what they need to realize in

1117
01:15:56,610 --> 01:16:01,210
their own way, let's say. Most people won't realize anything. But I mean, those

1118
01:16:01,210 --> 01:16:04,970
that want to listen and actually do something. So you can't jump into a

1119
01:16:04,970 --> 01:16:09,370
Middle East discussion, especially a coming Middle East Union, without

1120
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:13,510
understanding why things are called terrorism, what the mainstream

1121
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:19,050
religions are, and how Islam is irrelevant in its cause in this.

1122
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:25,170
It's not a religion versus a religion. It's a society, perhaps, versus another

1123
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:31,210
society. Just like we've disclosed here, there's no such thing as a Bronze Age or

1124
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:37,030
an Iron Age or a Stone Age or a caveman. There's a complete lie put out to you by

1125
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:43,390
the quackademics, academics, pranksters. You might have a stone-type

1126
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:52,250
society that is parallel to a bronze society, to an iron society, just like you

1127
01:16:52,250 --> 01:17:00,050
might have a society that's all wired and one that is wireless. So on and

1128
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:06,930
so forth. But all these things exist in parallel. So why is there terrorism? There

1129
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:14,070
is no more nations. It's all some kind of semi-unifying, semi-worldwide

1130
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:17,690
causality. Not the New World Order that you guys hear about and want to talk

1131
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:23,790
about. No. It is a New World Order, but it's sort of along those lines. That's

1132
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:26,430
why it's all being called terrorism. And the mainstream

1133
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:31,890
religions have nothing to do with it. It's traditions and customs. You also have to

1134
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:35,250
understand there's no money. You're in a credit-based economy, which, by the way,

1135
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:39,470
you will never understand, according to what's been memorialized. But fortunately

1136
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:48,450
or unfortunately for you, never is not too far away. So to go back into the Middle

1137
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:52,050
East Union wholeheartedly, just discussing what's coming, I believe, is

1138
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:58,650
not enough without discussing the type of thinking and perceptions that should

1139
01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:03,630
be made or can be made about it. So I'm going to take a – that was a long-winded

1140
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:06,950
thing there, Seth. I'm going to take a break. Anything you want to add or take away

1141
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:12,770
to the rationale that might have to be put in place before one can rationalize

1142
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:18,790
or have a good discussion on the coming Middle East Union without getting into

1143
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:24,850
any specifics at this point? It comes back to, you know, another topic

1144
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:29,630
that we've discussed. You brought up dreams, but even going a little bit

1145
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:35,610
further than that, just, you know, thoughts and where thoughts come from.

1146
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:42,710
And if thoughts are not simply, you know, machinations that are coming from the

1147
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:48,210
internal and are actually something more that's not really

1148
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:54,130
discussed in a rational manner anywhere as coming from without as opposed to

1149
01:18:54,130 --> 01:19:02,530
within, then it leads, you know, directly, the consequence of thought being action,

1150
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:10,710
that these actions that we are seeing on all levels are not simply as they are

1151
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:16,270
described. They're not simply as they seem to be, as they are broadcast

1152
01:19:16,270 --> 01:19:22,470
through the television or through the Internet or through the radio. That what

1153
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:28,630
is going on is going on at a level that is, the level is not actually discussed

1154
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:33,670
anywhere with any rationality. No, it can't. Yeah, it can't, because people lack the

1155
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:37,990
maturity. And I'm not talking about just an age. And by the way, folks, if you want

1156
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:42,050
to see what an eight-year-old mentality is like, run into your average grandma

1157
01:19:42,050 --> 01:19:46,590
person, granddad. They haven't developed more than eight or nine years old. They

1158
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:50,730
may look older. You should respect them, at least socially, because they've been

1159
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:54,410
around. They've gone to the bathroom a lot more and they've brushed their teeth

1160
01:19:54,410 --> 01:20:03,190
a lot more than you. But other than that, they've ceased to mature. So anyway,

1161
01:20:03,850 --> 01:20:09,470
there's a lack of maturity on many levels. And by the way, folks, when you've

1162
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:16,110
still been plugged in a bad way with this King James stuff, and these memes

1163
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:21,930
and sayings and cliches, like God is within you or anything is within you, go

1164
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:26,230
look at that. That's not in there. That's not in the text. They put that in there

1165
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:30,770
for you. I was on a discussion once, and this fellow liked to reiterate a quote

1166
01:20:30,770 --> 01:20:34,490
from, I think it was King Henry, when the King James Bible was out. He says,

1167
01:20:35,390 --> 01:20:39,750
the people must, I'm paraphrasing here, the people must understand that the King

1168
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:44,570
James Bible is under license, and it is only to inform your conscience. Remember,

1169
01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:51,430
it is under license. What are they telling you? So all this stuff about you

1170
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:56,990
have something is a joke, and you've been pranked. And don't be a prankster, folks.

1171
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:02,270
It's all you're receiving and you're transmitting. And memory is like a cloud,

1172
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:09,570
by the way, and you do need the equipment to access it. But here's the point. When

1173
01:21:09,570 --> 01:21:13,850
the gods come in, just to intersect this, because we were at an intersecting point

1174
01:21:13,850 --> 01:21:20,150
when, you know, it's not discussed, it's the gods with accuracy. And whether you

1175
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:23,670
are dealing with a benevolent or benevolent god, by the way, it is a

1176
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:29,830
frightful thing. If people tell you they've had this soft, wonderful feeling

1177
01:21:29,830 --> 01:21:34,890
and they saw a god, they're making stuff up because they want to sell YouTubes or

1178
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:41,910
whatever they do these days. Yeah. Anytime you deal with anything legitimate from

1179
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:47,250
the other side, overtly, unless you're being pranked by them, they'll present a

1180
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:51,410
very soft image for you to go and tell your friends and then they'll high-five

1181
01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:57,630
themselves, we got another one of these stupid humans. The concept of

1182
01:21:57,630 --> 01:22:02,310
discussing the gods is beyond most people's pay scale. And it will be, all

1183
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:06,270
the way to the end, because they will be pranked by others that are going to be

1184
01:22:06,270 --> 01:22:10,710
putting on quite a show. And there will be a legitimate influence from certain

1185
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:20,790
entities, let's say, to do so. But yeah, there is. Yeah. It's not just black and

1186
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:24,790
white. The wicked witch wears black and the, what is it, the good witch wears

1187
01:22:24,790 --> 01:22:31,210
white. It's not like that. Any god that you encounter, you will be, if they're

1188
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:35,270
not very careful and you are not careful, you will be dissolved out of this

1189
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:43,030
existence. So there is a very strong influence of that on this world. But

1190
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:50,150
yeah, the mindset, again, just because you have religion, what they call that,

1191
01:22:50,210 --> 01:22:54,310
you've been pranked. That's like saying I like baseball, or strawberry ice cream,

1192
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:58,170
or advanced nose-picking, or underwater basket weaving. It means

1193
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:03,370
absolutely nothing. It is there to prank you. All those funny hats and funny

1194
01:23:03,370 --> 01:23:07,610
costumes and revived sex temples that you call whatever you want to call,

1195
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:15,460
places of worship, that's what they are, folks. Do the research. So irrelevant

1196
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:20,180
stuff. I mean, you know, it's like when did the Yankees come in, you know? When

1197
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:23,200
did the Mets? Hey, how about them Mets? How about them Yankees? You know, how

1198
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:27,900
about that Islam? How about that Christianity? Same stuff. Sorry, guys.

1199
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:32,860
Buddhism. Again, just keep in the back of your mind, folks, when the Asian people,

1200
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:36,880
in general, Asiatic people, find out that they've been pranked with all that

1201
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:43,520
stuff they put on them. Oh, boy. So let's get into a little bit more of the

1202
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:47,760
Middle Eastern Union with some specifics, perhaps. You know, I hate piggybacking

1203
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:51,780
on when it's noisy, but let's just say it this way, folks. There was a lot of

1204
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:57,680
noise being made roughly in the past day period or so about an alleged military

1205
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:08,820
coup in Turkey. Irrelevant, folks. Wouldn't say irrelevant, irrelevant, but

1206
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:12,680
irrelevant on what we're talking about. It's just more noise and more

1207
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,980
information going towards what we've been discussing, which is the Middle East

1208
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:21,620
Union. And what we said in the past hour to preface this is how can you have a

1209
01:24:21,620 --> 01:24:26,200
loose confederacy of nations if they're all nationalistic and ready to pounce on

1210
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:31,780
each other with policies and things in place that discriminate or create

1211
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:35,320
disparity amongst countries that are tangent or parallel with each other. You

1212
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:43,880
can't have that. So I would say the easiest way to look at what's going on

1213
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:48,420
is to understand time, which we've kind of given a little bit of understanding

1214
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:53,060
on how to be lawful in it. Understand that things build up in the, things that are

1215
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:57,040
planted in the spring build up in the summer, torn down in the fall. If you

1216
01:24:57,040 --> 01:25:02,060
look at any event being a summertime event, these are all building up events.

1217
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:06,800
So if you've been looking at some of the quote-unquote acts of terror, we've just

1218
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,180
explained why things or everything is called terror. I want to throw this in

1219
01:25:10,180 --> 01:25:13,000
there, by the way, before we get to the Middle East Union. If you ever notice,

1220
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:18,220
especially in the Western world, the authorities, municipalities, states,

1221
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:23,040
federal government, whatever, is very anxious to brand something a terrorist, a

1222
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:28,140
terrorist attack. And in order for it to be memorialized or branded as one, it has

1223
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:31,660
to be done in the media, has to be done legally on paper, and it has to be

1224
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:37,140
discussed as such. Do you know why they do that? And it's a monetary reason why

1225
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:44,260
they do it. Because after 9-11, what they call 9-11, a terrorism insurance was put

1226
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:49,400
in. I don't know how big the claims are, but if you're working in a municipality

1227
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:55,060
and you have, let's say, a robbery, the municipality might be able to draw a

1228
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:59,140
little bit of insurance on it, maybe. But if you can brand that robbery into a

1229
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:03,560
terrorist act, now you tap into the terrorist insurance fund, and that's huge,

1230
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:08,040
folks. They're chomping at the bit to call everything terrorism because of the

1231
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:12,040
insurance companies. And by the way, all of you idiots are being told that all

1232
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:18,800
the money is on Wall Street, and it's not. It's a couple of blocks northwest where

1233
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:23,120
all the insurance companies are. Don't believe it? Look it up. What is the

1234
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:31,010
largest industry in America? Yes, you guessed it, insurance. So the other

1235
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:34,510
reason you're hearing, because they're motivated by a credit, is they have

1236
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:38,270
terrorism insurance. So there's another motivation to bring that up. So when we

1237
01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:42,550
say these things, we're giving you the explanation why, you see. We're not just

1238
01:26:42,550 --> 01:26:46,610
saying, oh yeah, they're calling it terrorism. If you've ever been in a

1239
01:26:46,610 --> 01:26:51,510
Homeland Security office, they have a poster to the employees. To the

1240
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:54,050
employees, and it says the purpose of Homeland Security is to regulate

1241
01:26:54,050 --> 01:27:00,530
commerce. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Uh-huh, you heard it right. If you know

1242
01:27:00,530 --> 01:27:04,110
anyone that works there, they will tell you. Tell them to go in the employees

1243
01:27:04,110 --> 01:27:10,280
lounge. You have a poster explaining what they're there for. So it's all about

1244
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:15,420
issuing and dispersing credit, folks. But that's just the explanation side. The

1245
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:18,580
description that we could get into again is the event that recently happened

1246
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:23,180
in Turkey. That is nothing more than, if you look at it in the summertime, it's a

1247
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:27,000
building up event to what? Breaking down. What happened? There was a coup. Okay, what

1248
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,700
does a coup do? Well, the actual coup itself is a breaking down period.

1249
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:37,160
There are several, quote-unquote, I know a guy runs over people with a

1250
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:43,980
truck, it's terrorism. I just told you why, right? Cash in on it. So, and people, by

1251
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:48,120
the way, your lives are regarded as nothing, by the way. Yeah, no matter what

1252
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:51,740
you, your innocent lives. Do you hear anybody saying, these are innocent people

1253
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:55,820
that were killed, that is a mark of an idiot. Because there's no such thing.

1254
01:27:56,700 --> 01:28:06,360
You're all target, you all got targets on you, right? So anyway, the events that are

1255
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:10,800
happening now, you see in great succession, they're breaking down events.

1256
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:15,360
Things being blown up, torn down, people killed, this, that, and the other. These

1257
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:19,780
are breaking down events, man. And this is going to continue. We have another two

1258
01:28:19,780 --> 01:28:24,180
years of it, roughly. We, whoever we is, this is the breaking down period. And then

1259
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:30,500
the building up period starts. So what else you're going to see? This is the

1260
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:34,560
most that can be explained about what's going on in Turkey. Yeah, they're going to

1261
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:38,420
recuperate and bounce back, but they're not going to be like they were before.

1262
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:42,500
Now, why is Turkey important? Is Turkey going to be part of this Middle East

1263
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:48,440
Union? No. They're not. But they're going to have a loose alliance with Greece and

1264
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:53,640
Cyprus. And let's say places like Libya, Northern Africa, that whole Mediterranean

1265
01:28:54,060 --> 01:29:00,180
rim, North and South, not the Levant, but this northern part of the Mediterranean

1266
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:02,480
rim and the southern part of the Mediterranean rim, like the Northern

1267
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:06,440
African countries and the Southern European countries, predominantly Turkey,

1268
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:12,280
Greece, and Cyprus, are going to be a loose alliance around this Confederacy,

1269
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:19,040
right? So, and things are done backwards sometimes, so you're going to see a

1270
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:22,160
softening up there. What you're going to actually see that's really going to be

1271
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:31,120
bringing in the main push or the crux of the matter where things

1272
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:37,260
will start to rotate like the hub of a wheel is the formation of a new country

1273
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:40,880
in northern Iraq, which is also going to take some land from Turkey and Syria.

1274
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:46,620
Now, I wrote about this a long time ago, that Turkey and Syria will be in the

1275
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:51,480
news and so will Greece, probably making an exit based on economics and things

1276
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:54,620
like that. And I was told I was crazy. And I don't know if I should thank the

1277
01:29:54,620 --> 01:30:01,340
people for it. I guess crazy is good. But this country called the new Assyria,

1278
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:05,440
which is going to form in northern Iraq, is also going to be borrowing a few

1279
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:12,560
kilometers into Syria, more than a few, just a couple, 10 maybe, and Turkey.

1280
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:18,520
So, it's being softened up. People, you know, can do research in that area.

1281
01:30:18,620 --> 01:30:21,700
They'll see there's a lot of activity. I'm not talking about the Kurds and all

1282
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:26,540
these other groups. I'm talking about the Assyrians. Not Syrians, Assyrians.

1283
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:32,260
So, that's where we are so far. And, Sefa, you could back up. We've been saying this

1284
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:36,520
and many other things regarding that region with great accuracy for quite a few

1285
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:41,580
years, you and I have, at least in public. I'll be back in about a minute and a half.

1286
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:44,100
So, take it on from here, Sefa. I'll be right back.

1287
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:56,760
All right. Loose confederation. Ten nations coming together. It's interesting.

1288
01:30:59,110 --> 01:31:04,170
We've, as Nickery said, we've been talking about this now for three years, give or

1289
01:31:04,170 --> 01:31:15,010
take a few months. And it's, a lot of it just kind of takes away the surprise of,

1290
01:31:15,730 --> 01:31:20,270
I'm certainly no longer surprised by just about anything that I see come across

1291
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:26,330
media in any of its forms. A lot of head shaking, I suppose.

1292
01:31:28,490 --> 01:31:38,650
But, you know, it's all, the people that are presented as being in control and or responsible

1293
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:47,750
are, for the most part, just as in the dark as those who they are claiming to be in control of

1294
01:31:48,630 --> 01:32:02,950
or responsible for. So, it's not as if, except on very, very small level, it's not as if they are

1295
01:32:04,530 --> 01:32:08,250
willfully even pursuing what we are talking about.

1296
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:15,850
It makes for really easy descriptions. He did it. He did it. You ever watch the news and say,

1297
01:32:15,950 --> 01:32:19,710
we don't know who to blame yet. That's what they say. They actually tell you that.

1298
01:32:21,990 --> 01:32:25,870
This event happened, but we don't know who to blame yet. You just want to, remember those

1299
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:29,230
cartoon gloves, you know, the really big four fingered glove where they slap them back and

1300
01:32:29,230 --> 01:32:34,190
forth, you know. It's like, what's wrong with you people? Not the people. You got to remember now,

1301
01:32:34,270 --> 01:32:38,650
when you're listening to alternative or mainstream media, they're saying all the

1302
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:46,190
stupid shit they're saying to accommodate you. So stop being stupid. I can't believe it. Like

1303
01:32:46,190 --> 01:32:50,630
sometimes I find myself yelling at the television, let's say, if I turn it on or

1304
01:32:50,630 --> 01:32:54,850
the computer, if I tend to land on someone talking about something,

1305
01:32:54,850 --> 01:32:57,410
and then I have to catch myself and say, wait a second.

1306
01:32:58,530 --> 01:33:02,090
There are people that listen, they tune in to hear this stuff.

1307
01:33:05,590 --> 01:33:10,250
You can't fault those that are dishing it out. There's a reason why lemonade stands are set up

1308
01:33:10,250 --> 01:33:15,290
in hot weather. There's a reason why there are gas stations on the side of the road in the desert,

1309
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:19,710
because there's a highway there. But if that highway closes, the stupid stuff goes away.

1310
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:27,190
So anyway, the description part is so easy, the blaming mankind. But if you're a god,

1311
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:32,070
and you don't want to show up overtly, why don't you just affect a group of people to do something,

1312
01:33:32,410 --> 01:33:36,390
or make a riverbank overflow, or throw down the company car?

1313
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:41,290
Or company car is kind of an inside joke for what a tornado or hurricane is.

1314
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:46,970
Yeah, you could even write down in relatively plain speech that you were going to do that.

1315
01:33:47,530 --> 01:33:50,930
Yep, and when and how, and no one, everyone ignores it.

1316
01:33:51,550 --> 01:33:55,930
They want to talk about Anunnaki, Planet X, and that you came from Planet Reticuli as a baby,

1317
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:59,450
or something stupid, or you're going to be reincarnated as the Dalai Lama or something.

1318
01:34:01,070 --> 01:34:04,110
Yeah, or blame it all on the CIA or the intelligence agencies.

1319
01:34:04,250 --> 01:34:07,870
Folks, I don't think you guys know anyone that works in the intelligence agencies

1320
01:34:07,870 --> 01:34:14,300
to be talking that way. These people don't know anything. They're there because it's a yob.

1321
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:22,960
Y-O-B. And they won't hire you unless you're extremely bought into all the pranking.

1322
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:33,100
That's a fact. And also, by the way, we do base a lot of this stuff on what's called

1323
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:37,260
the biblical textbook. You know what, Seth, we've never, well, at least I have, I could say,

1324
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:43,860
never recommend anyone go and read the biblical text. And this is sarcastic, folks, but it's true.

1325
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:46,840
You know why? Because you're not going to understand anything in it.

1326
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:52,360
You're going to get the, is, or was out of it, or day and night out of it, but you're not going

1327
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:57,960
to be able to piece it together, because you're going to have to learn to read out of things.

1328
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:05,480
If you go and approach any ancient text, and you say, oh, this is the part that I saw in the movie,

1329
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:09,840
you're going to start reading into it things that are not there, because Cecil B. DeMille

1330
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:14,780
put it on film for you when you're still in short pants, and you no longer had to wear a diaper.

1331
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:19,880
You saw the repeat on TV, because it was probably done 40 or 50 years before you were born.

1332
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:29,700
Yeah, I have recent experience with, like you said, you know, and I second that, that

1333
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:38,000
never really encourage anyone to do that. But at the same time, I'm often, with regularity even,

1334
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:47,620
encourage people that seem determined to do it anyways, that they go and read the book

1335
01:35:50,080 --> 01:35:57,280
Ecclesiastes, and even in doing, I've received responses back where it's like, that book is,

1336
01:35:57,280 --> 01:36:03,360
it's kind of repetitive, but it is, it has what I would certainly consider wisdom in it,

1337
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:09,840
it's kind of a book about wisdom. Right, and knowledge. Yeah, wisdom and knowledge.

1338
01:36:10,900 --> 01:36:21,140
But even in that, something that is, it's written, it seems to be on a higher perspective

1339
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:28,480
on a lower grade level, to borrow an analogy. But it's, because it's very, it's repetitive.

1340
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:35,540
It says what is important over and over and over. And I received a response after, you know,

1341
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:41,280
recommending that to someone publicly, that they had done just that. They had taken this,

1342
01:36:41,820 --> 01:36:47,560
they'd taken one line out of it and used it as a sort of justification for a previously held

1343
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:55,980
opinion about another like religious group or sect. And, which is not what was being spoken

1344
01:36:55,980 --> 01:37:01,740
about in the text at all. It was just being, it's very, very basic, written to just about,

1345
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:09,080
it's just from a certain perspective. A human perspective. Yeah. Yeah. Assisting the human

1346
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:14,700
situation. And speaking of which, we did bring, this is a segue, we're also going to talk about

1347
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:19,140
the deception. And let's just give a secret. What a better place to give a secret than a

1348
01:37:19,140 --> 01:37:22,400
minor internet radio station on a show that never is not supposed to be here.

1349
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:28,840
Someone mentioned in the corrupt KGV, the Antichrist is supposed to come. Let's, let's give

1350
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:33,360
the secret regarding that. By the way, folks, whenever you hear the term the Antichrist,

1351
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:38,040
it's not in the biblical text. It's instead of Christ, right? Well, a Christ figure is someone

1352
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:41,960
who's anointed, someone who is supposed to assist you to the next level, let's say, right?

1353
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:49,780
Right? Or to prove something out. If you're thinking about that long hair, nailed to a cross,

1354
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:56,380
wearing a diaper, sorry. That's Mithra Serapis. So, but, but here's the point. It's all secret.

1355
01:37:56,820 --> 01:38:02,080
But here, let's give a secret. Now, for those of you that understand and comprehend and listening

1356
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:07,700
that today, whatever you call whatever date you communicate with is the papal work schedule.

1357
01:38:07,860 --> 01:38:13,080
And the papacy, Catholicism, Christianity, the Pope, the Vatican, all that stuff has got nothing

1358
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:18,240
to do with anything. It is a social mechanism. It has nothing to do with spirituality,

1359
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:25,180
other than the spirituality that is defined as the mind. You see what I mean?

1360
01:38:29,170 --> 01:38:37,390
The secret is such, if you know how to keep time, we know pretty accurately that the, instead of

1361
01:38:37,390 --> 01:38:41,890
Christ, let's use the Antichrist character that is going to come on the world scene, is roughly in

1362
01:38:41,890 --> 01:38:48,210
his 19th year, right? And what I mean by that, again, to you folks, that regarding timekeeping,

1363
01:38:48,210 --> 01:38:55,390
when you have, let's say, your 18th birthday, that day, the next day, that next extra day

1364
01:38:55,390 --> 01:39:02,310
is from your 19th year. So when you become 18, you're in your 19th year, right? Because you're

1365
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:07,990
not using time from the previous, you're using time from the current, which has not been memorialized

1366
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:13,650
as being finished until it does. So when you become 19, you're actually in your 20th year.

1367
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:19,290
You see? It's kind of like backwards the way the legal society does it, but either way,

1368
01:39:20,670 --> 01:39:27,950
that's just a little secret again. But this fellow, contrary to all the stupid stuff that

1369
01:39:27,950 --> 01:39:33,770
you are exposed to as a society, the Antichrist, I use that term because it's common, the instead

1370
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:39,430
of Christ that is prophesied to come, he's going to be a highly, highly charismatic individual.

1371
01:39:39,430 --> 01:39:46,250
Everyone is going to like him. It's not going to be this bad politician, or this evil guy,

1372
01:39:46,430 --> 01:39:52,570
you know. Actually, all the way through, even when he's doing things that are, quote-unquote,

1373
01:39:52,690 --> 01:39:57,690
evil. And what I mean by that is because what people consider to be good is actually evil,

1374
01:39:58,210 --> 01:40:02,890
but to the gods, and what the gods consider to be good, people consider to be evil. So when he,

1375
01:40:03,650 --> 01:40:08,890
this person starts to administer a worldwide government in an evil way to the gods,

1376
01:40:08,890 --> 01:40:14,950
but in a good way to humanity, even then, he will not be viewed as a bad character. So

1377
01:40:14,950 --> 01:40:21,170
all this Hollywood crap, and there's people writing books about Antichrist, and YouTubes,

1378
01:40:21,210 --> 01:40:27,110
and movies, and it's all false, all of it. And you know what, folks? That may not sound rational,

1379
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:33,050
but if some of it wasn't false, we wouldn't be doing this. I just say, hey, by the way, Seth,

1380
01:40:33,050 --> 01:40:39,670
and everyone, go check out this link. This is good stuff. Sorry, guys. That's why this is the

1381
01:40:39,670 --> 01:40:45,450
show that's not supposed to be a show. And what a better place to give secrets on that.

1382
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:49,810
It has nothing to do with what you believe in, unless you have the information. And by the way,

1383
01:40:49,850 --> 01:40:55,410
how can you believe something if you're not informed about that thing? Think about that,

1384
01:40:55,510 --> 01:41:01,670
folks. So right now, this person, and should we give a little bit more secret on that,

1385
01:41:01,670 --> 01:41:05,450
Seth, or just hold off for the future? Maybe we'll hold off. Let's just do that.

1386
01:41:06,730 --> 01:41:12,210
But that's, I think, enough, his age right now. So if some moron next to you – hopefully we're

1387
01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:15,790
not addressing morons directly, so I'm not going to call if you're listening to a moron – but

1388
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:20,870
if a moron next to you says, look at this guy here. They say he's the Antichrist. Well,

1389
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:27,210
if he's older than 20, roughly, past his 19th year, currently, around there. Nah, sorry.

1390
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:34,850
Another Easter Bunny, Chase, Santa Claus, Tooth Fairy, whatever, whatever else.

1391
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:39,230
Maybe they told you that at the circus. I mean, church, circus, whatever, same thing.

1392
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:43,910
You folks are in really, really bad shape, and no one is saying anything.

1393
01:41:45,190 --> 01:41:51,610
It's really sad. It can't be that the entire population is that, and much in the dark,

1394
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:58,690
or that much immature that they like to make stuff up and go with it. Could it be?

1395
01:41:59,390 --> 01:42:06,410
It's like a dream. Yes, you will find that to be true if you do study.

1396
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:12,230
I had once someone say to me, I don't get any knowledge from a book. I get it from experience.

1397
01:42:14,350 --> 01:42:18,570
So if you're dealing with that kind of mindset, folks, you're in really bad shape.

1398
01:42:19,830 --> 01:42:23,810
So what a better place to give out a little secret like that, Seth. I mean, what say you?

1399
01:42:23,870 --> 01:42:29,610
I think we'll just leave that secret right there. So we're looking for someone right now.

1400
01:42:30,070 --> 01:42:33,530
We're not going to give – there's more information to give on him, quite a bit more,

1401
01:42:33,690 --> 01:42:39,290
and to identify him, not necessarily needs to be identified directly at this point,

1402
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:44,730
because if it's not meant for him to be identified, you will be blocked severely.

1403
01:42:44,730 --> 01:42:51,290
But what's wrong with knowing? Oh, we're not supposed to know. Okay. It's really confusing,

1404
01:42:51,410 --> 01:43:05,930
isn't it? But that's the secret, folks. It's a, yeah, confusion, war, war to bring into confusion.

1405
01:43:06,570 --> 01:43:13,370
Yes. Now, war in Greek is polymos, poly meaning many, and polemic,

1406
01:43:13,370 --> 01:43:25,480
like that's where you get the word meme from, you know. So, yeah, yeah. There's a lot to come.

1407
01:43:25,580 --> 01:43:32,560
Another secret is one we've been giving away, which is watch for the rise of Assyria in northern

1408
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:40,880
Iraq. Yeah. Another secret to give, let's just give this secret, and we'll see who's listening

1409
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:46,020
by who we get in touch, who tries to get in touch with us privately. Did you know that Israel has

1410
01:43:46,020 --> 01:43:50,340
about four prime ministers left before it's turned around into a monarchy or a pseudo-monarchy?

1411
01:43:52,910 --> 01:43:57,950
Did you, here's another secret, folks, about the Middle East. Are you ready? You ready? Did you

1412
01:43:57,950 --> 01:44:05,190
know that when, around that time, that Iran, Persia, will be more unified as it's becoming,

1413
01:44:05,950 --> 01:44:10,430
and will form a very strong financial alliance with what's known as Israel? Did you guys know

1414
01:44:10,430 --> 01:44:16,250
that? Now, here's another secret, folks. Did you guys know that the monarchy in Jordan will be

1415
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:22,270
expelled, and that country will break up into several jurisdictions? Here's another secret,

1416
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:27,530
folks. Did you know that what's known as Lebanon, the coast of Lebanon, the cities of Tyre and

1417
01:44:27,530 --> 01:44:33,630
Sidon, are going to rise to incredible financial prominence in the near future? Did you know that?

1418
01:44:33,770 --> 01:44:40,110
That's another secret. Yeah. And all these can be underpinned and explained in great detail,

1419
01:44:40,110 --> 01:44:48,890
which they will be in the future, in a semi-public, semi-private way, perhaps. I don't know. Well,

1420
01:44:48,910 --> 01:44:53,590
actually, I do know, but we don't know exactly how it's going to be done at this point.

1421
01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:56,990
There's a lot of secrets, folks. We just gave you a handful.

1422
01:44:58,770 --> 01:45:03,770
Here, here's another secret, folks. There's no money. You're under a credit-based economy. I

1423
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:08,530
wanted to just bring that up, just to throw this in, because this does tie in, just so I could give a

1424
01:45:08,530 --> 01:45:13,830
lengthy definition of why you're being told everything is terrorism. One is because it

1425
01:45:13,830 --> 01:45:18,450
actually witnesses that there is no sovereignty anymore, like Bugs Bunny. You know, when you

1426
01:45:18,450 --> 01:45:22,850
did something to Bugs Bunny, this means war. You won't hear that that much. You have war-like

1427
01:45:22,850 --> 01:45:28,830
behavior. And also, there's a big insurance for municipalities and local and national governments

1428
01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:34,810
to get from when they call, like dropping a cigarette on the floor terrorism. They could

1429
01:45:34,810 --> 01:45:39,470
cash in on that much more on the credit. But here's another secret, folks. There is no money.

1430
01:45:40,110 --> 01:45:44,330
And the reason why you're not being told there is no money is because – you see,

1431
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:48,830
when you go into a casino, you have to get chips to play. When you're born into a country that has

1432
01:45:48,830 --> 01:45:52,630
a credit-based economy – and by the way, if you don't know that it's a credit-based economy,

1433
01:45:53,070 --> 01:45:56,230
how come they don't call those plastic things money cards? What do they call them?

1434
01:45:56,930 --> 01:46:03,270
Credit or debit cards, right? But anyway, the reason why you're not told about how to access

1435
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:09,430
or why you should be able to access the treasury or, let's say, credit line that you're issued

1436
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:14,390
at birth – you want to call it the all-caps name or the social security number and all that,

1437
01:46:14,430 --> 01:46:18,710
all these other agencies that dip and dab into that, right, when you're birthed – and birth

1438
01:46:18,710 --> 01:46:21,730
has nothing to do with being born, by the way. These are all secrets, by the way.

1439
01:46:22,770 --> 01:46:26,610
You know, it's not that these things are secrets, but the way I'm stringing them together is.

1440
01:46:27,650 --> 01:46:32,490
What happens if you understand what's called public policy, all the statutes and codes and

1441
01:46:32,490 --> 01:46:37,350
things regarding money and law that each corresponding government or whatever nation

1442
01:46:37,350 --> 01:46:44,090
you live in uses – the reason why you're not being told about this is because the people that

1443
01:46:44,090 --> 01:46:50,430
are in government have term limits and they understand that if they create policies and

1444
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:55,270
things that give people access to it, they're not going to be able to profit once they leave

1445
01:46:55,270 --> 01:47:00,630
the office. So when they're in office, they put up the game that there's debt and there's all

1446
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:04,490
this stuff and there's money. So when they get out of office, they have friends and family that

1447
01:47:04,490 --> 01:47:09,350
could work in what's called the secondary market, which is called debt collection and loans and

1448
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:13,590
all these other financial products. By the way, banks don't have money. They have financial

1449
01:47:13,590 --> 01:47:20,150
products – a mortgage, a loan, a card is a financial product like hot dogs and hamburgers

1450
01:47:20,150 --> 01:47:26,470
are at a restaurant, let's say. So the reason why you're not being told this by your entrusted

1451
01:47:26,470 --> 01:47:33,210
leaders is because they have plans for the rest of their lives and their friends and families

1452
01:47:33,210 --> 01:47:39,110
when they do get out of office, how to take advantage of your ignorance of the lack of money.

1453
01:47:41,420 --> 01:47:50,820
And that is the secret. Just as car insurance was, there was no car insurance per se. That was a

1454
01:47:50,820 --> 01:47:57,440
requirement back in the day, but the senators said, why don't we start all these penny stock

1455
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:01,720
insurance companies? And then when we get out of office, penny stock insurance companies,

1456
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:06,080
and we'll pass laws or make laws, alleged laws that people should have it. And when we get out

1457
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:10,740
of office, we already got a head start and we'll do really well. Our family will do really well.

1458
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:18,100
So for just a small group of people to line their pockets, the rest of society has to go ahead with

1459
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:25,260
it. So these are little secrets, not the things themselves, but how they're strung together.

1460
01:48:25,260 --> 01:48:31,460
So we have one more episode to go and we will see you folks next week. In the meantime,

1461
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:35,680
you know what to do. Go to the American Freedom Radio homepage and do the right thing for them

1462
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:40,020
and stay in touch with us if you can. Thank you, Seth. Thank you, everyone.
