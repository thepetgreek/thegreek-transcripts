1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:08,310
Greetings. Greetings. Alright. Yeah, this is the credits version or aspect to the 18th, let's say, Sonic event.

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,230
What do you think about that, Seth? Yeah. Absolutely.

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,690
Yeah, I was thinking, since it's the credits, part of the credits is showing what was done before

4
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:25,290
and probably things that were not shown on the screen or aware to most of the audience.

5
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,730
And I was thinking, you know, you and I didn't discuss this.

6
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:34,950
I was thinking of perhaps bringing up how we got into what's called alternative media, if there is such a thing.

7
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:41,950
Whether it's crawling across the living room rug with its diaper needing to be changed

8
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:48,050
or whether it's walking side by side or as an alternative to what's called mainstream media, right?

9
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,910
And anything in between would be where anyone's thoughts on the matter is, right?

10
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:01,010
So I was maybe thinking randomly, throwing out how I got into it and how you got into it.

11
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:05,990
So maybe you first. I know I'm kind of catching you out there, but let's be spontaneous.

12
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,070
I know you were doing some radio. Of course, you do music.

13
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:15,850
If you want to look up Seth, it's Dead Shoes or Dear Red Shoes previously.

14
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,490
And he does music.

15
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:28,230
And you're also a conversationalist that got interested in perhaps doing some late night what they call radio.

16
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,190
And I believe that's how we met. Maybe we've crossed lines.

17
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,790
And somehow you've I've heard of you speaking and myself speaking.

18
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,010
And when we met on late night alternative radio somewhere else,

19
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,970
we started keeping some discussions going both publicly and privately.

20
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,950
So I kind of filled that in because I kind of caught you out there randomly.

21
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,230
But anything you want to add to that, Seth? I mean, tell us a little bit more if you can.

22
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:59,470
But I got into this whole thing. I pursuit of knowledge, I guess, in a in a short phrase.

23
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:08,990
I was I've always been kind of a suspect of the way things are explained.

24
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,970
Anything at all. Pick anything all across the board.

25
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,870
And that's how I came across a lot of the alternative media, I suppose.

26
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:31,670
I found some books, read some books, decided that I had no true concept of the things around me.

27
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,670
I only was familiar with what was being directly presented.

28
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:44,750
So I went looking for information. And it turns out there's not a whole lot of information out there that is reliable.

29
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:50,610
But there is still quite a lot of knowledge out there. You can go looking for it.

30
00:02:52,110 --> 00:03:04,310
Yeah. So I started I just called in to a radio program and ended up broadcasting a radio show for a couple of years.

31
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:09,290
A few thousand hours of broadcasting conversation, open call in.

32
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:17,230
And, you know, as you said, you and I, that's where we first conversed or held a conversation.

33
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:23,610
And it was it was interesting. I enjoyed it.

34
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,490
And we ended up doing it quite a bit and in broadcast.

35
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:40,370
And it was just we were able to talk about things that were not being discussed or take talk about the things that were being discussed in a in a different light than what is common.

36
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,430
So or some light versus no light. Yeah.

37
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,570
To say putting light on it. Yeah. Yeah.

38
00:03:49,630 --> 00:04:02,610
It's interesting that you ask that, actually, because I was contacted by an acquaintance from from that just that time period last night.

39
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:09,450
Something like that. Yeah. I was called in and spoke for spoke to them for a few minutes.

40
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:15,730
And it's it's I guess it was the same thing.

41
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:23,390
Oh, yeah. Yeah. You got to understand the times. The times dictate the environment, which dictates people's thoughts and other things.

42
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,930
Environment meaning everything seen and unseen. So, yeah.

43
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:34,830
So is about the brief side. But is it about the fourth day of the sixth month?

44
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,310
I'm reckoning it's the almost it's the end of the week of the first.

45
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:48,230
Week, let's say, of the sixth month. And we've been trying to there's nothing to drive home here.

46
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,110
People, you either acknowledge or see what's lawful versus unlawful.

47
00:04:52,270 --> 00:05:05,890
So this is something that can be determined by anyone based on their looking for a reference to mark things by, like, if you're a surveyor, you need a benchmark in order to communicate measurement.

48
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,210
Right. If you're working on a construction site, you need a benchmark.

49
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:16,870
It's called a tape measure, whether you're working in electricity, plumbing or whatever, framing concrete work.

50
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:30,370
You've all agreed on some benchmark. Now, what's been agreed to as being a benchmark by the current world society at large is the Gregorian calendar,

51
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:36,530
which is also I call it in jest the pope's work schedule for his subjects.

52
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:50,730
And the problem with it is that it's not a time piece. It has to be administered, meaning meetings and decisions have to be made on how it will be administered,

53
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:56,030
you know, or or, you know, the liturgy of society, how they will run on it.

54
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:00,630
That's why it's I call it the work schedule, because you have work week weekend.

55
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,910
It's not a time piece. Can't keep time with it. Let's give one example on it.

56
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,310
Now, lawfully, it appears to be the sixth moon or the sixth month.

57
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,310
And these measurements are always done in the light, not in the dark.

58
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:21,610
So the full moon is the new moon. And if you have been trained like a circus bear enough, you will not be able to hear what I just said.

59
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,610
So let's let's do a quick little experiment, which I always do today.

60
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:34,210
According to the pope's work schedule, it's what they call July 23rd and Saturn's Day or Saturday.

61
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,490
Right now, just to show prove the point again, we've done this for a few episodes already.

62
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:48,510
And what they call July 2015, I said it was the 23rd.

63
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:54,770
OK, that was what's called a Thursday. Right. Or Thursday, more commonly known.

64
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:00,430
And if we look at what they call 2017, because there's no such thing either, by the way.

65
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,030
What they call July 23rd is on a Sunday or Sunday.

66
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:14,830
So let me ask you, folks, is July 23rd a Thursday, a Saturday or Sunday?

67
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,450
Let me ask you to think about that for a moment. It's neither.

68
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:24,690
Again, just to recap, if anyone's old enough for before the electronic convention,

69
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:31,890
meaning when you turn on an electronic device that automatically had this demarcation of time on it, what you call time.

70
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,930
If you were growing up at a time period, you said, well, we need to go to get a calendar.

71
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,190
So we know what day it is next year during the end of the year.

72
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,430
You guys remember that anyone old enough for that? Yeah.

73
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:49,630
So and no one is paying any attention. And one of the reasons to go back to the discussion,

74
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:59,250
we kind of started was that I found out about alternative media through discussion to go here,

75
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,910
to go there on the computer and you will hear things. Right.

76
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:09,010
And I tuned into various stations and I was listening to what was being said.

77
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:14,790
And I just had to just have a moment of first review what was being said.

78
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,570
And then I went from one place to another, to another, to another.

79
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:25,970
And I found it to be pretty much a good cross-sectional representation of the thought processes in the mainstream society,

80
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:35,630
with some little tidbits thrown in, you know, what they call conspirology, alternative medicine, alternative this, alternative that, patriotism, such and such.

81
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:46,970
But the information, the subject matter was seemingly adequate, but the facts and the truth of the matter were severely lacking.

82
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:54,370
So I took the opportunity whenever there was a call in to call in and make a comment.

83
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:02,850
And I started interacting. And here, American Freedom Radio, I used to call in often to several shows.

84
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:08,630
And I was asked to perhaps do a show. And I said, well, you know, it's not really time yet.

85
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:14,330
You know, I've pretty much got a pretty good handle on where this society is and where it's going and what's coming in the future.

86
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:20,950
And right now is not the time to be speaking what I have discovered or what anyone can discover if you look at things objectively.

87
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,410
And time went by, time went by, time went by. And I said, OK, finally, I'll do something.

88
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:34,990
We did a sonic event prior to this one and then this one. But still, I wouldn't say it's an act of futility.

89
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:42,430
I believe that there is a time period coming, which if you know it's coming, it'll be quite astonishing to see it come.

90
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:49,470
But if you don't know it's coming, you'll just think it's a natural occurrence, which is people will start to learn to objectify.

91
00:09:49,470 --> 00:10:02,810
Right. What things are, whether it's economic, judicial, entertainment, medical, scientific, mathematic, religious, all these things will be objectified.

92
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:10,730
Right now, there is no objectification at all. When I say at all, meaning there's so little that it's irrelevant.

93
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:16,510
It's irrelevant to say that there is so statistically. Right.

94
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:25,190
And here we are. And still, it is pretty much the just throw this out for those that are listening.

95
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,750
And, you know, we might only have two listeners, by the way, not four or five.

96
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:34,490
Like we've always been saying, based on some of the comments that I've been getting lately on Skype and email.

97
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:43,850
But not to discourage anyone. Keep communication going. It's adequate. It's fine. We enjoy it.

98
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:52,270
But you have about roughly two years left in this particular time period.

99
00:10:52,970 --> 00:11:03,450
And I think we've said several times before on this Uncommon Sense show, it's going to be pretty much the same as you've been seeing it.

100
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:17,250
These little squirmishes going on, threat of economic collapse, criticism of corrupt politicians and missing planes over and over and over.

101
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,330
This is pretty much what you get, what you're going to get for the next two years or so.

102
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:31,430
And then is another time period that's going to begin that will be a little more refreshing to those that are truly seeking how things work.

103
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:38,730
But right now is not the time for that. If you are one of those that do seek how things work, what makes things go tick?

104
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:49,970
Typical human reaction is to go out and share it. Well, yeah, you're not going to be met with open arms.

105
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:55,270
Let's say the last thing you want to do is be super vocal about the truth.

106
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:03,130
And well, now, let's just not use this word, the truth, too much because it's been, you know, they've used it to mop the floor.

107
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:12,670
And if you don't believe it, go listen to what's being said on Mainstream and Alternative, all of it, not some of it, and do a little bit of research, just a little bit.

108
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,150
And you will see what we just said is true.

109
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:25,330
So, again, it's let's call this the 18th episode. It's the credits that you and I are getting together for this particular sonic experience.

110
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:32,390
So I guess with that said, that's how we got into it. A little bit more added in with time and the date being first the end of the first week.

111
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,050
So of the sixth month, which, by the way, we're just throwing a little more.

112
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:44,070
This might sound esoteric or occult, but six represents man, by the way, folks.

113
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,790
You know, five represents something that comes before man.

114
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:57,890
It could be animal kingdom. It could be a time period or an attitude prior to the man manifesting for represents something very interesting.

115
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:04,370
It's actually a center point. And let's go the other way. And seven represents the divine.

116
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:11,630
So just a little tidbit there. These things will be elaborated on more in the future.

117
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:20,010
If you'd like to stay in touch with us and Seth, let them know how they should try to get in touch with us.

118
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,870
Perhaps the email at Uncommon Radio, right?

119
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:28,330
Yeah. Yeah. Uncommon Radio dot com.

120
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,870
Yeah. Uncommon Radio dot com is the easiest way to find it.

121
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:45,470
Every for certainly until we get the next thing going, how we how we want to do it, then that's going to be the easiest way to to keep track of all of it.

122
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,250
Www.uncommonradio.com.

123
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,290
Yes. You'll find archives and other things. It's just a courtesy page.

124
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,630
Not into I'm not into doing websites or anything like that.

125
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,290
We tend to find that sonic experiences are the best way to interact.

126
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,570
They're also hard. Yeah. Yeah. It's just a courtesy calling card.

127
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:10,910
Yeah. So, yeah. Stay in touch, folks, if you're interested.

128
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:24,090
Yeah. You won't make friends, by the way, listening and discussing the things that you hear here, because people just tend to not want to listen at this point yet.

129
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:29,090
Does it mean they're bad? Definitely mean that it doesn't mean that they're good either.

130
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:36,890
Right. Someone asked me sometimes, you know, people ask things and they kind of look up to you regarding a certain subject matter and they're looking for approval.

131
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:42,630
And they'll say, well, am I wrong on that? And I'll say, well, you're not really wrong, but it's just not right enough.

132
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,530
You see. So there's just a there's is anything wrong?

133
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,550
No, but it definitely sure ain't right. That's for sure.

134
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,970
So, yeah. And the motto of what we do is to set yourself apart, folks.

135
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,530
Anyone talks about changing anything. You want to walk away. That's good advice.

136
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:09,850
Now, if you want to discuss it more objectively, you hear about this stuff they put in yeast and bread.

137
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:14,710
It's called activism or something like that. Yeah.

138
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:23,270
You know, there's an old saying about voting that if you want to really know, know what if you should vote or not have a five minute conversation with a voter.

139
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:32,630
If you want to know whether you should think about changing the world or being part of a group that does have a five minute conversation with an activist and be objective.

140
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:38,770
Ask them what they're protesting and ask them some objectifying questions about it.

141
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:43,890
Right. And you'll notice they know absolutely nothing about it because you know what?

142
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:52,030
It's activism, folks. Anyway. So, yeah, the aspect to these things is to set yourself apart.

143
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:57,550
That's the motto. Essentially, set yourself apart and protect yourself. It's called shielding.

144
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:04,950
Yeah. It's like as if you had a well-paying job or job that you had to work in the sewer every day.

145
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:15,830
Would you be would you be concerned about telling everyone to stop throwing their pooper into the into the tank and pulling the handle because there's too much poop in there?

146
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:22,950
Or are you going to think that you're getting paid so much?

147
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:27,450
Let's say that you're going to jump in there naked, skin dipping and drink the water. Can they pay you enough to do that?

148
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,810
Nope. Well-paying job working in the sewer requires.

149
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:37,310
Good amount of barrier protection, buffer zone, hazmat suits, breathing tanks.

150
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:48,190
So if you're on this planet and you're naive enough to think that you're going to change anything or any groups going to change anything, you're naive enough or excessively naive.

151
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:54,810
And by the way, folks, nothing exceeds excess. So don't be excessively naive.

152
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,730
That's all the way on the end. The best thing to do is to separate yourself from it.

153
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:06,170
Right. Shield yourself. You talk to someone who works on high power, high tension power lines.

154
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:10,910
I think they go out there and flip flip flops, a boxer shorts and a tank top.

155
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,589
Grab that thing. Hundred thousand volts.

156
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:19,390
Yeah. Pay attention, folks. Earth is a very violent place.

157
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,310
Yeah. Nature. Nature is incredibly violent.

158
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:29,070
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And one day people will find out. We'll discuss this in the future.

159
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,850
Things that have been memorialized. Oh, yeah. Those really ignorant ancients.

160
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,470
And they're so ignorant and dumb. We're so modern now. So we have smartphones. Right.

161
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,210
I've read a read a quote that speaks directly to that recently.

162
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:52,150
I think it was Edgar Allen Poe actually had something to say about that.

163
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:55,590
It was good. Yeah. Something to say.

164
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,430
And the things that we've spoken on that same topic.

165
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:03,450
Actually, now that's that you said something there, Seth, is we can use the word say a lot.

166
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,270
When someone has something to say, you should listen.

167
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,970
But when people just say, say something, just walk away.

168
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,530
That's the mark of a fool. How many times have you heard?

169
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,430
We've got to do something. We've got to say something.

170
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,810
Yeah. Just like, you know, tilt your hat the other way and just keep walking,

171
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,850
because nothing going to come out of that. And that's for sure, folks.

172
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,410
There's an old saying. I think it was one of the Greek philosophers.

173
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:32,750
It says that a fool has to say something, but the wise have something to say.

174
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:40,240
Now, another thing, this is just like basic instruction on how to function on this planet,

175
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,200
is that the level of stubbornness and rebelliousness and resistance to anything that's fit and proper

176
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,920
by your average surface dwelling earth inhabitant is so high at this point

177
00:18:52,920 --> 00:19:03,120
that they have this really tricky, almost conniving, insidious way of discounting informational flow.

178
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,620
And the way they do that, this is through conversation, is if you're bringing up a topic

179
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:17,560
and you try to impart or convey something that can be objectified or referenced by anyone

180
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:22,940
on the meaning of the word, let's say, or facts regarding a cause or a law

181
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:29,040
or something that's been memorialized, if they don't like it, what they're hearing,

182
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,360
they immediately insidiously discount what you're saying as your opinion.

183
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,360
That's what they say. So you've got to watch out for that also.

184
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:44,140
When you're talking to your average surface dwelling inhabitant, they will tell you that,

185
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:48,140
oh, yeah, I don't like what you're saying. I don't agree with it. That's your opinion.

186
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,980
You see, so they have a lot of insidious tricks that they use.

187
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,920
They're a pretty wicked group, anyway. I didn't say that, did I?

188
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:05,820
Okay. So you've got to be careful when you're communicating with your typical surface dwelling earth inhabitants

189
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,260
regarding discoveries and things that can be referenced.

190
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:16,060
The level of hypocrisy is so high at this point, meaning that people, when they go to buy shoes,

191
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,480
they want the right shoe size. So if you wear a size 8, someone brings out a 10 1⁄2.

192
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,220
No, I want a size 8. I need a size 8. That's what I need, right?

193
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,020
An American or, let's say, a 42 in England or something, right?

194
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,840
And they also like, you know, if they need a door replaced, they want it exactly to fit.

195
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,420
I mean, they want it measured out and fit precisely.

196
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,020
You know, if they need a part for their engine or a tire or something or a window,

197
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,360
they want it measured out precisely.

198
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:51,620
But when it comes time to communicating ideas or facts or objectifying the reality of the economic system,

199
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,620
the judicial system, the scientific system, the religious system, that's your opinion.

200
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,980
We don't need to know that. I don't believe in that.

201
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,360
Well, what do you believe in? I don't know. I'm just happy with what I believe in.

202
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,140
Well, tell me about it. I don't need to know anything about it. I just believe in it.

203
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,540
Okay, this is what you're going to be dealing with.

204
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,460
And I don't know, what does this have to do with the credits?

205
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,480
I guess that's kind of like the sentiment of this entire 18 episode on Common Sense,

206
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,100
is beware of the fools that are traversing the surface of this planet.

207
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:31,120
And they come in all shapes and colors and sizes and races and creeds and language.

208
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,640
And it's across the board.

209
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,580
We're not criticizing Americans or Europeans or people that live on the continent of Africa or anything like that.

210
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,880
It's the entire group as a whole.

211
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,460
This is a message to the mothership, folks.

212
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,080
So be objective, be clear.

213
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,040
And that's the other thing we try to discuss is clarity.

214
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:58,540
How are you going to go out and do activism or discuss any subject?

215
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:04,780
I mean, one of the funniest things I hear being discussed is liberty and rights and legal.

216
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:10,240
You hear those terms without them being prefaced or defined.

217
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,480
You're listening to the typical surface dwelling inhabitant, tripe, garbage.

218
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,640
And it's everywhere, folks.

219
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:24,120
And yeah, clarity, you're going to need clarity.

220
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,800
That's the thing that is lacking severely.

221
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,920
Oh, but that's your opinion, man.

222
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,900
We don't need clarity.

223
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,780
I believe in what I believe in.

224
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,700
What do you believe in?

225
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,360
Well, that's what I believe in.

226
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,740
Tell me about it.

227
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,120
I don't need to know anything about it.

228
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,060
I just believe in it.

229
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,000
Welcome to planet Earth, folks.

230
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,200
So you want to go and change that.

231
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,860
Best thing to do.

232
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,440
Set yourself apart.

233
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,200
It's called shielding separation.

234
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:52,320
Yeah.

235
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,220
Act impeccably.

236
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,320
These people are dangerous.

237
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,580
When I say these people, typical surface dwelling Earth inhabitants.

238
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,240
So, yeah, I mean, there's a reason why things are the way they are.

239
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,600
So be objective and be clear.

240
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,040
What say you about clarity, Seth?

241
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,560
Language, comprehension of language makes it easier.

242
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:24,580
Clarity, you can, if you understand or comprehend, rather,

243
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,580
the words that you are using to describe anything at all, you will have,

244
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,500
there will be it will be more clear regardless of who's listening.

245
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,900
And if you happen to be, you know,

246
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:47,980
have a listener that is also familiar with what words actually mean,

247
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,060
then the amount of information that can be transmitted

248
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,580
and received is greatly increased.

249
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,340
And I think that a good thing.

250
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,860
Like communicating the shoe size that you're looking for to the appropriate measurement

251
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,060
and getting it makes for better walking.

252
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,180
Absolutely.

253
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,420
So if you're going to use words like liberty and rights and legal

254
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,560
and better know what those things mean and none of you do, by the way,

255
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:23,520
when I say none of you meaning guys with microphones and websites

256
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,060
and might have some things in print, you got to check yourself, man.

257
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,160
You're doing a big disservice to the public, but maybe the public likes that.

258
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,740
I've seen a lot of people demand these artificial sweeteners out in public restaurants

259
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,300
instead of real sweetener, you know, like something derived from a plant, let's say.

260
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,380
And they get quite upset if they're not offered that.

261
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,920
So maybe people want this synthesized stuff that gives them cancer of the mind.

262
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,800
Yeah, I don't know.

263
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,520
It's strange, but I don't want to know.

264
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,800
I just want to objectify and have clarity of it because saying that you want to know

265
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,260
and get involved means you're implying that you might expect to change.

266
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,380
And the thing is when you expect change,

267
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,000
one of the things of being a man or woman, by the way,

268
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,060
you might want to call it where we're at in the food chain or so forth,

269
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,540
you have enough information, the cognitive ability, and the information accessible

270
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,200
to know what happened in the past, what's happening now,

271
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,800
and what's going to happen in the future.

272
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,200
That's not a big deal, folks.

273
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:32,220
Stop falling for these new age idiots talking about past lives and reading your cards

274
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,860
and what dreams are and things like that.

275
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,140
I'm not saying stop it, but I have for sure.

276
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,720
I mean, nothing there.

277
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:41,920
It's entertainment.

278
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,300
Now, most people take these things very seriously, by the way,

279
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,180
what's coming in the future and what happened in the past and what's going on now.

280
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,220
And they do go to these new age crap.

281
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,160
When I say new age crap, that's just a quick label.

282
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,940
That stuff has been around for all the ages, by the way,

283
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:05,040
those taking advantage of the energy that people want to dedicate to these things.

284
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,000
They've been around for a while.

285
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,760
And no matter how serious these people that are telling you a lot of these esoteric things are,

286
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,140
if you kind of bring up the point that what they're saying is wholly inaccurate

287
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,400
and not even accessible in any way or not even real in any way,

288
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:28,640
they either run away, shut up, get angry, or they tell you, oh, this is just entertainment.

289
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:36,400
But the people that this is being imparted to through media or what have you are not aware of that.

290
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,160
They kind of take it seriously because they're naive and sometimes excessively naive enough.

291
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,620
So a word of caution, folks, before you get into researching

292
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:53,640
or accepting what you think is relevant information on any subject,

293
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,480
do you have enough clarity to see what's being said to you?

294
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,280
Can you ask questions in real time, meaning as the information is streaming to your mind,

295
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,680
from whether you're reading it or listening to it,

296
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,840
can you question what you're hearing or reading or are you reading into it?

297
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:17,180
You see, are you reading out of it? Are you listening to what's being said accurately?

298
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,900
Now what I mean by reading into it, most people read into things.

299
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,600
Whenever they hear something or see something or experience something,

300
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,060
the mind is acting very quickly, unbeknownst to them, to try to connect what they're experiencing,

301
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:36,720
whether it's sonic, audible, cognitive, visual, to things that they've seen before.

302
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,280
And if we have a close enough match, they fit it in.

303
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,500
So it might be an elliptical peg. They have a circle, a round hole.

304
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:48,060
They say, ah, they're both kind of round. Let's just squeeze it in there and that'll be that.

305
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,320
A good example would be biblical references.

306
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,200
When people open up and read that book called the Bible and they get to a certain point,

307
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,360
they're like, oh, this is the point that I saw in the movie.

308
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,380
And they're not even reading what's there.

309
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,540
I mean, this happens all the time.

310
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,340
It's bad if they put what was there in the movies.

311
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,820
Nothing in any of the films has ever been done.

312
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,110
None of the religions have anything portrayed in the practices,

313
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,620
either iconography or anything that's in the text that they allegedly subscribe to.

314
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,180
None of them.

315
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:34,860
I'm surprised by it, too, because even with what culture seems to enjoy,

316
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:41,980
as far as cinematic entertainment, a lot of it is very violent.

317
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:50,860
And the fact that there's all of these incredibly violent things that happen,

318
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,120
and yet it's just, you can't turn on the television and see it.

319
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,240
It's kind of amusing, almost.

320
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,080
Some people don't need to turn it on because it's always on.

321
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,060
Right?

322
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,800
Just throw that in there. Yeah.

323
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,020
Television, by the way, which is audio and video, is very important.

324
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,440
Not television per se.

325
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,320
They used to call them television sets, remember?

326
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,160
Because some of them didn't have audio.

327
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,840
They had an audio and a video section.

328
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:27,780
But anyway, this audio-video thing, by the way, is a prerequisite in some ancient text

329
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,720
that says that in order to understand the information,

330
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,400
you don't need to learn a particular language or philosophy or go to school,

331
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,980
but you need to have eyes that see and ears that hear.

332
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,400
So something visual and something audio is going to be happening in the future.

333
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,320
And let's just give a secret out because what a better place to give secrets

334
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,160
other than a minor Internet radio with a minor show

335
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:58,220
and just two unknown guys that come around and talk stuff that four or five people listen to every week.

336
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:05,640
Well, what you're going to see encoded in a particular ancient text is audio and video code

337
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,700
that will be assimilated and presented in the future as well.

338
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,720
Yes, you heard me right.

339
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:21,140
That's why you have a proliferation of inexpensive devices that these phones give you video.

340
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:27,080
And the video and the visual is just as important as the sonic.

341
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,080
As a matter of fact, more so, because the speaker technology

342
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,920
and most of these small devices is still not very good.

343
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:41,400
And this is based on the entitlement that the current engineers in the audio business tend to enjoy.

344
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:46,140
What I mean by entitlement is you go through a particular level of pranking

345
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,720
until you get what's called a degree,

346
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:52,580
so you can hold a position in society that you could pull social rank on other people.

347
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,780
Yes, you know who you are.

348
00:30:53,780 --> 00:31:03,140
You're called doctors, attorneys, priests, pastors, rabbis, you know, engineers, whatever.

349
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,520
You're pranking.

350
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:09,300
But these pranksters known as audio engineers refuse to accept a particular technology

351
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,260
that's been around for about ten years that make small devices sound very clear

352
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,580
and very audible and use less power because it was, quote-unquote,

353
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,240
discovered or slash invented by a non-engineer.

354
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:24,360
So you're still subject to this pranking from the entitled classes.

355
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:31,340
But in the future you won't be because it'll be like a wave that overcomes everything.

356
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,700
And this wave is going to be accessible audio-video information to everyone on the planet

357
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,280
regarding events that are going to be taking place at certain parts of the world.

358
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,940
And this is within a decade plus.

359
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,500
And this is why we mentioned before.

360
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,620
You might be in a want for water, a want for food, or a want for credit, what you call money,

361
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:58,140
a want for transportation, a want for liberty and rights, right, like you call it,

362
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:03,340
but you won't have a want for accessible to instant communication and audio-video form.

363
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,400
There's a reason for that.

364
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,900
And it has nothing to do with what you're doing.

365
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,440
It has to do with the way things are and the way things have to be.

366
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,780
So just keep that in mind, folks.

367
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,400
This audio-video thing is not going to go away.

368
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,380
It's going to increase and be more prolific as you go on in time.

369
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:34,500
So, yeah, there's many things that have been discussed and kind of stated once before

370
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:40,600
that I wanted to kind of go into each one of these sonic episodes as being more topical in nature

371
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:46,760
and getting into a topic a little more deeply than just mentioning in passing,

372
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,780
hey, did you ever think of this, right?

373
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:57,480
But just to reiterate, during the week when I was kind of thinking about what to talk about,

374
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:02,100
I kind of poked around in alternative media and listened around a little bit,

375
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,760
and I was like, you've got to be kidding.

376
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:09,760
I couldn't find anyone or anything on the alternative Internet at all

377
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:16,180
or mainstream that was even close to what level of subject matter we wanted to discuss.

378
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,380
I was like, you've got to be kidding me.

379
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,860
People are accepting this junk.

380
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,120
There is no way I'm going to come out and talk about water publicly.

381
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,140
There's no way I'm going to come out and talk about how the banks work.

382
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,360
There's no way I'm going to come out and talk about how the body works in a little more depth.

383
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,020
There's no way I'm going to come out and talk about how automobiles work.

384
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,240
No way.

385
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,420
I spoke to a psychic the other day.

386
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,040
You did?

387
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,500
Well, why did you have to speak to them if they're psychic?

388
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,980
Shouldn't they have been able to read your mind?

389
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,080
But anyway, that was what I implied.

390
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:53,560
It was, I was incredibly reserved in my, I just kind of was like, oh, okay.

391
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:58,540
And yeah, it was, I didn't speak much, but that happened.

392
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,500
It was, yeah, it happened.

393
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,120
It was, I'd say entertaining, but it wasn't really entertaining.

394
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,420
There's a short little YouTube, by the way, if anyone wants to look, it's called Psychic Fail,

395
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:13,500
and it's a French interview of a man sitting in a train car, and he's a reporter,

396
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,020
and he asks this older man, are you psychic?

397
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:21,120
He says yes, and then he just gives them a full-fingered, full-open palm slap across the head,

398
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:25,400
knocks him to the side, and he says, well, you didn't see that coming, did you?

399
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,520
And he says no.

400
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,219
He says, well, you see, I got a charlatan over here.

401
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,440
You're not psychic.

402
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,159
And that's what they're all going to get.

403
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:39,300
The entitled classes are going to get this kind of stuff in the future.

404
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,820
It's going to be seemingly natural, but if you know it's coming, it won't.

405
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,699
It will be pretty obvious.

406
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,739
So now anyone who's listening, or even if you're just hearing things,

407
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:56,240
you might be able to remember there's going to be a pretty drastic change starting in the next few years.

408
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,720
To sanity, wellness, by the way, that's what that means, I guess.

409
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,580
Seth, would you say sanity means wellness?

410
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,260
Yeah.

411
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,200
Insanity means unwellness, unhealthy.

412
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,040
Sanity is health.

413
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,160
Yeah.

414
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:13,860
Absolutely.

415
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:23,780
Yeah, I am looking forward to the next sonic endeavor that we do as well,

416
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,040
getting into a little bit more depth, I think.

417
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,900
Yeah, yeah.

418
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,860
I don't know.

419
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,880
It needs to be done tastefully.

420
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:39,260
It needs to be done appropriately, meaning whoever, yeah, I think it needs to be set apart.

421
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,540
I don't know how it's going to be done at this point.

422
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,060
It has to be set apart.

423
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,940
Here, everybody cover your ears.

424
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,800
Privately, Seth, you and I, I'd like to not even do it on the Internet.

425
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:00,400
Anyway, all right, folks, I almost want to just write it on an old typewriter

426
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,880
and go to the old mimeograph machines that were loaded with this blue alcohol dye kind of stuff.

427
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,220
I don't know if anyone remembers that.

428
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,880
Or a woodblock print and just send it through the post.

429
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,420
Who to?

430
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,720
Yeah, exactly, to who?

431
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,720
That's the whole point.

432
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,660
But it's a strange desire.

433
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,500
Let's get less strange and, yeah, it will be on the Internet somehow.

434
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,980
We have a blog spot.

435
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:29,320
There's the www.uncommonradio.com.

436
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,380
A little Skype is being set up.

437
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,940
So, yeah, yeah.

438
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:38,160
And we're not going to talk about theories or Anunnaki or going to outer space

439
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,300
or liberty and rights and ridiculous stuff like that, yeah,

440
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,960
or how to change anything for the better in a social level.

441
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,620
It's going to be stuff that you can access immediately and you can see within arm's reach,

442
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,420
whether it has to do with water, automobile, what you call automobiles.

443
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,860
And they're not really automobiles, folks, because they're not auto.

444
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,400
They have to put fuel in them.

445
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:06,740
How to, let's say, change things in a car so it doesn't run like they tell you it does.

446
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,260
Discuss how the body really works, you know.

447
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,700
Just not some crazy theory and not allopathically.

448
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,940
We don't care about any substance that's illegal or needs to be legalized.

449
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,640
You know what I'm talking about, you stoners.

450
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,060
That's irrelevant.

451
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,560
We're not going to be talking about that.

452
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,540
We're not going to be talking about some stupid drops or something you make,

453
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,940
like you can't, you know, get on your own from within reach.

454
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:41,540
We're not going to be talking about, yeah, calories or blood pressure.

455
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,440
These are ridiculous things that don't exist.

456
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,780
Very relevant to the body.

457
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,380
Things that really, really work that you can access immediately.

458
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,300
Things that really work with water that you can access immediately.

459
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,120
Discuss how the banking system works, how money works.

460
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:03,100
If you can relax the mind enough, you will find that it's whoever you're doing banking with,

461
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,440
the local whatever branch, is ripping you off blind.

462
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,560
Not some Federal Reserve entity.

463
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,340
Yes, the Federal Reserve is the outline, but you'll see how whatever.

464
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:22,400
And anyone who talks to anyone that is in the arts of divinity, let's say a priest, a preacher, a minister, a rabbi or an imam,

465
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,100
will discuss what they're doing and what they should be doing or shouldn't be doing

466
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:32,340
and what these things that these people tend to represent really are.

467
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,900
Quote, unquote, religion.

468
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,560
You know, it only takes a few minutes.

469
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,160
You know, if anyone, by the way, if you have what's called a Bible,

470
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:45,400
if you have an under-bridged version, go read the introduction,

471
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,740
and you tell me if you want to continue reading.

472
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:52,640
They're flat out telling you what's going on with that.

473
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,540
Yeah.

474
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:00,340
They should put in there the disclaimer that they put at the end of films.

475
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,640
If anyone is alive or dead or whatever, it's just purely by coincidence.

476
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,760
So what is that disclaimer they use in film?

477
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,540
If anything represented herein resembles anyone alive or dead, it's purely by coincidence.

478
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:13,940
Yeah, purely coincidental.

479
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,140
Yeah, exactly.

480
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,100
Any person's living or deceased is purely coincidental.

481
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,160
This is a work of fiction.

482
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,880
Yeah, and then you have people actually pick up the King James and try to explain it.

483
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,080
I'm like, dude, don't you know what you're reading out of is not even legitimate, not even close?

484
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,240
I mean, they tell you.

485
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,320
I mean, it's just ridiculous.

486
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,500
It's just absurd, you know.

487
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,880
And this is actually explained in the text itself, but no one reads it anyway.

488
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,240
And by the way, when we bring up books, you know, there's still a lot of people out there.

489
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,940
They're like, I don't need a book to tell me anything.

490
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,460
I don't need to get any knowledge from a book.

491
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,420
I just believe.

492
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,220
What do you believe in?

493
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,780
I don't know.

494
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,420
I just believe.

495
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,980
This is the level of humanity, folks.

496
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,500
And they're really proud of telling you they don't know anything.

497
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,280
That's like being really proud of being stupid, folks.

498
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,640
And you know what?

499
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,200
That's also written about by the agents as well.

500
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,160
So, yeah.

501
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:18,300
They have like 15 different ways, I've noticed, in the past year that people express their pride of how ignorant they are.

502
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,840
But they don't quite say it that way.

503
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,960
I'm saying it that way.

504
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,200
You know, it's just excessive.

505
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:27,620
But remember, the pride comes right before the fall.

506
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:32,350
So, yeah, it's quite interesting.

507
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,910
So, yeah, we'll be discussing all these other things.

508
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:37,530
And if you're looking forward to it, Seth, hopefully others are.

509
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:43,490
I think these things need to be done, only because no one else is.

510
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:45,150
And it's thankless in a way.

511
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:52,190
I mean, there are some people that kind of say, yeah, you kind of took a little while to wrap around what you were saying.

512
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,670
I said, maybe because it's too simple.

513
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,970
Yeah, yeah, it's kind of almost too simple.

514
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:03,830
So, we don't discuss trends as such.

515
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:07,450
We discuss objectivity, clarity.

516
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:14,030
And you'll see that when you see things objectively and clearly, you'll see a trend is not really a trend.

517
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,530
It's not this random flow.

518
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:22,670
And you'll see why a lot of these things are somewhat shameful after they've been accepted.

519
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,070
You know, like if you ever have, if you're not old enough,

520
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:32,470
do you ever remember seeing a photograph of a parent or an uncle or an older friend from the 1970s

521
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:39,970
with the really strange colored polyester fabrics with wide lapels and polyester bell bottoms?

522
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,370
Man, they thought that was the best stuff at the time, didn't they?

523
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,350
Now they're kind of embarrassed.

524
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:47,030
Look how ugly that stuff looks, right?

525
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:52,150
So, a lot of the stuff that folks accept as trends and social things and changes

526
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:56,710
are met with great shame later on and embarrassment, typically.

527
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:03,290
So, unless they're glorified and romanticized, which tends to happen as well.

528
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,340
Yes, it does.

529
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,060
Worship of the past is relatively common.

530
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,340
And, yeah.

531
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,880
A bit strange, but relatively common.

532
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,700
Yeah, go ahead.

533
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:27,700
I always hearken back to the phrase, the quote, history doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes.

534
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,720
People do it.

535
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,580
But it's not even that history repeats itself.

536
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,300
It kind of does.

537
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,940
All of these things are set, folks.

538
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:42,980
And you don't really want to know that they are set because it kind of scares people.

539
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,180
They like the uncertainty.

540
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:54,800
They like the idea of randomness because it gives them a level of control that they don't have to take responsibility for.

541
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:03,300
See, when you kind of admit that things are random and no one knows what's coming or what is going to happen,

542
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,280
then you don't have to take responsibility for it, right?

543
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,200
Because, hey, it's random.

544
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:09,720
No one knew it was coming.

545
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,620
But once you know it's coming, now you're in a different light.

546
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,060
Now you're in a different position.

547
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:21,370
Now you are held responsible for certain things and not necessarily the acts themselves,

548
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:29,160
whether you're assisting them or impeding them, you know, whether it's you said something about it, right?

549
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:36,400
So that's, again, folks, when you listen to media, get a counter and write down,

550
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:46,200
make a column of what the word you hear being said, like I don't know or no one knows or who cares or opinion or belief.

551
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,660
Make a column with these words.

552
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:54,400
I don't know, belief, who cares or, you know, opinion, especially the I don't know one.

553
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:58,280
And every time you hear anything in the media, it doesn't matter, any media, you know,

554
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,460
everything before this show and after this show, anywhere.

555
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:08,140
And make a column and mark how many times those words come up and you will be astonished.

556
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:17,300
And then start piecing it together with everything else that's being said as if you can now make the decision.

557
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:24,780
What you are hearing or listening to is coming from a source that knows anything about what they're talking about.

558
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,160
And if you answered, no, they don't know.

559
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,200
That's correct.

560
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:37,700
They've actually heard something that was popular to talk about from someone else or themselves and they can do it.

561
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,180
And it's keeping everything moving.

562
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,840
And that's called entertainment.

563
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:52,600
So but I think infotainment concept being informed and entertained at the same time is very good as well.

564
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:59,620
So I don't know if we make you folks laugh or cry or get angry or yell at the speakers like I used to when I was a kid.

565
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:04,020
When I listened to Internet radio, as I used to because I don't listen to it anymore.

566
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:09,640
But either way, folks, there's lots to be said, lots to be done.

567
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:14,880
But not to change anything on a social or cosmic level.

568
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,920
So maybe did we mention Seth on our next perhaps sonic presentations?

569
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:25,240
We might talk about what's coming in the future with great accuracy and specificity.

570
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,980
I don't think we mentioned that.

571
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,460
We've we've done a bit of that already.

572
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:37,480
Yeah. You don't need a crystal ball or psychic or reading tea leaves, folks.

573
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,040
Yeah. Got to know what it means to be a man or a woman.

574
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,680
Where are you? Who are you?

575
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:49,500
Also avoid avoid internalizing too much.

576
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:58,160
When you hear people say this is our planet, our skies, our plants, our children, our government, our legal system.

577
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,000
You hear that coming from someone run.

578
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:07,520
That's someone who's stuck on flypaper.

579
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,380
You ever see a fly stuck on flypaper.

580
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,200
You try to remove it leaves like the wings and the legs and the head behind.

581
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:17,260
Yeah. Those people are stuck there.

582
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,200
Yeah. They can't get over there.

583
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:24,460
They're stuck in the in the entire thing as it's moving.

584
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,980
It's it's like a conveyor belt with the meat grinder at the end.

585
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,540
You don't want to jump on that conveyor.

586
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,560
So this is what you hear.

587
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,100
All you hear is people taking possession.

588
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,660
Now what that means. Why are they stuck?

589
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,060
Why why run the other way?

590
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,360
Here's the explanation.

591
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,900
Very simply, when you claim something is yours, now you get the bill.

592
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,220
You take liability for it cosmically and divinely.

593
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:59,960
So when you're listening to someone say this is our planet, our government, our legal system, our medical system, our belief, our skies, our plants, our children, our oceans.

594
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,760
They are taking the hit.

595
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:08,300
Liability both divinely and cosmically.

596
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:13,000
They're writing checks with their mouth that they will be cashing with their bodies later.

597
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,540
So listen for that.

598
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,540
Make another column.

599
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:23,680
When you hear any listening to anything, anything at all, even university, make a column.

600
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:24,740
I don't know.

601
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:34,440
Belief, opinion, mine or ours or we and how many times these things are brought up in conversation or presentation.

602
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:40,440
Make a note of how many times these things are brought up and that completely shows you what's going on.

603
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,640
Be objective.

604
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,900
Tend to make a statement sometimes whether it's harsh or not.

605
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:52,780
By the way, when the level of bad behavior or criminality is high, the level of harshness of language is also required to be high.

606
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,640
That's why you hear us calling or myself calling people morons and idiots and imbeciles.

607
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,680
Because it's gone way beyond the acceptable point for anyone.

608
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,860
And no one is noticing.

609
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:05,880
So, yeah.

610
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:08,670
Yeah.

611
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:10,930
We also have just to jump in here.

612
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:12,830
We've got a little bit of time for the end of the first hour.

613
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:19,730
You brought up perhaps discussing scripture a little bit, maybe regarding wisdom and Psalms and things like that.

614
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:28,010
My response was, I don't know how we can do that publicly, because first thing you bring that up, they think of some kind of religion.

615
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:35,210
And then there was another comment being made about, you know, why don't we just talk about Christianity or these religions, all of them, not just Christianity.

616
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:42,030
There's no significance to Christianity, Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, whatever, whatever, or what they call Satanism.

617
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:46,210
These things are not as significant as people think they are.

618
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:49,830
They are social things.

619
00:48:49,830 --> 00:49:00,390
And the significance that's brought forward is what is really going on with it, really going on with all of these religions.

620
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:01,710
And there's hundreds of them.

621
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:04,510
Would you say I think there's hundreds of various religions?

622
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,970
Could it possibly be in the thousands?

623
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:07,370
Yeah, there are forms.

624
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:09,170
I would say a little bit more than that.

625
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:16,010
They're social clubs with a form of, like, pseudo government, you know, use the word etymologically.

626
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:17,750
And they use the government.

627
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:23,650
I mean, they are the government, because let's say there's an overthrow revolution or whatever in a government.

628
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:26,090
You notice that the religious institutions tend to stay.

629
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:27,430
Yeah, yeah.

630
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:42,090
It was more overtly the case, you know, I suppose most recently, perhaps not even most recently, but, you know, with the Roman Catholic empire at one point.

631
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:45,670
Which is not Roman, and it's not really Catholic, which it is.

632
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:46,750
Yeah.

633
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:50,010
Roman meaning it's an offshoot of the Greek empire.

634
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:50,850
Right.

635
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:54,090
Well, I would call it the Hellenistic paganism empire.

636
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:54,590
Yes.

637
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:57,190
I don't think anyone would know what I was saying.

638
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:57,950
Yeah.

639
00:49:58,310 --> 00:49:59,830
Well, let's give it a try.

640
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:13,770
And the other thing is it's not Catholic, which means universal, because not strictly, but predominantly the liturgy, the people, the things that people are involved in, is the revived Hellenistic paganism that was done in ancient Greece.

641
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:20,190
And the leadership is involved in occult Canaanite and Babylonian practices.

642
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:31,410
So those are the three major aspects of what's called Catholicism, which is not necessarily universal, because you just laid out about 95 or 99% of what it really is.

643
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:49,790
And it's a revived Hellenistic paganism with, when I say Canaanite, Dagon worship, human sacrifice, Babylonian, meaning overt structural embellishments, overt display of power.

644
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:51,810
Have you ever heard of the seven?

645
00:50:52,350 --> 00:51:10,730
It's done, you mentioned even earlier in the program, that it has significant differences in the way that it's practiced in different localities, specifically like the southern American continent or even the southern North American continent.

646
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:18,550
It's practiced, widespread practice, but it's almost not recognizable.

647
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:29,130
Some of the iconography, I suppose, is very similar, but even what iconography is said to represent varies from one place to another.

648
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:43,770
Like here's, I guess, Seth, I just threw in, it's geographically, all religions are geographically based, regardless if you're talking about Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism, what have you, regardless, Satanism, all that stuff is geographically situated.

649
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:57,750
And also you have to remember, even though you might have different geographical locations with similar nomenclature, meaning, oh, this is Christian, this is Buddhist, this is Muslim, this is whatever, that's just the shingle being changed outside.

650
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:07,430
So it's just like, you know, you have Joe's hardware for 20 years, and then all of a sudden they change it to Phil's hardware, but everything's the same inside.

651
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:09,530
There are a couple of changes, right?

652
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:10,570
Still have hammers?

653
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:11,210
Yep.

654
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:14,470
They still have hammers, yeah, exactly, and saws, right?

655
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:16,650
And this is all they're doing.

656
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:20,790
So if you look at Islam, that's why you have all the various sects.

657
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:23,970
They're doing the same stuff that has been done since post-flood times.

658
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,910
Just call it Islam, but it's this type of Islam you see.

659
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:34,410
If you look at Christianity, you have Eastern Orthodox Catholicism, the various Protestant ridiculousness, the Quaker ridiculousness.

660
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:35,790
Then you come across the ocean.

661
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:37,270
You've got the Bible Belt.

662
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:41,130
You've got the buckle of the Bible Belt, biggest pork eaters in the world.

663
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:43,550
You've got the Utah version.

664
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:44,810
You've got the Texas version.

665
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:47,050
You've got the Jews for Jesus version.

666
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:50,750
You've got the Mexican version, the South American version of Christianity.

667
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:53,870
It's all the same geographical entity.

668
00:52:53,870 --> 00:53:04,930
What I mean by that is we've always discussed how there is a hierarchy of rank and power, all right, in the spiritual realm.

669
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:06,230
Just like you have on Earth.

670
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:22,590
You have the homeless crazy guy that walks down the street yelling at himself to the street sweeper, to the storekeeper, to the mechanic, to the cop, to the lawyer, attorney, let's say, or doctor, entitled people, to the mayor,

671
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:26,590
to the governor, to the president, to the emperor, right?

672
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:33,950
And then different classes within that group are exempt from certain things, just like you see in society, but different.

673
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:41,490
And we'll get into that a little bit more, just like this is the end of the first hour, and we will see you folks on the other side of the break.

674
00:53:41,970 --> 00:53:45,510
Greetings and welcome back to Uncommon Sense.

675
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:54,830
This is the credits episode or credits episodic sonic part of the presentation we're trying to bring here on American Freedom Radio.

676
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:59,590
And by the way, you folks, you're listening to American Freedom Radio, so do the right thing.

677
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:01,890
Go to the homepage and do the right thing.

678
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:02,770
You know what that is.

679
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:06,050
And Seth, are you with us?

680
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:06,910
You might be muted.

681
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:08,530
If not, we will continue.

682
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:10,150
Yes, I'm here.

683
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:11,290
Yes, good.

684
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:19,510
Before the break, we were discussing, as we brought up, you know, maybe discussing a little bit about Christianity or religion in general.

685
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:27,530
And the reason why we're not harping on Christianity, it's just from a secular point of view, a nonreligious, meaning academics,

686
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:32,690
who are self-professed atheists, by the way, consider this to be the Christian era.

687
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:41,910
And we had gone over more detail about what the Roman Catholic is and versus how it's perceived.

688
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:49,550
And a little more detail may not be against how it's perceived, but a little more detail, I'm not that anyone can discover about it.

689
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:56,090
And especially the high-ups in that particular religion will tell you this, but they don't speak it to their congregation.

690
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:05,530
And the various geographic aspects and the ranking system in the spiritual realm, does that sound about right to you, Seth?

691
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:06,270
Yes.

692
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:14,430
And it seems important to also discuss the geographical aspect of it, to rationalize what is going on,

693
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:20,870
because you still have, again, your typical surface-dwelling earth inhabitant.

694
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:28,150
Once the word belief comes in and you question about, ask them what they believe in, and you find out that it's totally erroneous,

695
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:33,770
which is typical, they tell you, well, leave me alone. I want to believe in what I believe in.

696
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:39,290
I'm happy what I believe in, even though I know nothing about it. I don't need to know anything about it.

697
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:43,250
I just believe in it. Right? That's kind of like idiocracy, right?

698
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:48,730
So you are in an idiocracy, by the way, folks, this entire society, high to low.

699
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:55,310
And by the way, just to throw in, as we were giving the description of the spiritual realm having hierarchy,

700
00:55:56,550 --> 00:56:04,670
what's different about that, which is difficult to comprehend for most, is that man's system is a vertical system,

701
00:56:05,650 --> 00:56:08,610
meaning the street sweeper at the bottom, the king is at the top.

702
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:15,230
In the divine, it's a lateral system. It's your inside or outside, and there's various levels.

703
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:22,610
If you've heard the term like inner circle and outer circle, and then there's all these concentric circles or rings that go out, right?

704
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:29,950
And it's a lateral system. And you'll find that's just a secret on how to comprehend when you're reading older texts regarding,

705
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:33,610
let's say, what we might call the holy writs of the world, which no one reads.

706
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:41,350
And by the way, folks, don't be impressed by folks that say they have a degree or academic.

707
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:47,470
Now, they speak very well because they're trained and polished to perform, just like circus animals are.

708
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:54,550
But if you listen to what they're actually saying, it has to conform to what the audience has previously been told,

709
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:58,570
which is probably some form of, anyway, inaccuracy.

710
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:05,550
So there's a level of discussion, and then there's a discussion.

711
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:10,930
And the level of discussion is when the audience is accommodated,

712
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:16,150
and then there's a discussion where you just spill the beans and say, this is what can be discovered.

713
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:21,190
This is how it appears to be. Any questions? You see.

714
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:27,450
So at this point, maybe we'll jump back to the geographic aspects of the spiritual realm.

715
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:32,290
So we kind of discussed these religions, how they vary from geographic parts of the world.

716
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:37,970
We went all the way from Roman Catholicism to the shores of America to the Bible Belt,

717
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:43,430
the buckle of the Bible Belt, Mormonism in Utah and South America, and how it all changes.

718
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:46,870
You know, the northern Europeans have Protestant, Quaker, all this other stuff.

719
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:57,530
None of it, absolutely none of it is based on anything at all that's in the text that they allegedly say they subscribe to, at all.

720
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:59,650
Not even a smidgen, folks.

721
00:58:00,970 --> 00:58:02,310
Think about that.

722
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:10,970
It's difficult to talk about those texts that they claim to be basing their things upon,

723
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:24,810
because when they're brought up, what immediately comes to mind in 99.9 percent of anyone listening is completely and totally false.

724
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,310
Right. And here's the interesting part.

725
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:31,250
How long of a discussion do you have to have with a quote unquote believer of any faith

726
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:36,550
when you point out that what they're doing is either contrary to the text, forbidden by the text, or not in the text?

727
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:43,090
It usually takes about, I found, 30 seconds to a minute for them to resolve the whole thing and walk away.

728
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:49,310
They don't really defend it, I found out. Have you found that?

729
00:58:50,210 --> 00:59:01,410
I would say that I've been met with a number of interesting conversations, actually.

730
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:04,670
But, then again,

731
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:07,730
That means, hold on, it means you're showing up to a knife fight with a knife.

732
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:12,950
You need to be a peacemaker, you need to show up with overwhelming force, and that brings peace.

733
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:14,270
Anyway, I'm just joking. Go ahead.

734
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:19,050
What ends up, it ends up, I end up answering a lot of questions.

735
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:27,630
I'll make a statement, and it happens, it hasn't happened all that much recently, I guess,

736
00:59:27,990 --> 00:59:36,250
but just in conversations with random people at a coffee shop or something like that,

737
00:59:36,350 --> 00:59:41,550
all over the conversation and offer a piece of information and then get invited into a conversation

738
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:47,250
where I'm essentially just asking questions, or, I'm sorry, answering questions.

739
00:59:49,290 --> 01:00:03,930
I haven't been met with a lot of people trying to defend their points once they realize that I'm talking about what's just written.

740
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:09,510
Then they want to, like I said, I've been met with just a lot of questions.

741
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:15,590
Well, okay, where it says this, I'm like, well, I mean, does it, is that what it says, is a lot of it.

742
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:18,230
But, I don't know.

743
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:25,170
I haven't met with too many people just getting angry.

744
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:29,130
I suppose one of the conversations, the gentleman was being defensive,

745
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:33,110
and then when the defense didn't hold up, he was dismissive.

746
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,890
Yeah, armoring, he armored himself.

747
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:46,870
Yeah, what happens is that they have human society or human nature

748
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:50,850
or what's acceptable by surface-dwelling earth inhabitants to fall back on.

749
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:55,470
In other words, whether they're gaining or losing an argument, I don't believe in arguing,

750
01:00:55,590 --> 01:01:00,970
I think just being slightly confrontational to offer a contrast, perhaps.

751
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:05,070
And by the way, asking questions, what about asking the answer?

752
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:06,610
Think about that, folks.

753
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:07,890
Everyone says ask questions.

754
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:09,230
How about asking the answer?

755
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:11,450
But think about that.

756
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:12,530
It's not a play on words.

757
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:14,550
That's going to require a little bit of chewing the cud.

758
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:22,730
But I found that when you confront these folks, what they want to do in their minds

759
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:27,990
and actually physically do is go to the people next to them and say, look, I've been challenged regarding this.

760
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:28,510
What do you think?

761
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:29,270
Oh, it doesn't matter.

762
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:30,510
Oh, see, I feel better now.

763
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:35,650
So what they're doing is relying on the crowd that we brought up, Gustave Le Bon,

764
01:01:35,770 --> 01:01:40,350
the crowd mentality where one gives up all rationale to join a group.

765
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:41,770
Look at the activists, right?

766
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:46,950
Look at the people that say we have to make the world a better place.

767
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:52,710
If you look at the topic and the subject matter that they're discussing in any depth at all, any depth,

768
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:57,330
beyond skin deep, you will find that they have no clue of what they're talking about.

769
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:03,410
But it doesn't matter because they have the plausibility that everyone, all the boys and girls,

770
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:06,290
are interested in this, and this is what they believe.

771
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:12,330
But essentially, folks, what you will find, going back to the geographical aspect of it,

772
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:17,670
that the earth is quite an interesting place, even more on the unseen than it is on the seen.

773
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:26,950
To find interest on what can be seen, one must comprehend the scale of things and how humanity fits in it.

774
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:30,930
There's a reason why we are the size we are, and there's a reason why things are the way they are,

775
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:37,690
when it comes to what things look like, you know, trees, mountains, oceans, how high, how tall we are,

776
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:42,030
and other things smaller and larger than us, greater and less great.

777
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:44,270
There's a scale there, and there's a proportion.

778
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:45,810
We've discussed this in the past.

779
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:50,290
Now, to go to the unseen, that seems to be unlimited to our little pea brain,

780
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:57,990
but we've been memorialized, or in the past there's enough memorialization that if we look at it,

781
01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:05,110
whoever we is, objectively, and don't read into it, you will find there's a lot of specificity and detail.

782
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:10,730
Now, it's not necessarily based on what you're going to do with it.

783
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:13,170
Is it, are you even familiar with the information?

784
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:14,490
And the answer there is no.

785
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:16,910
Most people are not even vaguely familiar.

786
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:24,370
Now, there are groups of people throughout history who have been and have made it, let's say,

787
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:29,710
public works projects to put out propaganda to keep people from comprehending it

788
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:35,570
and giving them enough rope to, right, what do you do with rope, right,

789
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:39,810
giving them enough leeway that they're comfortable and proud of being ignorant.

790
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:42,110
And this is the society that you live in.

791
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:44,190
This is at large on the entire surface.

792
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:47,530
This is across the planet, folks.

793
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:48,730
It's celebrated.

794
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:50,950
And ignorance is celebrated.

795
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:55,610
They don't quite say we're celebrating ignorance, but in essence you could wrap it all up as that, yeah,

796
01:03:55,690 --> 01:03:59,390
and they love it because they have each other, right?

797
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:01,750
They just look at the person next to them.

798
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:02,650
I don't know. I just believe.

799
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:03,310
That's great, man.

800
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:03,910
Pat you on the back.

801
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:04,610
I'm glad you do.

802
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:07,370
And then you throw in the pranking and all this other stuff.

803
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:13,930
But from a cosmic point of view, there are various aspects of the geographical layout of the planet

804
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:19,090
that have been established as dominions of certain spiritual entities.

805
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:22,770
Well, you know, whether you believe in what I'm talking about, whether you believe it or not,

806
01:04:22,810 --> 01:04:25,690
that we're communicating something that you might want to listen to.

807
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:30,850
And when you travel a certain part of the world and set up a community or a society,

808
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:37,230
if you don't, let's say, how would you say, pay homage to, acknowledge that entity,

809
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:40,910
or do what that entity wants, in short, let's just keep it simple,

810
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:43,170
you're not going to be able to live there.

811
01:04:44,530 --> 01:04:48,790
So henceforth, the various forms of Christianity that you see all over the world,

812
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:51,750
which are none of it is biblically based, right?

813
01:04:51,810 --> 01:04:59,850
It's all based, by the way, all of the religions at this point are based on some form of talismanic rabbit's foot

814
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:04,050
kind of like, you touch this thing, you're going to get power kind of thing, you know.

815
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:11,630
And even those that have supposedly, you know, the pranksters, the priests, the pastors, all this,

816
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:15,730
even they, I've spoken to some of them and they say, oh, I read the Bible every morning.

817
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:19,250
I get up and I open it to some page and I read a verse and it's pertinent.

818
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:20,990
That's like that.

819
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:24,430
Wasn't there a game like that?

820
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:27,630
It was like an eight ball or something that you touched and it gave a message.

821
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:28,530
What's that?

822
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:28,850
I don't know.

823
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:30,190
You guys know what I'm talking about.

824
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:31,290
I think someone does.

825
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:35,390
Was it one of these things at the toy store they sell?

826
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:36,490
Magic eight ball.

827
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:37,010
Yeah, absolutely.

828
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:37,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

829
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:40,050
My sources say no.

830
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:41,570
Right, right.

831
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:42,450
Yeah, exactly.

832
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:43,490
Yeah, that's what they're doing.

833
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:49,270
This is the people that you guys are looking to for answers.

834
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:50,570
Just stick with the questions.

835
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:53,450
It's ridiculous, absurd.

836
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:59,630
But this is, does it mean that it's not, this is not unobtainium we're talking about.

837
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:01,670
It's not a material that's hard to find.

838
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:08,350
You can actually just start learning how to read out of things instead of reading into it.

839
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:12,270
I brought up how there's groups of people that have spent,

840
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:16,270
made public works projects to make sure that you don't find out what's going on,

841
01:06:16,310 --> 01:06:18,490
not only with the religions of the world, by the way.

842
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:23,570
All of your biblically based movies that you see are false.

843
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:26,790
And how do I say that with great veracity and authority?

844
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:28,930
You've just got to go read the text.

845
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:29,890
Don't read into it.

846
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:34,090
When you read the text, even the crappy King James version, yes, I said the word,

847
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:42,570
even there you could piece it enough together that it will give some accuracy regarding any story that you find.

848
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:47,750
And you'll see that nothing is being portrayed on film as such at all, not even close.

849
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:53,090
Other than the time period and people maybe wore sandals and there were no airplanes in the sky.

850
01:06:53,590 --> 01:07:03,130
Or anything that you read about Noah's flood or the flood during the time of Noah is not accurate other than it was really wet.

851
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,770
Outside of that, forget it.

852
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:10,390
And any kind of these Christ movies that you see are absolutely false, every single one.

853
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:10,950
Very simple.

854
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:16,970
You can be an authority on what I just said by just simply reading the text.

855
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:18,430
Very simple.

856
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:25,150
I'll give another example on the talismanic, the paganistic aspect of it.

857
01:07:25,530 --> 01:07:31,710
I was at a lady's house one day and she had this big crucifix with the guy with long hair to a cross wearing a diaper, all that.

858
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:35,290
And I'm looking at it and I'm like, I thought you read the Bible.

859
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:35,850
What's that?

860
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:39,050
She goes, oh, he's helped me a lot in the past.

861
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:39,790
I'm like, who's he?

862
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:40,750
I don't know.

863
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:41,850
I just believe in it.

864
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:44,250
I'm like, well, I thought you said you were reading the Bible.

865
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:47,470
Don't you see that this is completely contrary?

866
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:49,630
Well, I don't really care, you see.

867
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:50,750
He's helped me a lot.

868
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:56,730
Now, what's interesting about that, this woman was definitely under the influence of that local entity.

869
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:00,090
So think about it, folks.

870
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:07,530
And by the way, when you see that iconography that they're being shown in Christianity, that's Serapis, right?

871
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:09,050
And Mithra.

872
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:20,250
And then there's an agglomerate, the one that you see with the Roman crucifix that was created around 400 or so A.D., 360 or 400.

873
01:08:20,689 --> 01:08:24,890
It was a council to kind of like put together what are we going to show the people?

874
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:26,149
Right.

875
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:27,510
It's not in the text.

876
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:28,330
It's very clear.

877
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:36,370
The text is quite clear that when the Christ figure was taken finally to Pontius Pilate for the final say,

878
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:40,870
he said that this man needs to be released or use your law.

879
01:08:41,029 --> 01:08:44,130
The Judean authorities should use their law.

880
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:48,890
There's no Roman crucifix at all, not even in the location, not even close.

881
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:54,210
They could use the word crucifix all they want, but if you look up the word crucifix, it is a botanical term.

882
01:08:54,510 --> 01:08:55,670
It has to do with flowers.

883
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:59,330
And there was a particular tree that was flowering at the time.

884
01:09:00,149 --> 01:09:04,930
But just to go back, we've mentioned this many times, what happened there.

885
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:11,410
The entire identity of anyone in the biblical text is secret, just like in the Koran and other writings,

886
01:09:12,029 --> 01:09:13,250
Book of the Dead and all these things.

887
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:17,870
Anything that you're reading out of that is a secret, hidden in plain sight.

888
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:23,990
There's no such thing as the rituals that people are partaking in.

889
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:31,729
But just to go back, there's been groups of people, they even made public works projects to hide

890
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:36,330
and put in front of you and distract you, like the films.

891
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:39,890
All of the biblical films are false, all of them.

892
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:45,870
Even without mentioning his name, there's someone who recently did one regarding something,

893
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:48,870
passion of something that everyone thought it was great.

894
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:50,490
And I'm like, it's a great piece of fiction.

895
01:09:54,530 --> 01:10:00,830
But the reference materials that you have access to, you don't have any translations, by the way.

896
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:02,850
None, zero, even to this date.

897
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:09,030
You're so advanced and so modern and you don't have anything translated, not even the Greek philosophers.

898
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:10,770
Sorry, folks.

899
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:15,990
And if you learn how to read a little bit of Greek, you could go back and read some of the surviving works

900
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:22,210
of Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates, and then go look at the corresponding English text, and you will say it is not so.

901
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:25,870
But you're quite happy with artificial sweeteners, I think.

902
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:35,990
So, even to this day, there's a tremendous amount of public works projects, private and public, funded, to distract you.

903
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:38,150
Like, for example, the economic system.

904
01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:40,370
You're being heavily distracted.

905
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:42,730
There is not one commentator, period.

906
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:44,030
Say it again.

907
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:54,910
There's not one commentator, period, on the Internet or anywhere that is even slightly accurate about the economy or the financial system or the credit system.

908
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:55,730
Not a one.

909
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:59,050
That's very easy to defend that comment.

910
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:01,660
Right.

911
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:06,600
You're being shown television shows regarding what goes on in court.

912
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:09,680
Not a one is even close to being accurate.

913
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:10,900
Nothing.

914
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,760
You're shown medical shows of what it's like to be a doctor.

915
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,720
Not a one is even close to being accurate.

916
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,140
Why are you being so distracted?

917
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:25,400
Because you all have the ability and the capability and capacity to comprehend these things.

918
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:32,440
Because all these entitled classes, whether they're priests, pastors, rabbis, attorneys, doctors, mechanics, engineers,

919
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:38,600
do you think they come through a wormhole from another dimension every day, serve their function, and then go back home to another universe?

920
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,520
Or are they people just like you?

921
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,160
And you all have the same capacity.

922
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:47,680
But it's important for the pranking to go on.

923
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:53,420
See, if a prankster wants you to sit on a thumbtack and get off on you being in pain,

924
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:59,260
they usually don't tell you they're placing a thumbtack on the chair before they offer it to you, do they?

925
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:06,720
And then after you sit on it and exclaim how painful it was, they laugh and say,

926
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,400
well, I didn't tell you to sit on it.

927
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:09,900
You did it all on your own.

928
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,100
It's exactly how the legal system works.

929
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,580
I'm going to offer you a chair.

930
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,400
I know why, that I didn't know it was there.

931
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:18,680
It's exactly how all the attorneys are working.

932
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:19,940
Not some of them, all of them.

933
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:20,320
Why?

934
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:24,720
There might be some attorneys that found out that they got pranked into that field,

935
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:26,540
and they're like, holy crap, I've got to get away.

936
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:29,400
And they're looking for an exit strategy currently.

937
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:33,020
But all the ones that stay in there are pranksters.

938
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:34,240
Sorry, guys.

939
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:35,140
Same with your doctors.

940
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,580
The best a doctor can do is give you a description.

941
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,140
Can't explain anything.

942
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:45,280
Call up a doctor and say, I'm going over there because my ankle is sprained, let's say.

943
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,460
You show up to the office, he's like, oh, your ankle is sprained.

944
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:49,260
$150.

945
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:50,560
Well, I knew that.

946
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,940
Can you explain why it's swollen?

947
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:54,300
Why?

948
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:55,920
No, no, it's just sprained.

949
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:58,860
And they act all surprised, like you didn't tell them anything,

950
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:00,440
because they don't know.

951
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:01,260
They don't want to know.

952
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,180
They might act like they want to know.

953
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:06,300
Sorry, folks.

954
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:09,620
So you want to change this to what?

955
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:12,100
You're going to make the world a better place to what?

956
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:17,980
You've got one-third of the planet right now engaged in heavy pranking.

957
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:22,360
You've got the other third emphatically supporting them.

958
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,860
Then the other third, you do whatever.

959
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,500
So in order to make the world a better place,

960
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,640
what are you going to do with two-thirds of the people on the planet?

961
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:32,440
You think these pranksters are rehabilitatable?

962
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:38,740
And you've all been distracted by this new world order of bullshit, that's what it is,

963
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:43,680
that they want to get rid of all the world's population down to 500 million.

964
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:44,460
Yeah, right.

965
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,080
Uh-huh.

966
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:46,780
Sure.

967
01:13:47,700 --> 01:13:48,520
Who are they going to prank?

968
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:50,500
It's not about pranking.

969
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,740
You hear about these morons talking about, oh, yeah,

970
01:13:52,780 --> 01:13:54,780
that's just enough slaves to do their bidding or whatever.

971
01:13:54,860 --> 01:13:55,340
No, it's not.

972
01:13:56,220 --> 01:13:57,440
Don't be fooled by that.

973
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,860
But here's the interesting part.

974
01:13:58,920 --> 01:13:59,580
You ready for this?

975
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:03,980
The Earth's population will be reduced to that, a little bit lower, actually,

976
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,840
in the next decade and a half.

977
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,600
And even when it's happening, you're all going to be saying,

978
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,040
what a wonderful world it is.

979
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:13,340
Well, don't worry.

980
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:15,240
We'll get back on track.

981
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:17,920
That's part of the great deception, folks.

982
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:19,520
Oh, what did he just say?

983
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,560
It doesn't make any sense.

984
01:14:20,620 --> 01:14:21,200
Yeah, it shouldn't.

985
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:26,680
But starting in the middle of the next century, oh, not century, next decade,

986
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,720
you're going to have major changes.

987
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:33,140
When all these fires that are in the Middle East right now are put out,

988
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,640
you're going to see some big changes.

989
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:43,140
So I hope that kind of went around the block with the geographic aspect of the

990
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:43,580
religion.

991
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:46,260
But next time you hear about someone's belief,

992
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:52,100
you'll find out if you look a little closer that they're discussing something

993
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:57,020
that's geographically pinned or sourced and a variance of something else.

994
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:02,240
So, meaning, what kind of a Christian are you?

995
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,000
What kind of a Jew are you?

996
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:06,460
What kind of Buddhism are you?

997
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,880
All this stuff, man.

998
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:11,920
Here's the final analysis of the matter.

999
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,040
Get up on your hind legs, people.

1000
01:15:14,780 --> 01:15:16,240
You deserve a lot better than that.

1001
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:19,760
And sometimes it's better not to speak than to speak.

1002
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:25,080
Someone asks you what you believe in, and if you don't know anything about it,

1003
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:27,620
it's best to say, I'm ignorant of the fact.

1004
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,420
Because this thing about opinions that is going around,

1005
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:36,480
especially to discount anything that could be brought forward as being true,

1006
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:38,520
is just insidious.

1007
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:39,940
And typical human nature.

1008
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:47,360
But then again, let's throw in what Gustave Le Bon said, L-E-B-O-N, the crowd.

1009
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:52,120
He was not there to explain the psychology of it necessarily on why people do it.

1010
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:53,100
It's how they do it.

1011
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:56,760
And some of the why was sort of an analysis.

1012
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:00,420
But what I do like about bringing him up, other than others,

1013
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:07,240
is that he was the most objective, objectified about how these groups form.

1014
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:13,960
There's not much comfort when you start discovering and objectifying what's going on in this reality.

1015
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:17,500
But once you learn to separate yourself.

1016
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:18,480
Insulation.

1017
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:22,060
Yes, you will be more comfortable when you're insulated, yes.

1018
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:25,340
See, if you don't know that you need to be insulated

1019
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:28,620
and you believe all the crap that we can make things better and all this,

1020
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:33,740
you're being tossed about and you've got some stinky stuff on you

1021
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:36,820
and you get shocked every once in a while and you're resilient enough to take it.

1022
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:40,500
But once you realize you should set yourself apart and insulate yourself from it,

1023
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:42,680
you start figuring out how to do that.

1024
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:45,440
And once you achieve a level of insulation and separation,

1025
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:50,880
you will find that then you might be able to relax a little bit.

1026
01:16:51,860 --> 01:16:56,300
Yeah, it's not that it's all misery and it's all strife.

1027
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:57,080
I know.

1028
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,060
Actually.

1029
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:01,140
Initially it is.

1030
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,060
Might not make you.

1031
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:05,140
Yeah, yes, certainly it can be.

1032
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:10,220
And it might not make you too many friends.

1033
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:12,520
No, no, you won't.

1034
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:17,320
Yeah, have a spouse and a dog if you need company.

1035
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:22,520
Yeah, find a spouse, make a spouse and learn to love each other.

1036
01:17:22,620 --> 01:17:25,540
This stuff about love and peace and all that, no one knows what that means

1037
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:26,800
and they still use those words.

1038
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:32,040
So very nice people tend to think that love is the answer.

1039
01:17:32,540 --> 01:17:36,580
And if you ask them to define it, they can't and that's why they're very nice.

1040
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:46,720
But, yeah, a spouse and a pet you'll find comfort in if you know how to love

1041
01:17:46,720 --> 01:17:51,320
or want to learn how to love, which is very different than just love,

1042
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:56,220
which is another thing to discuss, which we have, I think.

1043
01:17:56,380 --> 01:18:00,720
I think the most that we've ever gone into any detail on anything regarding

1044
01:18:00,720 --> 01:18:04,400
other than some ancient texts and the biblical stuff is dreams, Seth.

1045
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:07,900
We've pretty much gotten into that in some depth.

1046
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:12,160
We've gotten into love to a certain degree in comparison with fear

1047
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:16,300
and other things like that that are being tossed about on the world wide web,

1048
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:20,640
which I wonder which spider, is it a poisonous spider that's weaving this web?

1049
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:21,440
I wonder.

1050
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,660
Carnivorous, I imagine.

1051
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,660
Yes, yes, I think it's a really ignorant spider, but nonetheless.

1052
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:35,660
Yeah, the main point here, guys and gals and little ones, is avoid being pranked.

1053
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,900
There's a right time to call out a prankster.

1054
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:40,860
By the way, if you go to a court scene,

1055
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:44,020
don't call the judge a prankster or anybody else right there,

1056
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:47,580
but there are ways to say it because that's what they are, all of them.

1057
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:48,260
That's some of them.

1058
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:52,460
Now there might be some of them in those positions now that realize what they're

1059
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:54,800
doing is wrong and they're looking for an exit strategy,

1060
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:59,740
which from firsthand experience I've met a few, I should say a couple,

1061
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:05,380
three or four that were in the legal profession and they're like,

1062
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:07,180
I've got to get out.

1063
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,060
I found out what this is about.

1064
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:12,340
And it took them six months to a year,

1065
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:18,460
typically to get all their things kind of organized so they can sort of live

1066
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:23,700
the level of luxury or comfort that they had without sacrificing too much of

1067
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:26,320
their position economically, let's say.

1068
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,460
And the same with the doctors.

1069
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,000
But there are some people and they're looking for an exit strategy.

1070
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:34,740
And when I say all of them, I'm not including those,

1071
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:37,160
but those that remain for sure, yeah.

1072
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:44,800
So just like you have, there's something that goes on in society,

1073
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:48,800
it's been going on repeatedly, is when you have malevolent organizations,

1074
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,480
no matter how big or how small,

1075
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:56,580
they feel compelled to do some form of benevolent action or act, right?

1076
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:59,800
You've heard of certain societies,

1077
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:05,020
they build a hospital or certain religions are into charity,

1078
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,580
feeding the poor and the homeless, right?

1079
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:13,180
I mean, so when you examine the religions of the world as being just downright

1080
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:17,780
demonic, I mean malevolent to the core, I mean,

1081
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:21,360
which doesn't take much than a little bit of research to find out.

1082
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:24,340
And then you, on the surface,

1083
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:28,640
are always told how wonderful they are because they're doing charitable work.

1084
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,100
You need to put those two things together.

1085
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:35,660
And the third thing being that typically these very malevolent organizations,

1086
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:40,900
regardless of whether they're economic, judicial, religious, political,

1087
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:47,000
scientific, tend to engage in some form of charity or benevolence.

1088
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:53,020
An interesting thing is there's a level of,

1089
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:57,840
because this is a pagan society basically at large,

1090
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,500
they're into iconography and talismans.

1091
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:05,200
I'll throw this in there, maybe it'll make the 9-11 conspiracy theorists happy.

1092
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:08,920
You notice that after September 11th,

1093
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:12,700
X was in a conversation one day with someone who I had first met,

1094
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:15,700
and he said it should have been called 7-11 because September was the seventh

1095
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:18,760
month, and I was so happy to hear that from someone else.

1096
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:22,440
It was the first time in 10 years someone actually paid a little bit of

1097
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:23,980
attention and realized September means seven.

1098
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,400
But anyway, going back to that event,

1099
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:34,380
shortly after, do you notice how people started putting on American flag

1100
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:37,680
lapels, especially the politicians, you know,

1101
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:42,060
to show that they're patriotic or whatever, you know?

1102
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:42,420
Oh, yeah.

1103
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,140
To hide their guilt, yeah.

1104
01:21:44,820 --> 01:21:49,560
And also to distract, they don't know what to say because they can't say what,

1105
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:50,480
you know.

1106
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:51,040
Actually,

1107
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,840
they do know what to say because they look at the audience and they see what

1108
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:54,820
will accommodate them.

1109
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:59,820
So it's the same thing that's going on.

1110
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:00,520
So typically,

1111
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:09,300
if you do a quick assessment of who is living on this planet and what they

1112
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:13,340
subscribe to or are alleged to subscribe to and have their allegiances to as

1113
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:15,700
being downright malevolent across the board,

1114
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,300
when you do see this charity and benevolence being done,

1115
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,220
it's part of the things that are instigated to give the plausibility,

1116
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,420
because you'll hear that.

1117
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,220
What are you talking about?

1118
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,180
This religion is bad.

1119
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,800
Look at all the charity they're giving.

1120
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:32,080
Like, oh, boy, you can't pull that here, mister.

1121
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:34,140
Sorry, doesn't work.

1122
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:43,880
I'd also say don't let that stand in the way of being charitable.

1123
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:49,100
Don't let these horrible organizations preempt that.

1124
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:52,680
I think there are a few things better that one can do.

1125
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:59,500
Speaking, we're kind of hard on those who claim to want to make the world a

1126
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:00,140
better place.

1127
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:05,440
And I'd say that it's those that claim such things,

1128
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:09,220
because you want to make the world a better place,

1129
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:10,820
help someone that needs help.

1130
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:13,580
That's a good thing.

1131
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:15,020
Yeah, help those within reach.

1132
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:18,860
If someone needs shoes, give them shoes, a jacket, food, clothing,

1133
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:19,520
shelter them.

1134
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:21,780
That's good.

1135
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:22,960
That's good.

1136
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:26,980
And there are a few things that you can do that are better than that.

1137
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:31,720
If half the people on the planet helped one person,

1138
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,040
that would just take care of the other half, figuratively.

1139
01:23:34,660 --> 01:23:34,880
Yeah.

1140
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:38,040
And so we miss that.

1141
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:41,080
And that's something that can be, you know, there's no comprehension.

1142
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:47,960
There's no understanding that is deep and requires a whole lot of study to see

1143
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:52,040
that that is accurate and that those things are good to do no matter who you

1144
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:52,300
are.

1145
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:53,740
So, yeah.

1146
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,060
And when we say go deep,

1147
01:23:56,060 --> 01:24:00,620
have you heard of people saying how superficial things are, right?

1148
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:03,700
When we say deep, I mean like just a few millimeters, folks.

1149
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,840
Stop skimming across the surface on thin ice.

1150
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:08,460
You know?

1151
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:08,880
Yeah.

1152
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:12,900
You can acquire a lot of knowledge without much depth,

1153
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:17,960
but wisdom, if it's all a fountain and water, metaphorically,

1154
01:24:18,740 --> 01:24:22,480
wisdom is the realization that it is incredibly deep.

1155
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:24,620
Yes, quickly.

1156
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:31,640
And it's sort of like a counter spatial thing that you might go six feet or

1157
01:24:31,640 --> 01:24:34,420
eight feet or 10 feet into one thing and not find a lot,

1158
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:37,840
or you might just go a quarter of an inch into something else and be more

1159
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:38,680
than you can handle.

1160
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:41,900
Yeah, absolutely.

1161
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:43,180
Yeah.

1162
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:45,680
Yeah.

1163
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:49,880
So, yeah, there's many levels.

1164
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:54,560
Pick one, but it's always safest to be lateral.

1165
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:58,060
So insulate yourself, pull yourself away.

1166
01:24:58,180 --> 01:24:58,600
And by the way,

1167
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,340
you made the comment earlier, Seth,

1168
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,320
about making the world a better place and all that.

1169
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:06,940
If you study about that and objectify it,

1170
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:09,240
and also I've given historical references,

1171
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:13,360
people especially in the 20th century that overtly came up with discovery or

1172
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,080
invented something,

1173
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:16,600
said we have to implement this to make the world better.

1174
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:20,300
And you'll find that all of them, that some of them have been squashed.

1175
01:25:21,020 --> 01:25:21,360
Oh, yeah.

1176
01:25:21,540 --> 01:25:21,700
Yeah.

1177
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:22,860
No, it's dangerous.

1178
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:28,900
It's not good for one's health to loudly proclaim such things.

1179
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:29,800
No, no.

1180
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:32,360
Cosmically and divinely, meaning.

1181
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:33,920
Unless you're not actually doing anything.

1182
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:37,000
If all you're doing is saying something, it's not going to.

1183
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:41,500
They, whoever they are, they, they seem to encourage that quite a bit.

1184
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:42,380
Yes.

1185
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:43,640
They just talk about it.

1186
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:44,080
The fools.

1187
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:44,480
Yeah.

1188
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,720
They got to say something.

1189
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:48,280
Rights, liberty, chemtrails.

1190
01:25:48,700 --> 01:25:49,700
What's the other one?

1191
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:51,640
Vaccines, legalized cannabis.

1192
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:54,560
Try and improve the world.

1193
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:56,900
And by that, you know, society, not, not the earth.

1194
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,240
The earth doesn't need any improvement.

1195
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:58,920
It's pretty good.

1196
01:25:59,460 --> 01:26:02,800
Oh, the earth would be quite happy to go back to a black crystal floating in

1197
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,380
space with no atmosphere, nothing at all on it.

1198
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,560
None of these people will find those creatures crawling around all over.

1199
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:08,860
Right.

1200
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:09,360
Yeah.

1201
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,820
But the earth has been remade.

1202
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:13,660
So everything that you see here will,

1203
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:16,600
you would be able to live on it as you are.

1204
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:20,580
And in the level of ignorance regarding these things is so high that it's not

1205
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:24,340
even worth discussing at this point, but it will be a point in the future.

1206
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:25,980
Yeah.

1207
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:31,760
Discuss it and actually go out into the society and discover something that

1208
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:37,000
will or has the great potential to improve or change the society

1209
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,020
dramatically or drastically.

1210
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,360
Even I tried to smash those words together.

1211
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,060
Dramatically.

1212
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:44,920
Yeah.

1213
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:47,600
But yeah.

1214
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,760
Out of hand there.

1215
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,840
It's not a safe.

1216
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:53,180
Yeah.

1217
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:54,600
And why?

1218
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:58,340
If the spiritual realm controls the physical realm,

1219
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:01,440
the malevolent entities don't want it, obviously,

1220
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:03,900
because they want it to go south or bad.

1221
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:06,140
But now you're at a point.

1222
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:07,700
Let me say that again.

1223
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,820
Now, meaning now, meaning this era,

1224
01:27:11,220 --> 01:27:17,460
you're at a point where the benevolent spiritual side is tired of you also,

1225
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:19,540
and they don't want to see that put in.

1226
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:23,160
So now you've got the good guys, let's say third grade level here.

1227
01:27:23,220 --> 01:27:25,000
Good guys, bad guys against you.

1228
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:26,520
Right?

1229
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:27,420
Right.

1230
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,540
Stop watching the Saturday.

1231
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,780
So imagine like from the Saturday, more what they call Saturday morning cartoons,

1232
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:38,040
the superheroes, you know, you've got the villains and the superheroes, right?

1233
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:40,840
Imagine the villains and the superheroes against you.

1234
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:45,160
That's where you're at right now, folks.

1235
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:47,340
So set yourself apart.

1236
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:51,460
And, yeah, this will be discovered.

1237
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:56,020
We'll be able to go into this in much greater depth in the future if you want

1238
01:27:56,020 --> 01:27:58,380
sightings and references and where to look for it.

1239
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:02,640
But you've got to stop reading into it.

1240
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:08,120
I've gotten a couple of comments, and not many, that, you know,

1241
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:12,140
Greek, you sound like such and such or such, you know, this group.

1242
01:28:12,260 --> 01:28:12,940
Or you sound like it.

1243
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:16,220
And I'm like, okay, let me go assess that.

1244
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:17,280
And I'm like, not at all.

1245
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:19,600
How did this person come up with that?

1246
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:22,700
Well, reading into it.

1247
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:25,900
Again, when people experience something through their senses,

1248
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,600
the mind works so fast, what do you call it, involuntarily,

1249
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:35,720
autonomously, that when you're taking in information or sensory things,

1250
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:40,780
that you are trying to compare them to previous experiences in light speed,

1251
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,380
rapid fashion, beyond light speed, it's instant.

1252
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,280
And right now, I've noticed with most people,

1253
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:52,380
it's gotten to the point where close enough is it, right?

1254
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:55,800
If it sounds close to this, that's what it is.

1255
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:57,940
That's what this guy is saying.

1256
01:28:58,020 --> 01:28:58,880
Just like this guy.

1257
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:01,520
It's not even close in most cases.

1258
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:05,980
So this is one of the pitfalls of reading into it.

1259
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:09,060
Again, when you watch a movie on biblical stuff, you're like, oh, yeah.

1260
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:10,640
Yeah, this I saw.

1261
01:29:10,780 --> 01:29:12,000
Yeah, I've heard about this.

1262
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:12,700
I saw the movie.

1263
01:29:12,780 --> 01:29:14,840
Yeah, they don't say I saw the movie because it sounds ridiculous.

1264
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:17,040
And then when they go and look at the text, they say, oh,

1265
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,620
this is the part that I saw in the movie.

1266
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:20,140
And it's not there.

1267
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:21,560
They think it's there.

1268
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:22,300
They keep reading.

1269
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:26,020
Yeah, and they're not really paying any attention.

1270
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:30,420
Yeah, it's a programming.

1271
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,820
It's processing information through a faulty program.

1272
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:39,840
Yeah, and virtually no operating system.

1273
01:29:41,080 --> 01:29:44,340
Or a virtual operating system that changes.

1274
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:47,520
Imagine going to a computer every day,

1275
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,120
and the operating system is different or no operating system.

1276
01:29:50,240 --> 01:29:52,460
This is how most people at large are operating.

1277
01:29:53,260 --> 01:29:54,380
No pun intended.

1278
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,300
So there's nothing.

1279
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:02,120
By the way, folks, let's just say, let's just be really forthright about this.

1280
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:07,760
When you hear about making the world better, there's nothing to make better, folks.

1281
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:11,100
It's unrehabilitatable at this point.

1282
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:16,700
It has to go through what it has to go through, and then it's going to be redone.

1283
01:30:17,860 --> 01:30:19,780
And in the meantime, you set yourself apart.

1284
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:25,160
I give an example of in firefighting, firemen, sometimes when they go to a structure,

1285
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:31,520
they don't, if it's too far gone, they don't attempt to extinguish the fire.

1286
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:33,020
Have you heard of that?

1287
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:33,340
You know?

1288
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:34,220
Yeah.

1289
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:34,820
Yeah.

1290
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:35,800
Too far gone.

1291
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:36,880
Yeah.

1292
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:38,100
Too far gone.

1293
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:40,140
Prevent the buildings around it from succumbing.

1294
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:40,980
Yep.

1295
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:42,380
Becomes the main concern.

1296
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:43,540
Containment.

1297
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:44,440
Right.

1298
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:49,620
In this case, though, the containment has been put in place, and it's always been in containment.

1299
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:51,640
Yeah.

1300
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:56,900
That's why, for example, one way to rationalize things, not to convince,

1301
01:30:57,020 --> 01:31:00,080
but to rationalize the thought, because this is a big subject,

1302
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:03,360
is if you look at things in the past rationally,

1303
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:09,740
like look at the 20th century quote-unquote world's fairs

1304
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:14,440
and what was even memorialized in film and television.

1305
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:17,920
In the 1920s or even turn of the century up until the 50s,

1306
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:23,360
they were telling you folks you're going to have jet packs and flying cars by the year 2000.

1307
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:25,080
Oh, yeah.

1308
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,120
You're going to have all this stuff.

1309
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:26,380
Yeah.

1310
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:27,040
You have nothing.

1311
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:32,280
Your cars right now are still 25% efficient, the best cars.

1312
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:36,440
That means that 75% of what you spend to put fuel is just wasted.

1313
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:39,320
Yeah.

1314
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:41,100
You're not going to get any of that.

1315
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:42,780
You're not going into outer space.

1316
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:44,320
None of you are.

1317
01:31:44,420 --> 01:31:47,080
Very few of you are, if that at all,

1318
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:51,540
because no one that goes into outer space comes back and reports anything.

1319
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:55,340
They'll just tell you what you've been told in Walt Disney fashion.

1320
01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:57,600
You're not.

1321
01:31:57,700 --> 01:31:58,200
Forget it.

1322
01:31:58,360 --> 01:31:59,740
Just get that out of your mind.

1323
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:07,500
Your medical system is going to be exceedingly toxic because there is no medical system.

1324
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:08,640
It's part of the legal system.

1325
01:32:11,020 --> 01:32:12,780
And it's going to go on and on.

1326
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:14,860
Now, you want to make things better?

1327
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,760
I'll tell you how there's nothing left to make better.

1328
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:24,840
Children, little babies are pranked by their own parents at large and at wholesale throughout the planet.

1329
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,520
Across the board, pretty much.

1330
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:29,580
I'd say all of them.

1331
01:32:30,180 --> 01:32:31,260
Very few are not.

1332
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:35,780
And you wonder why you're having problems.

1333
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:38,280
When I mean pranking, look up what that word means.

1334
01:32:39,360 --> 01:32:43,820
It's a ludicrous trick done to their own children.

1335
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:47,160
On the other hand, let's look at this.

1336
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:53,840
If the future of mankind is reliant on the children,

1337
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:59,500
there is no future because seemingly, especially in English-speaking countries,

1338
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:02,740
all the children have been turned into goats.

1339
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:04,860
Think about that.

1340
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:08,140
What is a young goat called?

1341
01:33:09,820 --> 01:33:10,680
That would be a kid.

1342
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:11,800
Yeah.

1343
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:14,340
Oh, Greek, that doesn't matter.

1344
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:15,160
That's just what we say.

1345
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:18,160
Well, yeah, I know, because you don't say what you mean and mean what you say.

1346
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:21,960
So look at these things, folks, objectively.

1347
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:28,060
Look at, you know, a thousand years ago, public structures were built to last a thousand years,

1348
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:31,560
and many are still here, that were not deliberately destroyed.

1349
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:36,040
A hundred years ago, if you look at some of the skyscrapers that were built at the turn of the 20th century,

1350
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:36,720
are still around.

1351
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:41,420
Well, right now, when they're building these massive structures,

1352
01:33:41,900 --> 01:33:44,020
guess what their life expectancy is, folks?

1353
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:45,840
Want to say 20 years?

1354
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:46,600
It's pretty accurate.

1355
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:47,420
Go look it up.

1356
01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:48,480
Go look it up.

1357
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:53,420
Go look up all these large towers that are being put up now, or have been put up in the past decade or so.

1358
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:55,720
25-year life expectancy.

1359
01:33:55,900 --> 01:33:57,220
Is there something going on here?

1360
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:00,660
I mean, this is obvious stuff, folks.

1361
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:05,640
And one of the obvious things that I like to poke fun at this society for

1362
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:10,560
is, what do cannibals, birthdays, and dolls have in common?

1363
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:13,360
You want to make the world a better place, huh?

1364
01:34:14,700 --> 01:34:16,480
What do cannibals, birthdays, and dolls?

1365
01:34:16,480 --> 01:34:18,020
That sounds kind of crazy, man.

1366
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:22,560
Well, let's just put that together, or let's take it apart.

1367
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:24,500
What is the word cannibal?

1368
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:25,400
Yeah.

1369
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:26,800
So that's a good place to start.

1370
01:34:27,060 --> 01:34:28,280
What is the word cannibal?

1371
01:34:28,660 --> 01:34:33,260
It's an old Chaldean Hebrew term, meaning, like Latin encompasses various languages,

1372
01:34:33,380 --> 01:34:36,620
Chaldean Hebrew encompasses languages of the Mesopotamic region.

1373
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:42,680
The priests' religious order were called the Qahans.

1374
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:46,960
And they had told the people to worship the balls, which are the lords.

1375
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,800
Even today, how many times have you heard people say,

1376
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:52,480
I was brought to the Lord, I love the Lord, I worship the Lord.

1377
01:34:53,240 --> 01:34:55,740
I don't know what they're talking about, and neither do they.

1378
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:58,040
Actually, I do know what they're talking about, but they don't.

1379
01:34:59,020 --> 01:35:04,160
Now, the Lord is the ball, let's say, and the priest is the Qahan.

1380
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:08,220
The Qahan would say the way you worship the ball is by bringing a child

1381
01:35:08,220 --> 01:35:11,700
and sacrificing him and eating a small portion of the child.

1382
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:17,460
That's why eating human flesh is called Qahan ballism or cannibalism.

1383
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:20,600
Still today, this word is being used.

1384
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:26,080
That's why when you go somewhere and they are the priest or minister of the Lord,

1385
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:29,360
that is nicknamed cannibal.

1386
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:34,380
You guys still flock to him, millions and billions of people adhere to this.

1387
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:35,660
That's undeniable.

1388
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:39,860
Whether they say what they mean or know about it or whatever is irrelevant,

1389
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:42,740
we're not here to defend them or poke fun at them or make excuses.

1390
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:43,780
That's just a fact.

1391
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:49,780
Now, that's why the eating of human flesh is called cannibalism.

1392
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:50,920
It's the priest of the Lord.

1393
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:52,140
It's literally what it means.

1394
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:57,680
They had a proclivity towards conical hats as well.

1395
01:35:58,220 --> 01:35:58,580
Yes.

1396
01:36:00,820 --> 01:36:04,080
Now, when the parents went home and the child was missing,

1397
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,860
the other children would say, where's our brother?

1398
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:07,600
Where's our sister?

1399
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:13,480
So the altar that was administered where this was done,

1400
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:15,180
let's call them altar boys or girls,

1401
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:20,220
they would assemble an effigy or something of a child known as a doll.

1402
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:24,100
They tell the parents when you return home to the rest of the family,

1403
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:27,740
you give them this doll to take the place of the child.

1404
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:31,560
So now you know where dolls come from, folks, being given to children.

1405
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:36,540
It doesn't matter whether you grew up playing with dolls or you like playing

1406
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:40,540
with dolls or grandma played with dolls, or it's always been that way.

1407
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:41,340
It doesn't matter.

1408
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:43,400
We're just giving you the facts, folks.

1409
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:47,100
So I don't know about making it better so far.

1410
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:48,620
Does it sound like things are going to get better?

1411
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:49,800
I don't think so.

1412
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:56,600
Now, obviously, such a horrendous act didn't go over very well,

1413
01:36:56,620 --> 01:36:59,800
especially when the people were promised prosperity and they didn't get it

1414
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:00,920
for doing these things.

1415
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:03,640
So they said, let's do a parody of this event.

1416
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:07,420
And the next child in line, we'll put him in a high chair,

1417
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:10,160
give him a pointy hat like we wear, and we'll bake a loaf of sweet bread

1418
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:12,500
and put lights in it and tell the child to make a wish of prosperity,

1419
01:37:12,640 --> 01:37:15,300
blow the lights out, and to show that it works,

1420
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:18,880
everyone attending the ceremony brings a present for the child.

1421
01:37:19,860 --> 01:37:22,900
When I read that, I kind of hung around in the mind for about six months

1422
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:25,720
until I figured out that's the birthday cake celebration origin.

1423
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:29,950
So if you want to know if you're going to hell in a handbasket,

1424
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:34,610
so to speak, no matter how many smartphones you have in your back pocket,

1425
01:37:35,630 --> 01:37:38,950
go to the nearest shop and ask them if they serve birthday cakes

1426
01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:42,090
or can I buy a birthday cake or anything like that.

1427
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:44,810
And if they say yes, you're not doing so well,

1428
01:37:45,230 --> 01:37:47,130
at least from the divine point of view.

1429
01:37:47,470 --> 01:37:51,010
And now you know why the good and the good guys and the bad guys

1430
01:37:51,010 --> 01:37:51,890
are against you.

1431
01:37:52,050 --> 01:37:54,530
Yes, you, you, humanity at large.

1432
01:37:55,010 --> 01:37:58,230
Now, by the way, I want to bring up a little footnote here

1433
01:37:58,230 --> 01:37:59,970
because very often people say,

1434
01:38:00,070 --> 01:38:02,650
are you in the Jehovah's Witness Protection Program?

1435
01:38:04,810 --> 01:38:08,390
Now, what happens when certain ideas like this are grasped on a group,

1436
01:38:08,510 --> 01:38:10,130
a crowd mentality forms around it,

1437
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:14,310
it's quickly infiltrated and another organization built around it.

1438
01:38:14,330 --> 01:38:16,430
That's what your Jehovah's Witnesses are, by the way.

1439
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:19,350
If you ever met anyone that was in that organization,

1440
01:38:20,670 --> 01:38:24,330
yeah, greet Gustave Le Bon and you will see that as a perfect fit.

1441
01:38:24,330 --> 01:38:29,570
And usually, I shouldn't say this too much about them, but yeah,

1442
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:31,390
once they're in, they're never out.

1443
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:35,410
That mentality that requires to be in that group never escapes them.

1444
01:38:35,450 --> 01:38:37,570
Even though they leave the group, they still keep that on.

1445
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:40,770
It's really sad to say with most religions,

1446
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:43,850
but especially I've noticed with that particular group,

1447
01:38:43,990 --> 01:38:47,570
for some reason there's an entity attached to it, which I can't explain.

1448
01:38:48,190 --> 01:38:50,950
But we're not any, nothing like that.

1449
01:38:51,030 --> 01:38:53,510
There are many aspects of many things.

1450
01:38:53,510 --> 01:38:57,550
Again, like there's a benevolent label or facade that's put up,

1451
01:38:57,730 --> 01:39:00,910
but they're all malevolent, all of them.

1452
01:39:02,050 --> 01:39:03,130
So set yourself apart.

1453
01:39:03,230 --> 01:39:07,770
And if you're interested in the gods, plural, with the hierarchy,

1454
01:39:08,010 --> 01:39:10,510
and there's, by the way, let's just give the secret right now.

1455
01:39:10,570 --> 01:39:14,490
What makes the chief god, the almighty, the chief god?

1456
01:39:14,570 --> 01:39:16,630
Very simple, folks. He's not subject to death.

1457
01:39:17,530 --> 01:39:19,010
Death is subject to him, in fact.

1458
01:39:19,490 --> 01:39:22,050
Correct. And all the others are subject to death.

1459
01:39:22,050 --> 01:39:24,210
But think about that, too, on that. It's very simple.

1460
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:28,710
Stop watching television. Stop going to these sex temples.

1461
01:39:28,950 --> 01:39:30,590
I'm not saying stop going to these sex temples.

1462
01:39:30,910 --> 01:39:32,010
Actually, they're very powerful.

1463
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:34,490
You know what I'm talking about.

1464
01:39:34,570 --> 01:39:36,890
They have steeples and crucifixes and things and pews.

1465
01:39:37,630 --> 01:39:39,450
But the next time you walk into these religious places,

1466
01:39:39,530 --> 01:39:41,130
what do you think all the seats are there for?

1467
01:39:41,490 --> 01:39:44,090
Something that's going, a show that's going on in the front.

1468
01:39:44,850 --> 01:39:46,290
Just explained it to you, folks.

1469
01:39:47,890 --> 01:39:51,130
All of this right now might be insulting and offensive to some,

1470
01:39:51,130 --> 01:39:55,390
but I assure you that most of you will be wiping the floor

1471
01:39:55,390 --> 01:39:56,850
with all these things in the future.

1472
01:39:58,390 --> 01:40:00,390
The truth is often insulting.

1473
01:40:01,270 --> 01:40:03,450
Yes, because they're not seeking the truth.

1474
01:40:03,530 --> 01:40:06,570
See, people who don't seek the truth are easily offended.

1475
01:40:06,750 --> 01:40:07,830
There's an old saying that said,

1476
01:40:07,930 --> 01:40:11,950
never talk about politics or religion because you will offend the ignorant.

1477
01:40:13,470 --> 01:40:15,670
If you're seeking the truth, you cannot be offended.

1478
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:19,490
Now, the hardest part about that is that people don't want to admit

1479
01:40:19,490 --> 01:40:23,970
they've been defrauded or been involved in a malevolent organization,

1480
01:40:24,170 --> 01:40:27,350
albeit they consider themselves to be good, quote-unquote, good people.

1481
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:29,070
Right?

1482
01:40:29,870 --> 01:40:31,370
They don't want to admit that.

1483
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:33,870
And that's okay.

1484
01:40:33,990 --> 01:40:37,290
You don't have to admit it, but you should definitely act on it.

1485
01:40:38,430 --> 01:40:42,030
And act on it not in a way like anything is going to change,

1486
01:40:42,430 --> 01:40:44,730
but act on it to insulate yourself from it.

1487
01:40:45,310 --> 01:40:48,070
That's the problem that people don't understand

1488
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:50,970
is they think that action is social.

1489
01:40:52,050 --> 01:40:54,110
It's personal, meaning to yourself.

1490
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:58,250
And if half the world did that and helped one person,

1491
01:40:58,390 --> 01:40:59,990
then everything's taken care of.

1492
01:41:00,130 --> 01:41:01,130
But it's not going to happen.

1493
01:41:01,190 --> 01:41:04,390
You still have quite an epic to go through in the next decade.

1494
01:41:04,970 --> 01:41:06,770
It's going to be quite interesting to watch.

1495
01:41:08,650 --> 01:41:11,490
And the level of deception, it's not going to be bad, by the way.

1496
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:12,910
It's going to be actually quite good.

1497
01:41:13,070 --> 01:41:15,890
What's going to be happening is that you are going to have a perfect,

1498
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:19,790
nearly perfect society on this planet.

1499
01:41:19,970 --> 01:41:20,950
That's what's good about it.

1500
01:41:20,970 --> 01:41:24,330
The deception is that you're going to be told that it's going to last a thousand years

1501
01:41:24,330 --> 01:41:25,550
and you're all going to believe it.

1502
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:29,610
It's only going to last a few years, a few, three or four.

1503
01:41:30,910 --> 01:41:32,510
So, yeah.

1504
01:41:32,690 --> 01:41:35,970
And also, don't be impressed by large numbers, man.

1505
01:41:37,850 --> 01:41:39,750
Anything in creation is in large numbers.

1506
01:41:39,950 --> 01:41:42,490
The number of grains of sand on the beach, stars in the sky,

1507
01:41:42,490 --> 01:41:46,370
cells in the body, people on the earth, species of animals, insects,

1508
01:41:47,110 --> 01:41:48,930
the creators always use large numbers.

1509
01:41:49,050 --> 01:41:51,230
And also, don't be impressed with what mankind is doing.

1510
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:56,090
They were given knowledge on how to work with stone, metal, chemistry.

1511
01:41:56,910 --> 01:41:57,950
Yes, you were given that.

1512
01:41:57,990 --> 01:42:00,730
There's no such thing as a Stone Age or a Bronze Age or an Iron Age.

1513
01:42:00,770 --> 01:42:04,850
You had stone societies, iron societies, bronze societies, so forth.

1514
01:42:05,290 --> 01:42:07,630
And when you're told about cavemen and Neanderthal men,

1515
01:42:07,630 --> 01:42:11,170
those are people that had a lifespan of five, six, seven hundred years.

1516
01:42:12,130 --> 01:42:16,030
This has been proven out by forensic dentists and pathologists,

1517
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:18,650
and they were told to not talk about it.

1518
01:42:19,030 --> 01:42:24,810
And all those jaw bones and things were set in plastine with wide brows and things

1519
01:42:24,810 --> 01:42:27,250
to make them look more ape-like, and you're all being lied to,

1520
01:42:27,330 --> 01:42:29,310
to be made, felt insignificant.

1521
01:42:29,550 --> 01:42:31,450
Because if you did come from apes,

1522
01:42:31,450 --> 01:42:36,850
why do you have webbing between your toes and fingers and apes don't?

1523
01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:40,350
I thought you were supposed to come out of the water, not go back into the water.

1524
01:42:41,130 --> 01:42:46,050
You're being pranked, folks, not by some of academia, all of academia.

1525
01:42:46,350 --> 01:42:51,210
You're being pranked, not by some of the religious people, but all the religious people.

1526
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:55,050
You're being pranked, folks, by not some of the attorneys, but all the attorneys.

1527
01:42:55,650 --> 01:42:58,870
You're being pranked across the board.

1528
01:43:00,590 --> 01:43:01,070
Sorry.

1529
01:43:02,690 --> 01:43:05,870
I don't know if it's bad news or good news, but just take it as objectivity.

1530
01:43:08,790 --> 01:43:09,830
And the pranking goes on.

1531
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:11,770
Like we said earlier, pay attention.

1532
01:43:12,090 --> 01:43:13,830
Children are being pranked by their own parents,

1533
01:43:13,910 --> 01:43:16,950
who tend to have the position of God to them.

1534
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:23,090
The parents are your God until you realize there is another higher power.

1535
01:43:23,930 --> 01:43:28,850
You're being pranked by your gods while you're still in swaddling clothes.

1536
01:43:29,630 --> 01:43:32,630
Yeah, that's a right start in this world, isn't it?

1537
01:43:33,630 --> 01:43:37,150
So, and I still see it going on by young parents and old parents.

1538
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:40,950
I see parents that have very young children, they're young themselves,

1539
01:43:41,090 --> 01:43:42,730
and they're pranking the hell out of their children.

1540
01:43:44,090 --> 01:43:46,230
Yep, lying to them and everything.

1541
01:43:47,750 --> 01:43:50,290
So, yeah, there's nothing to make better.

1542
01:43:50,990 --> 01:43:51,750
Just live it through.

1543
01:43:51,970 --> 01:43:54,350
Like I say, man up, get strong.

1544
01:43:55,310 --> 01:43:57,890
You know, all this stuff they tell you about fear being disabling,

1545
01:43:57,890 --> 01:44:02,470
fear is based on how strong your mind is or your spirit and your skill level.

1546
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:05,110
If you've got no skills and you've got a weak mind or a weak spirit,

1547
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:06,190
you're subject to fear.

1548
01:44:07,350 --> 01:44:08,250
And there you have it.

1549
01:44:08,350 --> 01:44:09,130
Learn how to love.

1550
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:10,790
Be clear.

1551
01:44:12,090 --> 01:44:13,650
If you don't have clarity, seek it.

1552
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:17,290
And by the way, your law comes from your God.

1553
01:44:18,310 --> 01:44:19,730
I'm not making that up, folks.

1554
01:44:20,750 --> 01:44:23,210
If you don't have a God, then you believe in the laws of the state.

1555
01:44:23,310 --> 01:44:25,830
Well, fine, the state is your God and April Fool's is your holiday.

1556
01:44:26,390 --> 01:44:29,030
And the state, by the way, has a patron or matron deity.

1557
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:30,530
They put it in your face all the time.

1558
01:44:31,190 --> 01:44:32,150
Look at their buildings.

1559
01:44:32,290 --> 01:44:34,950
They have the statues there, and they'll tell you what it is, and they'll tell you.

1560
01:44:35,390 --> 01:44:35,870
It's a God.

1561
01:44:36,730 --> 01:44:43,970
Right now you're under the revived goddess religion, Justice, Themis, D.K.

1562
01:44:46,210 --> 01:44:50,330
I don't know about them telling you that it is a God.

1563
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:56,330
They'll acknowledge it, but they don't come out and they're not out there preaching it

1564
01:44:56,330 --> 01:44:59,590
as though they're not preaching it for what it is.

1565
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:00,750
Nope.

1566
01:45:01,530 --> 01:45:07,450
Every nation, bar none, every group of people has a patron or matron deity, period.

1567
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:11,170
Whether you believe in it or not, know it or not, is irrelevant.

1568
01:45:11,890 --> 01:45:13,770
That is the report back to the mothership.

1569
01:45:13,850 --> 01:45:17,370
If you land on a planet and see what's going on, like what's going on here,

1570
01:45:18,010 --> 01:45:22,990
that's a very simple notation that is about as accurate as accurate can be.

1571
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:25,810
So what do you know about these revived religions?

1572
01:45:25,810 --> 01:45:27,890
And if the answer is nothing, yes, you're in good company.

1573
01:45:28,690 --> 01:45:30,210
Can much be known about them?

1574
01:45:30,290 --> 01:45:30,530
Yes.

1575
01:45:32,110 --> 01:45:35,030
So do what you've got to do in the meantime.

1576
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:38,190
I think we pulled a song.

1577
01:45:38,310 --> 01:45:38,570
I don't know.

1578
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:42,390
We've got about a few minutes left.

1579
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:47,530
We're thinking of playing something for you folks, audible entertainment.

1580
01:45:48,530 --> 01:45:49,630
Yeah, a little bit, and we'll see.

1581
01:45:50,470 --> 01:45:51,470
We've got about eight minutes.

1582
01:45:52,290 --> 01:45:58,430
Typically we go to the four-minute mark, 54, and we've got two minutes or so.

1583
01:45:59,090 --> 01:46:02,710
I was thinking, anything else, Seth, you want to put in?

1584
01:46:02,770 --> 01:46:04,550
And maybe just cue it up and bring it in.

1585
01:46:04,910 --> 01:46:06,250
Bring in as much of it as you want.

1586
01:46:06,350 --> 01:46:14,030
I would say, again, that if you were interested in hearing what comes next,

1587
01:46:14,750 --> 01:46:25,190
to check out uncommonradio.com because as that comes to fruition and it begins,

1588
01:46:25,330 --> 01:46:26,990
that will be the easiest place to find it.

1589
01:46:27,630 --> 01:46:30,430
So www.uncommonradio.com.

1590
01:46:31,330 --> 01:46:35,570
