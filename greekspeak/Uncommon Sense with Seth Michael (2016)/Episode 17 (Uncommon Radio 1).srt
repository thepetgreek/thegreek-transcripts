1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:09,170
This is the first installment of this sonic endeavor with myself, Seth Michael, and The Greek.

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,590
We are going to stick with the moniker Uncommon Radio,

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,630
being that we are hosted currently at uncommonradio.com. If you're listening to this,

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:27,330
you're probably already aware of that. We will integrate with every format that we can to make

5
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:36,050
it as easy as possible for the listeners to get to the program. So iTunes and things of that nature

6
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:42,250
will be forthcoming. This, like I said, is just kind of a test. We'll call this episode zero.

7
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:51,770
And we're back. We're popping up like toast. So we're going to continue perhaps discovering

8
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,110
levels of discernment and subject matters and things that could be conveyed sonically that

9
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:03,750
just simply are not anywhere else. And maybe that's why we are doing it.

10
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:11,810
And welcome, everyone. And let's see how it goes. What's on your mind, Seth?

11
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:22,640
Oh, what is one is always on my mind. Scripture, I suppose, is what's on my mind.

12
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:32,000
It's left to me. That's where we'll go. Yeah, refer to as the scriptures. By the way,

13
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:41,240
I finished watching a series called Wolf Hall. It was a novel written by a woman novelist around

14
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,140
what they call 2009 on the Pope's work schedule. It was about the court of King Henry VIII,

15
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,860
and the main character is Thomas Cromwell. Not so historically accurate, based on some critics

16
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,700
on it, but a very enjoyable show. Do I recommend it? Perhaps. It's called Wolf Hall.

17
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,600
Unfortunately, it's a streaming type deal. You're going to have to purchase

18
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,740
somehow. It was on a PBS masterpiece theater. The reason why I brought this up, because around

19
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:20,220
that time, there was no English translation. This is in the 1500s. Tyndall and some others

20
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,820
were doing a reformist movement. What's interesting about that show or that presentation

21
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,600
is there was the Roman Catholic precedent set of what's called Christendom throughout the land,

22
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,300
which England was a part of and King Henry tried to break away from.

23
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:44,440
They repeatedly referred to the scriptures and how interesting the scriptures were versus what

24
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:51,260
the Roman Catholic Church, which represented and really founded Christendom, was purveying

25
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:57,100
throughout England. I just wanted to bring that up because there's a resonance in the mind still

26
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,940
from watching that short series, which I don't really partake in a lot of media. This was

27
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:08,180
something that I came across. I found interesting because it was a well-acted, well-done presentation

28
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,400
around Thomas Cromwell. The scriptures were a main feature of this presentation.

29
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,300
This is just something that's fresh in the mind, and I'm bringing it up because

30
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:26,400
people have to remember that, as we've said before many times, or I have said, the Greek has said,

31
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:35,140
let's say, even today in your modern time, you do not have an accurate translation of what is

32
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:41,660
known as the scriptures. Sorry, folks, that is the truth. All of the versions that you have

33
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:52,860
are not translations. There are very loose reference versions, inaccurate, that convey

34
00:03:52,860 --> 00:04:01,360
the general story of what is in the scriptures, and that's it. Period. So you have no real

35
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,880
understanding, no real information conveyance of what is in the scriptures. Now, a lot of it comes

36
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:19,040
across in the versions, but unfortunately, when you combine that with the social aspect of how people

37
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:26,440
read into works of information or things that they revisit later on in life, that they were initially

38
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,540
exposed to that subject matter as a child through various social institutions.

39
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:39,360
What I mean by that is, if you right now pick up what they call a Bible, and you read something

40
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,040
familiar, you get to, let's say, Exodus, or the Flood, or Adam and Eve, or the Apostles,

41
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:56,600
most people tend to read in and overlay what they saw on television by Disney, Cecil B. DeMille,

42
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:05,300
what they were told in church, or the circus, or their parents, and unfortunately, none of it is

43
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:14,260
accurate. Sorry. And the reason why I'm saying it that way is because it's still a massive endeavor

44
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:23,160
to delve into that thing we call the scriptures. And what I mean by massive endeavor is it has to

45
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:32,300
be retold or restated. So with that said, yeah. Go ahead. With preface, with background, with

46
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,600
it has to be established that we're working with versions and not with a translation.

47
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:48,000
That's easy to do for yourself. If you'd like to find an interlinear, there are a number of

48
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,220
them available on the internet for free reference. You can punch the one that always comes to mind

49
00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:04,680
first is what's called Genesis, Bereshit. The first verse of Genesis, as it is the version

50
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,500
that is available to English speakers and those who read English like myself,

51
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:19,920
the first verse in the King James Version is 10 words. In the Hebrew, in the language that has

52
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:27,840
been memorialized in, it's seven words. It could be argued that it's eight words because there's a

53
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:34,080
in there, which is in English, we translate that as and, and that's relatively accurate.

54
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:45,540
But at the same time, there are two words in the first verse of Genesis that actually the same

55
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:52,960
word. So it's one word that appears twice in the first verse of that book that is not translated.

56
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,900
And not only is it not translated, that word occurs in the scriptures

57
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,780
between six and 7,000 times. It's been omitted.

58
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,040
So just to sum that up one more time, because there are 10 words in the first verse of Genesis

59
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,700
1.1 in English in the version, but there are seven in the language of preservation,

60
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:24,780
but only six are being translated. Right? Generally, correct. And that would be the

61
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,000
Aleph Tav. And it would be the first seven words would be the fourth one that the fourth word that

62
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,400
is not being translated. So what's interesting about languages and names and things, they are

63
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:43,140
sounds that we attach to things, right? What is a name? A name is a sound that you answer to.

64
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:50,580
Right? So what's interesting about, you know, even we describe these presentations as being

65
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:59,200
sonic presentations, meaning it's of the sound nature of our perception, not visual yet, because

66
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,960
it's, you know, it's audio strictly. So just for the audience, just to have an effect on the mind,

67
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:11,220
just to, and it's good to start at the beginning, which we will find out later on that Genesis is

68
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:18,360
not the beginning, I guess, but that's for another discussion. In Genesis, basically 1.1,

69
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,200
it says, in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. But in Hebrew,

70
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:30,760
it would be something like, Bereshith bara Elohim et ha-shem yim v'het ha-aretz. Right?

71
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:39,140
Now, what's interesting is Bereshith, beginning, bara, we would say created or presented Elohim,

72
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:46,980
the gods, et, which is the Aleph-Tav, the first and the last, or would be the letters of the

73
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,340
Hebrew alphabet, or any alphabet, which would be the A and the Z, or the Alpha and the Omega.

74
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:57,640
And there's someone who identifies themselves as being the first and last, and the Alpha and the

75
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:10,660
Omega. Right? And then, the heavens, and, which can be namely the waters, and et ha-aretz, which

76
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:17,640
is the earth. So there you go. And you don't get that in the King James or any version.

77
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,240
So guess what, folks? You open what's called a Bible, you're on the first verse, the first,

78
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:31,700
of the first book, of the first chapter, of the first verse, of the first book, and you're already

79
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:38,680
spit out on the other end with an omission. How do you think you're going to fare on verse two,

80
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:46,660
or verse three of the first book? An omission and obvious mistranslation in the first verse.

81
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,760
Right. Now, a lot of, by the way, the side note, or footnote here, some scholars say,

82
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:58,320
the olive top is just a punctuation for them to show you something is important, or it's a

83
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:05,120
conjunction of some kind. I've seen it presented as, or I've seen it translated as the word the,

84
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,500
or the, which is also inaccurate. Right. Because it's defined.

85
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,900
That's right, ha. Yeah, and ha would be for plural or singular.

86
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,920
So, so we're going into this kind of like head fast, and I mean, head first, quickly,

87
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,120
only because there's a something here that needs to be set in the mind. You know, everything that

88
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:37,420
we do or hear has an effect on the mind, and that's how we tend to rationalize things. And

89
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,520
when I, when I mentioned earlier reading into subject matter that is brought up, that is

90
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:51,440
biblical, as be, and you know, we're actually overlaying and reading into things, because when

91
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,120
we perceive information, this is just a commentary on how the human mind works. There's a, there's a

92
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,420
maturity level that people reach, known as adulthood, and they feel that they can operate

93
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,880
freely in the world and do what they wish. And when they approach things, they are constantly

94
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:14,860
comparing what they're doing throughout their day with previous experiences. And that's how

95
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:20,800
people read, and that's how people interact. Right? So, you know, if you, let's say, are walking

96
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,720
on the street and you see a dog, you, you actually see the dog, but you're not really

97
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:32,180
seeing the dog. You, you see enough of the dog to know it's a dog, and you,

98
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:37,020
immediately the mind compares it to all the other dogs you've seen, and it's close enough,

99
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,460
and that's just a dog. But if someone were to ask you what that dog really looked like,

100
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,740
you would give it, oh, it's a dog, you know, but you're really not looking at it. You're just,

101
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,320
I mean, you just kind of glanced at it, it's enough, and you've compared it to everything

102
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,240
else that you've seen about a dog, it's good enough. That's what I mean about reading into it.

103
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,900
So when people are also having conversations, I'll notice, or reading something, if you ask

104
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:05,500
them to describe what they just read, well, if the subject matter is familiar,

105
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,780
they're not really paying attention because they're comparing it to previous things that

106
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:17,020
have been downloaded. That's where, in, I guess, in media school years ago, they used to talk about,

107
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:22,880
you know, man bites dog, right, and people were like, oh, okay, yeah, because it sounds like

108
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:29,080
dog bites man. That's pretty common, but man bites dog is very uncommon, right? That's the,

109
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,160
the story that you're always looking for, something that people see as familiar but

110
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,800
is very strange at the same time if you're paying attention. So we're, we're jumping into

111
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,960
scripture and basically we're only a few minutes into this sonic presentation and we laid out

112
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:51,720
pretty much a gem, I would say, about how you're not even getting anything true in the first verse

113
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:57,560
of the first chapter of the first book, so what do you think you're going to get in the rest of it?

114
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:04,040
So, very much similarly, the same attitude carries through.

115
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:20,950
So, the, I found it easier to discuss things that are written in the text with those who have very

116
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:30,770
little to no experience with study. Preferably, yes, preferably atheists or secular people.

117
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:37,190
That might be interested in the subject matter. I've jumped into conversations at coffee shops,

118
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,330
actually, where I heard, you know, something of interest to myself being discussed.

119
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:48,030
I'm like, but that's, that's not what it said. And the ones I've, I've, many times, actually,

120
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:52,210
and it's, it's much easier to talk to people that don't have

121
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,910
misinformed, preconceived notions to battle with when, when speaking about it.

122
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:08,050
Let's just jump into another concept, because we do bring up time very often. It's almost the last

123
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:15,410
week of the sixth month, and it's, you want to sound off the date, roughly, what it is on the

124
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:21,850
Pope's work schedule? It's August something? The 10th? Yeah, something like that.

125
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:28,750
I think. What they call 2016, I think. Right, the 25th of the sixth month.

126
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:34,550
Yeah, roughly, last week of the sixth month, going into the seventh month. So why is time

127
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:39,450
important? Because you have to realize that when we start discussing, let's say, Scripture,

128
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:46,310
one of the things we'll bring up is that the word forever is not in there, right? The word being

129
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:52,890
translated as forever is the word olam and the word eon, which means the age.

130
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,990
Yeah, unto the ages.

131
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:58,950
Uh-huh. And an age is typically a thousand or two thousand years, pairs of thousands.

132
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:05,790
Right? So there is no forever. And the reason I bring that up is because

133
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:12,960
all information is only pertinent when it's registered as pertinent in the time that it's

134
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:18,980
registered as pertinent. What does that mean? Well, if you're reading about, you know,

135
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:27,420
horse-drawn carriages, you will find information that is difficult to understand if you're living

136
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:34,320
in an age of what they call the automobile or the car, right? Because you've spent your entire life,

137
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:42,040
uh, most likely being driven around, as they say colloquially, in a rubber-tired,

138
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:50,920
reciprocating engine, gas-guzzling, gas-eating machine. You're not familiar with the basic common

139
00:15:51,920 --> 00:16:01,620
things of what a horse-drawn carriage is, you know. Yeah, you might know that it's, yeah,

140
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,960
it's made of wood, and it's got a metal strap around the wooden wheel so it doesn't break,

141
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,300
which is called a tire. And there's an animal in the front drawing it, and that's simple enough.

142
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,360
But if you were to study, let's say, the Casanova wagons and things like that, and pick up some

143
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,040
reference material on it, the majority of the information conveyed will be unfamiliar to you,

144
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:28,120
even though they are simple terms and simple concepts. And this is very much what Scripture

145
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:36,560
is like, because people don't know how to place the information within the time period that they're

146
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:44,740
living in. So that's why time is very important. So what is important about time in Scripture is

147
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:50,040
knowing where you are in that entire story. And that cannot be garnered until you've basically

148
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,440
downloaded the entire thing, or been familiar with the entire thing, and then pieced it all

149
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:02,620
together rationally, just like the, I guess, the horse-drawn carriage. Because you can still

150
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:10,579
access a horse-drawn carriage somewhere. So there's something about it that requires,

151
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,500
let's say, an understanding of time, would you say, Seth? And how to keep time and things like that.

152
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:27,440
Absolutely. Especially if you're talking about something that is referencing times,

153
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:37,400
when to do things, or when things will happen, and you're trying to make proper observations

154
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:44,680
about such things. It's impossible with the Pope's work schedule, as they call it.

155
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,520
But even with the Pope's work schedule and mechanical clocks, time has to be measured

156
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,780
accurately, to some degree. Let's use the mechanical clock. And I just want to throw something in.

157
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:01,180
Right now there is a particular religion and culture on the planet that is allegedly adhering

158
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:07,640
to this type of information. And many people are under the misunderstanding that the day ends at

159
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:14,740
sundown, because a certain group says so. A religious group, let's say. And if you study

160
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:22,420
scripture with an open perception, where you see it objectively, you will see that the day starts

161
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:29,100
at noon. Because, very simply, you cannot make a measurement at sundown. Sundown is actually the

162
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:36,860
last hour. The noon time, using, let's say, what you might call a sundial, or just a stick in the

163
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:44,040
ground, can be measured very precisely. Also, there is a concept that the new moon is the dark

164
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,280
moon in scripture, and that is another mistake, because you cannot make a measurement with a dark

165
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:56,340
moon. It just sits around in the West, and it's dark. Where the full moon rises like the sun,

166
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:02,160
and it has its own noon time. In other words, when the full moon is at the apex of the sky,

167
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,840
at the zenith, it will cast a very sharp shadow, which you can compare it

168
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,080
to the solar shadow taken that day. And that's how you determine what's called the equinox.

169
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,540
It has nothing to do with equal day and equal night. It has to do with a measurement at night.

170
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:24,200
That's why it's equinox. Equi meaning measure, nox meaning night. If it was equal parts day and

171
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,640
night, it would be equimdeum nox. So, these are things I just want to, we're kind of like

172
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,700
randomly throwing in concepts here. And just to throw in a few other things here, this is kind of

173
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,960
like running into someone and pushing them around, you know, and I don't mind doing that sometimes,

174
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,600
but because kind of like a little bit, the subject matter is not really something we're

175
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,900
going to delve into other than the overall mindset. Like we said earlier, there is no

176
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:57,420
forever in the scripture. It's the ages, which are chunks of limited times. You will not find

177
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:02,500
the word. The other one that's important to consider is you will not find the word church.

178
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:09,140
The reason I'm saying that is because from a secular perspective, secular historians consider

179
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:15,000
this to be the Christian era. And when the first thing you bring up in the mind, or most people do

180
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,780
when you bring up Christendom is the church, you will not find anything that resembles that

181
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:28,900
in scripture at all. Zero. What they call church today is a revival of the ancient circus or the

182
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:35,840
architecture resembles the ancient sex temples. None of it is biblical at all. Zero. Period.

183
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:45,260
At all. You will not find hell as Dante's Inferno, where bad people go when they die.

184
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:50,980
And there's devils with pitchforks and things like that. There is no such thing in scripture.

185
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:58,440
Period. You will not find anyone being animated in a heavenly realm after they die,

186
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,840
where you die and you find yourself with a light and a cloud and plucking a harp and doing all that.

187
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:10,300
That is a lie. You will not find any of that. Actually, you won't find any of those in any

188
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:17,920
ancient texts. Those are inventions of a particular character or group of characters

189
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:26,960
inspired by a magician in the first century. So this is the truth of these matters when you

190
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:34,620
discuss the time, because you're in a time right now, people, where when this topic is brought up,

191
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:43,000
you think of heaven and hell as plucking a harp in the pearly gates or being in a fiery,

192
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:51,200
infernal place with demons or forever or church. And all of these things are completely

193
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,040
irrelevant and not in scripture at all. Period.

194
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:05,500
Give me a quick example. The word congregation or ecclesia, as it is in scripture, just means

195
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:11,720
a group of people. And that is being translated as church and what's called the New Testament.

196
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:20,720
And if you actually do some research, there's an unruly mob protesting or ready to do some harm.

197
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:28,080
And they're referred to as an ecclesia of people. I think it's in the Book of Acts. I think when

198
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:34,540
Shaul was there, he roused up a crowd and he was arrested for rousing up the crowd.

199
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:41,480
And that crowd is referred to as an ecclesia. So it just means a crowd or a group or people

200
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:47,940
grouped together. So when you hear us say things like there's no such thing as a church in

201
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:54,880
scripture or heaven or hell or forever, we're going to try to throw in a very fast reference

202
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:00,820
on how and why we're saying it as well, which I think is important.

203
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:12,340
Absolutely. Absolutely. We're doing this on our own, independently from any other

204
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,960
media outlet or anything like that. Currently, it's going to be available just here.

205
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:29,280
And I am fond of that idea. After having experience with sonic projects in other venues,

206
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,300
it's a lot more comfortable to sit in our own venue and speak.

207
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:46,000
Yeah, definitely. There are no time limitations. We can broadcast very short episodes

208
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:54,540
or very long ones. And we can speak freely without

209
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,880
the implied audience that is common to other venues.

210
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:09,300
Yeah, media was, I think it was Edward R. Murrow, someone that when the advent of television,

211
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,340
meaning it was popular and available to most people, he said it should be taken seriously

212
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:23,140
because it's almost a cross between a national park and a library or university. And a lot of

213
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:29,900
the media that people partake in, known as internet radio, can be viewed very similarly. And we've

214
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:36,480
tried that, and we're very grateful that we were given the opportunity. But if you don't have to

215
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:45,880
be associated with it, why not not be associated with it is the point. And in essence, being able

216
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,240
to do this, being very grateful that the website can host it at the moment, and we'll see other

217
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,020
ways to get information out. I think the four or five listeners that we kind of like semi-jokingly

218
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:04,820
talk about will be able to access it. So, with that said, in terms of media, folks,

219
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,960
I've heard that there's some frustration regarding media. I hear that constantly, but people still

220
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,700
use it. And I think we've mentioned in one of the sonic presentations that this is all a beta

221
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:23,440
test, what you've been watching throughout the human course of events with television, radio,

222
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,800
and the internet. Right now, it's just a beta test. That's why it's all junk. It's just like I

223
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:35,580
think we did an audio test here, get on the mic, testing, testing, one, two, three. That's all you've

224
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:40,660
been experiencing all your life. There's events that are going to be occurring in the future

225
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:48,440
where there's going to be an imparting of information. There's going to be the witnessing

226
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,800
of events in real time with audio and video throughout the world. This is what this entire

227
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,560
evolution, let's say, or an opening or unraveling from radio to television to internet

228
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:05,360
is. So, if you're frustrated about all the junk out there, yes, and it's all junk, because if it

229
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:12,000
wasn't, we would probably be saying, go listen to here or go over there. We wouldn't be doing this,

230
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,020
you know, at least in private. So, what the attempt here is to give maybe a little bit of

231
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:25,100
credence to maybe a cross between a national park and a university. And by the way, folks,

232
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,300
I want to throw this in as another commentary, because, you know, I kind of rambled, but I

233
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:34,800
tried to tie things together. You university folks, your academics, whatever, look up the

234
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:40,900
word academic in an etymological dictionary. To paraphrase, it means theoretical and practical

235
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:47,080
never leading to a conclusion. And if there is any benefit in the current system of academia,

236
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,980
and you live in a benevolent society, and you have such free media available,

237
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,620
why can't you turn on the television or the internet and have these wonderful universities

238
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:06,860
that want to help mankind do all of their teaching online? Because first of all, this is the truth,

239
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:11,580
folks. It's not worth learning from them. They have nothing to teach you. When I say nothing,

240
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:16,600
there's a, yeah, there's something there, because even a counterfeit note has to look like the real

241
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:24,860
thing, you know. Sorry. And you've been pranked. You've been pranked by your parents to go to these

242
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:32,660
schools. And then, where if you study intellectual minds of the 19th century, they never received

243
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:39,060
their graduate degrees by 15 or 16 years old. They only went through several years of schooling.

244
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:44,320
That's all you need. The kindergarten through 12th grade in university is a prank.

245
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,700
It destroys your formative years. It steals all of your formative years.

246
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:55,500
Now, this might sound like heresy. And by the way, the word heresy means what one prefers or one

247
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:02,240
likes. And this goes beyond that. This is trying to be objective. So when you hear us discussing

248
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,820
certain subject matter, this is the kind of stuff that makes academics crawl out of their skin.

249
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:12,100
Or go into convulsions and fall on the ground and vomit.

250
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:21,600
Right? Because it is possible to take very large pieces or chunks of subject matter and reduce it

251
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:29,860
down to a few sentences where the man or the woman listening, or even the child, can digest what's

252
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:36,200
been said and understand it. And that is one of the things we like to do. And it's based on

253
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:43,380
discernment and clear, concise communication. Which is a big contrast to academia. Which I think

254
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:49,060
is just what anyone can think, actually. If you were to objectify it, it's a prank on humanity

255
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:54,340
at this point. And it actually has always been these public institutions. And I'm not speaking

256
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:59,860
against them that they shouldn't exist or anything like that. Just like ice cream shops shouldn't

257
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:08,580
exist or shoe stores or whatever. But if you're trying to associate knowledge and learning with

258
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:14,040
these institutions that are in place, you are really, you don't get it. Sorry. And you never,

259
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:22,200
probably never will. So I wanted to bring that up because conveying and imparting information

260
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,080
can be done very quickly, concisely, and effectively. And that might be one of the

261
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,120
things that we might start, you know, endeavoring on these sonic experiences with.

262
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:43,580
I think that we do. I think that a lot of what is spoken about requires, you know, explanation.

263
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:51,040
And the more that we get into it, and the more that things are explained, we'll be able to speak about

264
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,640
them without the explanation and be able to refer back to where we have explained it, where it has

265
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:07,080
been explained. But I think that explanation is important, especially to anyone who, you know,

266
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:16,060
makes it a habit to listen, to seek out such conversation as we have.

267
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:23,840
And I require it myself for my own, you know, knowledge.

268
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:34,900
You know, instruction is something to be sought. And that's certainly a large part of why I do

269
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:40,920
this and why I have enjoyed the conversations that you and I have had over the years, public and

270
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:49,800
private. And with this endeavor, I think that we have the ability to do it in a more comfortable

271
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:58,740
setting. There have been, you know, we've had some objectively or relatively good broadcasts

272
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:05,520
in the past, and I don't mean to speak derogatorily of any of the venues that, you know, we've spoken

273
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:10,500
because, well, they allowed us to speak, and that in and of itself is relatively rare.

274
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,860
But there's no pressure with this, and that's wonderful.

275
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:24,000
Yeah, in other words, you can have a beautiful venue and they serve food that is synthetic or,

276
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:30,820
you know, bad ingredients in it, right, let's say, but the venue is fine. We'd like to have a good

277
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:38,040
venue, let's say, with good ingredients, right? You know, when we serve cheese, it's made with

278
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:44,220
milk, not cheese made of whatever, right? Or if it's salt, it's real salt, not, you know, something

279
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:51,900
from the aluminum industry. So, yeah, but here's the thing also, the partial rant and commentary

280
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:58,900
regarding internet radio or other venues or academia or any of these things that people are

281
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:07,920
going to, where the hosts, the teachers, the professors, those professing, you know, those

282
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:15,320
behind a microphone or a lecture hall or writing a book, they are just part of the human collective

283
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:22,620
that have decided to do such a thing. And they come from the same, let's say, maladies and flawed

284
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:30,080
aspects of the society that we're sort of being critical about. Now, if you told me that a wormhole

285
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,740
opened up and a bunch of people came from another dimension, let's say, which is only one dimension

286
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:42,880
or another universe or planet to be your internet radio hosts or your professors or whatever, yeah,

287
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:50,060
you might want to give a listen because they haven't been subjected and pranked by the insanity

288
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:54,600
going on on this planet by the human race for thousands of years. You see, they haven't been

289
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:00,260
subject to that. So it might be worth listening to. But all of these professors and whatever,

290
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:06,560
all these people pontificating, they have not realized that the majority of what they're saying

291
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:13,580
is a product of prankdom. None of, I mean, I shouldn't say none of it, but very little of it

292
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:20,120
is accurate. Very little of it is based on anything. It's just the typical social chatter

293
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,520
that you hear, whether it's academia, all the way through, I mean, any form of media.

294
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,380
So this is the point, you know, can information be imparted in an objective,

295
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:41,700
clear, concise matter regarding any subject to a surface-dwelling Earth inhabitant? And I believe

296
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:51,670
the answer is yes. And that might be the crux of this whole thing. Absolutely. Absolutely.

297
00:33:53,610 --> 00:34:02,370
I would say that it can be, but how, whether the seeds fall on fertile ground

298
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:10,449
is, I don't know. I guess there's plenty of fertilizer out there. Yeah, there is. Flowers

299
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:17,570
need a lot of bullshit to grow, but I think sonic experiences can be free of it to a certain extent,

300
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,989
because you're not really growing flowers. But the thing is,

301
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:30,590
the point of conveying information is also that it has to fit the time period,

302
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:37,170
so it's more relevant. Because I think we've mentioned how the nature of existence is very

303
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:42,409
simple, folks. It's basically where spirit's animated through material. You know, the spirit,

304
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:46,449
the soul, the body. The spirit is the mind, the soul is the breath, and the body is the physical

305
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:53,130
matter. And the three working together to animate the show, known as everything that we consider a

306
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:57,670
reality, is the reality of it. And that's all it is. It's very simple. It's not easy, but it's simple

307
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:06,770
to explain what's going on. And to give information that is pertinent to a mind animated through

308
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:18,410
material is not being done effectively or efficiently on this planet at the moment. It's

309
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:26,510
astounding to observe. So that, again, would probably be the way we would like to discuss

310
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:34,110
things objectively, as if you're just visiting a place, clearly and concisely. And just to go back

311
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:40,530
to what we started with, the interest in scripture, just to give a thought, the reason

312
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:47,490
we brought up the concept of maybe discussing scripture more, and please, you have to bear

313
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:54,910
in mind that this has nothing to do with any religious affiliation at all. And even you folks

314
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:59,590
out there that think you're non-denominational, that's just like going to a supermarket and instead

315
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:05,130
of buying a particular brand, it's the generic white box. That's not any better. It's still

316
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:12,050
macaroni and cheese with whatever in it. We're not discussing any religious affiliation or anything

317
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:17,370
in that aspect, which I think I brought up. There's no forever, no church, no heaven and hell

318
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:25,010
as people discuss it in certain religious circles and certain timekeeping things. It's just maybe a

319
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:32,830
little bit of a preface. Absolutely. I would recommend that for anyone that is interested in

320
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:39,110
studying such things or looking at things objectively, use the, you know, the internet

321
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:44,690
only has what the internet has, but there are tools available there, and you can find free

322
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:50,910
interlinear software, things like that, that make it, I wouldn't say make it any easier, but make it

323
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:59,510
more fruitful studying such things. I'd like to recommend coelesthes, ecclesiastes, as it's

324
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:08,640
called in the English versions, to anyone who is considering such things. It's not going to

325
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:15,870
make you friends. It will be a point of contention if it's something that you are

326
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:20,470
looking at objectively between you and anyone that you speak about it with.

327
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:26,290
Or anything in scripture. Yeah, absolutely. But there are tools available.

328
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:34,490
How about this? How about, not a promise, but a consideration that if people adhere to what we're

329
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:41,210
presenting and piece it all together, they'll have a pretty good idea of the rhythm of

330
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:49,870
what is going on. What I mean by that is, yes, koaleph is important, proverbs are important,

331
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:53,590
the book of Jeremiah is important, because those things are universal. Those are pretty much for

332
00:37:53,590 --> 00:38:00,350
everyone. Most of the other things in scripture are directed to certain groups, right? Just like

333
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:04,990
you would go to someone's mailbox and they're being addressed specifically. But, you know,

334
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:11,070
I just gave a handful of things there. Now, that's a lot of information right there in a very short

335
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:17,250
sentence. Consider that, anyone listening. Now, the rhythm of it is, let's give an example,

336
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:21,410
like the band Fleetwood Mac. The first time you hear a Fleetwood Mac song, you're like, oh,

337
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:28,710
okay, I see what they sound like, how they play music. And then you hear another song from them,

338
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:33,030
let's say on an album, and okay, all right, I can see it's the same band, but it's a different song.

339
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:38,230
And if you're familiar with, let's say, 10 Fleetwood Mac songs, if you were to go about in

340
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:42,070
life and another song comes on, you'll say, oh, that sounds like Fleetwood Mac, even though you've

341
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:50,530
never heard it before. And on the same note, if someone plays a song for you and tells you that

342
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:54,950
this is Fleetwood Mac, and it's not, you'll be like, this doesn't sound like Fleetwood Mac at all.

343
00:38:55,470 --> 00:39:00,910
Yeah, exactly. So what we will do, besides reading the books of wisdom and things like that,

344
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:05,350
and maybe the book of Jeremiah, which is addressed to everyone, like Seth likes bringing up Ecclesiastes,

345
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:13,250
and rightly so, let's say we'll discuss certain very specific topics, like we mentioned, let's

346
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:20,450
say, the flood, a very short thing about very specific interlinear kind of etymological aspect

347
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:25,790
of a certain part of, let's say, the flood in Genesis, or like we just started out by doing the

348
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:30,790
first verse of the first book of the first chapter, we just gave an illustration of what's going on

349
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:36,910
there, we could pick and choose various aspects of scripture and go into it in great depth very

350
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:45,250
quickly, in short, and concise and objectify it all over. And you will notice that it's obviously

351
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:50,470
there, it's all tied together, it's the same band, it's playing, it's the same, it's the same band,

352
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:57,650
but different songs. And let's say we do a dozen examples of like, example, something in the flood,

353
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:01,650
something in, let's say, the Garden of Eden, something about when the Israelites left Egypt,

354
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:07,790
or something from what they call the New Testament, and we'll explain it, and people will figure out,

355
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:14,290
hey, there seem to be, these things have something in common, even though they seem that, you know,

356
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:20,090
they're all set, you know, separate instances and separate events, these guys are showing us what

357
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:24,730
all these things have in common, and there's an understanding here, how it's all tied together,

358
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:29,610
and the mistakes they're pointing out seem to have a frequency and a rhythm in an app.

359
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:38,150
There's a mindset to what makes the versions that you're given so bad, if we reveal that mindset,

360
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:44,090
and then we reveal the mindset that when you do research what is really being said in the

361
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:49,190
language of preservation, you'll have a good contrast. And just giving maybe a half a dozen

362
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:55,730
examples, like we just started out with the first verse of Genesis, the listener then will be able

363
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:03,770
to have almost a pretty good understanding of what is going on on their own, like listening

364
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:12,690
to Fleetwood Mac, for example. So this is just an example. So just like we gave the example right

365
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:18,510
out of the gate, we will perhaps go into many other explanations like that, and this is not

366
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:24,470
a lot of people resist this because it goes contrary to what they believe, but if belief

367
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:30,170
is based on nothing, well there you go. If you say you believe in something and someone questions it

368
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:35,190
in terms of why do you believe that, and it's based on nothing, well then you just need to

369
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:40,810
kind of like walk away, because guess what, nothing is based on nothing.

370
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:45,970
So yeah, if you're listening, it's like listening to music in a different tuning,

371
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:58,030
that is unfamiliar, if it doesn't, if it sounds, it's going to sound discordant to many.

372
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:07,710
Now why scripture? The big question here is very simple, folks, and we'll lay it out really quickly

373
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:13,370
and really simple. If someone has a lawful mind, meaning that when you have a communication

374
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:18,170
and you have a lawful mind, you see if that communication sets a precedent, if it's an

375
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:23,750
important communication, or is it trivial, or is it, you know, how much attention does that,

376
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:28,530
what you just heard or read, require? Like for example, if someone says, excuse me, I have to

377
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:32,730
go to the bathroom, well that's a communication, but you know, it's like okay, fine, it's common,

378
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:37,690
no big deal, but thanks for letting me know. But if someone, if you read a communication that says,

379
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:43,050
I created the heavens and the earth, and I am the supreme being, oh, that's so trivial,

380
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:47,510
I don't really believe in that, I don't care. Well, you see, that's the typical mindset. But

381
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:50,470
if someone has a lawful mind, and they hear that, they're like, wait a second,

382
00:42:51,050 --> 00:43:01,570
that is a really, really tall claim, right? And it sounds extremely important. And I mean,

383
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:10,470
and has it been rebutted? Is it true? Right? Or whatever, right? So that's why we go to scripture,

384
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:15,070
because you will find things that are claimed in there that are really tall claims. I mean,

385
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:19,650
we're talking big claims. And the majority of the surface dwelling earth inhabitants

386
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:27,990
are apathetic to it, because they don't have a lawful mind. So that's why, that is why I would

387
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:34,470
like to say from the Greeks perspective, is why I have an interest in it. You know, if someone says,

388
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:39,590
hey, I got to go to the bathroom, or else, you know, I've got to go, you know, rearrange the

389
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:44,550
sock drawer, that is a communication, just like I created the heavens and the earth, for example,

390
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:50,550
is a communication, but they have different veracities. You know, one needs to be considered

391
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:57,390
to see if it's true. And if it is true, well, that is really important information.

392
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:04,250
And it's been hijacked, just like all information, right now, has been somehow

393
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:10,010
conveyed through some corrupted kind of presentation, or individuals that are loose

394
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:16,250
and apathetic and don't really care. And I say not all, but you know, typically. And here,

395
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:21,990
the reason why I'm saying that to be ranty or critical, is because I like the truth. I like

396
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:28,770
information. I like learning. This is a personal thing, right? And I like to see and hear that

397
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:33,390
other people are doing, you know, just like if someone likes, let's say, basketball, they like

398
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:39,270
to associate with other people who have a fondness for it, right? Or playing instruments, or cooking,

399
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:44,810
or whatever. So I like learning. I like, you know, learning things, and especially if they're big

400
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:54,030
things that are important. And I have certain people that I communicate with. And if I had

401
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:59,910
found a source that was able to convey important information clearly, concisely, and objectively,

402
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:04,650
wouldn't be doing these sonic presentations at all. I would just sit back and people that I

403
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:09,110
communicated with, I would, you know, send them information, say, look at this, look at that,

404
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:15,350
look at this guy here, or whatever, right? And you would not know about the Greek at all.

405
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:23,350
But the reason why I come out and speak, is because no one is saying anything. You know,

406
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:29,350
I mean, when I say no one is saying anything, it's just, yeah, it sounds kind of arrogant or

407
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:34,190
whatever. But on the other hand, it's like, what the hell is going on? Are you people lost your

408
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:41,470
minds? Are you crazy? Oh, they're saying, they're saying plenty. But generally, what they're saying

409
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:50,750
is just a complaint about the symptoms. Yeah. Is anyone paying attention? Yeah. So, you know,

410
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:56,830
sitting back, there's a, there's a, if I was not speaking, I would feel that there's a level of

411
00:45:56,830 --> 00:46:03,430
negligence incorporated in my existence. So I have to come out and say, I mean, if you want,

412
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:06,690
if you folks want to know what I'm talking about, just go to the internet radio and turn on

413
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:14,430
anything. Right? Or go to YouTube. Start watching stuff. It's like, huh? What the hell is wrong with

414
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:22,730
you people? So anyway, you may not, you can't really say they're wrong. Right? But you can't

415
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:31,050
say they're right. I would say that my interest and the reason that I, as I said, right when,

416
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:35,870
right when we started this, that if it's up to me, that we'll, we'll discuss scripture.

417
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:44,210
I, I guess that I grew up in an environment where it was spoken of quite a bit. And so I was

418
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:52,550
familiar with it from a relatively young age and put together pretty early on that what is written

419
00:46:52,550 --> 00:47:03,630
and what is said in these congregations is very rarely congruent. Not, not even to touch upon

420
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:11,070
what is actually done, but just, just what is said, what is taught is not, it's not there.

421
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:18,990
And there, you'll get various explanations from any of these groups as to the why, the

422
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:28,810
apology. You'll get an apology. They'll speak in defense of it. But so I've always, it's, I guess

423
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:33,070
I've just kind of been drawn to it for that reason. I'm going, well, there's, there's good

424
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:38,170
information here. It's obvious there are directions, lots, lots and lots of directions.

425
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:45,530
It's almost like a handbook for living on the surface of this planet. And, but it's, it's

426
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:52,590
ignored and distorted. And so I see this, this object, if you look at, you know, the scriptures

427
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:56,510
as a whole, as, as an object, as a singular book, although it's many.

428
00:47:58,110 --> 00:47:58,410
49.

429
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:06,630
Yeah. 49 books, right. That are being discussed, but not being directly addressed.

430
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:13,690
The only time that I could tolerate being in these places is when we were sitting in a circle and

431
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:18,030
just reading passages and discussing them, because it's very hard to skirt things

432
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:27,570
when you have the ability, but I can't, I can't, I, it's been many, many years since I've

433
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:31,930
subjected myself to, to that particular form of punishment. But

434
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:38,330
I've, I've, there's value in it. It's, it's valuable. It's something that is

435
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:46,070
rare. You know, there are many, many textbooks and I'm sure we'll get into, you know, who edits

436
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:52,130
textbooks these days, but there's lots of information available. But when you start

437
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:59,510
going and looking for what this information is based upon, it's just, it's not present.

438
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:04,950
Theory, lots, lots and lots of theory going from scripture to what people refer to as

439
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:11,210
science these days. Science is just a word that means knowledge. It kind of is a pet peeve,

440
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:15,630
I suppose, when I hear people talking about science, because that's, that's simply what

441
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:21,290
it is, you know, knowledge. Being aware of it, being aware of something else.

442
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:28,110
It's been turned into an, you know, a faith instead of being natural philosophers. Now we have

443
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:32,710
the priests in the white coat that call themselves scientists or that other people

444
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:41,130
refer to as scientists, or they were, it's just, it's absurd. The, the way that information is

445
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:48,430
communicated, good or bad currently is, is just absurd. And there is so much that is left out.

446
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:55,070
And when, instead of things being discussed, people start insulting people that do not agree

447
00:49:55,070 --> 00:50:02,150
with their beliefs, be them quote unquote scientific, or even if the beliefs are founded

448
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:08,810
on nothing. If you peel away the onion, there's nothing there. And it just, the whole process

449
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:12,750
just brings tears, right? Right. One of those people that's just looked around them and like,

450
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:22,370
this, the way that we exist, we, I'm using very, very lightly, I guess, but referring to,

451
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:27,590
you know, service dwellers and what I've had the occasion and the opportunity to observe,

452
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:38,570
there's three O words in a row, is that it's, it's just, it's, it's absurd. And yet, the absurdity

453
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:47,690
is only referred to in art, it seems, art seems to be where the absurdity at least is reflected

454
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:54,930
in a more accurate manner. But yeah, punk rock and hip hop. Yeah, no, I'm just joking. Yeah.

455
00:50:55,790 --> 00:51:02,310
I'm surprised, man. There's lots of both now. Once upon a time, you could pigeonhole it. But

456
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:08,690
these days, music is one of those things. I'm a musician, for those that are unaware. So it's

457
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:15,670
something that is, it's certainly a passion. It's something that I've done since I was very young.

458
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:25,050
And it's all I've ever really wanted to do, as far as work goes. But it's, it can be used,

459
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:28,590
you know, it's a medium like any other, it can be used properly or improperly, you can impart

460
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:31,590
good information, or bad information.

461
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:36,170
Sonically, yeah, using an instrument, and the voice can be an instrument as well, if you listen

462
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:45,050
to opera. I want to go back to the concept of scripture of perhaps calling it a manual. I

463
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:53,030
Now, whenever you have a benevolent creator of anything, they fit whatever they've created to

464
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:57,350
the end user with a manual, you ever notice, buying something, even a very rudimentary

465
00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:05,170
appliance, like a toaster or hairdryer, you open the package and in what falls out a manual.

466
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:08,890
And you ever notice on these manuals, especially electrical devices,

467
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:15,010
that the first couple of pages are filled with what not to do.

468
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,990
Danger could cause shock, potential injury and death, do not submerge in water,

469
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:27,410
do not write you ever noticed that? Yeah. Yeah, the first few pages are the dotes.

470
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:31,930
Right? Isn't that interesting how it? Yeah, think about that for a moment, folks.

471
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:38,630
And it seems like right now humanity is, they've got a product, let's say a blow dryer,

472
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:43,210
and they've got the manual. They're aware of it, but they don't want to look at it.

473
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:47,030
So what they do is they take the blow dryer, plug it in and dunk it in water.

474
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:54,370
Right? It's discordant to current society. It's, it doesn't, oh, I don't like it. I don't like

475
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:59,450
that. It's like, this is how it's done. I'm not going to do it like this. It's like, well, okay.

476
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:05,870
So it's interesting, what we'll get into is what most of humanity is incorporated in,

477
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:10,910
incorporating their behavior in and their actions and deeds and works are the don'ts

478
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:16,490
in the, in what's called the scripture. Like, for example, I've stated before, there's not

479
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:19,890
one religion on the planet that knows or does anything that's in the text that they

480
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:27,370
allegedly subscribe to. That's a tall statement. But if, if you are, have a faith in one of the

481
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:30,930
main religions, you might find that to be offensive. That's too bad, because you're

482
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:37,410
not pursuing the truth of the matter. And if essentially, if you, on a cursory level,

483
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:40,810
start looking at, let's say, whatever religion you are in the book that is supposedly

484
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:45,070
based on, you'll say that what I just said is not true and you don't see it,

485
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:50,290
because you're reading into it. If you actually sit down and study it, you'll find that you might

486
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:54,030
want to light your hair on fire and run down the street screaming how you've wasted your entire

487
00:53:54,030 --> 00:54:01,430
life following these ridiculous institutions. But anyway, the other thing about, about,

488
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:10,310
is that you'll find that what they are actually partaking in, no matter what religion it is,

489
00:54:10,370 --> 00:54:16,990
is the don'ts in what the book that they allegedly subscribe to are. So when I say nothing,

490
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:21,370
that they don't do anything, that, that, that's a general statement. But to get more specific,

491
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:27,310
most religions are doing things that are in the texts that they allegedly subscribe to,

492
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:31,910
and the things that they're doing are the things that are considered abominable or forbidden.

493
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:42,390
I would say most, most. I would say there are, and albeit a lot of them are just a disguise for

494
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:48,330
something else, but there are, you know, charitable organizations out there. There are people out

495
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:52,930
there feeding people that don't, or don't have the ability to feed themselves, clothing themselves,

496
00:54:53,090 --> 00:55:01,730
you know. There's still good being done, but what is, what is discussed and what is taught, it's,

497
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:05,650
honestly, what is discussed and what is taught, it's kind of amazing that there are still good

498
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:09,610
things being done. Well, the good things that are being done are out of a guilt. Just like,

499
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:14,390
for example, I bring up the example, whether it's good or not, just something that is in your face.

500
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:18,490
After 9-11, you notice how most government officials started wearing these little American

501
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:23,070
flag lapel pins to show how patriotic they were when they were actually in on what was going on

502
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:29,270
prior to it? It's to kind of like cover their guilt. And it's not really, I shouldn't say it

503
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:34,830
that way, because the government, I've never, all governments and all throughout time, current,

504
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:38,510
past, present, any country in the world is the government you deserve, period. There's nothing

505
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:43,550
wrong with it, even though they might just be doing wrong in certain cases. They are there to

506
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:52,390
fit what the society is about. That's all it is. So, yeah, it's like a mirror. You don't put

507
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:57,190
a pink elephant in the mirror and expect to see a green giraffe. You put a pink elephant in the

508
00:55:57,190 --> 00:56:01,570
mirror, you're going to see a pink elephant in the mirror. If you don't like the people that are

509
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:06,690
ruling you, you need to just look at your neighbors and your family and whatever, and you will find

510
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:14,330
that they are identical in nature. So, yeah, that's why if you look at the things about wisdom

511
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:19,690
is don't try to change any of this because you're not. Just set yourself apart from it. It's like if

512
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:25,830
you had a well-paying job working in the sewer or with high tension power lines, do you go in there

513
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:32,610
with a tank top and flip flops and touch everything? Or you go in with protection? Yeah, exactly.

514
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:40,170
So, yeah, you don't want to touch, yeah, because you will be zapped or you will be dirty and stinky

515
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:49,250
and unhealthy. So, that's the other good advice is avoid people that talk about making humanity

516
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:54,470
better and the world a better place. Those people are clueless. They have no clue. They are just,

517
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:59,190
yeah, it's just not good. It sounds good, makes you feel good,

518
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:09,050
but, and here's just another note, folks. This is not about pessimism or things being dark or

519
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:16,090
evil or whatever because you are at the precipice right now of, from an age, from the ages point of

520
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:20,530
view, you know, the 30 seconds or 10 seconds to midnight where things are going to end.

521
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:25,110
The next stage of humanity is going to be so wonderful and so incredible compared to

522
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:32,410
all of the things that have been recorded about humanity, good or bad, that even the worst things

523
00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:37,710
that you've ever imagined done by humans will be nothing, will be considered trivial when you

524
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:41,910
compare it to the benefits and the wonderment and the existence that you're going to have in the

525
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:48,310
future as humanity. So, the most atrocious, horrendous things that have been done by people

526
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:54,190
will be just like peanut shells falling on the floor compared to the wonderful things that you

527
00:57:54,190 --> 00:58:00,130
will be open to. You will fully understand all the misery, the evil, the mayhem, the lying,

528
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:06,390
the deceit, the corruption and you will see that it has its place and why it had to be done the

529
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:14,170
way it was done and in the future, but not now. And we will discuss what's coming in the future

530
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:18,870
because there's only a couple of years left where you can actually discuss it and then

531
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:23,590
those who know what's coming will not be speaking because it's going to be kind of dangerous to do

532
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:33,010
so. So, the reason why is because the closer you get to a point where things are going to go south,

533
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:40,870
let's say, meaning not well, the window dressing and what you're going to be shown in society and

534
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:45,050
in your personal lives is going to be the opposite. Things are going to appear to be getting better

535
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:51,490
and better and better, judicially, economically, academically, let's say, religiously,

536
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:55,830
government-wise, financially, economically, all these things are going to be getting better

537
00:58:55,830 --> 00:59:03,870
and better and better the closer you get to what I call the kill shots. So, it's going to be very

538
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:12,590
difficult to explain to people what's coming next when they're fully engrossed in a real society

539
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:17,610
with real things going on that are getting better. Yeah, they're going to get harsh and we will

540
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:24,930
explain how and why with detail. One example would be of what the future is going to be like

541
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:31,510
in the next decade is if you run into someone who lives in a big mansion and has a very expensive

542
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:37,170
exotic car and fancy jewelry and you say, wow, look how wealthy this guy is and then you find out that

543
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:41,930
it's all borrowed and rented and the person is just one day away from being homeless.

544
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:46,990
Right? People don't want to hear that. They just want to see, wow, look at that expensive house that

545
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:52,750
he has, an expensive car and all that jewelry. There's no way this guy is completely destitute

546
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:58,790
and broke and none of it is really his and that is how humanity, this is what humanity is going

547
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:05,070
into in the next decade. You're going to be exposed to the pinnacle of human society but you are going

548
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:13,410
to be subject to pretty much a condition that's going to last three and a half years that is going

549
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:23,500
to render the entire surface of the planet only with a small remnant of humans left. Right? And

550
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:29,460
the reason why is because most people are unrehabilitatable. You cannot have seven

551
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:34,380
billion people with the mindset that they have right now to go to the next level. You just have,

552
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:39,380
and the remnant that's going to be left, it's not because they're better. Well, only the good

553
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:46,230
people. No, it will be a representative sample. So the reason I'm throwing this in there is

554
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:54,390
because this is part of the subject matter that I found is very interesting and can be conveyed.

555
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:03,370
It's an interesting basis, that's for sure.

556
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:15,930
Yeah, and it's, you can rationally sort out the information, even though it seems irrational when

557
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:21,170
you incorporate the mind and the body because the body likes comfort. And when things are getting

558
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:29,150
better and feel better in society, both personal and social, and when I mean social, I mean

559
01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:36,770
geopolitical and personal and all around, when things are seemingly getting better and better,

560
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:41,810
people don't want to hear that the whole thing's going to crash next week or in a year or three

561
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:46,270
years, or this is how it's going to go down. They don't want to hear that because the body is

562
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:51,110
comfortable and the mind is comfortable. It's housed in this container that is experiencing

563
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:57,370
joy. You're a party pooper, right? So right now, before these things are incorporated into society

564
01:01:57,370 --> 01:02:03,630
and this upward swinging tide comes through, it's kind of interesting to those that have eyes

565
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:09,490
and ears to be aware of what to be aware of. And we will discuss that in detail as well.

566
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:16,680
I'd say that we've already gone into quite a bit of detail.

567
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:21,880
Yeah, so what do you think? What's the time on this? Should we wrap it up or what do you think?

568
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:25,960
I think we've been going for like half an hour, something like that, a little bit longer perhaps.

569
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:30,920
Oh, it seems like hours. Okay, anything else?

570
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:40,500
That much worth of information, certainly. If you would like to get into contact with us,

571
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:48,420
the email is uncommonsenseradio1 at gmail.com. I know that's a mouthful, but you can go to the

572
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:55,860
website uncommonradio.com. www.uncommonradio.com because if you put in uncommon radio as a general

573
01:02:55,860 --> 01:03:04,860
search, we're not near the top of the query result query on that. So www.uncommonradio.com

574
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:12,160
brings you very close to it. And there's a form there you can email directly from the site.

575
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:20,040
The sonic broadcasts that will be forthcoming will be easily available there as well.

576
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:27,840
Okay. We also have a blog done by someone that really thinks the reporting that we've

577
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:32,240
done and the Greek has done is critical and important for others. And it's a blog,

578
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:38,700
Just Greek Speak, I believe. And there's also a Skype setup, which anyone that's interested

579
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:46,800
in joining the Skype. And there's also a chat in the blog. And I don't have that in front of me,

580
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:56,800
but you will find a link to the blog on the Uncommon Radio site. And it's listed as the

581
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:03,880
unofficial blog. And it's not done by myself or Seth, but it's done by someone who has invested

582
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:09,120
quite a bit of time into it and has found that what is being said as being important enough that

583
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:16,780
a blog would have been a good project for them to engage in and invest in that amount of time

584
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:22,880
into it. And I'm very appreciative of them doing that. They have their own way of expressing what

585
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:29,440
has been expressed, which I found to be, I haven't really spent much time on it. I just put it up for

586
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:35,880
everyone else. And there's also a Skype setup as well and a chat there. So I just want to throw

587
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:43,760
that out. Things to look for. We might be more engaging in the future. Yeah, absolutely. And we

588
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:54,260
will respond to emails when opportunity is there. You can get into contact with me directly at

589
01:04:55,400 --> 01:05:02,920
dearredshoesatgmail.com. D-E-A-R-R-E-D-S-H-O-E-S at gmail.com. And that's a relatively quick way

590
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:10,740
to get in contact with me. And yeah, come back. We will be doing this. We're not going to do it

591
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:17,620
scheduled, really. We're going to do it as we have the time and the topics to discuss.

592
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:23,680
Let's say weekly or four times a month or maybe not. You know, roughly the weekly thing seems to

593
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:32,780
be okay, right? Maybe in frequency. Certainly. And we're going to do that. If you'd like to

594
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:40,740
help support the broadcast in any way, you can email us and we'll let you know how to do that

595
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:47,580
as well. Everything is appreciated. I'm glad that there are some people out there that are

596
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:52,220
going to be able to hear these conversations. And I do encourage you to get into contact with us.

597
01:05:52,920 --> 01:06:03,580
We will explain what we can. Yeah. Perfect. Okay. Well, thanks again, Seth and everyone who's

598
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:11,100
listening and hearing as well. Absolutely. See you again soon. Be well and we'll speak to you again

599
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:11,860
in the near future.

600
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:31,940
Bye.
