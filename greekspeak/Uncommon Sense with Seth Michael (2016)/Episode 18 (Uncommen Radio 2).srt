00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,850
Welcome to Uncommon Sense with the Greek and Seth Michael.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,730
How are you doing, Greek?

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,290
Hey, doing great. Welcome, everyone.

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,390
And here we are again. Let's do some more Uncommon Sense.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:14,510
Absolutely.

6
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,690
So, jumping, just kind of jumping right into it,

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:27,250
the Greek shared a communiqué with me, an e-mail that he'd received from a listener

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:33,230
that was, I didn't have the chance to, it was actually about a 26-page document,

9
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,830
and I did not, I've not had a chance to get through all of it,

10
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,970
but what I was able to peruse earlier today while I was drinking some coffee

11
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:53,430
was very interesting and brought up a lot of subjects that we have discussed

12
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,030
in varying depths over the last two or three years.

13
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:05,610
And so I thought that perhaps we could use that, if not as specific bullet points,

14
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:09,790
but as a kind of a springboard into what we'd like to talk about today.

15
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:19,750
And the letter opened with the first few points were having to do with gods, essentially,

16
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:29,610
with the gods and the history behind how they are perceived today

17
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:36,670
and how they are interacted with, I guess would be a way of stating it.

18
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,010
But if I can pull it, I don't have the document right here in front of me.

19
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:44,570
I'm going to pull that up so I can address it specifically.

20
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,310
Sure. Seth, just a quick note.

21
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,770
I'm at the Ustream site, and it seems pretty blank.

22
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,790
In other words, I can't get it to play, and I got a couple of messages.

23
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,550
Are we broadcasting? So maybe it's something to consider.

24
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:06,150
Okay. It says I've got the broadcast going. It says we have six viewers.

25
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:10,590
I just asked in chat to clarify, make sure that it's going out.

26
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:19,150
So if you can hear us, there will be probably 20 to 30-second delay, I imagine, for Ustream.

27
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:26,230
Maybe not quite that pronounced, but we are going to find out.

28
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,050
Is the audio live?

29
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,290
Yep. We're good. Just did a check. We're good.

30
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,190
All right. Wonderful.

31
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,190
So, yeah, this is Uncommon Sense with the Greek and Seth.

32
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,830
You can find the Web page, which is essentially just a business card.

33
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,370
Not really a business card, but a calling card.

34
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,630
And that's at uncommonradio.com.

35
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,690
And, yeah.

36
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,970
Also, Seth, I shared the document with you because it was partially, if not indirectly,

37
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,690
or addressed to you as well, or directly, I guess, somewhat.

38
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,450
And I think it's interesting as a bullet point just to go back to the document that you mentioned

39
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,690
and that there's many things to be discussed every time we get together.

40
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:18,290
I think this might be the third or fourth time, perhaps, sans the technical difficulties we do consider.

41
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,190
This might be maybe number four, perhaps.

42
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:27,610
I just want to throw in that what we're trying to do is a sonic project,

43
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,530
and what makes it uncommon is itself being uncommon.

44
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,070
All right. What does that mean?

45
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:43,750
Well, right now when people are going to any, let's say, labeled, topically labeled forum, institution,

46
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:52,790
or even man or woman for a particular genre of information, they're getting the opposite, or none of it.

47
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,650
If you go to electrical school, you learn nothing about electricity.

48
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,710
You go to divinity school, you learn nothing about the Bible.

49
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,890
You go to medical school, you learn nothing about the body.

50
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,350
You go to science school, you learn nothing about science.

51
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,210
So what's going on, right?

52
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,850
That's, I guess, what I always like to preface as the views here,

53
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:18,649
and also the strangeness about it not being recorded, perhaps.

54
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,730
Bring your own recorder, but this one might be.

55
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:26,270
But I just want to interject this is uncommon, and it's uncommon in itself as well,

56
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,850
because we don't really want to tell anyone anything.

57
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:38,210
We just want to share certain discoveries in a sonic way that maybe might stimulate some thought

58
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,490
or stimulate some perception.

59
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,410
Absolutely, absolutely.

60
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:50,690
I've actually said many times over the last few years that if I have any goal or agenda in this,

61
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,410
other than the fact that I just enjoy the conversation,

62
00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:02,710
if we can get anyone out there listening to think in a way that is just a little bit different

63
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:12,090
or a lot bit different than what is common, then that is something I would, I don't know if take pride in

64
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,850
is the right word, but something that would further my enjoyment of the conversation at the very least.

65
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:20,650
Yeah, it's just a way of being set apart,

66
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,390
and you brought up some of the points that you might want to bring forward on the document.

67
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,710
But before, maybe I want to share something.

68
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,670
I had a chat.

69
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,810
I've been going around, certain people inviting me to have discussion with,

70
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:40,810
and this one person was befuddled in the scriptural text of, I'm going to paraphrase here,

71
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,950
it's not what goes into someone's mouth that defiles them, but what comes out that defiles them.

72
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,610
You've heard of that cliché sort of phrase.

73
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:55,850
And I've brought it up in cliché form because just about any time I've ever heard anything biblical being mentioned,

74
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,810
it's not accurate.

75
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:57,790
Sorry, folks.

76
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,030
And I didn't say everything, but just about everything might as well.

77
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,150
What's interesting about that verse, when you look at it, it doesn't say that at all.

78
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:13,930
The word that's being used to defile is the prefix koinonini.

79
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:20,630
Whenever you see that k-o-i-n prefix or part of a word, it means common.

80
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:29,390
And that's where you have like koine Greek was the lingua franca of the age and things that are, let's say, common,

81
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:35,370
is the k-o-i, either prefix or mid-root part of the word.

82
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,590
And even in Strongstein's Concordance, he says, well, it means common.

83
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,670
It means to defile.

84
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:45,650
But what's interesting, being a concordance, it's not a defining.

85
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,650
Concordance just means what everyone agrees on it meaning.

86
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:55,690
And this agreement actually came from, it's in Matthew, by the way, 1511, I believe.

87
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,430
And this agreement and perception has come from the following verse, which was after this was said,

88
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,870
the Pharisees were very insulted or offended.

89
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:13,190
So it makes more sense, even in context, because someone being a high level priesthood or an entitled class,

90
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:19,150
if they're told that they're common, indirectly or directly, feel offended, where the common man wouldn't.

91
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:27,070
So it's quite interesting when we look at even something as simple as the cliches that are thrown out into society.

92
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:34,430
And what's interesting about this dialogue that I had with this person in chat was they were pondering

93
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,170
how can that be, how can something defile you that way?

94
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,610
And I'm saying you missed the point.

95
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:39,970
It doesn't say defiled.

96
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,590
So now your whole struggle with it is an illusion.

97
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,450
Isn't that interesting?

98
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:56,010
So a parable to that or a comparison would be, you know how they say electricity is like electrons going down a wire?

99
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,810
You know, and everyone kind of agrees on that concordantly.

100
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:06,910
But I'm telling you, I've done so many experiments with a live wire where I've cut the wire with a dustpan in hand and a microscope,

101
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,130
and I still haven't found any electrons flowing.

102
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:16,050
And just such a simple method to test their crap, right?

103
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:23,730
Unfortunately, with certain things that have many layers where you have different conveyance of translation and language,

104
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:32,190
and even within the same tongue you have shock talk, right, a technical language that most people are not privy of,

105
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:39,690
there's a conveyance that creates distortion and changes the meaning so much that now the people are off track.

106
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,610
So I just want to bring up, these are the things we like to discuss.

107
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,010
Would you think that might be another way to describe what we're trying to do?

108
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:50,090
Certainly. Yeah, absolutely.

109
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:59,010
And by the way, I hear a background, maybe a speaker or something on your end,

110
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:07,770
but since we're kind of like brought up one of the first bullet points was the discussion of the gods,

111
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,350
will we bring up any kind of a topic regarding the gods?

112
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:19,210
The first thing that maybe should be evoked in one's mind is that we're talking about formative beings,

113
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:22,010
things that come before, right?

114
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:28,570
Because even in the cliche form, the gods make things or made everything, right?

115
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:33,450
So we're looking at things that are being made. That's what they do.

116
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,290
And what's interesting, just as a common thought, you ever notice when things are being made, they're dirty?

117
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,310
Like if you're machining a whole bunch of metal, even when the product,

118
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,450
even though when you've succeeded, according to specification,

119
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,450
you've got to clean all the cutting fluid and chips off of it.

120
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,210
Right. Absolutely.

121
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,810
Or if you're doing pottery, the pot is finished.

122
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,810
I'm not talking about it being completely fired up and all that,

123
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,450
but when it's finished, there's like clay being slung everywhere and it's kind of messy.

124
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,670
Or, you know, when you're growing stuff in the garden and you pull it out, it's kind of full of dirt.

125
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,750
When you paint a room, it gets cut. You see my point?

126
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:15,170
Oh, yes.

127
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:15,790
Isn't it interesting?

128
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:25,210
Isn't it interesting how when quote-unquote active creation or bringing forth is taking place or has taken place,

129
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,590
there is a certain element that has to be cleaned up?

130
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,330
What's called, let's say, the afterbirth, when a woman bears a child.

131
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,310
First thing they do is start cleaning the baby.

132
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,790
Isn't it interesting? You know, baking a cake.

133
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:48,510
I mean, it's interesting how formative activities in the material world create a situation that needs to be cleaned up.

134
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,230
Think about that.

135
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,270
I think this is kind of the first time we've brought this up.

136
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,530
Boy, we're full of surprises sometimes, but think about that for a moment, folks.

137
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:04,390
Could it be that this epoch of man quote-unquote being created, socially as well,

138
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,750
is going to render some form of cleaning in the near future?

139
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,870
Just think about it.

140
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,770
You know, when we think about these formative actions in the material sense.

141
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,670
Absolutely.

142
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,710
Do you see how much discussion?

143
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:25,810
I managed to pull it all up.

144
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,590
I need to roll with that.

145
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:35,450
There was one thing immediately that came to mind when I was reading this.

146
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,810
I'm just going to read the first paragraph here.

147
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,350
We want to keep it anonymous as well.

148
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,610
Yeah, absolutely.

149
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,970
You can just do it loosely.

150
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:48,710
Yeah, that's fine.

151
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:59,930
Okay, this is basically the question of the gods and the many myriad interdimensional beings that share our world, if not our dimension.

152
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,890
As someone who has had the occasional paranormal experience, I know that, et cetera.

153
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:12,750
So what immediately came to mind is the concept and the terms dimension and interdimensional.

154
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:21,410
While being useful perhaps for thinking about things is really not an accurate way of describing it,

155
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:29,230
because such things exist in dimension is just space.

156
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,090
There's only one dimension.

157
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:32,630
Exactly.

158
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,010
You have the seen and the unseen, the tangible and the intangible.

159
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,210
Right.

160
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:45,890
So it's a way of describing what is present but unseen or what is present but it's intangible, intangible.

161
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:55,690
The very purpose of such a condition existing has brought forth the necessity of communication and memorialization.

162
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:03,230
It's no different than having your great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather's diary.

163
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:09,490
The reason why I said great-great-great-great-great-great is because he's almost physically immaterial at this point.

164
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:14,530
Because if he's just your great-grandfather, some people might want to just want to dig him up anyway.

165
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:15,470
Right.

166
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:22,970
But I mean like someone that you had found you had interest in that lived so long that they don't exist in the material sense at all.

167
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,490
The only thing that's left is a good memorialized communication.

168
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:36,990
Even in the pagan sense or in the, when I say pagan meaning let's say a lower level sense, they're always trying to do what?

169
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:37,710
Communicate.

170
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,270
Right.

171
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:45,990
Some form of communication or even in the non-pagan way when you get to the more informed way of how the world works, there's still a communication.

172
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:50,210
It's called prayer or manifesting certain actions that show yourself.

173
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:50,530
Right.

174
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,390
Absolutely.

175
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,670
So it's all about communication.

176
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:02,650
And that's how it works with electricity as well and other things that are not tangible until they become tangible.

177
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:08,150
Electricity for the most part is unseen other than its results if it's being done correctly.

178
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,230
Yeah.

179
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:17,190
You don't see the electrons doing what they say they do.

180
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:23,490
And as a matter of fact, what do you think people are going to do when they discover there's no such thing as an electron, not even close?

181
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,130
It's going to be interesting.

182
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,190
I always like to, if you want to learn about this field, by the way, this is not a diversion.

183
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:36,670
This is to make a point about electricity in your conventional institutions.

184
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:40,470
It doesn't matter if they're Ivy League or eighth grade.

185
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:46,990
Well, let's say in universities, there's two places where you learn about electricity.

186
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,250
One is the physics department.

187
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,010
The other is the electrical engineering department.

188
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,810
They usually cross the street of each other.

189
00:14:52,810 --> 00:15:01,090
If you go to the electrical engineering department, they focus on the positive part of the pole as in electricity being a positive negative phenomenon.

190
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,870
And the ground, the negative is sent to ground as common ground.

191
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,590
So you could put a plus one on the electrical engineering building.

192
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:15,950
If you go across the street to the physics building, they focus on the negative polar phenomenon of electricity.

193
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,830
And the positive is just marked as positive or source.

194
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:24,550
So you could put a negative one on the physics building.

195
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:33,610
So when you go to university, any university, what you're going to learn about electricity is what you get when you put minus one and plus one together.

196
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,050
Seth, what do we get?

197
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,250
Minus one and plus one together, that's nothing.

198
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:39,870
You got it.

199
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,550
And that's what exactly what you're going to get at university when you go to study electricity.

200
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,890
Plug it into the wall.

201
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:49,110
Yeah.

202
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:49,970
Plug it into the wall.

203
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,850
Don't ask questions.

204
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,730
I had once an academic.

205
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:58,790
I was trying to explain that an electrical generator doesn't generate electricity any more than a water pump generates water.

206
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,670
You know what he actually said?

207
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,510
This is a guy with tenure now.

208
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:06,950
This is a guy that your children, people who are out there are spending tens of thousands, right?

209
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,770
You're being mocked.

210
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,830
But anyway, he said there's no such thing as energy.

211
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,430
It's electrons moving down the wire.

212
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,490
You know, it's like it's such a cosmic joke.

213
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:28,660
I think when the gods want to play a joke on humanity, they they they get the most elevated people, the most in any field.

214
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,930
And they place a total idiot or complete moron in that field.

215
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,830
Whether regardless of what field, the least the money is.

216
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,590
Yes, exactly.

217
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,970
And just to prove how blind.

218
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,430
And how undiscerning the people are.

219
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,050
They go along with it.

220
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,870
And there was an interesting story about the emperor has no clothes.

221
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,510
And it was a child that pointed it out, isn't it?

222
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,450
Absolutely.

223
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,210
They're OK.

224
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:07,670
So dimensions would the encountering of apparitions and the like mean that we've encountered one of these gods?

225
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,690
Not necessarily.

226
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:16,450
What's interesting about the gods is you really don't know unless you're well informed and communicating.

227
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,349
There's something written about testing them.

228
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:25,530
Are you of such or you of the other or you of this or you of that?

229
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,329
Absolutely.

230
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:37,950
Well, and there's the whole part, the rest of the hierarchy as well, even those entities that are nonphysical, at least in the sense that we think of.

231
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:48,430
And the commonplace physical that are, you know, in any sort of hierarchical organization that we have reference to on Earth.

232
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,770
It's not just, you know, one tier.

233
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:51,650
There are several tiers.

234
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:58,950
So there's the lower, the lower beings, the imps, spirits that would be called demons.

235
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:06,310
Colloquially, I don't I don't like using that word because the connotation that we have with it in English is just inaccurate.

236
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:13,150
It comes from the Latin, you know, Damon, which is just a word for spirit.

237
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:19,730
The plural is one that we have through through tradition.

238
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,110
We have demonized the word, as it were.

239
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:28,070
So, you know, by the way, I was on a discussion recently.

240
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:33,070
It was actually a public one that was on air, and there were maybe half a dozen people there.

241
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:39,090
And they all admitted with their own volition that knowledge and information has nothing to do with anything.

242
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,510
It's your intent.

243
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:53,810
Could you believe I just wanted to bring this in here because this discussion gets very touchy because how many people say I don't believe that I am quite happy with what I believe.

244
00:18:53,810 --> 00:19:04,610
And there's one thing to be able to drag out something tangible and material post discussion to confirm or provide as evidence.

245
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:09,190
But you're not going to necessarily pull a God out of your hat to show someone.

246
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,050
You know what I mean?

247
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:10,550
Right.

248
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:22,330
So they've taken the high ground regarding really any topic that information and knowledge has nothing to do with anything.

249
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,130
It's strictly what your intent or belief is.

250
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:28,770
This is how people are rolling in public, folks.

251
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:40,690
Oh, there are people making making thousands and tens and thousands and hundreds thousands of dollars getting up in front of large groups and telling people that very thing.

252
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:47,690
The other comment was when I brought up some things that anyone could access, you know, the soul, the spirit, reincarnation, things like that.

253
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:50,650
They didn't want to acknowledge what was being said.

254
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,970
They just wanted to acknowledge that.

255
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,530
How can all these people be fooled?

256
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:58,850
The reason why we say it is this way, because all these other people are saying it.

257
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,790
Right. Right.

258
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,810
And and again, like in terms of the alternative media, it's the same thing.

259
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,230
Have you ever noticed TV ads?

260
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,110
Millions have been sold.

261
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:08,950
Everyone's like, oh, good.

262
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,010
They sold millions of them.

263
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,430
You know, must be good because everybody's buying into it.

264
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,670
It's kind of like another analogy.

265
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:19,150
I went to this or natural store.

266
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:24,010
I wanted to get some spray on an insect repellent for some people complaining about bugs.

267
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,230
And of course, it's the way they eat that the bug anyway.

268
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:29,810
So I asked the lady, you know, where the insect repellent is.

269
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:33,190
And she can she please guide me through because I didn't want to sit there and read everything.

270
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,890
And she goes, this is the one that everybody buys.

271
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,790
And I said, oh, I don't want that one, then.

272
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,810
And she goes, what do you mean?

273
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,310
I said, have you met everybody yet?

274
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,370
And have you met the general people?

275
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,210
Do you are you paying attention who your customers are?

276
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,110
I don't want what they want.

277
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,110
I want something more set apart.

278
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,770
You see, I want something just because everyone is getting it.

279
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:54,930
You see the point here?

280
00:20:55,310 --> 00:21:03,150
I immediately reject it based on statistical information, not because what everyone wants may not be good.

281
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,370
Because everyone wants to breathe air.

282
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,290
I'm not going to say I'll breathe water instead.

283
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,130
Right, right.

284
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:12,050
But but categorically, it's pretty safe to reject it if the public has accepted it.

285
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,590
And even the private, in many cases, it's pretty safe.

286
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,970
But you have to discern it again.

287
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,390
You see.

288
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:27,430
What brings them these apparitions referred to to our our realm?

289
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:34,310
A magical call, a personal visit of their own accord with an agenda.

290
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,130
And I would again.

291
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:37,970
That's that's the whole question.

292
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:46,410
But I would say the idea of bringing them to our realm is sort of a miscommunication or a misnomer.

293
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,850
There's several problems with that.

294
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:52,510
We're simply because what evidence does anyone have that it's our realm?

295
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,710
But that's the language that man will develop.

296
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,650
This is not a criticism on who wrote it at all.

297
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,890
This is typical.

298
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:02,370
I mean.

299
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,570
Yeah, absolutely.

300
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,350
And if if the author is listening, please don't don't take it as that.

301
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,390
This is just the way that we address language.

302
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:18,770
Well, that's why I would suggest maybe just being not adhering to the to the literal message, but just the general gist of it.

303
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:29,230
Because there's so much even even with a wheel that's like loose and wobbly and semi-flat, you'll still get to where you're going is the point.

304
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:31,790
OK, so let me rephrase this question, then.

305
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:39,450
What what would cause these nonphysical entities to interact with us on a personal level?

306
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:42,550
Nothing and everything.

307
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,030
It's not up to us.

308
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:49,070
And these a lot of these interesting aspects are well worth thinking about.

309
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:55,170
But a lot of the let's say what might seem more mechanical or technical aspects with interacting with the gods.

310
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,230
Sorry, folks.

311
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:56,990
I hate to say it.

312
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,370
But you lack the maturity to do so.

313
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:06,450
We're talking about beings that have relatively, you know, using the colloquial term IQ of two million plus.

314
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,990
Even their their most simplest communication.

315
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,290
They don't they don't do anything in futility, by the way.

316
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:19,270
They're any anything that even man sees as being befuddled by is their baby talk.

317
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,430
We are given enough information about the gods.

318
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:26,670
And this is a general brush statement, which is fairly accurate.

319
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:33,730
We are given information about the gods and evidence of them for some simple reasons, such as you.

320
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,830
You don't have to wonder.

321
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,110
Right. And also, you've been told certain things.

322
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,790
Right. So you're without excuse.

323
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:48,510
And also given where we're made privy of the gods and their ways.

324
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:52,930
So we can actually have an advantage over those who don't.

325
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,210
When I say we, it's whoever we is.

326
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:59,390
And that goes both for doing harm and for doing good.

327
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:03,650
Typically, the human element.

328
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:15,490
This might be a little off the question that wants to manifest a lot of the things that the gods are instructing or capable of giving are doing it from a level and purposes just about across the board.

329
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,370
The benevolent side of it.

330
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:25,950
If you look at the benevolent side of these communications, it basically tells you to set yourself apart and do nothing.

331
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,850
Sorry. You know, in other words, within the group at large.

332
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:37,890
Right. The benevolent side seems to be ever present.

333
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:41,850
Not something that has to be coaxed.

334
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:42,870
Worked.

335
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,610
Yeah. Like doesn't have to. Yeah.

336
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,150
Yeah.

337
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:52,770
Yeah. The actual all the religions of the world.

338
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,170
All of them. All of them.

339
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:54,930
Should we say it again?

340
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:56,090
All of them.

341
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,910
All of every denomination of every religion.

342
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,090
Is one hundred and fifty percent malevolent.

343
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,790
Why did I say one hundred and fifty percent?

344
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:14,230
Because one hundred percent for the exacting fact and truth about them and fifty percent thrown in for what they're going to do tomorrow or the next day, which we don't know yet.

345
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,810
But that's pretty easy to see with a little bit of discernment.

346
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:24,530
And when I say easy, meaning all you got to do is look at what something is based on.

347
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:25,730
Period.

348
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:40,410
Does it matter if it's a religion, if it's money, if it's a story that's supposed to be about something that successively physically accessible about a communication, if it's baseless, unfounded or fiat.

349
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,670
Oh, they're fixing on doing something that ain't very good.

350
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,850
And the only way. Yeah.

351
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:52,910
The only way you could succeed with fixing on doing something bad.

352
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,290
Let's keep it simple.

353
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,170
As always, by presenting it as something as being good.

354
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:01,530
Absolutely.

355
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:05,930
With fail safes, with fail safes built in like plausible deniability, all this other stuff.

356
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:07,670
Very simple.

357
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:09,190
You know.

358
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:09,890
Yeah.

359
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,050
Question.

360
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:25,010
I'm not going to read it anymore, but the question comes up on the word deities and referring to these entities as the specifically the gods and that deities just comes from Dios or.

361
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,450
Or dual.

362
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,230
Yeah.

363
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:38,810
And that's just one of the words that English translates into the word God or God's deities.

364
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,070
You know, plural would be gods.

365
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:46,830
The phrase adios in Spanish comes to mind.

366
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:57,910
Well, what's interesting about this is we've said publicly years ago, Seth, when I say years more than two or three, perhaps.

367
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:07,990
That the society at large, every culture and all people will have this urge to gain.

368
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:15,630
Interest in this realm, the realm of the gods and spiritual things, let's say, of the mind.

369
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:22,330
But you're going to see an increased discussion as a product of the interest.

370
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:30,670
It'll be, you know, the everyday discussion all the way to Hollywood to literary art, whatever government.

371
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:41,950
But one thing we discussed years ago is opposing or within this interest, let's say, is the lack of still the lack of clarity and accuracy.

372
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,370
But that's not the important part.

373
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,890
The important part is that there is a focus on that topic or this topic.

374
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:59,970
We brought this up years ago and we could see now how more people are catching on to whether it's the large institutions or just the man on the street or woman on the street.

375
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:08,170
There's an interest in this subject, but all in all, it'll be very still inaccurate and misplaced.

376
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:18,010
And that's pretty easy to discuss why when you actually look about what's written about this time and what's called prophecies and things like that.

377
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,710
So, yeah, I just want to bring that up as well.

378
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,790
So this is sort of concordant with the times what we're discussing right now.

379
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:36,530
Absolutely. And in these deities and gods have been referred to in many different ways throughout history and where they are referred to.

380
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:41,810
A lot of it is considered myth in the Western world.

381
00:28:41,990 --> 00:29:04,810
You know, we are taught that it is simply allegory and ways that what we see is primitive man describing a natural process or natural processes that are would be otherwise indescribable to these primitive minds.

382
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:10,930
Which is not an accurate way of being facetious.

383
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,590
But, well, yeah.

384
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:17,590
And the irony of it is they're calling electrons after Electra anyway, which is mythological.

385
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,390
So it's in line.

386
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,050
So, right.

387
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:19,710
Absolutely.

388
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:29,810
I've through my studies, I've come to look at most mythology as simply just a history that's been relatively obscured through language.

389
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:43,810
One example that you shared with me probably more than a couple of years ago was the instances in myths where you will hear people being turned to pigs.

390
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:59,170
And the connotation there is actually cannibalism where you see read in a myth or a story or history of like a group of people being turned into pigs.

391
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:05,510
It very it most likely means that they were slaughtered and consumed.

392
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:13,990
And what's what's interesting about that is that let's say you brought up the myths.

393
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:19,950
Right. And we look at, you know, what's being handed to us served on a plate about the myths.

394
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:25,610
And we start researching, let's say, the literary origins, how these stories have been preserved.

395
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,570
Because if it's just oral, I mean, you can only go back to whoever is alive.

396
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:35,410
But if it's literary and written, you start looking at how many hands it's changed and the studies that have been done through the years.

397
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:47,570
And you find that there's some research being done where some of these demagogues and especially through what's called the age of heroes before the dynastic reigns of Egypt, for example.

398
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:52,830
You will find that these were kings or personalities that were deified as well.

399
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,270
And it's still being done today.

400
00:30:55,270 --> 00:31:00,670
That's why you have something called idolization of musicians and film stars.

401
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:07,770
I mean, you know, they even have what, American show or, you know, Elvis has left the building or something.

402
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:10,610
You know how this is idolization. This has been going on for a very long time.

403
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,970
I mean, could you imagine if there was another four or five hundred or a thousand years?

404
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:28,410
Isn't it possible that the very existence of a man called Elvis Presley walking the earth can be twisted and turned into a demagogue and some mythological figure who rained lightning down from a microphone or something?

405
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,450
Most certainly.

406
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:30,650
Yeah.

407
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:31,130
Most certainly.

408
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:31,970
Yeah.

409
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,650
If you believe that there are electrons running down wires, you'll believe anything.

410
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,750
Anyway, would I just say that?

411
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:35,990
Okay.

412
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:36,910
Yeah.

413
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:39,710
And if you'll.

414
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:48,930
The apotheosis of George Washington is a painting inside of one of the Capitol domes that comes to mind anytime.

415
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:50,350
Oh, yeah.

416
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,710
What's next after that?

417
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,770
A hologram of him?

418
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,110
You know, what's that?

419
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,930
And then after the hologram, what are they going to do?

420
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,090
Put some glue and meat and metal together?

421
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:00,250
You know, this is how humans roll.

422
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:10,850
Speaking of a hologram, that is another concept that is brought up in the email.

423
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:18,270
The question of whether we exist in a holographic simulation.

424
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:28,690
The holographic, you know, coming from the words, the hologram or holograph, hollow being the whole, like as in.

425
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:29,830
Holistic.

426
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:30,530
Yeah.

427
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:36,590
And, you know, gram or graph being image, the whole picture.

428
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,830
So in one way, yes.

429
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,830
And simulation.

430
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:46,950
Well, you know, what we are experiencing, I would say, is is real colloquially.

431
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:59,330
But at the same time, whether or not it's a colloquial holographic simulation would be completely and totally based upon your perspective and where you were seeing it from.

432
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:11,590
Because, you know, to my experience in my, you know, my mind or spirit and the observations that I've I've made, it's very real.

433
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:24,910
But at the same time, looking if I had, you know, I was looking at it from a higher perspective, be that of number of years or literal, you know, just height.

434
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,270
That that could be considered differently.

435
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:40,910
You know, the question, you know, the Matrix films always come to mind when people talk about that, because that's the main premise is a simulation within a simulation almost.

436
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:49,810
And so looking at the word hologram or holograph like we did, we look at the word Matrix and that word is just womb.

437
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,350
That's that's what that means.

438
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,150
You know, formative, a formative place.

439
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:54,530
Right.

440
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:17,850
So the Hollywood of the mind and how such motion pictures and all media affects the way that we think and bleeds over into the way that we color in things that we don't comprehend completely is is very interesting.

441
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:24,130
And it's can be difficult to kind of separate thought from the images that have been pumped into our minds.

442
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:38,489
But it's I think that that's an important thing to do, especially with studying these things, because the things that we're talking about, you know, any of the scriptures and stuff like that, what is presented through any form of media, even in discussion about it's inaccurate.

443
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:51,409
So, of course, the the images and the stories that are reproduced from these poor versions are lacking in in any sense of veracity.

444
00:34:52,449 --> 00:35:00,250
Yeah, there's there's an objectivity also that you could lay out all the pieces and to say that it's a hologram is lacking.

445
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:08,110
But if from certain respects where, you know, there's an empirical and ephemeral, you know, the part that can't change and the part that can change.

446
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:11,790
And we're told that anything can change by the formative forces.

447
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:26,850
So from that aspect, maybe and from another aspect, what's interesting about a hologram is that if you were to tear a hologram up into smaller pieces, the entire images in each small piece can still part of it is preserved.

448
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:31,050
Right. If you hold it on just the right angle, you still see the whole picture in every fragment.

449
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,750
So there's a fractal nature to it.

450
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:41,010
But I believe that using that term can be applicable, but it's it's heavily discounting what can be perceived.

451
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:45,450
And just to throw this out very often, I've said, well, I'm not going to discuss certain things.

452
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:49,870
I'll just throw things out just to satisfy some curiosity.

453
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:55,170
And you just spin off and people could look at it at themselves.

454
00:35:55,170 --> 00:36:03,230
There is a subject of the intangible, not only about the gods, but also like we keep bringing up the nature of electricity.

455
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:09,090
Well, what's interesting about electricity, for example, what we call electricity or this manifestation.

456
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:14,410
Rudolf Steiner wrote something about counter space during the early development of electrical engineering.

457
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:20,590
And which was also this thing called counter space is a space that's counter to space.

458
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:27,710
So in other words, when you're in counter space, space seems to appear solid, but material seems to be space.

459
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:33,750
When you're in a material world, the material is solid and the space is just, well, space.

460
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:39,790
The interaction between these two spaces. And they're both quite physical, by the way.

461
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:47,650
And don't it's really difficult to imagine the properties of counter space because you have to be able to turn your mind inside out like a sock.

462
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:57,250
But but either way, because we're very materialistic, the concept of counter space has to be understood before you can actually work with electricity and engineer things.

463
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:02,530
Before you find out that you made something so big, it tends to you can't shut it off or it explodes.

464
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:10,250
Right. And Charles Proteus Steinmetz is one of the most intelligent engineers that ever lived.

465
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:13,570
Or I should use that word intelligent, most diligent and fruitful.

466
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:20,330
I was now hidden in history, by the way. Einstein wouldn't be worth tying his shoelaces.

467
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:29,130
Pretty much came up with the concept of the square root of minus one, which is another concept.

468
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:39,990
I mean, not not with the concept of square root of minus one, but to apply it to discerning how we manage counter space manifestations into space, i.e. electricity.

469
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:46,350
So I just want to throw that in there because the concept of a hologram is very easily received.

470
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:55,910
But what really is going on, as evidenced by electrical fields and magnetic fields and other things like that, is far more different, not complex.

471
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:01,070
Because you can't use eighth grade math to rationalize anything. It's not worth rationalizing, really.

472
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:07,910
So there are many aspects of this physical world that evidence, a nonphysical world that predominates in many instances.

473
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:15,830
So I do like the analogy of the hologram, but it's an oversimplification like Le Bon.

474
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:23,170
Gustav Le Bon wrote in his crowd that now has gotten it away from the meaning so it could be easily accepted.

475
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:31,550
So I don't know if we cleared anything up or not for anyone, but there's a discussion.

476
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:45,130
I think that one of these programs in the in the near or distant future, we may open to Collins through Skype because that's the easiest way to do it.

477
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:52,290
But I've done that a lot, and that's not what I'm trying to do with our conversations here.

478
00:38:52,430 --> 00:39:01,190
But I know that there are people out there that would like to join us perhaps for a little while in discussion.

479
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:06,470
And that came to mind, so I thought that I would speak it.

480
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:13,210
Oh, clearly. Yeah, I do like the input of any kind as well.

481
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:24,070
Absolutely, Ed. The website Uncommonradio.com does have an email address listed there that you can send us any sort of communication that you would like.

482
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,530
UncommonSenseRadio1 at Gmail.

483
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:33,150
That's right. UncommonSenseRadio1 at Gmail.com.

484
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,450
Numeric one.

485
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:54,430
Another thing that is brought up that is certainly in line with the discussion is the concept of external input as dealing with thought, actually.

486
00:39:54,430 --> 00:40:04,690
With the brain as a receiver and a transmitter, not just a closed system, as it were.

487
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:20,350
And we are, you know, humans are kind of built like trees upside down with our roots, you know, the myriad of nerves, as they call them, and whatnot that make up the brain.

488
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:20,710
Root ball.

489
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,270
Yeah.

490
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:28,250
So we're kind of like upside down trees, our limbs, you know, our legs and our arms.

491
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:35,770
And so this concept of, you know, where do thoughts come from?

492
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:48,470
Some of the obvious things that I think are often missed because they're not really addressed is the super form of those,

493
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:55,530
like communication, listening to people speak, you know, words, television, images.

494
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:03,830
These things cause us to think in ways that we would not perhaps think if we were not subjected to them.

495
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:23,010
But beyond that, I think what is being referenced in the question and bringing it up is the more certainly our physical but intangible inputs that are received.

496
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,710
So where do thoughts come from?

497
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:32,910
Well, in order to process the thoughts and the input, also you need an operating system.

498
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:39,130
I like to give that plain example and that mankind is very different.

499
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,330
And we're not animals in that respect.

500
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:50,210
And I always give the analogy of a dog, a very young puppy being raised by a family of gorillas and adopted as an adult dog would act just like a regular dog.

501
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:57,390
You would not be able to discern that it was raised by apes, where if a very, very young child was raised to adulthood by apes, guess what?

502
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,030
It'll be very easy to discern that they were right.

503
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,530
Anyway, I've been in public lately and I've seen what, but anyway, that's another discussion.

504
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:16,790
So the concept of the operating system and the thought being the program or the file, let's say, being run.

505
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:24,370
But again, going back to the upside-down plant, this is an ethereal, primal, formative energy approach.

506
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:32,310
And maybe discussing the nature of plants might be something that can be used allegorically or metaphorically,

507
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:43,610
simply because it's a very interesting analogy to say that maybe the human body ethereally or formatively, archetypally, is an upside-down plant,

508
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:50,210
the brain being the root ball, the limbs are well the limbs, and where the seed is and the flower are the sexual organs.

509
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,130
So what's interesting about that is what do you know about plants?

510
00:42:55,250 --> 00:43:01,870
And just to give a discussion I had with a university dendrochronology department, dendro meaning tree, chronology meaning time,

511
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:08,010
it's actually the number two or number one lab in the world, and they wanted to discuss trees.

512
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:14,730
And I said, well, you guys are really into trees and it doesn't seem like you do a lot of describing but no explanation.

513
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:22,190
And I said, well, I'm not going to ask you, in my mind I'm thinking I'm going to ask these dummies what a tree is.

514
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,810
These are like high-level university people.

515
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:31,870
So I figured instead of berating them like I do on radio in person, what I did was I said,

516
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:36,210
well, listen, if you could explain to me how one blade of grass grows,

517
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:42,850
I'd be glad to spend the time that you're asking me with you to look at what you want to present.

518
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:45,710
And they all went, mom, they all just looked at me.

519
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,830
You know, like, can't do that.

520
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:50,050
Yes.

521
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:50,310
See?

522
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:51,450
Absolutely.

523
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,150
They can't even explain how one blade of grass grows.

524
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:57,510
They could describe the how, but the why.

525
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,850
Why does one blade of grass grow?

526
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:00,530
Yeah.

527
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:05,230
Now, you can't fault them for their ignorance, but you can, you should, because they're bleeding,

528
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:09,090
they're parasitical on society at this point, but yes, they are parasitical.

529
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:15,790
And if you want to know what I mean by that, look up the word parasite and predatory on the people,

530
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,430
which I find disgusting.

531
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:20,110
I'm not saying that they shouldn't exist.

532
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:23,250
Places of higher learning should exist by all means.

533
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:26,350
We just actually said that we require that as a species.

534
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:33,170
But the current condition is ugly, to say the least.

535
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,150
Those are the good words.

536
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:36,170
I'll tell you what I really think of them.

537
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:46,590
But in a sense, the aspect of approaching them with even an archetype or a parallel

538
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:50,750
or anything that might be comparative is completely rejected and refused.

539
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,350
Of course, you know, they're running a religion.

540
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:53,910
I think we've discussed this before.

541
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:55,990
Something that they want people to do.

542
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:57,610
When I say religion, I mean it loosely.

543
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:04,030
You know, if you approach any of these people that supposedly hold knowledge in society today

544
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:07,970
and you refuse to bow at their altar, you are quickly shown the door.

545
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:12,750
Or if you're wise enough, if you realize there's an altar that they want you to bow to,

546
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:17,530
why hang around and wait for them to hit you in the knees with a baseball bat so you do bow down,

547
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:20,850
just go for the door while you can still walk.

548
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:27,850
So in essence, a lot of the things that we like to say are not because this is how they are so,

549
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:33,090
but it's like why isn't anyone looking at these simple things, at least for the young ones,

550
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:37,430
the young people that we know are so impressionable, you see.

551
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:44,830
So the concept of looking at the mind, looking at the body, and the plant as being an archetype

552
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:49,050
is quite interesting in itself, which by the way, Seth, we could dedicate the next four hours

553
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,010
on just that discussion.

554
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:51,230
We may not want to do that.

555
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:57,870
But the concept of being eluded and being distracted by change,

556
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:05,910
in other words, when we discuss things, we take a slice of things that change, right?

557
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,010
Like a photograph, right?

558
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:13,830
Or when you go to learn about something, a machine, or you're looking about how a car works,

559
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:15,110
you look at a piston.

560
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,390
That's not the piston in action.

561
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:19,310
It's a slice of it, and it does change as it wears out,

562
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:22,730
and it did have material had to go through change to form a piston.

563
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:30,250
But I mean that we have gone away from actually being objective about these slices in time,

564
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:34,210
how things do change, and we figure because they do change,

565
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,290
and how they change, we grade them on their significance.

566
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:42,950
So if we look at elements of change and take a slice of reality,

567
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:45,290
like in a still photograph of something moving,

568
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:50,370
if you were to study the dendric nature or the branches of a tree

569
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,830
or the root system of a tree as it spreads through soil,

570
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:55,450
typically not a root ball now, but the actual spreading out,

571
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:59,830
or the capillaries of your eye, or a lightning bolt,

572
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:02,910
which is, I guess, described as a Lichtenfield or Lichtenberg pattern,

573
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:09,070
or high-voltage sparks, photograph of a high-voltage emission,

574
00:47:09,550 --> 00:47:12,230
you'll notice they all share the same geometric forms.

575
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:14,330
You see?

576
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:16,850
So there's an underlying archetype.

577
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:20,750
Now, if you want to say that it's just random, that's fine.

578
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:23,630
But how can something be judged so random,

579
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:26,510
and ha, ha, ha, oh, isn't it funny how it's similar,

580
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,790
and not be observed with scrutiny?

581
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:30,230
You see my point?

582
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,190
This is what the academics have failed.

583
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:35,930
And they will not, by the way, in your society currently.

584
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:39,970
You will never get the truth or anything tangible,

585
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:43,690
a tangible explanation out of the academia in this society.

586
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:45,710
The next society will, quite clearly,

587
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:50,990
because if you didn't, there would be no reason to end this society

588
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:53,090
and start another one, or a continuance of it.

589
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:57,250
So the interesting part here is just a real simple way to sum it up.

590
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:01,390
If you look at a high-discharge, a high-voltage emission through gas,

591
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:03,030
or even across a piece of solid,

592
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:06,870
what we call a lightning strike or a high-voltage discharge,

593
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:09,590
look at how similar it is to the capillaries in your eye,

594
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:14,470
or the roots or branches of a tree, you see.

595
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:16,610
And that's a good place to start.

596
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:19,290
And we're talking about not the change,

597
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:23,610
because, well, Greek, how can you say a tree that takes 300 years to grow

598
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:26,450
is the same as a lightning bolt which flashes in a tenth of a second,

599
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,430
or a second or so?

600
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:28,890
Not saying that.

601
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:32,770
What I prefaced earlier is that because we've been deluded

602
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:35,270
by the nature of things changing, we don't see the similarity,

603
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:38,550
but we have the ability to take a slice and freeze frame

604
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,390
of all these things and show how they're all the same.

605
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:46,270
So this is partly the study of how formative things work.

606
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,570
And believe it or not, this is a discussion for the gods.

607
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:53,770
If you're discussing this with people who are completely descended,

608
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:56,130
have descended into materialism,

609
00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:00,670
they will quickly shift into how things change

610
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:03,430
and show that as the irrelevant point.

611
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:08,770
Again, how can a 300-year-old tree have anything similar

612
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:10,990
with a tenth of a second lightning strike?

613
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:14,230
Where if you're to eliminate the delusion of change

614
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:17,430
or what emphasis you've put on the rate of change

615
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:20,430
and looked at a freeze frame of it, you would see they're almost identical

616
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:22,450
in archetype form.

617
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:24,130
In other words, there's a pattern.

618
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:26,930
And this pattern is behind everything.

619
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:29,610
And not only is this pattern behind everything,

620
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:32,810
it's behind things you don't see and perceive.

621
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:36,230
And it's being used over and over and over

622
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:37,670
at different rates of change.

623
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:40,550
It works really, really well.

624
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:41,950
Yes.

625
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:48,250
And this is the foundation of all discernment, by the way.

626
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:55,450
In other words, if someone's screaming hateful stuff at you

627
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:58,250
for three seconds or 30 hours, what's the difference?

628
00:49:59,010 --> 00:49:59,910
You see?

629
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:03,470
Stop thinking of how long something is being done for,

630
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:04,870
whether it's good or bad or irrelevant.

631
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,830
It's that it's being done, you see.

632
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:17,010
And a practical application that I have, I don't know, adopted

633
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:24,390
just with the considering of where thought comes from

634
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:30,450
is that if you are aware of the similarities between

635
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:34,390
transmission and reception of information

636
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:39,450
and the interaction of the mind with the physical world,

637
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:42,530
if you're, just as an example,

638
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:46,650
if you're watching something on a television

639
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:51,850
and you don't like it or don't want to watch it for whatever reason,

640
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:53,750
you change the channel.

641
00:50:54,970 --> 00:51:00,530
And when you start to have the realization that thoughts are coming in

642
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:04,750
and they're not always beneficial,

643
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:11,750
some of them are very detrimental to the health of one's mind or one's body,

644
00:51:12,790 --> 00:51:19,250
then you realize that you can metaphorically change the channel.

645
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:24,330
It's not always quite that easy or simple,

646
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:29,530
but just having the awareness that it's not all coming from within,

647
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:34,190
that a lot of this is external input and external input that is not tangible.

648
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:43,230
You still have, you know, the brain is a pretty neat organ for the mind

649
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:45,450
and for the spirits to interact with the physical world.

650
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:51,610
And in that, the more that you're aware of how such things work,

651
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:57,190
the mechanics, specifically those that are not widely discussed,

652
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:03,130
it gives one the ability to think better, I guess,

653
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:04,770
or at least differently,

654
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:08,230
and almost the ability to change the channel.

655
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:13,350
The whole process seems to be taken for granted as people do many things.

656
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:17,950
Some of it is just absolutely taken for granted and being insensitive,

657
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:19,330
like the concept of walking.

658
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:23,090
Or once you've got it, you never forget.

659
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:25,430
Once you learn to think, you don't forget.

660
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:27,670
It's kind of like riding a bicycle, right?

661
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:33,070
There's the aspect of the manipulation of the thought,

662
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:37,130
meaning using your hand figuratively of your own thoughts,

663
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:39,570
understanding that they're streaming in and going out.

664
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:42,370
It's difficult because it's just simply taken for granted.

665
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:46,750
Ask a six-month-old why they can't get up and run around the block.

666
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:48,630
Well, it's because they're still crawling on the rug

667
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:50,950
and they're very happy to learn how to stand and walk,

668
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:53,970
or someone who can't ride a bicycle, you see.

669
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:57,150
But once you learn those things, you don't think about them anymore.

670
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:01,770
That's the aspect that's being taken for granted,

671
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:05,410
and the discernment falls apart because of that, let's call it,

672
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,270
emotional or spiritual laziness.

673
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:13,350
On the other hand, the thoughts are simply like Seth was relating on the television.

674
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,710
Right away, my mind went to the psychotronic aspect,

675
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:18,390
but I don't think you were discussing the psychotronics of it,

676
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:20,990
subliminal messages and pulse frequencies and things.

677
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:24,510
You're just discussing the simple suggestion of a thought or concept.

678
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:30,210
Like the television changing the channel is very much the thought process.

679
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:34,750
Again, bringing it forward to the senses would be as if you walked into a café

680
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:39,010
and you're asked what would you like to eat, and you're presented with a menu,

681
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:42,450
and you see chicken sandwich, tuna sandwich, veggie sandwich, salad, soup.

682
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:44,790
That's exactly what all of our thoughts are like,

683
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:49,050
but it happens so quickly, and because we take the process for granted,

684
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:52,570
we've pretty much fallen into this emotional laziness

685
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:58,370
and in this befuddlement and bewilderment state.

686
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:00,130
Absolutely.

687
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:01,530
Yeah.

688
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,150
There's a concept also.

689
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:04,530
The speed of thought.

690
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:06,290
People are instant.

691
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:08,270
We think very quickly,

692
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:14,710
and I would say that it's almost better to think slowly and to consider one's thoughts.

693
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:15,970
Exactly.

694
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,550
Think before you speak.

695
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:20,010
Yes.

696
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:21,890
Absolutely.

697
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:30,410
So the thought aspect, that will be understood more as we get into other things.

698
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:34,110
And by the way, there's a lot of – do we want to preface?

699
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:37,550
There's a field called psychiatry or psychology around this, right?

700
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:38,730
And the PSY means spirit.

701
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,370
You mean study of the spirit?

702
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,230
Yeah, the study of the spirit is what they are.

703
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:47,590
And by the way, folks, anyone who wants to see one of these guys should have their head examined.

704
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:53,230
Anyway, the only purpose these psychos are there, psychiatrists, psychologists,

705
00:54:53,330 --> 00:54:55,290
are there to keep you in check,

706
00:54:55,730 --> 00:55:01,090
because typically when these topics are brought up, it's a threat in modern society.

707
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:05,650
And even back then, if you actually look at it objectively,

708
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:09,390
the field of psychiatry or psychology is generally brought up in common

709
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:12,670
when someone is being threatened by it.

710
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:15,010
So it's actually weaponized spiritualism.

711
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:18,010
Anyway, I just thought I'd throw that in there.

712
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:19,410
Maybe it sounds creative. I don't know.

713
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:25,290
It's like most anything that we come into.

714
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:27,990
It's a system of government.

715
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:35,330
It's a system of a religious organization with tenets and scripture that they follow.

716
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:37,590
It's just a lot of it is very recent.

717
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:44,970
And what's interesting, what's been brought forward in these fields

718
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:50,110
and the people that have been accredited with it, like Freud and Jung and others,

719
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:56,510
if you go and actually study what these people that were accredited with these fields

720
00:55:56,510 --> 00:56:00,110
were actually studying or trying to bring forth,

721
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,950
is not what the field that is using these men's names is doing anyway.

722
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:10,550
Freud started off, for example, with the study of electrical impulses in the body.

723
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:15,910
You notice that when different emotions gave different electrical fields on the skin.

724
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:23,090
So, I mean, it's just bizarre what's being put forward, what these men were about.

725
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:27,090
I mean, obviously they descended into something to be socially acceptable.

726
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:28,510
Look at alternative media.

727
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:31,690
No, I'm good. Thank you.

728
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:35,490
I've seen that. I'm good.

729
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:36,890
Yeah, it's just bizarre.

730
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:43,750
So, again, folks, I mean, Seth, I don't know what we stepped into with this on Common Sense Radio

731
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:52,350
because it's so bizarre, so sublime to discuss reality from an objective point of view.

732
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:56,390
It almost feels like you cannot communicate it effectively.

733
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:59,690
Yeah, well, certainly with difficulty.

734
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:05,770
And with complete accuracy, I'd say at this point in time, it's next to impossible.

735
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:11,690
But with more accuracy than what is common, absolutely.

736
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:14,590
And I think that's what we've stepped into.

737
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:22,110
Yeah, meaning I think that one of the things that mankind or current society across the board has succeeded in

738
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:26,610
is their ability to not communicate and still get some things done.

739
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:29,450
If you think about that for a minute.

740
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:38,110
Yeah, I had no interest in further broadcasting radio or conversations at all

741
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:42,750
until we spoke about doing this together.

742
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:50,190
So, you know, on one level, it's certainly self-serving for me

743
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:56,790
because I find the conversations very edifying, very building and uncommon.

744
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:00,670
These are conversations that are very uncommon.

745
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:03,910
It's an aptly titled broadcast.

746
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:12,370
Something that I did want to jump into just a little bit is health.

747
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:13,930
Health.

748
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:21,970
You know, we spoke last time about a little bit, you know, scratching the surface, as it were, is health.

749
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:27,130
And I had one specific thing I wanted to talk to you about.

750
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:32,050
And I was going to bring it up privately, but it's nothing that needs to remain private.

751
00:58:32,230 --> 00:58:33,350
Just curious.

752
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:40,290
You know, with the seasons changing as they are where I am, you know, on the rock at least,

753
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:46,770
the weather changing can put stress on the body as well as, you know, the foods that we eat

754
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:49,910
and the things that are not food that we eat.

755
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:50,790
Right.

756
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:53,690
Some cheeses, yeah, I found out.

757
00:58:53,790 --> 00:59:05,630
So on a specific level, I'm curious what your input would be on like a swollen or irritated lymph node.

758
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:12,310
Not for myself, but for a friend, because I like to, you know, help people when I can.

759
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:18,490
Well, essentially there's something people could research, especially if you're hearing about us on the computer,

760
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:20,150
lymphology.

761
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:23,550
And you'll notice there's very little about that.

762
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:28,150
And there's more lymph fluid in the body than blood, so it is very important.

763
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:35,750
The lymph fluid somehow has a very interesting way in its presence in all living things.

764
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:42,490
And typically anything that's swollen is a state of expansion, heat, explosiveness.

765
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:45,350
It's not functioning correctly.

766
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:45,990
Right?

767
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:47,270
That would be the simplest thing.

768
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:53,670
So if anyone wants to go and research lymphology, unfortunately there's very little about it,

769
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,830
and most of it was sort of parented.

770
00:59:55,830 --> 01:00:01,470
The study was parented by a fellow in the 50s or 60s under the name of Wood, perhaps, or something.

771
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:06,110
He wrote something called The Golden Whatever Bough, or not The Golden Bough, Golden Mean,

772
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:09,450
or something about lymph system and golden.

773
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:14,730
And he's the only one that I've found online that's published anything or anything prevalent out there.

774
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:21,030
But essentially the lymph fluid is very passive compared to the blood.

775
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:27,690
Swelling through general tissue is when the lymph fluid gets in between interstitial spaces.

776
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:33,170
And part of the simple things of understanding lymphology is it likes compression.

777
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:38,790
That's why if anyone gets a cut or a bruise, your initial reaction is to grab it and squeeze it.

778
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:43,590
Well, what's not really taught is that when there is a cut or an injury to the body,

779
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:49,070
it should be squeezed as much as you can for as long as you can, and then releasing it to let things flow.

780
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:53,370
But if you have a swollen lymph node in an area where you can't do that,

781
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:56,530
typically they're in between joints or under soft parts of the body,

782
01:00:56,810 --> 01:01:03,230
that would indicate something is the body is producing that it shouldn't be producing or is being stimulated to produce.

783
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:04,950
It's behind the jaw.

784
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:10,350
Yeah, that's a typical one for something very local near the head.

785
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:14,430
So it could be a tooth. It could be a sinus. It could be an eye.

786
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:22,310
I've actually seen and experienced myself and through others that just the very nature of working,

787
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:26,870
let's say someone out in the field and gets a splinter in their hand,

788
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:30,970
the lymph node around the elbow or armpit will swell if it's not treated properly.

789
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:38,290
So usually in terms of diagnosis, the best diagnosis is self-diagnosis if one is looking for self-treatment.

790
01:01:38,290 --> 01:01:46,770
But anything lymph like that, typically the most susceptible in the jaw or in that part is the teeth.

791
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:50,990
And there's the teeth or a whole other study.

792
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:58,810
But all of these things need to be looked at from a lymphatic point of view and what the lymph system is about.

793
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:03,170
And, for example, I think the pusture – don't hold me. I'm paraphrasing here.

794
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:05,230
It's been over 25 years since I've looked at it.

795
01:02:05,230 --> 01:02:10,550
But you've heard of how blood testing is done in the medical fields very prevalently?

796
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:11,290
Yes.

797
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:19,010
Well, one of the older institutes in Europe that were quite successful in many of the initial studies and discoveries made,

798
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:23,710
let's say in the 20th century, which are very few, they do lymph testing, lymph fluid.

799
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:29,630
And it's far more accurate and shows more if they know what they're looking at,

800
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:37,730
which is kind of frowned upon discussing the lymph system in the standard medical field.

801
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:40,630
And because it is, I think it should be looked at.

802
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:45,830
But typically something like that is stagnation, right?

803
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:47,370
Any kind of swelling or anything.

804
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:54,390
And if it swells to the point where you notice it and it's discomforting, I would go look up lymphology on that.

805
01:02:54,390 --> 01:03:01,290
But more of a rudimentary aspect, not like the new agey stuff that's going to send you off into a tangent.

806
01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:09,850
But typically, you know, you could judge by the area of where it's at what's the most sensitive.

807
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:12,550
You know, near the mouth is usually the teeth.

808
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:16,750
It could be a reaction. Or it could be dietary, many things.

809
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:23,170
The interesting aspect, again, is these fields have been specialized.

810
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:27,830
I mean, we all have teeth. We all have hair. We all have lymph systems and blood and livers.

811
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:30,490
Why aren't we being taught, right?

812
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:32,810
12,000 hours in school.

813
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:37,550
And you ask anyone who spends 12,000 hours, which in kindergarten and high school, what you learned,

814
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:39,670
and they're like, I don't know, but I'm glad I'm out of there.

815
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:43,310
12,000 hours, folks, come on.

816
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:47,190
If you're not completely disgusted by what's going on, you're not paying attention.

817
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:53,730
So, yeah, this would be maybe a parallel study.

818
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:59,290
And there's more that can be said on it, but I don't know how to say it.

819
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:02,650
How's that about the lymph system?

820
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:03,710
Right on.

821
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:04,730
Yeah.

822
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:05,850
Well, I appreciate it.

823
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:11,050
Now, what about health and nutrition in the broader sense?

824
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:14,950
Kind of diverting away from the e-mail.

825
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:17,010
But that's, like I said, springboard.

826
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:18,270
Yeah.

827
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:21,170
Well, what's wonderful about that is the obvious.

828
01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:29,090
You notice how we're standing on the earth and we rely on agriculture.

829
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:36,870
And you notice how as temperature changes, so does the agriculture and the food stuffs, right?

830
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:37,430
Right.

831
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:43,170
Even if it's fit and proper food or not fit and proper food, the food stuffs change.

832
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:47,230
Like in colder places, things grow differently.

833
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:55,130
You have different types of fruits and veg and animals as well and wildlife and, you know, if you're into eating meat and fish.

834
01:04:55,350 --> 01:05:05,050
Where if you go to a warmer climate, you have different types of fruits and veg and fish and other things that mankind has decided to consume.

835
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:13,290
The most obvious thing here is that there is an effect on the body chemistry and energy on what you eat.

836
01:05:14,130 --> 01:05:23,970
And it's not only based on the chemical side that is discussed to us, meaning humans, inhabitants right now, but there's an energetic side and a formative side.

837
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:40,810
Certainly not just the ingredients that something is made of, being that something an orange or an apple or a cow, but how those ingredients are structured in whatever organism this is.

838
01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:52,530
Now, what they're doing, the academics and the scientists, in terms of measuring the quality or quantity of things, is that their measurements are actually changing the thing.

839
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:54,550
And what I mean by that, I'll give a stark metaphor.

840
01:05:55,550 --> 01:06:09,370
If you're a carpenter and you're on, let's say, on a site, construction site, and someone asks you, how much does that, you know, one inch thick by 12 inch wide by three foot long oak board weigh?

841
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:10,950
How much does it weigh?

842
01:06:11,370 --> 01:06:16,570
So what he does is he takes it and he mills it down to complete sawdust to put it on a scale.

843
01:06:18,150 --> 01:06:20,990
It's no longer a board, it's a pile of sawdust.

844
01:06:21,810 --> 01:06:22,750
See my point?

845
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:37,790
So when they tell you there's vitamin C in oranges, the way they determine that is so radical that no one really knows if there's vitamin C in oranges, just like you wouldn't know what that pile of sawdust was before it was a pile of sawdust.

846
01:06:37,790 --> 01:07:06,870
Anytime you're dealing with a living thing in their system, not with their system, meaning the academics, academia in general, which means to be impractical, theoretical, never coming to a conclusion, look it up, is that they've, not only can they just give you a description and not an explanation, but what happens is that they've lost the ability to observe it when it's alive.

847
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:15,290
And whenever they separate something that is in a living state into a fragment, it is no longer in a living state.

848
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:17,190
Now it goes through chemical decomposition.

849
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:24,850
That's why there's a lot of criticism on the conventional medical field, which is just based on battlefield practice, by the way.

850
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:32,390
With all their testing and their lack of success in, quote-unquote, curing disease is because the study is based on the study of cadavers.

851
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:36,450
Samples of tissue.

852
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:44,650
If you take a liver sample and view it under a microscope, that is not a living, it's no longer alive.

853
01:07:44,790 --> 01:07:45,550
It's now dead.

854
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:49,250
And you're viewing the chemical decomposition of it.

855
01:07:50,010 --> 01:07:53,310
Yeah, so this is so radical.

856
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:55,210
And no one's noticing.

857
01:07:55,450 --> 01:08:05,530
No one's really, and I say no one, I mean it's not, that's the reason why they should be viewed in contrast to reality is what I mean, academia, right?

858
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:12,450
There's such a contrast, but the people have just, everyone wants to pursue things that they like.

859
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:14,890
If they want to know about the body, they go to a medical person.

860
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:20,830
But it only takes a few minutes to acknowledge that the medical people only acknowledge dead things.

861
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:24,670
So this is, again, the rift.

862
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:26,390
This is a spiritual problem.

863
01:08:27,109 --> 01:08:33,130
So to go back with eating seasonally, this is a long way around the block, let's say up the driveway here.

864
01:08:33,189 --> 01:08:35,050
Let's go back to eating seasonally.

865
01:08:35,149 --> 01:08:42,290
Could it be that the seasonality or temperament of the food affects the body chemistry?

866
01:08:42,770 --> 01:08:57,450
So another simpler way would be to explain it is if you live in a cold climate and you eat food that was grown or purveyed from a warm climate, it will change your body to adapting to a warm climate.

867
01:08:57,649 --> 01:08:58,689
But you're in a cold climate.

868
01:08:59,609 --> 01:09:01,649
So you're going to get sick and vice versa.

869
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:08,910
The reason I'm stating this is because anyone I've ever encountered that had a problem of being cold in the winter,

870
01:09:10,090 --> 01:09:16,609
I've always asked them or went over to where they lived or saw what they ate, and they typically ate some form of tropical foodstuffs.

871
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:18,510
And I made a suggestion.

872
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:23,490
I said, hey, look, did you ever consider that the food will actually change your body chemistry?

873
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:30,970
We use the term chemistry because people kind of like to go with that to the opposite climate that you're trying to adapt to.

874
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:32,590
And they're like, never thought of it, but I'll try it.

875
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:37,130
And 10 out of 10 people that do that have success and varying successes.

876
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:39,930
But they all come back says, yes, I've noticed a big change.

877
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:43,109
And this is not being discussed.

878
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,210
It's the simplest thing.

879
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:45,189
I'm one of them.

880
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:53,109
The problem with this is that you could be knee deep in snow in a cold season part of the world.

881
01:09:53,229 --> 01:09:55,510
And you go to one of these what they call markets.

882
01:09:55,730 --> 01:10:00,330
And they're showing they're selling you things that are from the tropics.

883
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:03,370
And people look at it from a dead chemical sense.

884
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:05,310
Oh, it's freezing outside.

885
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:07,350
But I heard potassium is good for you.

886
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:10,190
And I heard that bananas have potassium.

887
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:11,750
I'll just eat them.

888
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:12,490
Right.

889
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:22,790
I do drink coffee with a little bit of chocolate just about all year long.

890
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:34,850
But if you were in 15 degree Fahrenheit or minus 10 Celsius and it was 39 degrees indoors,

891
01:10:34,850 --> 01:10:40,610
that was the warmest you can get, or 4 degrees Celsius, you'd give up the coffee.

892
01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:49,250
You'd have to go strictly with like roasting roots from local things and making something brown and hot.

893
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:52,410
Yeah, that would be the suggestion there.

894
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:58,690
But you do have the convenience perhaps to be within the medium temperature so you could get away with certain things like that.

895
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:06,590
And this is why people in the Western cultures get the cold, the flu and things like that during the quote unquote holiday season.

896
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:12,770
They have their holidays in the middle of winter, which I'm guilty of it growing up in this society.

897
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:17,110
But then I discovered there are no holidays in the winter really that are fit and proper.

898
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:24,750
And I discovered that the reason why they're getting sick, it's a cosmic joke, is because during their holidays,

899
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:30,010
not only are they overeating, but they're elaborating on just about anything that tastes good,

900
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:40,170
which goes down the path of sugars and chocolates and all the concoctions and things that are out of context seasonally.

901
01:11:40,990 --> 01:11:47,190
Oranges is one thing in particular that I've noticed just in my own physiology.

902
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:56,670
Is that when I used to what I say when I used to several years ago, let's say three, four years back,

903
01:11:57,250 --> 01:12:04,930
anytime I thought that I was starting to feel under the weather or starting to get sick, you know, irritated throat, coughing abnormally,

904
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:11,450
things like that, I would immediately go and get, you know, a big jug of orange juice.

905
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:20,190
And every time I don't know why it took me so long to piece it together or just I didn't I didn't piece it together.

906
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:29,510
You know, I was told it's external input. And I I would drink that orange juice and I would just get so much worse.

907
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:39,090
It would cause, you know, a significant noticeable increase in, you know, mucus and phlegm and things like that.

908
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:53,090
It would make my throat worse and the cough worse. And I, you know, I've changed dramatically the foods that I eat and year round,

909
01:12:53,370 --> 01:13:06,070
you know, not just when it's cold or just when it's warm. But, you know, I haven't been ill with anything other than I've I've had.

910
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:16,370
I've been sick to my stomach once. I've had an ear infection bad enough to actually seek out medication for it once.

911
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:29,970
But other than that, you know, my health has benefited significantly from just being more aware of not only what I'm eating, but why I'm eating what I'm eating.

912
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:44,130
So this goes beyond the it is and it goes beyond the what is right in terms of discernment, because there is a very heavy commercial aspect to this,

913
01:13:44,250 --> 01:13:48,590
because on one side of the world, when it's summer, the other side, it's winter.

914
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:57,490
So that the people that have been promoting commercial farming where it's summertime are now transporting their food to where it's winter for convenience purposes.

915
01:13:57,490 --> 01:14:03,350
So you can have these particular things that grow in during season now out of season.

916
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:07,990
So there's a very strong commercial element behind it as well.

917
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:12,250
And how many times have you heard, you know, people do things for money?

918
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:16,370
Well, there you know, there are industries that are set up for money and there is no money.

919
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:21,050
That's the other cosmic thing. One day we'll discuss that there is no money and what that really means.

920
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:29,270
Yeah, well, that will be a that will be an entire couple of hours for I think a couple of hours.

921
01:14:29,450 --> 01:14:33,690
Yeah. Just to preface it. Exactly. Because there's another thing.

922
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:37,150
Speaking of a couple of hours, just to preface, there's another thing is I was reading.

923
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:45,790
I was reading I was reading aloud and, you know, commenting on it as loud as I was reading it.

924
01:14:45,790 --> 01:15:02,370
And I'm going, you know, a lot of these things that are brought up in this, not only would they take several hours to explain with any sort of accuracy or precision, but also, you know, more, more hours than that, just in prefacing what's being spoken about.

925
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:23,390
So, you know. Yeah, because it's humanity, as we stated earlier, as their greatest success to this point is they've succeeded in almost eliminating all viable forms of communication, but are still able to function somewhat making things going places.

926
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:40,690
What's interesting when I out in the world or digitally or physically, I hear and see people trying to communicate and is one of the most one of the funniest things that I mean, you just got to really hold back.

927
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:49,910
It's like they're saying nothing. Yet they're doing things. I mean, that's kind of harsh, but I just want to give that as a perspective.

928
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:51,690
No, it's it's accurate.

929
01:15:52,270 --> 01:16:00,190
Yeah, or they don't know what they're saying, but they still get things done, you know, and I mean, you know, more than just like filler up 20 bucks regular.

930
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:09,690
I'll take a dozen eggs, but anything outside basic food, clothing, you know, basic was it food, clothing, shelter.

931
01:16:09,950 --> 01:16:23,770
It seems to be so obscure and almost irrelevant that it's just fascinating to see that their crowning achievement is controlled chaos or controlled confusion and controlled ignorance.

932
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:39,230
I like to add the to the food, clothing and shelter list that reminds me of a lot of the discussions I've had with people that would refer to themselves as preppers and things like that.

933
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:51,770
And they they tend to miss the fourth thing that is necessary to not only to comfort, but to just to existing as as, you know, surface dwelling earth inhabitants.

934
01:16:52,170 --> 01:16:59,090
And that's in a word, I would call it fellowship. You could call it companionship, just other people.

935
01:16:59,090 --> 01:17:07,360
You know, it's not just food, clothing and shelter that is necessary to any sort of accurate idea of survival.

936
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:18,250
But it is also, you know, other people, because if it's just just one, we are, you know, from the very beginning of what is recorded.

937
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:23,890
That is that's not how how we operate.

938
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:26,270
It's not how it's not how we exist.

939
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:41,450
So great. And then there's attached to that might be the ethic and moral aspect of people just to tie back into the conversation about money, which we won't have when you bring up even to the most staunch conservative.

940
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:48,790
What what the money system really is or how they're endorsing it by their actions and their words and their pen.

941
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:53,850
Ultimately, if you press them, just like a religious person about they're not doing anything in the text.

942
01:17:54,650 --> 01:18:01,350
You know what they say is they I don't really care, ultimately, as long as I can go to the store and get something for it.

943
01:18:02,770 --> 01:18:11,950
So there's no. So even the most active, pragmatistic type conservative, we've got to do the right thing.

944
01:18:12,030 --> 01:18:20,410
Person pressed to see objectively what is going on, what's going on and how there's two sides, let's say, to it.

945
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:25,950
They really don't care. So there's a moral and ethical problem with humanity across the board right now.

946
01:18:26,850 --> 01:18:34,610
And, folks, if you're going to use the Napoleonic Code, which is, you know, you're guilty till proven innocent in society, you're going to be safe.

947
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:45,750
So when you meet people, if you judge them as being moral and unethical before they even open their mouth and then you have to make sure they have to prove to you that they are, you're going to be very, very safe.

948
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:59,210
Yeah, yeah. So this is this is a general view. If you just drop down on this planet, I bet that before anyone comes here, I bet they probably preface them and say, listen, whatever.

949
01:18:59,350 --> 01:19:04,310
This is what this society is like. They're really stupid and they're really simple and they're really wrong.

950
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:10,430
And they're quite easily provoked to violence. It only takes 15 minutes to explain humanity.

951
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:20,710
And I'm sure that they finish off by telling whoever's visiting here and whatever you do, don't talk to any of them because anything you say will confuse them.

952
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:26,290
So anyway. Absolutely. Yeah.

953
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:37,330
Now, this is a very, you know, but just just to throw something in for things, this is not for anyone to believe or even think about, but just jot this down as a note to self, folks.

954
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:42,270
You're not going to go through any kind of survival type situation like that, by the way.

955
01:19:42,330 --> 01:19:47,350
You're not going to have other than maybe some local catastrophes like are always happening.

956
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:53,030
Earthquakes, floods, localized things like that. But but not on a national level anywhere.

957
01:19:53,930 --> 01:20:03,930
At this point, unless it's temporary, like, for example, you know, there's some political manifestation that cuts things off for a while, then, you know, might be considered.

958
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:12,690
But generally in the in most parts of the world, you're not going to be forced into that situation because what's coming on the scene is the opposite.

959
01:20:12,690 --> 01:20:22,150
Is that mankind will go through these this period for the next, let's say, better part of a quarter of a decade and such, maybe half a decade.

960
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:28,490
And then everything is going to start turning around where you're pretty much going to have a perfect society on the planet for a short time.

961
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:36,830
So, yeah, perfect society, not like from the top down and bottom up.

962
01:20:36,830 --> 01:20:44,550
Yeah. No war. Yeah. Access to things, education, peace and prosperity for all surface dwelling earth inhabitants.

963
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:49,210
And the deception of that. Well, what's wrong with that? Greek, where's it? You know what?

964
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:54,290
What do you mean by deception of that deception is that it's going to be promoted as this is how it's going to be for the next thousand years.

965
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:59,230
That is the great deception. You know, when I say that, it's like, why am I saying this in public?

966
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:02,770
That's worth like a million bucks. Just that one statement, just that clue.

967
01:21:04,030 --> 01:21:11,650
The great deception really is that you will be told you all of you, meaning that all of humanity at large will fall for it.

968
01:21:13,190 --> 01:21:22,110
So, yeah. So when you read in the ancient text, the great deception, it's that you will fall for this perfection because you have to be given this.

969
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:27,050
So later on, no one's without an excuse. I say, well, we didn't have a chance to have world peace.

970
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:34,550
We didn't have a chance to end world hunger. You know, that's the last thing the gods want to hear from anyone.

971
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:40,330
So you'll be granted that for a very short time, a third of a third of a decade or so.

972
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:48,570
And then while the glitches start coming, there'll be some very unusual requests to put it back on track.

973
01:21:48,610 --> 01:21:53,550
And it's just going to get worse and downhill from there. And you're going to suffer a couple of cosmic kill shots.

974
01:21:53,550 --> 01:22:00,470
And, yeah, that's the end of the story pretty much. So, yeah, anyway, not that very exciting or super exciting if you want to research it.

975
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:07,410
Yeah. Every would. Every would. Gidrelli speaking specifically in alternative venues.

976
01:22:08,770 --> 01:22:14,350
You'll hear a lot of people speaking about cataclysm and about the end of everything.

977
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:18,750
And realistically, it was last September. That was supposed to be last September, by the way.

978
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:26,970
Oh, I could I could list it probably 10, 15 solid dates that have come and gone that I've heard just in the last two years.

979
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:36,210
But, you know, realistically, even though it is an ending of sorts, it's going to appear to be quite the opposite of that.

980
01:22:36,250 --> 01:22:42,010
It's going to appear to be the beginning of something very, very good.

981
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:48,790
Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's the whole thing. Well, yeah, it's the it's the credits.

982
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:55,290
Yeah, it's the part. It's the part of the film that's thrown in at the credits.

983
01:22:55,430 --> 01:23:01,690
It's an outtake, let's say, you know, it's thrown in there and you're like, oh, wow, that wasn't in the movie.

984
01:23:01,930 --> 01:23:10,330
They talked about that, but we didn't quite see that. Yeah. You know, I mean, look, if you believe there are electrons going down wires, you'll believe anything.

985
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:16,030
So, I mean, come on, folks. So, yeah, but it's not.

986
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:21,870
Yeah. And this whole thing about no one knows the future. You've heard of that.

987
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:28,190
It's like, geez, Louise, you know, it's like, well, you know, I'm baking a cake, you know, we'll eat cake in an hour after it cools down.

988
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:31,730
Well, how do you know the future? Well, it's simple.

989
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:38,930
You see, you make the rest, you know, you make the batter, you put it in a pan and an oven for an hour and or 40 minutes or so.

990
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:41,950
And then you cool it, you serve it. That's why I'm not psychic.

991
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:44,870
Yeah. The sun's going to appear to go down here in a few hours.

992
01:23:46,330 --> 01:23:50,450
Yeah. Well, how do you know? Right. Well, it's happened before.

993
01:23:50,610 --> 01:23:57,190
And you've been told even if even if you get a recipe to make something you've never made before, how do you know?

994
01:23:57,770 --> 01:24:03,450
There's a certain element of trust and a certain element of skill. The skill here is can you see clearly?

995
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:11,650
But anyway, the thing is not think not see not thinking deeply, but thinking clearly.

996
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:17,830
You know, an insane person can think deeply, but it takes a good amount of sanity to think clearly.

997
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:22,770
Sanity being health, health of mind, body, soul.

998
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:30,230
And what's and what's coming after all this stuff, which is great, is is a level of existence for all living things.

999
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:36,390
That is so beyond what exists now that it almost escapes description.

1000
01:24:36,590 --> 01:24:41,650
You can hint at it. That's the wonderful part about it.

1001
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:56,150
So nonetheless. Yeah. Before we get too far away from the, you know, food idea, there is, you know, something I guess you could call it an addendum to that.

1002
01:24:56,810 --> 01:25:05,770
What about foods that are preserved, such as pickles, you know, or anything that is changes, pickled changes, right?

1003
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:12,750
If you were to have a well, let's say the typical in the Western world, let's say American or the States.

1004
01:25:12,890 --> 01:25:16,930
When you say pickle, you, you know, something you slice on a burger or sandwiches and such.

1005
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:21,950
And that is actually a preserved cucumber variety.

1006
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:30,170
Well, if you were to compare that to a non preserved cucumber, it's almost a completely different thing.

1007
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:36,150
Well, guess what? When you preserve something like that, it is completely different in its property.

1008
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:40,290
So there are many things that could be considered the canning and pickling.

1009
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:46,750
Even eating those things out of season is proper through experimentation, believe it or not.

1010
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:50,910
You can do it yourself. So there's something like banana chips.

1011
01:25:50,910 --> 01:25:56,490
Have you heard of those dried banana chips? Well, should you eat those if you're in a cold climate?

1012
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:59,790
Well, you know, here's the thing. It's so extreme and so specific.

1013
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:05,810
No, but if you do, it's not going to have the same effect as if you ate a live banana, let's say.

1014
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:14,130
Right. So considering the preserving of things, changing them, it's almost the mildest form of alchemy when you think about it.

1015
01:26:16,890 --> 01:26:20,930
Absolutely. Anything else in that department could be discussed?

1016
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:24,930
Or go ahead, give us any experiences that you might have with preserved foods out of season.

1017
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:32,190
None negative. And it's something that I, you know, as I have attempted to do, eat seasonally.

1018
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:36,470
And as I said, you know, there are things like coffee and stuff like that,

1019
01:26:37,770 --> 01:26:41,490
that would be breaking away from that.

1020
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:47,710
Generally speaking, that's something that I do, you know, year round.

1021
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:57,130
And I've found it to be over the last, you know, two, three years to be of great benefit,

1022
01:26:57,410 --> 01:27:04,310
not only just to not being sick, but just to the well-being of my physical body.

1023
01:27:04,310 --> 01:27:11,470
Even, you know, I've gone through, as we all do over the last few years, some very stressful things.

1024
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:15,510
I would say non-physical, but that's inaccurate, you know.

1025
01:27:15,570 --> 01:27:27,790
Emotions are a physical phenomenon that could have very well made this meat puppet ill,

1026
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:33,530
had it not been for the fact that even through all of that, I was still eating.

1027
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:43,970
Perhaps not as much, but the quality of intake was still very considered in anything.

1028
01:27:44,710 --> 01:27:49,730
So, I would, I'd recommend it to anyone who, especially if you have a tendency to,

1029
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:56,510
toward, you know, illness of the body, seasonally or, you know, sporadically even.

1030
01:27:57,230 --> 01:28:01,570
Think about what you're eating and maybe, maybe change it.

1031
01:28:01,570 --> 01:28:03,150
And where it was grown and where you got it from.

1032
01:28:03,390 --> 01:28:03,550
Absolutely.

1033
01:28:03,550 --> 01:28:05,110
And where you got it from, yeah.

1034
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:05,930
Absolutely.

1035
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:10,690
Now, it doesn't mean, it doesn't mean just eat what, you know, within a few miles or locally.

1036
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:16,430
That's for economic purposes as well, what's called self-sustainment and all that economically, locally.

1037
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:19,790
But you can go cross-latitude across the world.

1038
01:28:19,970 --> 01:28:28,210
So, if you're, you know, somewhere in the States, let's say your type of diet or what you eat can have extreme variety.

1039
01:28:28,450 --> 01:28:35,110
You know, let's say mid-part of the States, you go across, you know, the world and you'd see, you know, parts of France,

1040
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:39,910
parts of Northern Italy, parts of China, parts of Russia.

1041
01:28:40,410 --> 01:28:47,270
And then you could flip the globe and go on the lower half and that similar latitude of seasons,

1042
01:28:47,950 --> 01:28:55,830
you can enjoy those types of food as well, you see, but in different times of the year, usually spring or fall is a great equalizer

1043
01:28:55,830 --> 01:29:00,270
where both sides of the world, you know, the people down under, let's say Australia, New Zealand, South America,

1044
01:29:01,010 --> 01:29:05,890
and the people on the northern part, that transition.

1045
01:29:05,890 --> 01:29:12,250
It's possible to have similar temperatures on similar days where other parts of the year,

1046
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:14,850
summer and winter, it's polar opposite, right?

1047
01:29:14,930 --> 01:29:17,630
You have winter in one place, summer in the other.

1048
01:29:18,130 --> 01:29:19,590
So, spring and fall is interesting.

1049
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:23,050
It's an equalizer for the entire planet in that respect.

1050
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:33,790
But the actual seasons manifesting like that and the actual foodstuffs are different because they contrast.

1051
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:36,670
When it's winter, one place they tend to ship to the other.

1052
01:29:36,790 --> 01:29:41,750
So you might want to look across the world just for variety, you know.

1053
01:29:43,790 --> 01:29:49,410
We gave the contrast of if you live in a cold, it's a cold time of year for you.

1054
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:55,550
If you eat food that comes from the tropics, there's a good chance it's going to adjust your body chemistry, let's say,

1055
01:29:56,330 --> 01:30:00,410
to being in the tropics and you will get ill because you will not be able to adapt to the cold.

1056
01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:01,690
And the vice versa is true.

1057
01:30:01,690 --> 01:30:07,870
If you live in the tropics and you eat, let's say, salmon or things that are grown in very cold places,

1058
01:30:08,350 --> 01:30:10,690
you will not be able to adjust to the heat.

1059
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:16,350
And actually that I have seen, let's say, in places in summertime in the desert southwest,

1060
01:30:17,170 --> 01:30:22,150
I found someone who liked eating salmon in summertime and went to their house,

1061
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:26,890
they had the air conditioner down so low you felt like you were walking into a cooler box,

1062
01:30:26,890 --> 01:30:30,270
walk in refrigerator, and they were still warm.

1063
01:30:32,030 --> 01:30:32,310
So.

1064
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:35,170
Yeah, absolutely.

1065
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:48,390
And my personal experience just with avoiding tropical fruits during the cold months here has had a, I've noticed, you know.

1066
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:53,950
It's something that I've been aware of, as they say, in the back of my mind constantly

1067
01:30:54,590 --> 01:30:56,510
because it's something that I did consciously.

1068
01:30:57,750 --> 01:31:00,330
And I've, you know, it's been good.

1069
01:31:00,790 --> 01:31:06,250
So I recommend it to anyone out there who thinks about such things.

1070
01:31:06,290 --> 01:31:10,490
And I'd recommend that you maybe think about such things if you're not in the habit of doing so.

1071
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:14,550
Health of the body is, I mean, that's, you know,

1072
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:18,150
that's how we interact with this physical plane that we find ourselves in.

1073
01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:27,610
So having it as healthy as, you know, possible will make everything else just that much more tolerable and pleasant.

1074
01:31:27,930 --> 01:31:30,770
Because it's a crazy violent place out there, man.

1075
01:31:31,030 --> 01:31:32,550
You said you've been out in public recently.

1076
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:34,530
I know, it's pretty scary.

1077
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:36,930
Yeah, I'm not agoraphobic or anything.

1078
01:31:37,090 --> 01:31:41,550
I just find that the level of quality of individuals from every aspect now,

1079
01:31:41,630 --> 01:31:43,970
it's like as if everyone's lost their mind to some degree.

1080
01:31:43,970 --> 01:31:49,990
But anyway, you know, Seth, how we discussed earlier the external input with thoughts.

1081
01:31:50,050 --> 01:31:55,390
It's interesting how the external input with food is parallel to that, isn't it?

1082
01:31:56,150 --> 01:31:56,970
It is.

1083
01:31:58,370 --> 01:31:58,530
Yeah.

1084
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:06,370
So what other external input can we discuss other than thought and food?

1085
01:32:08,630 --> 01:32:14,570
Well, on this time coming around, I think we prefaced by reading some things that were sent to us.

1086
01:32:14,650 --> 01:32:15,690
Actually, a thing.

1087
01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:16,570
It was quite a document.

1088
01:32:17,790 --> 01:32:23,230
And just going from the gods to pretty much the external input and the food.

1089
01:32:23,550 --> 01:32:25,230
What do you think we just give it a rest?

1090
01:32:25,390 --> 01:32:30,570
It's been about an hour and a half, an hour, better part of almost two hours here.

1091
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:31,310
What do you think?

1092
01:32:31,410 --> 01:32:31,910
Should we just?

1093
01:32:32,930 --> 01:32:34,290
Yes, that's fine with me.

1094
01:32:34,290 --> 01:32:38,010
I'm getting relatively hungry as well.

1095
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:39,210
Yeah.

1096
01:32:39,690 --> 01:32:49,390
So usually we have the convention of the two hours from previously coming together on a radio network to do two hours with breaks and such.

1097
01:32:49,490 --> 01:32:56,310
But I think I think we've put out a pretty good presentation for this episode, let's say.

1098
01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:56,710
Yeah.

1099
01:32:56,970 --> 01:33:03,590
And we've touched on some some topics and gone a little bit more in depth than maybe we have in the past.

1100
01:33:04,430 --> 01:33:15,010
And, you know, being that this is only the second or third broadcast that we're doing, we a lot of it can be new to people that are that are new to the concepts that we're sharing anyway.

1101
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:22,070
So I think that we have done a relatively good job, as they say, such things.

1102
01:33:22,670 --> 01:33:24,390
And also what are great.

1103
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:27,830
I just want to present one thing in closing just to answer this.

1104
01:33:28,030 --> 01:33:38,950
We've been getting some feedback as in terms of text messages on Skype and emails and such about discussing certain specific topics in greater depth.

1105
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:44,670
And that will come. And some of these topics include alternative technologies.

1106
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:50,090
Tesla, Victor Shaw, Berger and such various things about ancient texts.

1107
01:33:50,110 --> 01:33:52,510
One might say the biblical text.

1108
01:33:52,510 --> 01:34:01,130
Now, the first part that could be done pretty substantially, basically just discussing the matter of fact aspect.

1109
01:34:01,410 --> 01:34:05,130
I think that there's no real right or wrong time for that.

1110
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:21,190
But discussing something like the holy rites of a particular culture or even something that might be called the biblical text at this time publicly is met with great indifference only because it's not quite time yet to discuss it.

1111
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:24,670
You see, would you be in agreement with that, Seth?

1112
01:34:24,770 --> 01:34:27,990
Or it doesn't mean we should bar the topic and not bring up things.

1113
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:33,970
But I think it really coming out with what is really trying to be conveyed there is you think it's time yet?

1114
01:34:34,770 --> 01:34:40,290
No, but it does seem the time, as they say, gets closer every day.

1115
01:34:40,670 --> 01:34:43,530
So, yeah, there's a lot of stuff going on.

1116
01:34:43,530 --> 01:34:45,510
Just leave with a metaphor.

1117
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:56,530
Someone, an individual once contacted me a couple of years back about doing a video presentation on Da Vinci's Last Supper and how it explains the stars and the Bible and all this.

1118
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:59,550
Let them go on for hours and hours, a very long presentation.

1119
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:01,390
And I said, wait a second.

1120
01:35:03,430 --> 01:35:05,850
By the way, there is no last supper in the Bible.

1121
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:07,550
It's the Passover.

1122
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:15,430
What you just did, all that effort, all that time is wasted if you try to connect it to the biblical text.

1123
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:19,370
But it's not wasted if you want to make it like maybe an art review.

1124
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:20,270
Right.

1125
01:35:20,550 --> 01:35:24,150
So you see, there's two aspects to it.

1126
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:24,430
Right.

1127
01:35:24,710 --> 01:35:31,210
So when we discuss the biblical text right away, they go to church, yet any church, Christianity, Islam, Judaism.

1128
01:35:31,570 --> 01:35:34,870
Like that's social stuff.

1129
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:38,030
That has nothing to do with the biblical text at all.

1130
01:35:38,170 --> 01:35:40,450
See, I just wanted to put that in as well.

1131
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:41,670
That's why it's not time yet.

1132
01:35:43,970 --> 01:35:46,950
So with that said, I'll let you close it off, Seth.

1133
01:35:47,070 --> 01:35:50,990
Thank you, everyone, attending and listening and recording and BYOR.

1134
01:35:51,690 --> 01:35:55,950
I don't know if Seth's going to successfully achieve a recording on this, but.

1135
01:35:56,010 --> 01:35:58,270
Yeah, we have recorded the entire thing.

1136
01:35:58,390 --> 01:36:02,270
We'll see if it all goes through once I hit the stop button.

1137
01:36:02,270 --> 01:36:06,590
But don't don't hang up.

1138
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:09,350
Hang on after we are going to go ahead and end the broadcast.

1139
01:36:09,570 --> 01:36:12,430
So thank you all for being here and participating.

1140
01:36:12,470 --> 01:36:21,530
If you would like to contact us, the easiest way to do that is going to be to go to uncommon radio dot com, where the email address is listed.

1141
01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:29,670
That email address is uncommon since radio one, the number one at Gmail dot com.

1142
01:36:29,690 --> 01:36:31,550
And I'll drop that into the chat here as well.

1143
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:33,690
Actually, I'm going to do that right now.

1144
01:36:33,730 --> 01:36:44,380
One at Gmail dot com and go.

1145
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:50,540
So that's in the chat and we will be back barring unforeseen circumstances.

1146
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:57,440
Broadcasting again on what they call Saturday, right around one one p.m.

1147
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:00,000
Pacific wartime, four p.m.

1148
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,420
Eastern wartime.

1149
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:07,660
And yeah, thank you all for being here and, you know, making this worthwhile.

1150
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:09,600
We we I enjoy doing it.

1151
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:12,200
I can't speak for both of us, but I enjoy the conversation.

1152
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:13,660
So I'm grateful for that as well.

1153
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:18,880
And until next time, be well and think.

1154
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:21,100
Start record.

1155
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:23,640
Start broadcast.

1156
01:37:31,650 --> 01:37:32,690
Start record.
