00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,420
Greetings, this is American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:09,220
And this is the Uncommon Sense, Call it the Show, and you're with the Greek and Seth Michael.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,540
And we'll have Seth here in a moment, folks, sorry about that again.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:18,920
Seems to be the technical difficulty era for this show, but we're going to just see how

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,620
it works out.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,600
Seth, are you with us?

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:22,840
Hello.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,920
Shalom, I believe so.

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,040
Yes, you are.

10
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,520
Okay.

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:33,660
So we just did our, we're live on the air at American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,820
And this is Uncommon Sense with the Greek and Seth.

13
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,400
Yes, welcome.

14
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,200
Welcome to the program.

15
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,600
Greek, as always, it's good to hear your voice.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:45,640
Yeah, great.

17
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,000
Same.

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,180
And, you know, what's interesting, we always like to say, you know, let's just get into

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,280
the matter, but it's very difficult to just jump in because, you know, there's certain

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,600
ways of communicating and people like a preface and things like that.

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,739
But one of the things we'll always preface is the reason we're doing this get-together

22
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:08,700
publicly is because we're trying to figure out why certain things that are so freaking

23
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,120
obvious aren't being discussed.

24
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,240
So maybe it should be called the freaking obvious subject discussion.

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,800
I don't know.

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,240
But just to get back to the things at hand, we have two hours, which seems to go by very

27
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,620
quickly.

28
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,520
I want to bring up a point.

29
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,440
We've always gotten very good feedback when I say we, meaning the Greek speaking and anyone

30
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,640
else about the subject matter and the way that it's broached on.

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,020
And I just want to start off, perhaps, Seth, I think I made you aware of a message we got

32
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,720
from a listener, and highly commendable, someone really actually listening to the details being

33
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:42,780
imparted.

34
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,480
And I was thinking of perhaps reading that message and going down that road, even though

35
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,280
it might be unpopular to most.

36
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,880
What do you think of that?

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,480
And we'll let you.

38
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,220
I think, yeah, I think that we can.

39
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:02,920
You shared the message with me just a few minutes ago and I read through it and my response

40
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,380
was what was my response?

41
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,199
Someone is really listening.

42
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:08,820
Yeah.

43
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,100
Yeah.

44
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,380
Right.

45
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:09,620
Right.

46
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,760
Well, it was someone is really listening and should just be held for private.

47
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,360
And I'm like, well, you know, it's a great topic for discussion.

48
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:16,720
Yeah.

49
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,540
It would be excellent.

50
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,040
And within the discussion and the message, and as I've been saying, let's say, for years

51
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,660
in public forums, is it's not time yet.

52
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,980
And Seth, do you think that sometimes a precursor or a trailer to the movie or an introduction

53
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:39,580
to something that it's not time yet for, but might be time coming up that maybe it can

54
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,820
be hinted at or introduced somehow would be valid?

55
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,300
I do.

56
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,020
Yeah.

57
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,460
I do.

58
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:46,920
Yeah.

59
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,740
So here we go.

60
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,380
Let's get into it because time is short.

61
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,520
Message reads thusly, Hi, Greek.

62
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,260
Looking forward to what you and Seth bring forth today.

63
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,060
In the last day, I've listened to your interview with Freeman as well as the first Uncommon

64
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,800
Sense broadcast.

65
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,760
You bring a lot of information forth, although not in too much depth.

66
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,380
I would like to know a little more about you and why what you personally feel the obligation

67
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,520
to tell men about what you see coming.

68
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,280
I'd asked you before how to study scripture.

69
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,300
During Freeman's broadcast, you said you don't recommend people start trying to figure out

70
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,380
scripture because most won't understand it anyway.

71
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,100
I'm confident over time you'll bring forth everything you need to say.

72
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,260
Yet what I'm not hearing is what scripture actually tells us to do to be pleasing to

73
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,500
the ultimate creator, basically how we should conduct our lives, if any certain way.

74
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,500
You said people can contemplate what you are saying, and if we see events start to pass,

75
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,640
we'll know the end is close.

76
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,260
I've always been told through modern evangelicalism to conduct myself a certain way.

77
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,060
Are we supposed to prepare for what happens when our spirit parts with our body?

78
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,660
I'd like to have an idea now how and what to teach my little ones.

79
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,360
I apologize for such a lengthy message.

80
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,640
If anything which can be discussed today, I'd appreciate it.

81
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,940
From someone who is interested, and I think you and I Seth agreed that here is someone

82
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,100
who is listening.

83
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,260
Let's just maybe talk about the subject matter at hand.

84
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,980
I made some bullet points off of that, so don't kind of lose it.

85
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,680
But you know what's interesting, Seth?

86
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,660
Whenever you bring up, let's just, we could talk about general communication and how it's

87
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,380
been obscured.

88
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,300
But when you bring up anything regarding the scripture or the Bible, the majority of the

89
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,100
consensus is, oh no, here we go, religious talk, right?

90
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:45,480
Or if you want to talk about, let's say, a certain chemical reaction, oh, that's scientific.

91
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,160
Or if we bring up numbers, oh, that's mathematical.

92
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,480
Or it's like, well, chill, people, right?

93
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,400
There's topics, there's general topics, and there's specifics.

94
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,880
It seems like a lot is lost in generalities, but we can get specific on these things, I

95
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,180
believe.

96
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,800
And again, what do you think, Seth, about whenever you discuss anything from the biblical

97
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,420
text, and we can explain what is really going on with the text itself as a way man perceives

98
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,340
it as well, which is another topic, but we might want to a little bit.

99
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:32,360
I would say that just in general, the first time the subject comes up, I am apprehensive,

100
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:41,400
I suppose, because there is so much, what is familiar in people's minds, or at least

101
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:48,140
what appears to be, is that it's traditions.

102
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,600
We're dealing with traditions.

103
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,880
We're not actually, when you and I speak about scripture, we're speaking about what is written,

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
what has been memorialized.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,900
We're not speaking about the traditions of any earthly hierarchical society.

106
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,120
They've hijacked it, essentially.

107
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,000
It's just like if we say the word government, I assure you, most people's minds all of a

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,660
sudden go to politicians, which has nothing to do with it.

109
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,740
So on that aspect, here's the thing, and this might sound dogmatic to some, but I assure

110
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,480
you it's the truth.

111
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:31,900
If you think 2 plus 2 equals 4 is dogmatic, meaning, well, that's the way it is, and sorry

112
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,180
if you don't think so, would be maybe a loose definition of dogma, right?

113
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,740
You like going and saying 2 plus 2 equals 4 at the market or when you're teaching little

114
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,220
children math, but other statements that broach upon these traditions, let's say, and what

115
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,740
they're regarded as and what they're basing it on.

116
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,720
If you start discussing those things, it sounds dogmatic, oh, we don't want to go there, right?

117
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,260
We can explain that's part of human nature as well.

118
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,800
But what's interesting, Seth, I just want to say this, and I have been saying this for

119
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,120
over a decade and a half almost, is that if you hear anyone discussing anything when they

120
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:17,900
say the Bible or the scriptures or the biblical text or the scriptural text, let me say this

121
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,440
strictly but loosely, because sometimes it's not done, but it has to be done within a discussion.

122
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,120
If anyone is discussing, again, the Bible or the scripture or anything like that, and

123
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:34,700
they don't give a condition or say that we're going to discuss the Bible or the scripture,

124
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,860
but it has not been translated out of the languages of preservation into any other language,

125
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:46,640
all you have are versions of it, they're doing you a disservice, and probably what they're

126
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,980
going to continue and say about it is going to be erroneous, either half true, completely

127
00:07:52,980 --> 00:08:02,640
off, where it has nothing to do with it, or just not really any merit or showing that

128
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,660
there's any basis to it.

129
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:12,880
So again, when we discuss anything regarding scripture or the Bible, the listenership needs

130
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:20,140
to keep in mind that those texts are preserved in Hebrew and Greek, and even to this date,

131
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,060
whatever day you want to say it is, let's say, it has not been translated.

132
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,480
And if you have an unabridged version, you could read the introduction and they are very

133
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,340
clear about that.

134
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,720
So we have a problem there as well, you see.

135
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,760
But nonetheless, we can go through the subject matter based on what people might know through

136
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:46,380
film, Hollywood, or the circus, or churchianity, or through tradition.

137
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,820
I think linking it back to that is important.

138
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:49,960
Absolutely.

139
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:59,100
I think that something that might be of interest, at least to the person who sent that message,

140
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:07,160
would be, you know, some of the, there were actually a couple of direct questions in there

141
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:13,040
that we could perhaps even provide some more questions for.

142
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,400
Because there's just too many questions.

143
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:23,800
And just to preface, there's a certain thought pattern that requires labor, let's say, spiritual

144
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,180
labor or labor of the mind.

145
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,760
And before you go and do any labor or run a marathon, you want to do a little bit of

146
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,400
a warm-up.

147
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,660
Let's just say a few things here, which are true, and again, it's not, you're not going

148
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,420
to make friends saying these things, because, and here's the thing.

149
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,260
People tune into media to feel liked, and they like to hear pleasant things, in which

150
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,640
we try to be pleasant, as close as possible to being pleasant.

151
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,380
But there's a Greek philosopher, and I'll paraphrase, he said that a friend to all is

152
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,160
a friend to none.

153
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,860
So that's an interesting thought.

154
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,000
Now that aside, the things that need to be said, folks, and which you might have heard

155
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,140
the Greeks said before, there's not a religion on existence right now in society that does

156
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,320
anything that's in the texts that they allegedly subscribe to.

157
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,260
Not a single one.

158
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,560
Not a single one.

159
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,900
It doesn't matter if it's Eastern, Western, or Central.

160
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:22,780
And I can say that specifically for the handful of texts that I have actually read through

161
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:23,920
myself.

162
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,920
Obviously, I haven't read all of them that there are.

163
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:36,540
But that has been, you know, that's something that we've discussed years ago, and that the

164
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:47,120
more I have looked into it, you know, I'm not the sort to just patently accept what

165
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,340
I am, what I hear in conversation, what I'm told, especially if it's something that I

166
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,120
am interested in having a knowledge base in.

167
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:03,660
And so I can, you know, I can honestly say that through my studies over the past few

168
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,460
years that I haven't found anything to contradict that.

169
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,080
And what's good about this is interesting, because let's say you heard that statement

170
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,440
and you wanted to check up on it.

171
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,860
And it was very easy to see, but just like an immediate thing, like a flashing, you know,

172
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,580
color or something, it would be really shocking to the system.

173
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,300
But when you hear a statement like there's no religion on the planet, bar none, that

174
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,700
does anything that's in the text that they allegedly subscribe to, it takes a time to

175
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,300
figure that out because you actually have to go and see the contrast and comparison of

176
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,340
that statement within what the religions are doing and their texts.

177
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,520
Right. And that is not very rapid.

178
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,820
It takes a long time, let's say, or some time.

179
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:48,240
And because it does that, the shock of that reality is gradual.

180
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,500
So it doesn't kind of like come across your head like a baseball bat.

181
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:56,700
Right. Which is fortunate because there are certain things, some things that could be

182
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,940
very shocking. And that's what horror films and slasher films are for.

183
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:05,560
But it's just as shocking when you discover there are seven billion or plus or minus.

184
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:11,260
Basically, the entire planet has been wholesale deceived and they just go along with

185
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:11,980
what's comfortable.

186
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:18,040
You see. And when that statement again is made, you know, fortunately, there is no way

187
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,380
to validate that immediately.

188
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,560
It takes a little bit of research and that little bit of time spreads out the impact.

189
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,880
See, I tell people, see, it's not the crashing that hurts you.

190
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,980
It's the sudden stop.

191
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:35,460
Right. So that's another statement that has to be made that the other thing is let's

192
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:39,540
just go more on what people can relate to, which they may or may not know.

193
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,780
There's a field of study amongst humanity known as history.

194
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,220
Right. And, you know, you have to wink, wink and be sarcastic about that.

195
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,220
But let's just say, put that aside.

196
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:56,020
The secular historians have considered this past two millennia, which would be 2000

197
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,360
years to be considered the Christian era.

198
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,520
OK, it's not it's it's secular.

199
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:09,520
In other words, we're not talking about religion as as as you might understand it.

200
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,120
But historically, it's been dubbed or labeled, you know, if you were to put this

201
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,840
2000 years in a jar and put it up on a shelf, it would be labeled by them the Christian

202
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:25,240
era. So when we say the word Christianity, we're not we're going to toggle back and

203
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,300
forth to what actually the traditions of it are and also the historical aspect of it.

204
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,720
So I just wanted to bring that up as well.

205
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:41,080
So to go into the the because time is short to go into the the message that we received

206
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,600
what's interesting is one of the first things was what obligation does the Greek

207
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,260
sense to tell man about this?

208
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,560
Well, that's a that's a very good question.

209
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:55,420
But what's interesting, there's a sense of responsibility that if you find out

210
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,340
something and all people do this, when they find out something that brings them joy,

211
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:07,540
where they find out, find out about something that can help someone.

212
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,700
I'm using that term loosely because generally people want to help other people.

213
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,060
You want to go out and tell others.

214
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:20,920
And initially, you bring the subject forward or the notion of whatever that is, very

215
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,880
generally, as if someone else already might know about it.

216
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,880
And when you regarding this subject matter, let's say the ancient texts and such, when

217
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,960
I first started discovering what was written, it was very much in contrast to what we were

218
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,860
told about it. And I started discussing this mostly with received without great

219
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,080
opposition. And that forces one to retract.

220
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:52,480
So I then started thinking about the sanity or how the well-being of what was being said

221
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,980
in terms of what the Greek was saying regarding these things.

222
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,100
And I went back and double checked on everything.

223
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:02,040
And I found it to be pretty much in accord with what I initially said.

224
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:09,320
So there is an obligation that one should say things if they're not being said.

225
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,840
There's an obligation to say things, even though if they're not well-received, if they

226
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,240
can be validated or verified.

227
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,380
And that's how I feel about it.

228
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:26,060
Now, the other thing is, I've said before, the reason why one should say things is to

229
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,620
clear themselves of future guilt.

230
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,920
Why is that? Let's say there's a dam and it's going to break.

231
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,700
And because of a defect and you're aware of that defect and no one else is, you need to

232
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:41,360
state it. Whether it's fixed or not, or whether the people take precautions to avoid any

233
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,040
kind of disaster, let's say, is up to them.

234
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,460
You know, the interesting point of that is to clear oneself of their guilt, because I've

235
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,660
also said in public before, it's interesting when you watch people in this day and age,

236
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,780
even in the past century, that go out and publicly say, let's say they have an invention

237
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,740
or a good idea. I'm doing this to make the world a better

238
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,840
place. What I say about that is if you're doing it, if you have something like that and

239
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,620
you are doing it to make the world a better place, do it anonymously.

240
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,320
If you focus on telegraphing or messaging that the preface of you doing this to make the

241
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,240
world a better place, you're going to make some really powerful enemies.

242
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,520
The reason why is most people would say, yes, there's a group of oligarchs that don't want

243
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,400
to see that and they will take you out.

244
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,300
But there's also a spiritual side.

245
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,040
There is a parallel community of non-tangible beings.

246
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,260
Yes, you will find that out later.

247
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,720
And they're divided into a benevolent and malevolent group.

248
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,140
Now, obviously, the malevolent group doesn't want to see the world be a better place because

249
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:47,640
they're malevolent. But also, we've come into a time period now where the benevolent group

250
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:52,400
doesn't want to see the world a better place because certain things have to take place to

251
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,820
clear the slate. So now you have both the benevolent and the malevolent spiritual

252
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,320
entities, let's say, in that realm against you.

253
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:05,220
That's why when you look at several people, let's say the inventors of the water car, the

254
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,460
inventors of, quote unquote, free energy or free power devices, cancer treatments and such

255
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:15,400
and such, once they go public and start saying, I'm doing this to make the world a better

256
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,819
place, they're screwed.

257
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,240
So the thing is to avoid saying that as good advice, do it anonymously.

258
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,300
But from another point of view, there are certain details about anything, whether you

259
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,440
can put the label on it for making the world a better place or not, need to be said

260
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,080
objectively. And that's why I'm speaking, because these are things that anyone can

261
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:48,200
objectify. And OK, now, another point that was mentioned in the message is the study of

262
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,440
scripture. And this person had heard me speak about this.

263
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,860
And what's interesting through society, there's a religion that has hijacked what's

264
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,700
called the biblical text or the scripture.

265
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,780
Actually, there's more than one.

266
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:05,640
But one of the religions promotes conversion and belief in their system and accepting a

267
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,860
particular character in all this.

268
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:15,820
And what's interesting about how this is being promulgated is that there's very little

269
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,960
study in what it's supposed to be based on.

270
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,280
Just as if you're talking to someone about the money system, they're always speaking

271
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,440
about things based on the credit based economy and never referring to lawfulness or what

272
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,460
it should be based on.

273
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,040
The same happens with.

274
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,640
Understanding the text, most people, when they discuss money, they just don't care what

275
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,260
it is, they just care that if they go into commerce, the merchants will accept it and

276
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,160
they get what they want.

277
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:52,760
What's interesting about religious groups that use what's called the biblical text, they

278
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,480
just get what they want, which is groups of people that seem to be happy and believe the

279
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,900
same thing. But if they actually look at the text, they will find that it's very

280
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,460
contradictory to what they are doing.

281
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,340
And they're supposedly based on that text.

282
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,540
So the reason why I've said the study of scripture, most people will not understand it

283
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:19,480
is because there's a problem here that when people approach anything in any reference

284
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,800
text and any subject, what they are doing is they're reading into it what they've been

285
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,580
told about it prior to them approaching the subject.

286
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,860
Right. Give an example.

287
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,900
For example, OK, let's just stick to the scriptural text.

288
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,540
If you're reading what's called the New Testament and you get to the point of the

289
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:45,840
execution of the Christ, instead of actually reading what's being preserved in the

290
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,740
text or written in the text or imparted in the text, you say most people will say, oh,

291
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,760
this is the part that I saw in the movie.

292
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,500
This is the part that they told me about in Sunday school or in church or, you know,

293
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,420
there was a whole bunch of movies made about this.

294
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,420
This is that part.

295
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,660
And they're not actually they're reading it functionally.

296
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,340
But they're not really comprehending what's being written at all because they're

297
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:13,000
overlaying in their minds what they've been told prior to it.

298
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,380
Very similarly, as if if you go to science, you know, they'll tell you that, you know,

299
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,700
electricity now is defined by protons and electrons or electrons moving down a wire.

300
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:30,260
If you study this academically, let's say it doesn't sound so outrageous because, you

301
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:35,340
know, you saw it in, you know, Walt Disney YouTubes or films that, you know, electrons,

302
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,740
this electrons that and you're not really paying attention to how the electrons being

303
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:45,260
defined. So the reason why I say most people will not understand and I don't recommend

304
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:50,540
reading scripture in general as a whole is because the individual or the people that

305
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:58,180
hear this is extremely difficult for them to overcome the the the nature of the

306
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,600
predetermined nature of what they've been told about it.

307
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,140
And whenever they approach the subject, they're reading into it instead of reading out

308
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:10,860
of it. And the other thing is that we are creatures of convenience.

309
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:17,140
Otherwise, people wouldn't want to buy microwaves or eat out of a can or whatever,

310
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,380
whatever. And the convenience right now is that they believe that they have the

311
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,920
information memorialized somehow in a version.

312
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,280
And like we stated before, it has not been translated.

313
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:34,020
So your versions, again, are erroneous at best.

314
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,760
There are other words to describe things like that, but it might seem disrespectful to

315
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:44,580
most. So that would be the point of why I have not recommended most people read it.

316
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:50,020
But in a sense, if anyone wants to look at anything, what anything is allegedly based

317
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:55,340
on, they could, of course, look at that, whether it's scientific, scriptural or legal,

318
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,060
legal. That's a real mess.

319
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:02,080
Again, just to bring up the legal society, there are no attorneys that know any law or

320
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,460
it includes the judges as such, very simply, because if you were in that legal society

321
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:13,420
and you started studying law, your own colleagues would oust you because it has

322
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,740
nothing to do with law. The same with science.

323
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:20,580
If you started actually talking about anything than just pure decomposing materialism

324
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,780
and talking about how things work as opposed to just describing them, you will be

325
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,240
ousted by your own colleagues.

326
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,480
And the same in religious circles.

327
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:35,060
If you are in any religious circle and you start studying what allegedly that religion

328
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:40,240
is based on, whether it being any text, because most religions adhere to some form of

329
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,200
text, at least in the Western world and most of the Eastern world.

330
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:48,600
If anyone in that field started looking at what it's supposed to be based on, they would

331
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,860
be ousted from that community by their colleagues.

332
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,680
And it's very interesting phenomenon.

333
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,340
And this might sound like a very general statement.

334
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,840
And yes, it is. But it's also can be many specific examples can be shown, actually

335
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,640
countless. So that has to be said.

336
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:11,840
So I'm not suggesting people go and not ever look at any reference material, but I'm

337
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,680
suggesting that they don't, because seemingly on the surface of the general approach that

338
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,540
people take looking at anything, they'll be wasting their time.

339
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:32,140
I think that a good preface for anyone who is wanting to study, you know, scripture is

340
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:39,440
Kohalath, which is the book Ecclesiastes in the King James vernacular.

341
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:50,440
And it is, it's a great, at least I've found it to be in my own studies, very beneficial

342
00:23:51,120 --> 00:24:03,400
in the information that is provided because it speaks of the varying experiences that

343
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,160
many of us go through in life.

344
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:12,780
Some of it is in metaphor and allegory, but a lot of Kohalath is very direct.

345
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:20,000
And even in the version that is easily available in English, which would be the King

346
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,280
James version, any of the versions that are available in English are inherently currently

347
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:33,020
based upon the King James version, which is not good for accuracy's sake.

348
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:41,740
But it's, you know, chances are anyone out there listening to this is familiar with at

349
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:46,400
least a few of the phrases that come directly from Ecclesiastes.

350
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,180
Like this book of wisdom, let's say there might be called.

351
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,680
But Seth, I want to interject one more thing about that.

352
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:02,360
What's interesting in, it's OK, the level of writing, let's say, and the level of

353
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,620
comprehension that's required in many of these ancient texts, let's say, is beyond the

354
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:12,080
level of training that most people have through what's called the education system.

355
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:18,360
Right. So what's easier maybe would be to explain it in metaphor, perhaps.

356
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,280
And I like using the jigsaw puzzle metaphor for it.

357
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:30,040
And that is, most people understand what a jigsaw puzzle is, little things, little pieces

358
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:37,440
that interlock to form a whole and it produces an image that is rational and observable

359
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:44,640
where that image, when those little pieces are not interlocked, seem to not be rational or

360
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,840
understood. Right.

361
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:51,140
But what's interesting with the jigsaw puzzle as such is you let's say you were to

362
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:56,380
purchase one. They usually come in a container or a box and you see the picture of the

363
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,420
completed jigsaw puzzle on the box, let's say, cover.

364
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:05,000
And you take it home and you open it and you dump the pieces out on the table and now you

365
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,020
have to put it together. But at least you have a reference of what it should look like

366
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:11,000
when it's done. And you're always referencing the box.

367
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,340
Now, what's interesting is imagine doing a multiple piece or a many multiple piece jigsaw

368
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,620
puzzle without a reference picture.

369
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:23,040
And that is basically the condition of most of the studies that people are engaging these

370
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,700
days. To further on this metaphor, maybe beat a dead horse with it.

371
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,400
Let's say you get a jigsaw puzzle with a blue sky, a black mountain and a white snowy

372
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,120
field. Immediately when you dump all the pieces out, you look at the picture and you see

373
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,140
there's a major area of blue, major of black, major of white.

374
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:43,600
You could actually start fielding and separating the pieces, all the white pieces here,

375
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,640
black pieces here, blue pieces here.

376
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,440
And then this is how they actually fit together.

377
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:52,680
And you'll be able to go through it much quicker that way than if you really had if you

378
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,220
were just looking at each small piece and how it interlocks with another without that

379
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,820
general reference. And that is what is lacking in the world at large today is any

380
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,220
general view of any subject like that.

381
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:10,060
And that's what I call about the hijacking of information by certain groups.

382
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:14,940
That's why you have shop talk and academic talk and legal talk, scientific talk,

383
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,760
religious talk. And people hear not what's being said, but it's being said by a certain

384
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,300
specialist in a certain way.

385
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,500
Oh, that's not for me.

386
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,980
And that is what's keeping the information from everyone at this point.

387
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,000
And this will change.

388
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,080
Just to you know, also, I believe what was mentioned in that message was, you know, is

389
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,480
there a time, you know, over time these things will be understood?

390
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,100
And I think we've discussed the credits portion or it's not time yet or how to keep

391
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,200
time quite a bit, Seth.

392
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,120
Do you think we should go into it a little bit?

393
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,500
Why? Why there's timing involved, you know?

394
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:57,500
Yeah, I think that I absolutely I think that we can.

395
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:09,140
I think that this conversation is one that could be viewed outside, outside of time,

396
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:15,500
especially being that we've kind of started directly in with the subject matter that

397
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,200
we're discussing.

398
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,780
Like I said, you know, this is a great topic.

399
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:26,820
Is this one that should be discussed, you know, in private or is this one that we should

400
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:34,200
broadcast? And your response was, this will just be the the episode that never happened.

401
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,840
Right. So, so might as well.

402
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,620
Yeah, might as well.

403
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,740
Might as well.

404
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:46,180
I think that it might be perhaps beneficial to those listening to this conversation.

405
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:56,720
To dispel some of the, quite literally, actually, to dispel some of the the baseless

406
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:04,660
traditions that surround the subject matter directly that we're discussing, that being,

407
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:11,840
you know, the separation when when the soul is gone and the spirit moves on back to from

408
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:19,340
whence it came, because there is a lot of even those words and me saying them in a way

409
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:24,720
that is perhaps a little bit more uncommon than the common vernacular.

410
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:31,280
It's still going to immediately bring to mind pictures of of white clouds.

411
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:37,860
It's false. What they're talking about, the smell of brimstone, you know, et cetera, which

412
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:44,720
certainly have their place in in in the conceptualization of such things.

413
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,740
But the way in which they're used currently are just baseless.

414
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,160
Yeah, this would be as if, you know, you go to someone's house for dinner and you're

415
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:00,180
expecting a savory meal and they pull out ice cream with hot fudge and chocolate cake

416
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,540
and you're like, well, is this for dinner?

417
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,040
Or like, yeah, man, life is short.

418
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,660
Dessert is for dinner. Skip dinner, go right to dessert.

419
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,300
Right. Absolutely.

420
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,100
So let's say this is a bit of information that could be imparted.

421
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,620
I found out that a lot of people behind the scenes in media always say about you can't say

422
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,700
certain certain things.

423
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,700
You have to dumb it down.

424
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,640
The people just don't want to hear it or they don't understand it.

425
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,440
I'm like, screw that. That's that.

426
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,300
That is basically stating that the people are ignorant.

427
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,780
And I'm saying that ignorance is not the problem.

428
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,480
Ignorance can be solved very quickly.

429
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,600
The problem that the people have at large, the general majority of the people on this

430
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,500
planet is not the ignorance of something.

431
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,800
It's the stubbornness and resistance and rebelliousness to the information.

432
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,500
Right. Absolutely.

433
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,340
Yeah. What if you hear the truth and the truth and it's dissonant?

434
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,040
What if you don't like what is true?

435
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,740
That's why we keep going on.

436
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,980
I say we, whoever I've discussed this with in the past publicly, what is the definition of

437
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:02,580
the spirit, the soul and the body?

438
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:08,760
Why? Because we sort of perceive and we define ourselves by our perceptions and being

439
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,920
alive. And the three things that we're made up of is a soul, a spirit and a body.

440
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:19,680
And if two out of those three components are obscured by a democratic system, you've

441
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,680
lost. Right. So now you're lost in deception.

442
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:28,480
And if headquarters being yourself, your body, your soul and your spirit is deceived,

443
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,940
you're most likely going to just spread or be in resonance and just be involved in

444
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,580
deception for the rest of your life.

445
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,560
If headquarters is deceived, you're going to extend deception throughout your life.

446
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,380
And a lot of people have sort of come to certain realizations through being informed,

447
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,460
saying everything is a lie is a general statement.

448
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:53,180
You've heard that before. The thing is, well, if what you know about yourself, if you

449
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:56,840
think what you know about yourself is a lie, well, of course, that makes perfect sense

450
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,400
that everything else is a lie as well.

451
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:04,800
And like I've said before, if one wants to define the soul, the spirit and the body and

452
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:10,380
finds the definition of it, if you seek out beyond just the common person or man or

453
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:14,220
woman and you seek those that are supposed to be holders of that information, they will

454
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,920
resist you like I don't know what they will hear what you've said and they will come up

455
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:24,000
with a million ways to tell you it's nothing what a million different ways that it's

456
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,200
other than that and why it's not that.

457
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,400
But they will never address what you've just said.

458
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,800
It is the most fascinating thing I've ever seen with human beings.

459
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,040
I think it can be very entertaining.

460
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,520
And this doesn't happen with absolutely everyone.

461
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:43,420
But if you were to if you were to try to define the spirit, the body and the soul with

462
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:48,640
a thousand people, nine hundred and ninety, if not nine hundred and ninety five would

463
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,200
resist you and not want to hear it.

464
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,660
It's amazing.

465
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,080
It's more than ninety nine percent.

466
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:02,120
So really quickly, the body is the is the physical aspect and it can be divided down to

467
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,700
the twenty eight or so elements found in soil, you know, and then the other aspect is

468
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,020
the soul, which is your breath.

469
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:14,640
If you are breathing, whether you are insect, bird, mammal, animal or man or woman, you

470
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,360
all share the same soul.

471
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:22,000
You are breathing, meaning the soul being the breath, the inhalation, exhalation and

472
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,880
then the spirit is the mind.

473
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,980
The mind, which is your personality, what makes you you the way you think, the way you

474
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,940
speak, the way you your character, the way you behave.

475
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,800
And that is also true in the animal kingdom and in the mankind's kingdom.

476
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,520
If anyone has any pets and has had pets for many years, let's say dogs, you'll notice

477
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,600
that each dog is different because it has a different spirit, a different character.

478
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,120
Right. So that's all it is.

479
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,500
Your spirit is your mind and your soul is the breath and the body is, well, the fleshy

480
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,860
part. And that is very, very simple.

481
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,640
Now, the aspect that people are most concerned with when they get find when they when

482
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,340
they get a tangible grip on these definitions is they're concerned about the spirit

483
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,320
because, yeah, the body, I get it.

484
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,940
I get it. You know, I cut myself.

485
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,340
I put a bandage on.

486
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,239
It gets old. It's flesh.

487
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,540
Yes, I know. I know.

488
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,060
Like seawater or coconut milk is like blood plasma.

489
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,940
Yes, yes. It's very tangible, very material.

490
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,340
The soul is more difficult.

491
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,440
You know, if you're not if you're holding your breath, you've stopped your soul.

492
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:30,639
If someone is not breathing and you administer resuscitation or CPR, you're putting

493
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,340
your soul into their body so they can be a living soul.

494
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,460
And when they breathe on their own, now they are breathing with their own soul.

495
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,500
It's very simple.

496
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,199
It's sort of also materialistic.

497
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,639
But when these things are understood, then people are really concerned about the

498
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:50,520
spirit. And the spirit is intangible, but it isn't a basis

499
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:55,280
of information. Like, for example, you can buy a movie on a DVD

500
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,440
and it's a shiny disc or whatever, and it doesn't you can't see the movie unless you

501
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,560
animate it through the proper device or that movie can be streamed

502
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,920
through wires, let's say, and also wirelessly.

503
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,120
Right. So where did that movie come from?

504
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:14,840
Let's say you were to download one and you have wireless streaming.

505
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,680
It would be broadcast and sent to you from a source.

506
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,960
And that's basically how the spirit works.

507
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,020
It can be the mind is can be remotely controlled.

508
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,480
It could be remotely sent. It can be remotely initiated and remotely terminated.

509
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,520
And if I didn't lose most of the people, this is this.

510
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,740
That's a concept that is

511
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:43,640
albeit dealt with on the fringe, but that is a concept even

512
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,760
that some have tried to describe physically,

513
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,060
especially those familiar with alternative media.

514
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:55,480
The idea of the implantation of thoughts

515
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,860
or the podcast of thoughts, you know, for downloading the mind.

516
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,760
Yeah, absolutely. Those two are hard.

517
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,020
Yeah, it's possible.

518
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,440
It's actually so possible that the answer to that would be why not?

519
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:14,700
But the thing is, you know, going down this subject

520
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:18,080
without defining the three aspects and getting a firm grip on it

521
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,660
is kind of futile, because dare I say this?

522
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:26,000
There's a level of maturity that's involved, you know, within a society

523
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,360
or whether it's let's just say this within the vegetable animal

524
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,020
in mankind's kingdom, you have a concept of maturity in the vegetable kingdom.

525
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,180
It would be, well, let's say this fruit is not ripe yet, right?

526
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,380
It's not ready in the animal kingdom.

527
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,900
It would be, you know, the very young puppy or the little kitten.

528
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,760
And in mankind's kingdom, it would be the child.

529
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,460
The problem with mankind's kingdom, unlike the others, is that

530
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,280
when let me just I'll dare say this.

531
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,800
When people go out in society, they very invariably see

532
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,020
that there are less mature people physically.

533
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,600
They're small and they don't like the subculture of kids

534
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,320
or that they call children's.

535
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:07,120
They've created a subculture around children with kids, meals and toys

536
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,240
and things just specifically for them.

537
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,320
They're just small people.

538
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,500
That much hasn't been imparted to them.

539
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,280
Lacking experience, the entire kids culture,

540
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,460
children's culture, I find repugnant.

541
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,960
But nonetheless, moving forward, when they see someone that's adolescent

542
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,060
or in their 30s or 40s, let's say more mature or already

543
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,700
what's called an adult or someone really old with gray hair,

544
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,420
they discern maturity that way.

545
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,440
And let me just say it this way.

546
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,700
That is physical maturity.

547
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,500
But I assure you that most people you've ever met, regardless of their age,

548
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,940
have stopped developing

549
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,900
spiritual maturity around the ages between nine and 12 years old.

550
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:51,060
I dare anyone to approach, especially a scholarly type in any of

551
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,960
the talk that we're discussing regarding ancient texts

552
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,720
or what's called spirituality or biblical or scriptural.

553
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,820
And have a try to have a sober discussion with them

554
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,560
about how religions, no religion on the planet is based on any of the text.

555
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,260
And watch how their mind all of a sudden

556
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,520
is revealed to be roughly in the eight to nine to 12 year old mentality.

557
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,780
And most people take it for granted when they see an older person

558
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:22,120
walk into the room that this person is mature and has wisdom.

559
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,000
And I beg to differ.

560
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,740
And I will tell you, the majority do not.

561
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,700
So if you want to consider that the Greeks opinion, fine.

562
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,060
But it's a statement that needs to be considered very, very closely.

563
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,740
So this subject, again, requires maturity.

564
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,400
So let's go back to the spirit, the soul and the body.

565
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,380
Once these things are understood, then the rest can go on.

566
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,720
Like the discussion can go on.

567
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,380
What happens to the the spirit when it's, I guess, disembodied?

568
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,520
Right, because the soul dies when the body dies.

569
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,720
Right. And that's one of the first things that how do we determine

570
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,120
if someone is dead, right?

571
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,160
Right.

572
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,960
What's the mirror under their nose?

573
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,960
Right. See if they still have a soul, which is breathing.

574
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,800
Right. Right.

575
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,100
So, you know, it's breathing.

576
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,420
It's interesting.

577
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,760
And it's come up in conversation.

578
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,900
Some people have asked questions like, is it possible that they

579
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,220
they were buried and they still had a soul?

580
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,640
I'm like, well, that means they were buried alive then. Yes.

581
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,300
That's harder.

582
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,100
That's that's burying someone alive.

583
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,800
And then you have this other thing.

584
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,660
It's just the most ridiculous stuff, especially in the alternative media.

585
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,980
These people are soulless, you know, referring to certain oligarchs, you know.

586
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,460
And I'm like, well, if they're soulless, it means they're dead.

587
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,180
And if they're dead, it doesn't really matter.

588
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,220
Maybe it's their descendants you're talking about.

589
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,460
Then I don't I don't understand what these people are trying to say.

590
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,440
You see, you've heard that.

591
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,800
So if they're if you're not breathing, you don't have a soul.

592
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,820
The spirit or the mind is completely different.

593
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:49,020
So what's interesting about the spirit, it just like a DVD,

594
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:53,100
it requires a device, let's say, let's let's be materialistic on this

595
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,500
to animate that information or make it analog.

596
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,140
Because the spirit in itself is completely intangible.

597
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,240
You don't know the character of a person or even an animal unless they're animated.

598
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,180
You know, you can have a thousand people asleep in bed

599
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,680
and you can walk in while they're all asleep

600
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,280
and you cannot discern the character of the individual until they're animated.

601
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,440
You see, so the spirit needs to be animated.

602
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,500
Now, they still have a spirit.

603
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,280
They're just unconscious at the moment.

604
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,840
So what's interesting about the spirit is that it's incarnated,

605
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,120
it's excarnated and then reincarnated.

606
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,500
And I'm not talking about past lives.

607
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,080
There's no such thing. Sorry, folks.

608
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,980
There's a lot of people out there flapping their lips and gums

609
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,480
about being here before in past lives and all that.

610
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,660
And have fun with it.

611
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,980
If it brings you joy to be entertained with such erroneous information,

612
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,320
who am I to get between you and your pursuit of happiness?

613
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,540
But I'm telling you that it's going to be quite interesting.

614
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,060
And people will take it lying down.

615
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,360
Now, when people find out that most of the information

616
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,800
that they highly regard as being spiritual is absolute rubbish in the future.

617
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,640
I wonder if they're going to take it lying down

618
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,860
or there's going to be a lot of streetlights with rope.

619
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,940
I'm just I just think they're going to take it lying down and say, oh, big deal.

620
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,280
We got fooled. It's no big deal.

621
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,160
But the spirit is incarnated, excarnated, which is when you die.

622
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,040
It leaves the device incarnated would be you put the DVD into the DVD player,

623
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:20,700
excarnated as you remove the DVD from the DVD player

624
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:25,280
and then erase the DVD or write over it where it's just blank now.

625
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,100
Right. And it goes back.

626
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,340
Right. But it's sent into another realm that you no longer have access to.

627
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,500
Now, let's just get specific with this.

628
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,300
You know, what's interesting is there's something called the heavenly realm.

629
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,240
All right. Now, if you want to consider it a place where, you know,

630
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,800
that's tangible and can be located, which I in private can't say it can be

631
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,580
because we're given location of this, let's say, headquarters in the scripture.

632
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,200
But it hasn't been discussed and it can be discussed.

633
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,220
I will do it in private.

634
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,200
The the heavenly realm is where the spirit came from for mankind.

635
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,760
And when man is excarnated, it goes back there.

636
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,360
Now, whether they you know, I like to joke around and say that they have the big

637
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:12,240
master hard drive where you're just, you know, reinstalled into again and inanimated.

638
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,460
There's no consciousness there.

639
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:19,340
Just like when you have the the DVD player removed from the DVD player and all the power is off.

640
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,520
You're not watching the movie, you know.

641
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,140
Now, what's interesting, just in contrast to that, we're told in the ancient texts.

642
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,920
Now, by the way, when we're discussing this, it's it's not our opinion.

643
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,240
Anyone can look this up.

644
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:36,220
And the thing is, if you consider the this information making it forward to this modern day

645
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:41,020
and being preserved for so long as being frivolous, not important and based on opinion and

646
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,820
belief and the people that came before us.

647
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:49,320
Yes. Also, your forefathers, whoever is listening, people that came before you or worthless

648
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,520
idiots and primitives.

649
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,320
And this information means nothing because you have silly phones and you have rockets

650
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,760
and planes. Then this is obviously this information is not for you.

651
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:07,100
But if you believe that those that came before you took great I went to great lengths and

652
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:11,700
labor to make sure this information is forwarded to this day and should be considered as a

653
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,380
valid communication, then this information is for you.

654
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,700
I just wanted to throw that in.

655
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:20,860
But in contrast with man's spirit going into, let's say, back to the heavenly realm and

656
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:25,200
being downgloaded completely unconscious, the animal spirit, it's interesting, we're told

657
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,920
goes back down into the earth.

658
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:35,000
Wow. So the earth houses the minds of the creatures, the animal we call the animal

659
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,360
kingdom included the insects.

660
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,000
Fascinating.

661
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,920
Isn't that interesting?

662
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,720
You know, what a field of study on its own.

663
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:48,420
And I dare anyone to go down this field of study because you're not going to make any

664
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,640
friends and your family will hate you.

665
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,240
So anyway, what did I just say that publicly?

666
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,800
Hmm. OK, let's let's listen.

667
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,240
That's accurate. I can attest to that as well.

668
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,760
That's right. You will really find out what it means to be, quote unquote, human.

669
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,540
And let me just bring this bring this point out.

670
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,560
I like bringing this up for whatever reason.

671
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,740
Earth is a very violent place.

672
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
And someone said, what evidence do you have of that?

673
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:19,120
I said, I dare anyone to turn on any animal kingdom type documentary and show me where

674
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,440
something isn't eating anything else violently.

675
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:27,580
Right now. And a lot of people are talking about doom and gloom and oh, government

676
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,520
clampdowns, natural disasters, survivalism.

677
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,440
I'm like, are you kidding?

678
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,500
How ungrateful you are.

679
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:40,360
You should be thanking whatever force or just just existing that if no one crawled in

680
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,780
through your window last night while you were sleeping and didn't rip your liver out of

681
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,600
your body and if they if you caught them doing that and asked them why they were doing

682
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,480
that, they said, I don't need a reason to do it.

683
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,580
I just feel like it.

684
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,360
This is the real reality where you're living, folks.

685
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,900
And people need to stop taking things for granted because you are in a situation of

686
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,920
peace right now that you know nothing about.

687
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,160
Yes, there's over maybe a hundred conflicts going on all over the world.

688
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,960
But if you ask the people that started them and are involved in them, they're saying it's

689
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,220
just a freaking sport.

690
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:12,440
And you do like sports as a society.

691
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,120
So anyway, yeah, this is a very violent place.

692
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,860
But the thing is, people have failed to take they're taking too many of the pleasantries

693
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:26,040
for granted. So let's I think we covered a little bit about the spirit, the soul and

694
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:31,340
the body. I mean, we went over it quickly and sort of like interjecting certain conditions

695
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,780
about the information, which I think always has to be done.

696
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:38,760
Let's just go on and bounce around a little bit over here.

697
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,580
You know, like there's a question also about what is pleasing in the scripture.

698
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:47,880
You know, what is pleasing that what has been memorialized from the past or from a higher

699
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,180
vantage point, let's say.

700
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:53,360
And by the way, when I say the scripture and all that, you know, people say, well, who

701
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,920
wrote that? You know, well, who did that?

702
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,440
Or whatever, you know, that is really, really interesting.

703
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,420
And it could be valid.

704
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:07,140
But to me, those types of questions are that now you're looking at the delivery mechanism

705
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,320
and not the information that's being imparted.

706
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,480
Right. People say, who wrote that?

707
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,860
Whatever, you know, I don't believe in that.

708
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,980
That was written by whatever.

709
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:19,800
Here's the point. You know, it's kind of like, you know, people receive the post or the

710
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,200
mail. And when do they hold the delivery person?

711
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,780
Let's say the mailman or the postman accountable for the quality of the message that

712
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,840
they're receiving. When do they ever do that?

713
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:37,000
Hardly ever given the given the mailman grief about grammatical error.

714
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:45,160
Yes, so so you receive this, this is goes back to almost any subject when you let's put

715
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:50,580
the common man aside because this is about uncommon things, by the way, when you go to

716
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:55,480
the entitled classes regarding any field and you show them that what their field of

717
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,920
study should be based on or the basis of their field of study, they will hear it and not

718
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,520
want to address it and will give you a million reasons why you shouldn't say that or why

719
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,080
it isn't so. But never address what you're saying, what it should be based on.

720
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:09,360
It's simply a communication.

721
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,600
So, again, just to go back to it, what is pleasing and how should one conduct their

722
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,340
life? I guess that would be what's called setting ones apart.

723
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:20,380
Some setting oneself, oneself apart.

724
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:27,000
Once you get over the taking for granted things, once you once you establish that Earth

725
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:34,220
is a violent place and you made it by the skin of your teeth alive another day, and

726
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:40,140
most people don't consider that when they wake up, that they're fortunate that they

727
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,460
hadn't been eaten while they were sleeping by others.

728
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,780
They take it for granted. Once you get out of that realm and you don't take that for

729
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,840
granted and you are grateful, then you could see what's more pleasurable.

730
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,140
And that's by setting yourself apart from the rest.

731
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:57,380
And maybe we'll save more discussion about being saved, setting yourself apart, because

732
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:01,060
the other point was events that are come to pass.

733
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:07,060
And he also mentioned the evangelicalism, which I almost don't want to address the

734
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,540
spirit, the soul and the body we did.

735
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:11,120
And then he also brought up the point of the little ones.

736
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:12,980
What do you tell little people?

737
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:16,680
And thrown in there is the concept of the end.

738
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:22,100
So maybe we could just go through that before what being set being set apart is to find

739
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,520
pleasure and how that's recommended.

740
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,340
What do you think, Seth?

741
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,880
Yeah, I think that is a wonderful way of going about it.

742
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:33,420
We are about, oh, probably eight minutes from the break.

743
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,780
Yeah, let's let's get into time then, because you just brought up some time.

744
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:44,020
Absolutely. The three concepts here to consider is that first concept is if anything

745
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:48,100
is being discussed, because man has descended into materialism clearly.

746
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:56,980
Clearly descended into materialism, we need a basis for things, and I just got a message

747
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:04,200
that I'm not being heard if anybody else thinks that we're not everything looks good

748
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,160
here. OK, great.

749
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:11,560
OK, so there's a there's a material Rudolf Steiner, interestingly, made something called

750
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,140
the man's descent into materialism.

751
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:19,600
And when when one is extremely materialistic, one should seek out the basis of what

752
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,960
something is based on.

753
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:26,040
And interestingly enough, although it is a materialistic society, mostly everything is

754
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,100
debased. If you look at the money, they call it fiat money.

755
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:33,460
It's based on nothing. If you look at science, it's based on things that stories that

756
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:38,160
they make up and theory religions we covered already that they're not based on what

757
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:41,220
they're supposed to be based on, so on and so on and so on.

758
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:45,700
When we talk about time, what is it based on right now?

759
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:50,860
The planet, the surface dwelling earth inhabitants are of all agreed that they're

760
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:54,880
keeping time with what's known as the Gregorian calendar based on Julian calendar

761
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,100
dates. And what is simply what simply can be said with that in a short phrase, that is

762
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,700
nothing more than the papal work schedule for the papal subjects.

763
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,580
It is an arbitrary work schedule.

764
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,420
You cannot keep time with it.

765
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:11,980
And the purpose of saying that is very simple that anyone could evidence.

766
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:17,440
If you observe a certain date on that calendar system, you'll notice how it's a

767
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,440
different day of the week every year.

768
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:26,360
Very simple. And if you start researching how they formulate months and dates and

769
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:29,780
days and years, they are arbitrary.

770
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:37,940
And there is nothing wrong with that if you have an allegiance to such an authority

771
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,580
as a subject to perform certain duties.

772
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,140
Wow, that was a mouthful.

773
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:49,280
But you can't keep time with it and it's based on nothing, right?

774
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:55,840
It's arbitrary. For example, you can keep a schedule, you can build something, but as

775
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:01,880
far as the concept of time and being a recordation of events through our

776
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,540
perception, it's inaccurate and irrelevant.

777
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:11,760
And they make they try to make corrections to it, you know, over over the moons and

778
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,860
over the months, months and the ages.

779
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:24,220
But even that only gives it a an appearance of of a semblance of accuracy where the

780
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,300
accuracy is just not there to be had.

781
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:31,160
Or you could say it's cheese not made of milk, you know, and cheese is supposed to be

782
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:34,220
made of milk. You know, I was shocked, you know, cheese product.

783
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,920
Yeah, I was once at a supermarket and the lady said, do you like a sample of this?

784
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,220
What is it? It's cheese made with milk.

785
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,960
And I was shocked. I was like, are you kidding?

786
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,980
What is it? If it's not made of cheese, what are you talking about?

787
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,080
It's cheese made of milk.

788
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,560
What is cheese supposed to be made of?

789
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,160
And that's what the calendar is.

790
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,460
You know, it's the most funny.

791
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,700
And the thing I just want to throw in here again is there's a lot of people on the

792
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:58,220
alternative media bad mouthing the papacy, the Vatican, so on and so forth.

793
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,020
And I'm like, oh, what a ignorant hypocrite.

794
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,760
And first, all you got to do is ask them what day it is.

795
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,600
And you know what? They're going to say something between January through December,

796
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,280
Monday through Friday. They've just admitted with their own mouth that they're a papal

797
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,200
subject, whether they know it or not.

798
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,220
And they are speaking against their master.

799
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:19,080
Oh, boy. Do you think there's sort of problems with things going on?

800
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,100
Because people are anyway.

801
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,800
Yeah. So one of the certainly adds to the confusion.

802
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,060
Yes, it does. So there's the hypocrisy.

803
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:32,800
So the other thing I want to discuss is a statement that I've made is that the what's

804
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,440
interesting about a movie and I kind of feel bad giving movie references because years

805
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:38,700
ago, people didn't do that.

806
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,900
And it's it's part of the dumbing down of society.

807
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:42,440
But let's just do it for communication.

808
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,060
It seems like it's an easy colloquial reference.

809
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,300
It is. And they're very such of such poor quality.

810
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,440
But let's just give it this way.

811
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:54,320
If you had to shoot a two hour film, do you buy exactly two hours worth of film or do

812
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,560
you need two hours and ten minutes credits in the end?

813
00:52:58,620 --> 00:52:59,460
Right. Yeah, that would be.

814
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,800
Yeah. Right.

815
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:06,700
Now, what's interesting is if you were to run a multi-millennial film and end it, how

816
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,780
long should the credits be?

817
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,720
Well, you know, that's already, you know, that requires a sense of discernment.

818
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,900
And if I'm just going to drop that information in a quantitative value, I don't think it

819
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,600
gives much value to it.

820
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:23,100
But what what I can say is right now, for at least 18 years, mankind society has been

821
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,840
in the credits portion of the movie.

822
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,040
Now, what's interesting, very few.

823
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:32,380
See, let's go back to the movie when the movie during the movie, people get very

824
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:36,320
disturbed if their view of the screen is blocked or someone is speaking.

825
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,360
They all get together and say, shut up, sit down.

826
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:43,200
The movie's playing. And here we are getting ready for the break.

827
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:45,560
So we'll talk a little bit more about the credits.

828
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:50,640
Greetings, everyone. And this is Uncommon Sense with Seth at American Freedom Radio.

829
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,880
Seth, are you with us? Yes.

830
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,840
Excellent. Great. And that was a good break for us.

831
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,140
And let's get back to it.

832
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:04,080
We're talking about the credits portion of human, let's say, society or man society on

833
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:10,200
the planet. And we discussed briefly how when the film is running, people get

834
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:15,040
disturbed. But when the credits come on, they're not as upset.

835
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:19,240
When someone is speaking or disturbing the picture, but technically the film is still

836
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,500
running. And what's interesting, I like to say when people talk about end times or

837
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,180
all these bad things are going to happen, I'm like, what are you talking about?

838
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,020
It all ended already and no one has noticed.

839
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:35,000
And that is the beauty of understanding or comprehending how the the the formative

840
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,500
aspect or the the the primary, let's say, the spiritual world interacts with the

841
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:44,180
physical world. They're very careful about not having too many disturbances until the

842
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:49,400
time for their overt presence is considered or to be manifest, let's say.

843
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:56,160
Right. So what's interesting about the credits part of the movie is let's just take

844
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,960
six thousand years of recorded history.

845
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:01,880
Would you say about 40 years is pretty ample for credits?

846
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:07,960
You know, so if we're looking at roughly 1998, you could add roughly around that much

847
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,880
time to it and then say, well, it's been cut short, so let's round it down a little bit

848
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,880
more. It's quite interesting, isn't it?

849
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:19,360
And what's what's interesting, I just want to throw something in in here for everyone, is

850
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:25,000
that when something comes to an end, when promises are made about something and that

851
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,620
something comes to an end, if a certain promise is not fulfilled or desire, people feel

852
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:35,540
cheated or they want to make excuses about why they didn't get what they were sort of

853
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:37,080
imagining they were supposed to get.

854
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:42,940
Right. So what's interesting about this and let's just throw out real, real serious

855
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:49,200
disclosure about the matter here is that regardless of who you are, when you've lived

856
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,040
on this planet, man, woman or child, you all like pleasant things.

857
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:54,920
What you like is peace.

858
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:59,180
You'd like prosperity, food, clothing, shelter.

859
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,480
When you're hungry, you'd like food.

860
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,660
When you're thirsty, you like drink.

861
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,260
When you're warm, you want to be cool.

862
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:04,620
And when you're cool, you want to be warm.

863
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,440
You'd like comfort.

864
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:06,960
You don't like violence.

865
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,220
You don't like disturbance.

866
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,000
You don't like chaos. And yes, there's a lot of talk about war and quote unquote terrorism.

867
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:17,540
But even if you look at that, supposedly they have a reason for doing those things to achieve a

868
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:20,940
certain end. Typically, I'm not discussing that violent side.

869
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:26,960
I'm discussing that everyone on this planet at any time, any given time wants, I'm going to put

870
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,000
this in very big air quotes, a perfect society.

871
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,200
What would be a perfect society?

872
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:40,420
It would be peace, prosperity, liberty, liberty, meaning time off from things that you have

873
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:42,880
allegiance to or things you said you were going to do.

874
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,820
Health. So on and so forth, all the pleasant things on a social level.

875
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,480
And here's the thing, folks, coming around what you call the 2020s, you're going to have a

876
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,900
society on this planet that is going to incorporate all of those things.

877
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,900
Yes, you are. So where's the doom and gloom in that?

878
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:08,700
The interesting thing, and here's the disclosure part, is that when this manifests, and I'm not

879
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:14,860
discussing a propagandized global perfect society, like, for example, one example of that

880
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:21,560
would be, let's say, the former Soviet Union, where you saw the people or being told you

881
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:23,560
are we're establishing a perfect society.

882
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:29,200
And what you saw was three thousand people online in knee deep snow for toilet paper.

883
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,140
That's not what I'm talking about.

884
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,820
A propagandized idea.

885
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,120
I'm talking about an actualization in the material.

886
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:42,660
Everyone can have everyone's going to eat beef and potatoes for dinner and have strawberries for

887
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,400
dessert. What if I don't want strawberries?

888
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,480
You're going to do exactly as we tell you.

889
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:51,040
Right. You're going to eat those strawberries and you're going to like it.

890
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,960
That's right. Not like that either.

891
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,980
To some extent, it will be.

892
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,580
But here's the disclosure on the deception that's coming that many people read about.

893
00:57:58,620 --> 00:57:59,660
There's a great deception.

894
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,160
And this is it. Let's just say it.

895
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,400
Why not? Why the heck not?

896
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:09,360
When this is manifested in the late 2020s, roughly, you're going to be told, obviously,

897
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:12,940
again and again, you may not have to be told because it's pretty obvious that you are in a

898
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:15,360
very good golden age type society.

899
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,300
And this is how it's going to be for the next thousand years.

900
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:25,200
And most people will buy it hook, line and sinker and say, why the heck not?

901
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:28,300
Because, look, this is no propaganda.

902
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,400
This is manifest.

903
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:35,780
That is the deception, because shortly after this is manifested, the glitches are going to

904
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:41,780
start to kick in and the high command of your whether it's national or global level is

905
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:45,840
going to start making very unusual requests of the population.

906
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:52,120
And these unusual requests are going to be sort of unreasonable and pretty much unlawful,

907
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:59,420
but using certain laws to get everything on track again and to take care of these

908
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:03,480
glitches so we can get back on the road and have the next thousand years sort of be

909
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,700
perfect. And it's not going to work.

910
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,700
The more they're trying to fix these glitches, the worst it's going to get.

911
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,000
And this perfect society is only going to last a few years.

912
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,940
When I say a few, meaning a few, three or four.

913
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:17,840
So that is the great deception.

914
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,120
You you mean perfect.

915
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:25,980
It's going to be unlike anything experienced at the very least in recorded history, a time

916
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:30,140
of peace and prosperity for everyone.

917
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:34,640
That's right. And the reason why they're going to fall for it is because they're not going

918
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:39,320
to be able to go back in history and find a time on a global level that is anything like

919
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:44,120
it. And because of that, they're going to be so enthralled and enamored with the

920
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:50,020
achievement that any anything speaking counter to it is going to be met with, what

921
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,300
should we say, great aversion.

922
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:58,860
So, yeah, this is we just we just thought we'd drop this right now at this time.

923
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:03,260
And speaking of time, by the way, I'm sort of reckoning it's around the 13th day of the

924
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:05,460
second month. I just wanted to throw that in the second moon.

925
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:11,120
So but yeah, so this is a disclosure about what I mean about time and what's coming.

926
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:16,760
And that is the time where, for example, let's just entertain one thought within that

927
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:21,160
thought of the credits and the perfect society when everything is really going really

928
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,320
well and, you know, it's not.

929
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,600
But everyone else doesn't.

930
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:27,980
It's pretty easy to gather things together if you wanted to separate yourself, quote

931
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:31,940
unquote, air quotes again, being a survivalist and getting away from society.

932
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,880
It would be quite easy to do that.

933
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:40,860
An example would be, you know, if if the opposite of that would be like, let's say

934
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:46,080
there's a disaster being broadcast in the media and a few days later you decide to go

935
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:48,580
to the supermarket to stock up and all the shelves are empty.

936
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,660
You waited a little too long and, you know, the panic has been ensued publicly and

937
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:54,000
everyone is heated to the panic.

938
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:58,640
So see, but when when it's time, when you see this prosperity and everyone is very

939
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:03,480
relaxed, that would be the time to start gathering what you wanted to gather to be by

940
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,160
yourself and about a three days walk from anyone else.

941
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,220
And there's another reason why I'm saying three days walk.

942
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:10,200
But that's another subject.

943
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:16,400
So it's going to be very fitting for those that know and they're going to be very few

944
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,460
that actually can see it because almost everyone's going to be deceived into it.

945
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:26,360
So let's just say let's just put that that aside again, because it's about being setting

946
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,640
yourself apart. What's interesting here, let's bounce around again a little.

947
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:33,900
We have a little bit of time, but I have to watch it because it goes by really quickly.

948
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:39,640
The individual mentioned evangelicalism or whether it's that or any other form of

949
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:44,400
religion, I have to hearken back to the firm statement, which I will stand and anyone

950
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,000
can stand firmly behind it.

951
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:52,540
There is no religion at all, institution or group that knows or does anything that's

952
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:54,480
allegedly in the text that they subscribe to.

953
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:55,960
It's out of context.

954
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,120
If they say they do, it's very simple to see.

955
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:00,700
Very, very simple.

956
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:05,560
But again, going down this path, you're not going to make any friends.

957
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,860
And people like to have those sorts of things.

958
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,780
You know, they like to be part of a group and such.

959
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:17,280
So I really rarely I have addressed specifics about, quote unquote, Christianity in prior

960
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:21,120
public speakings in a way that is very matter of fact.

961
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:27,680
But the fact is, the purpose of giving information is not to address such an organization

962
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:30,800
or belief system because it's not.

963
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:37,320
We like to stay on things that are based on something other than belief or a cultural

964
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:42,940
phenomenon or social phenomenon or the reason why people should get together and believe

965
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:46,660
in something. That is not the purpose of discussing uncommon sense.

966
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:54,140
Anyone can clearly see the anomalies and the distortions and the unbasedness of any

967
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:59,160
religion. The symptoms are prevalent through all of them.

968
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:03,760
Yeah, it doesn't matter. Let's just want to mention them specifically would be

969
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,860
Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism.

970
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:09,320
You want to go down the line, go down the line.

971
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:14,160
They're all none of them are based on on what they say they're basing it on and their

972
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:19,460
followers at all. And one of the strong comments I like to make is if you consider

973
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:25,040
yourself to be a Christian or Jewish or Muslim and you go ahead and study the book that

974
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:29,160
it's supposed to be based on, there is no way you could call you would call yourself one of

975
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:33,540
those in that group. Now, there are many that have studied the text and they say, wow,

976
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,620
I seem to have an upper hand.

977
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,540
I sound like one of the more informative ones.

978
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,780
I'm going to take advantage of all these people following.

979
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:43,660
Now, I'm not talking about those people, the predatory types.

980
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:48,800
There are a lot of people within these religions that do comprehend what's in the text,

981
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:56,100
but because they are predatory in nature, they go back into the group and promulgate

982
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,220
whatever they do within the group.

983
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,520
It's a really sick system if you look into it.

984
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:03,200
And the same goes for the scientists and the legal society.

985
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,900
Yes, there are attorneys and judges that know law, but they're like, wow, what we're this

986
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:12,760
society has nothing to do with this, but I'm going to go back in because now I have an

987
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:16,140
upper hand and the same with the scientific community and so on and so forth.

988
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:22,540
And any individualized institution that mankind's involved with, there's always a within

989
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:27,520
the hierarchy of that entitled class, there is a predatory group that does know the truth,

990
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:33,800
but fails to reveal it and takes part in the group in a predatory perspective.

991
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,500
I think I said predatory enough times there.

992
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:42,860
So, so, you know, so again, there's the concept also of what to do that's pleasant.

993
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:48,700
Well, what's interesting is if you establish that Earth is a very, very violent place and

994
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:53,760
you've made it another day without being torn to pieces or eaten or put in a box, let's

995
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:58,300
say, however, whatever you want to call it, kidnapped in a prison, in a cell, in a camp

996
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,920
or beaten to death or anything like that, you should be very grateful.

997
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,660
Right. And this is not doom and gloom about something to come.

998
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:07,580
This is the situation of being on this planet.

999
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:14,300
And once you are such you, you are grateful of having being having a certain level of

1000
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:18,240
health and peace in your life and you haven't been dismembered the night before.

1001
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:24,380
It's it's actually a very realistic point of view to take, which most cannot because it

1002
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:30,620
requires a certain level of my spiritual mind maturity to understand the reality of any

1003
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:36,280
situation. But once you do understand that, you'll see that there's a way to set yourself

1004
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,780
apart. And how do you do that?

1005
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:44,060
Given the metaphor of what's called an operating system, you know, let's say using the

1006
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:47,660
metaphor of a computer, you have an operating system and then you have a program and a

1007
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:53,040
file. All operating systems come for mankind, come from your deity, from your God.

1008
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,780
And this might sound dogmatic.

1009
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:57,060
And yes, there is no such thing as a God.

1010
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,120
It's a plurality.

1011
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:04,660
Just like when someone says the word army, no one ever thinks of one individual.

1012
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,080
It is a plurality.

1013
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:13,120
And when people try to approach and define and defend or apologize for them using God,

1014
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:14,180
they have no detail.

1015
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:17,660
It's talking about the creator or the chief God.

1016
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,160
They have no detail on it.

1017
01:06:19,660 --> 01:06:26,640
And it's no different than going to a mechanic and no detail on the automobile and asks you

1018
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,140
where the steering wheel on the car is.

1019
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,300
I mean, they're not much of a mechanic.

1020
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:34,960
So we have a society here that is fully capable of comprehending details, functional

1021
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,380
details, but refuses to.

1022
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:42,800
OK, and they're being accommodated with these texts that are obscure and ambiguous, and

1023
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:47,020
they go around talking about things that don't exist as the way they should.

1024
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:53,620
So being set apart is figuring out what your operating system is, and that comes from your

1025
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:58,180
God. That's why when you look at, for example, law forms, they always prop a deity in

1026
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:03,020
front of you. And right now, the law form of the earth is a revival of the ancient goddess

1027
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:07,480
religion known as justicia or justice or decay or Mott, if you go back in time.

1028
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:11,920
There's always a God put in front of you, whether it's scientific.

1029
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:16,680
They'll show you a Prometheus type character or a character holding lightning bolts.

1030
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:19,080
There's always a deity behind an operating system.

1031
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:22,800
And people are very neatly and conveniently based on their lack of maturity.

1032
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,060
So this under the rug to acknowledge it.

1033
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:27,680
Every nation has a patron deity.

1034
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:31,140
Sorry, I'm not making this up.

1035
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:39,700
It's very simple to observe in the literature, even specifically in this group of 50 some

1036
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:42,960
countries that, you know, you and I find ourselves in.

1037
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:52,840
It's it's very specifically in the literature that defines, you know, the the the purpose

1038
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:58,220
of the existence of this country, justice and liberty for all.

1039
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,980
Yeah. Which is a revival of the ancient goddess religion.

1040
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:05,780
So the so right there, stop, everyone hit the pause button.

1041
01:08:05,860 --> 01:08:08,460
What do you know about ancient goddess religions?

1042
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:13,540
There's plenty of it. Actually, there's not that much of it online, unfortunately.

1043
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:18,680
But if you if you sort of are savvy with doing searching online electronically or digitally,

1044
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,319
you will find things.

1045
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,740
And guess what? It's not very pleasant.

1046
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:27,359
It's a lot of cruelty. And it also happens at the descent of a society.

1047
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:33,180
Most societies, let's just say the Babylonian, Greek, Roman, so on and so forth, at the end

1048
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:38,520
of the height or the before the fall of their prominence, had adopted this type of goddess

1049
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:44,620
religion. So anyway, we've we can go down the goddess religion path in the future.

1050
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:46,200
But that is not the point.

1051
01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:50,500
The point is that your law form, when I say law, I'm not talking about what you call traffic

1052
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,500
law, tax law or what they do in courts as law.

1053
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:57,020
I'm talking about what you eat, what you wear, how you keep time, how you conduct yourself,

1054
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:01,380
how you raise a family, how you form a contract, how you keep time.

1055
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:02,840
All these things are your law form.

1056
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,100
What why do you do what you do is your law form.

1057
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:10,620
And that comes from your God, your God, I said, not the God, because there are many.

1058
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:13,720
So pick one. Interesting, isn't it?

1059
01:09:13,979 --> 01:09:15,260
Greek, you sound really dogmatic.

1060
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:19,439
Sorry, I'm just trying to give people a clear, concise report on what can be viewed

1061
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:26,399
objectively. And I'm just really I don't I don't think I doubt that it's coming across

1062
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,279
as dogmatic. OK, I just wanted to throw that in there.

1063
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:34,979
And you will find there is some kind of deific or deification within the subject matter of

1064
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:37,899
anything, even music.

1065
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:41,180
They say this guy is such a good heavy metal musician.

1066
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:42,399
He is a god.

1067
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:46,180
You know, look at Elvis Presley and the immortalization.

1068
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:50,700
You know, I mean, it's just it's just so blatantly in front of everyone and no one is

1069
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:53,900
speaking on it. That's henceforth uncommon sense.

1070
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:57,500
So moving forward, what does one do about being set apart?

1071
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,160
Set apart is a very simple thing.

1072
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:04,280
If you establish that you're getting a well-paying job, let's say working in the sewer,

1073
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:10,620
do you jump in there naked and drink the water or do you set yourself apart by putting on

1074
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,740
a full hazmat suit with breathing tanks?

1075
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,540
Now, hopefully the latter, hopefully the latter.

1076
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:22,320
And the way you set yourself apart is is really what is discussed in what's called the

1077
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,060
scripture. Yes, let's just go ahead and say it.

1078
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,560
Now, there's about there are a few hundred rules in there.

1079
01:10:26,580 --> 01:10:29,480
But what's interesting about it, about how to set yourself apart?

1080
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,220
Yes, there are rules. Yes, you don't like that word, but that's too bad.

1081
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:37,640
Most of the rules have to do with certain ordinances regarding a certain edifice which no

1082
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:42,840
longer exists. And the other part of most of those rules are regarding the rules of the

1083
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:48,620
people that were to operate that edifice, which cannot really exist in that way because the

1084
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:49,560
edifice doesn't exist.

1085
01:10:49,740 --> 01:10:54,200
So the other small handful of rules is what you do when you're just basically on the earth in

1086
01:10:54,200 --> 01:11:00,080
general form. And it has to do with what to eat and why, what to wear and why, how you go into

1087
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:02,280
business and why, how you keep time and why.

1088
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:07,100
And actually the how to keep time and why is actually sort of obscure.

1089
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:08,400
That's kind of spread out.

1090
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:12,900
That would be like the white field on the jigsaw puzzle that you have to piece it together to

1091
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,000
kind of see the whole picture.

1092
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:20,060
Going back to that, so what's interesting about this is what does one do and how does one

1093
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:21,180
set themselves apart?

1094
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:25,400
Like I think we've once discussed the word holy is not in the text itself.

1095
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:31,820
It's the word kodesh or agio, Hebrew and Greek corresponding, which means to set oneself

1096
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:37,480
apart. And then the Greek agios means geos, meaning Gaia or earth, and a means without,

1097
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:38,640
not non-worldly.

1098
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:44,660
Very interesting. So setting oneself apart, you know, if you have an apple orchard and you're

1099
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:49,440
farmer, when you do your crop harvest, you know, you have all the general apples, the ones

1100
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,220
with been pecked with a hole in it go for the applesauce.

1101
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:56,400
The fairly good ones get, you know, a grade A standard, but then you have some perfect ones

1102
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:02,220
that you set apart for maybe a display or photographer or are sent to like a hot cuisine

1103
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:04,460
type thing because they're almost perfect apples.

1104
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:09,420
And what makes them perfect is that you've judged them to be such and you set them apart

1105
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:10,180
from the rest.

1106
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:15,080
There's one definition of it, perhaps.

1107
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:16,640
Now, what do you do with the little ones?

1108
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:18,620
Right. That was one of the concerns here.

1109
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:21,500
Let's let's let's just be practical about this.

1110
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:27,740
I've done discussions about how parents interact with children, and I think I've voiced the

1111
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:33,140
yes, it's an opinion, how I find it repugnant that there's been a subculture for kids or

1112
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:37,740
children, subculture, meaning they have their own entertainment, their own little meals,

1113
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:41,260
their own little funny little toys and things like that.

1114
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:46,420
And they're treated in an immature, quote unquote, way in some parallel reality to society

1115
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:49,240
when, in fact, all they are is small people.

1116
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:56,020
That the reason they lack understanding is because they have not been inputted, they have

1117
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:57,940
not received the input or the experience.

1118
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:01,800
And creating this subculture, I find completely repugnant.

1119
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:05,060
But nonetheless, what do you do with the little ones?

1120
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:09,580
Typically in this society, the model of society now is give them enough training to go and

1121
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:13,640
function in the world with some sort of career and then function in some sort of

1122
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:19,060
retirement. That little statement or a few statements that I just made cover a reality

1123
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:24,460
of past year formative years, like four or five, six, all the way to perhaps later years in

1124
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:26,820
life, maybe 40, 50, 60 years.

1125
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:30,540
I've just covered there, right, of what's suggested in society.

1126
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:34,540
Get some training, have a career or a job to fend for yourself, and then a retirement

1127
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:37,820
golden age over a 40 or 50 or 60 plus year.

1128
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:43,560
Now, how is that relevant if you don't have if you have roughly a decade and a half left

1129
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,060
in society as you know it?

1130
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:49,120
Not not where everybody's going to be killed or destroyed or the earth will be destroyed.

1131
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:53,000
No such thing is going to happen, but society will be reset or rebooted.

1132
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:58,880
Now, how does a 40 or 50 year plan work within a such a short span that's left?

1133
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:02,480
Doesn't. And let me just mention a few things here.

1134
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:06,360
How when anyone studies, it says that these things are written on the heart of man.

1135
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,580
Well, OK, what does that mean?

1136
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:09,380
Let's look at several examples.

1137
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:14,380
You know, a thousand years ago in architecture, when buildings and edifices were erected

1138
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:17,840
and constructed, they were designed to do such for a thousand years.

1139
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:22,580
You can find most of them still available on the many of them are still standing.

1140
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:25,420
Those that have not been intentionally taken apart.

1141
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:30,320
Exactly. A hundred years ago, if you look at a lot of the primary skyscrapers in some

1142
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:33,280
of the major cities, they were designed to last a hundred plus years.

1143
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37,400
Look at the, you know, the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building and so on and so

1144
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,220
forth. They're still doing just fine.

1145
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:44,780
Now, what's interesting is that right now, when structures, at least in the past 20

1146
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:49,180
years, have been installed on the surface and you could look at some of the big towers

1147
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:53,660
that are, you know, multibillion projects, guess what their lifespan is?

1148
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:57,180
20 years. Yeah, about 20, 20 years.

1149
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,240
That's how they're underrated by the insurance companies and the engineering.

1150
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,980
Don't don't believe it. Look it up.

1151
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,160
OK, now what's what's even more fascinating.

1152
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:06,640
What do you see with your own eye?

1153
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:12,340
I was conveying on what they call a highway and I looked to the right and I saw what

1154
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:15,980
they call a new subdivision going up houses for people and they were made out of

1155
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:17,140
compressed sawdust.

1156
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,780
Yes, that one more time.

1157
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:21,360
That's yeah. Yeah.

1158
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,040
They're building their homes now of compressed dust.

1159
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:28,980
They called flakeboard, particle board, whatever you want to call it, oriented strand

1160
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:31,300
board. But nonetheless, what it is, it is what it is.

1161
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:35,560
I don't care what they're saying in an engineer lab that it's as strong as this or

1162
01:15:35,560 --> 01:15:37,500
whatever. We're conserving on recycling wood.

1163
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:40,520
That's irrelevant. I'm saying that.

1164
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,440
They're building their houses out of dust.

1165
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:48,660
Need I say more. So so the thing here, what is going back to the advice of the little

1166
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:52,640
ones? OK, let's say you have one that's five years old and you have roughly 15 years

1167
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,820
left in society as you know it.

1168
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:59,320
In other words, society functioning as you know, let's just take those as roundabout

1169
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:02,480
numbers that will be discovered to have some accuracy.

1170
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:08,140
So if you add five to 15 years roughly to a five year old person that puts them at

1171
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:13,620
around 20. So it would be reasonable then was is that all of the things that people

1172
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:17,080
suggest young people do now that they had done, let's say they're much older than

1173
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:20,620
that. Things those things won't be around to do.

1174
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:26,640
Right. So what I would suggest to any parent, take the age of your child at 15 years

1175
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,560
and then see what number you come up with and then look at how old you were according

1176
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,640
to that number. So let's say take a five year old at 15.

1177
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:37,720
That puts them around 20. So what would be recommended to the parent to perhaps do is

1178
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:42,400
say, what would I have done different up until about 20 years old?

1179
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:44,840
How would I have based on what I know now?

1180
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:48,960
Because now I have a higher vantage point, I've passed through this and maybe I would

1181
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,260
have done certain things different.

1182
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:53,080
Make a list of those things and impart them to the child.

1183
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:59,280
This is what I would have done different at 20 or up leading up into that age.

1184
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:01,900
And it doesn't mean do that with the child.

1185
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,140
It just means impart the information.

1186
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:09,620
And what most people will find is that no matter how as long as it's lawful and

1187
01:17:09,620 --> 01:17:12,520
relatively beneficial, you'll be able to do it.

1188
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:18,880
You know, I've discussed the education system, kindergarten through 12th grade, 12,000

1189
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:24,820
hours of what I have queried and asked people, what did you get out of 12 years?

1190
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:26,440
Nothing. I'm glad to be out of there.

1191
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,560
The reason they have you in school for all those years is because they need to capture

1192
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:38,380
your formative years and spit you out as now as a malformed project.

1193
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:44,800
Now, here's the thing. When a tree is growing, if you purposely grow it on an angle or

1194
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:50,340
distorted for 12 years and you release it from that mechanism, what are the chances of

1195
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:54,200
it straightening up? You have to cut it down.

1196
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:57,840
It's not going to do it. You can't straighten it out at that point.

1197
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:59,600
So here that's why a lot of people are wrestling.

1198
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,180
And then I believe a lot of this has led to the emergence of the alternative media.

1199
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:07,800
But like I've said before, the alternative media is not being used at its highest and

1200
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:11,940
best form. I just hear a lot of opinion and I don't know what and a lot of maybes.

1201
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:18,460
So anyway, how are we doing on time, Seth, and how any thoughts so far?

1202
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:22,700
We've got quite a bit, a little bit is it's going to go by quickly, but this is the

1203
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:27,700
subject matter that I believe we've covered in that message from this individual.

1204
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:34,580
I think we've gone across the board without getting again, maybe into the specifics of

1205
01:18:34,580 --> 01:18:38,060
the person asked. You haven't given specifics.

1206
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,120
Do you think we've given a little more specific than we usually have?

1207
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:46,600
I would say so. Yeah, absolutely.

1208
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:50,000
You and I have spoken a lot over the past few years in private.

1209
01:18:50,220 --> 01:18:56,740
So these are things that you and I have discussed in depth quite a bit.

1210
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:59,900
But as far as being broadcast, yeah, absolutely.

1211
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:04,400
And publicly, we've discussed this as well on air in many other places, I'd say.

1212
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:08,740
Yeah. And speaking of being on air, you're listening to American Freedom Radio and

1213
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:14,220
folks, I'm going to make this short and sweet and sweet as such, if it manifests.

1214
01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:17,820
There's something called keeping the lights on.

1215
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:25,100
There's something called about, you know, things are available and things are free.

1216
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:30,900
The information that you hear, the venue called American Freedom Radio is available and

1217
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:36,340
free, but it costs it's not that the money needs to be sent to them for just sending

1218
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:39,480
the money. It costs to pipe it to you.

1219
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:44,880
And right now in this actual while I'm speaking today, let's say, and yesterday,

1220
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:48,960
hopefully not tomorrow, American Freedom Radio does need some help.

1221
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:52,940
There are donations that need to be gotten here quickly.

1222
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:58,900
Quickly, meaning there are there are infrastructures that need to be infrastructure and

1223
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:04,720
Dunning's or debts, let's say what you call bills have been thrust upon the station on

1224
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:09,360
a regular basis. And this month, let's just say this particular cycle that they have has

1225
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,520
been extremely challenging.

1226
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:15,720
And it's up to you, the listener, the listenership, anyone hearing this right now to

1227
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:19,140
perhaps be proactive and send something their way.

1228
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:24,040
The way you send it their way is by going to their home page and you will perhaps find a

1229
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:25,840
donate button or other forms of contact.

1230
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:31,000
And I just wanted to say this because there's a way to present a fund drive.

1231
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:32,280
But I don't believe it's needed.

1232
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:33,880
But the message needs to be clear.

1233
01:20:34,180 --> 01:20:38,560
It is important that American Freedom Radio does get some monetary help here in the very

1234
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:44,780
near future, because it is quite possibility you might be able to try to tune in and

1235
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:49,320
it'll just be blank here just simply because it ran out of juice.

1236
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:53,520
So let's let's get some throw some juice towards American Freedom Radio.

1237
01:20:53,620 --> 01:20:54,900
And that's what I'm going to say about that.

1238
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:59,880
Yeah, speaking of radio, it's actually reached a critical point right now.

1239
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:05,700
So please, anyone within even down the stream, if you hear this on the archive, feel free

1240
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:12,580
to do so. And I would I would like to point out as well that we're not being

1241
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:19,100
compensated monetarily for the time that we spend here speaking with all of you.

1242
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,840
We're we're doing this.

1243
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:26,060
I'm doing this because I quite selfishly, I enjoy it.

1244
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:32,620
I enjoy being able to discuss the things that we are able to discuss here in the way that

1245
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:40,840
we are. And that is, you know, that's made possible by, you know, American Freedom

1246
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:45,180
Radio, the medium that you are hearing our voices on currently.

1247
01:21:45,460 --> 01:21:51,080
So you do have the ability to keep that going and to help out when you when you do

1248
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:59,000
let them know that, you know, that you enjoy the conversations and that you would

1249
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:05,440
like to keep them going. And, you know, actions speak louder than words, as they say.

1250
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:09,860
So even if they don't enjoy it, if you want to just provide some funds for the

1251
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:11,400
infrastructure, that would be great.

1252
01:22:11,620 --> 01:22:12,380
Right. Absolutely.

1253
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:15,600
So, yeah, absolutely, Seth.

1254
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:17,660
Yeah, this is it's interesting.

1255
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:23,980
I mean, you know, even if recently I've heard I did some math on this, sharpened

1256
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:28,380
some pencils and I figured out that if I switch to, let's say, LED bulbs, I'll be

1257
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:30,300
using one tenth the energy consumption.

1258
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:36,100
And I did so. And yeah, it is possible to reduce your consumption tremendously these

1259
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:40,780
days. But even with such a consumption being reduced and a bare bone skeleton way of

1260
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:48,620
providing a radio format as such, it still needs some infrastructure underpinning in

1261
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:51,780
the form of donation or influx of monetary something.

1262
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,280
And thank you, folks.

1263
01:22:53,420 --> 01:22:57,520
And we'll stop right there on that if you can do so.

1264
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:02,340
So, again, back to the subject matter at hand, we kind of brought up the concept of

1265
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:07,220
scripture and still what this is, is up to people to discover.

1266
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,060
You know, I just want to throw out a name.

1267
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:12,560
This is maybe just arbitrary within the discussion, but still part of the discussion.

1268
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:19,260
There's a man named Ivan Panin, I-V-A-N, Ivan and then Panin, P-A-N-I-N.

1269
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,440
And he is an interesting character.

1270
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:26,120
He was a mathematician looking for a doctorate thesis in mathematics, which is hard to

1271
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:26,940
find something unique.

1272
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:30,820
He decided to look into the biblical text to see if there are any number sequences of

1273
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:32,800
any significance. Go read with this.

1274
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:35,020
This was a secular approach, by the way.

1275
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:42,260
And if anyone wants to look up Ivan Panin, P-A-N-I-N, and look at his work, that is a

1276
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:48,020
real interesting way to sort of in a forensics point of view, meaning in detective work,

1277
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:52,460
look for what's called a fingerprint for identification purposes.

1278
01:23:52,680 --> 01:23:57,920
Now, the problem with giving references regarding anything biblical or scriptural,

1279
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:02,880
again, as you will go online and you will find it, this information is again hijacked by

1280
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,500
quote, unquote, religious groups.

1281
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:08,560
You know, they will say, oh, here's proof of Christianity.

1282
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:11,140
The Bible can be validated mathematically.

1283
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:13,520
And oh, no, why did they do that?

1284
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:17,240
You know, because then they're going to pop Santa Claus and the Easter bunny in there.

1285
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:25,420
So the problem is it's really difficult to find things that are untainted by, like Seth

1286
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:28,940
earlier in the broadcast said, the traditions of man.

1287
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:32,040
So if you have a good B.S.

1288
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:34,820
filter, you can find a lot of good things.

1289
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:38,980
And it's easy to find a needle in a haystack with a magnet, right?

1290
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,680
Something you want to attract what you're looking for instead of randomly sifting.

1291
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:49,140
Right, so I just wanted to throw a little bit of that out for the validation of the text.

1292
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:51,580
Now, the other thing is there's a concept called paganism.

1293
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:55,280
Now, Seth, clearly the easiest way to sum up paganism is as what?

1294
01:24:55,280 --> 01:25:01,310
It just means that someone is, Seth, would you say ignorant perhaps?

1295
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:03,150
OK, well, so we get Seth back.

1296
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:08,690
So what's interesting is right now, anything like this has been idolized.

1297
01:25:08,930 --> 01:25:12,890
People do not want to look at what's called the purpose of anything.

1298
01:25:13,590 --> 01:25:15,890
And when I say that, I mean maybe in a general way.

1299
01:25:15,930 --> 01:25:17,310
Let me say what I mean specifically.

1300
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:21,190
If you bring up the scripture, the biblical text, it is simply a communication.

1301
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:26,370
Now, the legal society has hijacked the notion that one needs to walk in and swear.

1302
01:25:26,370 --> 01:25:27,770
Put their hand on a Bible.

1303
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:32,310
Now, what the interesting thing I like to say is what if you say I don't want to put my hand on that book?

1304
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:35,890
I have it downloaded here on a USB thumb drive or a DVD.

1305
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:37,230
Can I swear on that?

1306
01:25:37,850 --> 01:25:43,910
And of course, they'll say no, because they've turned it into a talisman, a rabbit's foot, because it is paganism.

1307
01:25:44,370 --> 01:25:47,310
You know, wear this rabbit's foot and you will have good luck.

1308
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:50,490
You know, this is what this communication has been reduced to.

1309
01:25:50,490 --> 01:25:56,950
Just the idolization, for example, iconography that you see through religion, symbolism.

1310
01:25:57,990 --> 01:26:10,150
There is nothing wrong with having a graphic symbolism in that context, but it has to be kept in its perspective as it is a form of communication to communicate something.

1311
01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:20,270
So we have another problem when we discuss things of the biblical nature because of the, quote unquote, paganism involved with it.

1312
01:26:20,890 --> 01:26:26,630
You know, to take things further down the line, I maybe want to say we have some time left here.

1313
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:33,130
And maybe the only thing I have access to here is anyone in Skype contact and also the American Freedom Radio chat room.

1314
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:38,650
So I'm going to take time and use the word maybe we'll do this democratically as we have some time left.

1315
01:26:39,190 --> 01:26:43,710
If anyone has a question to pose, at least in text or writing, do so.

1316
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:45,750
And I will look at it at the moment.

1317
01:26:46,330 --> 01:26:53,210
But at the moment, I want to go back again to the message that we read off to be the theme of the subject matter of today's show.

1318
01:26:53,850 --> 01:26:55,830
And it was about getting into specifics.

1319
01:26:57,190 --> 01:27:05,850
So there's so many specifics, but the generalities have to be covered first and the generalities have to find some accuracy and the statements that we've made here today.

1320
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,970
And if you just tuned in, you might want to check it up on archives.

1321
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:12,910
You will find that they are accurate statements.

1322
01:27:12,910 --> 01:27:20,070
And again, to go back to the beginning of the show, as I said, a friend to all is a friend to none.

1323
01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:34,490
Many people like to or let's just say much media is designed to be accepted by the masses, whether it is in the alternative sense format or the mainstream format.

1324
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:39,790
No one sets out and says, well, this might offend certain people or be accepted.

1325
01:27:39,970 --> 01:27:41,930
So everyone wants to make things universal.

1326
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:44,250
And what I have to say that is to harken back.

1327
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:46,950
I think it was Plato that said a friend to all is a friend to none.

1328
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:55,970
The purpose of doing the show is not to consider being a friend to all, even though it would be quite pleasant if that were the case.

1329
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:57,870
But in reality, it is not.

1330
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:00,350
And also, I want to bring up the concept of offenses.

1331
01:28:01,470 --> 01:28:02,630
And this is a concept.

1332
01:28:02,730 --> 01:28:05,630
And I'll give what I seldom like to say is an opinion.

1333
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:15,010
How many times have you heard the concept of someone saying, oh, that is offensive to me or that I have been offended by that?

1334
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:22,250
Yeah. Well, what's interesting is when regarding when someone is in the let's say seeking truth, how is it possible to be offended?

1335
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:28,010
If you're seeking truth, if the information is brought to you, you tend to want to be objective.

1336
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:30,170
It is either true or false.

1337
01:28:30,490 --> 01:28:31,430
Where is the offense?

1338
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:36,470
You see, I've heard that prior says, oh, I don't want to hear the Greek, I find him offensive.

1339
01:28:36,630 --> 01:28:43,250
I'm like, well, that doesn't tell me why they find I don't want to ask why I'm offensive.

1340
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:48,610
That right away tells me this person has lax objectivity because the purpose is not to offend.

1341
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:50,170
The purpose is to be objective.

1342
01:28:51,170 --> 01:29:00,450
And this is how one, I believe, should continue to use any form of medium of communication as its highest and best use.

1343
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:07,350
So with that said, again, if we're not necessarily set up, we're going to take any callers.

1344
01:29:07,570 --> 01:29:16,050
But within the text format so far, I haven't seen any questions and we're waiting for Seth to come back.

1345
01:29:16,090 --> 01:29:17,730
He said technical difficulty again.

1346
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:28,970
So in the meantime, I believe that I'm using that word belief here loosely that many of the specifics will be able to be imparted when the time is correct.

1347
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:37,050
And we are coming upon a time right now where perhaps I'd say in the next two years, this particular time period is going to end.

1348
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:42,510
And the next time period would be easier to impart things, new ideas.

1349
01:29:42,690 --> 01:29:48,510
And what I mean by new ideas is I can roughly say, if you want a really new idea, read a really old book.

1350
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:54,410
And let's just put I'm going to say one thing here and I want to put it aside, which I keep bringing up.

1351
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:58,630
But I'll put it I'll say it and then put it aside is that many people have an aversion to things that are old.

1352
01:29:58,630 --> 01:30:02,790
They don't want to hear things that are old.

1353
01:30:02,910 --> 01:30:03,970
They believe that they're modern.

1354
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:22,890
And folks, if you are in if you think you're so advanced because you have a little silly phone and you have a microwave and all these other things that define that, go do a little bit of history and look at all of these civilizations that have fallen, had called themselves modern prior to that fall.

1355
01:30:23,030 --> 01:30:24,710
Let's say it's I find it very ironic.

1356
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:27,390
But again, a friend to all is a friend to none.

1357
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:29,050
So we might have a message here.

1358
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:30,310
Let's just see.

1359
01:30:30,410 --> 01:30:31,710
I'm trying to walk and chew gum.

1360
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:34,470
Oh, yeah.

1361
01:30:34,630 --> 01:30:38,090
One one question here is how about money as people's God?

1362
01:30:38,510 --> 01:30:48,330
Well, what's interesting here is that anything that's debased and has no basis in it from a material point of view, then it has no material substance based to it.

1363
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:49,990
It has to go strictly on belief.

1364
01:30:50,630 --> 01:30:58,470
And the concept of God, there's also the concept of worship, and you don't question things that you worship, just like people don't like to question money.

1365
01:30:58,910 --> 01:31:03,770
How many times have you discussed or if anyone has the nature of fiat currency?

1366
01:31:04,030 --> 01:31:10,950
And the typical response that one might get is I don't care because when I go to the store, I get what I want with it.

1367
01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:13,410
Think about that for a moment.

1368
01:31:14,650 --> 01:31:19,050
How does a statement like that contrast when one is considering ethics and morality?

1369
01:31:20,290 --> 01:31:26,010
Hmm. Now, let's go to the next level and say, well, I don't care what I do as long as it feels good.

1370
01:31:26,090 --> 01:31:32,950
And then you might put that in the back of your mind and you'll hear a lot about certain people or of aspects of culture that are doing things to other people.

1371
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:35,450
They shouldn't be doing too, because it feels good.

1372
01:31:36,470 --> 01:31:43,690
Where's the aspect of morality there or ethics, let's say, how those let's just define morals and ethics loosely.

1373
01:31:44,170 --> 01:31:48,250
So this is the type of society that mankind is engaged in.

1374
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:50,610
And when I say mankind, I mean wholesale.

1375
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:55,910
And if you're listening to this, I mean you as well, unless you can prove otherwise.

1376
01:31:56,450 --> 01:31:58,990
It's quite interesting how one can.

1377
01:32:00,570 --> 01:32:06,310
Let's say, hear about something and then disregard it from a moral or ethical standpoint.

1378
01:32:06,570 --> 01:32:10,950
Now, what does one do, let's say, for money as people's God, that's that's really interesting.

1379
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:16,110
Yeah, that's interesting, because if we look at the concept of that, your law comes from your God.

1380
01:32:16,110 --> 01:32:26,710
What's interesting is that the things surrounding the current fiat currency or credit system are legal things, things of law.

1381
01:32:26,810 --> 01:32:38,330
And when you approach the current legal or lawful, what they call law society, which is not lawful, by the way, they're based on the money system, not money, but the money system.

1382
01:32:38,890 --> 01:32:42,830
It's quite interesting and no need to go down that path specifically.

1383
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:44,570
But, yeah, that's that's a good point.

1384
01:32:46,110 --> 01:32:51,030
And the other thing I want to mention about money, folks, is don't be a sucker there.

1385
01:32:51,390 --> 01:32:53,070
Why? Well, why?

1386
01:32:53,190 --> 01:32:54,230
Why did he say be a sucker?

1387
01:32:54,430 --> 01:33:02,970
Well, when you go on the Internet, alternative media, there are dozens, if not hundreds of comp financial commentaries or commentators.

1388
01:33:03,730 --> 01:33:07,270
Yes, they have websites, they have Web pages and they have radio shows and subscribers.

1389
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:12,890
And not a one of them, not a one of them is discussing the relevance of a credit based economy.

1390
01:33:13,870 --> 01:33:23,310
And how it should function as such, not a one of them is discussing the difference between lawful money and legal tender, not a one of them.

1391
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:28,170
They might throw out the concept of silver and gold and they might always preach doom and gloom.

1392
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:34,670
But I have not heard anyone address it holistically, especially the concept of endorsement.

1393
01:33:35,130 --> 01:33:38,610
Endorsement means you have no other choice.

1394
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:43,110
What I mean by endorsing is that you're putting your full faith and credit in the system and signing to it.

1395
01:33:43,590 --> 01:33:49,590
No one is ever discussing, well, we have no other choice, but in the meantime, we can make it conditional.

1396
01:33:50,850 --> 01:33:58,330
You see, everyone is going into it unconditionally, and that is the part that is the most difficult to really discuss about money.

1397
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:01,170
It's just the ethics and moral value of it.

1398
01:34:02,330 --> 01:34:03,250
OK, folks, I'm back.

1399
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:05,790
It looks like I had a small technical as well.

1400
01:34:06,690 --> 01:34:12,550
So and Seth, I believe, is also gone on a small little break because of the technical issues again.

1401
01:34:12,690 --> 01:34:22,910
So we'll just continue and see if there's any other democratic aspect of question asking and such and appears to be not much at the moment.

1402
01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:28,310
I see Seth has departed from the conversation just momentarily.

1403
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:29,430
He'll probably be back.

1404
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:31,750
Another question here. Let's just maybe read it.

1405
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:34,410
Information is communication, education and entertainment.

1406
01:34:34,850 --> 01:34:37,490
Talk about the entertainment aspect or any of them.

1407
01:34:37,650 --> 01:34:46,530
That's interesting as well, because what people are gathered in groups for is for entertainment value anyway.

1408
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:52,470
You know, it's interesting. There's a concept that has come across the alternative media is what's known as activism.

1409
01:34:53,030 --> 01:35:01,590
And I find it to be very interesting because whether it's on the Internet or not, activism, you look at these rallies and protests.

1410
01:35:01,590 --> 01:35:07,030
And they sure sure, as you can imagine, have much entertainment.

1411
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:08,530
They have bands that come and play.

1412
01:35:08,650 --> 01:35:12,030
They have roasts, barbecues, hamburgers and hot dogs and beers.

1413
01:35:12,190 --> 01:35:13,650
And they liked it. And there's nothing wrong with that.

1414
01:35:13,690 --> 01:35:16,510
But they like to have a good time while they're protesting.

1415
01:35:17,110 --> 01:35:21,910
It seems like any information, any cause has to have some form of entertainment around it anyway.

1416
01:35:22,290 --> 01:35:28,150
But what's interesting is that the entertainment value supersedes the value of the purpose of the activist.

1417
01:35:28,710 --> 01:35:32,490
I hate to say it, but a lot of people get upset.

1418
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:35,550
You know, I do know some of them, quote unquote, activists.

1419
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:38,770
And I always message them resistance is futile.

1420
01:35:38,830 --> 01:35:41,010
And they get really upset about that.

1421
01:35:41,050 --> 01:35:48,770
And that's fine. I'm just trying to be truthful, because there's a lot of purpose of being an activist or protesting something.

1422
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:53,630
But the way it's being done may not be effective.

1423
01:35:53,630 --> 01:36:00,290
Let's just say if anyone's curious about how that this whole thing about entertainment and information comes together.

1424
01:36:01,010 --> 01:36:06,510
Read about there's a man named Gustav Le Bon that's called the crowd, the psychology of the crowd.

1425
01:36:06,610 --> 01:36:08,570
What happens when you get people together in a movement?

1426
01:36:10,170 --> 01:36:11,650
So it's quite interesting.

1427
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:15,770
Let's see, we're getting leisure with dignity.

1428
01:36:15,850 --> 01:36:20,090
I don't understand that one, but this is just again going democratic route here.

1429
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:27,650
So, folks, so what's what I want to say again, perhaps of information as communication.

1430
01:36:27,950 --> 01:36:30,850
Well, information should be communicated.

1431
01:36:30,970 --> 01:36:34,810
The problem is, again, there's a concept of people being ignorant.

1432
01:36:35,030 --> 01:36:42,750
There's a lot of people being apologetic about, quote unquote, masses or the people on this planet at large about their ignorance.

1433
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:44,950
And I'm saying the ignorance is not the problem.

1434
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:50,590
It's the resistance and the stubbornness and rebelliousness to actually look at what they think they want to know.

1435
01:36:51,070 --> 01:36:52,390
They really don't want to know.

1436
01:36:52,830 --> 01:36:55,070
So that's very important in the entertainment aspect.

1437
01:36:55,290 --> 01:37:01,430
I mean, what I found, again, just not to harp on the alternative media, there's this thing called YouTube that people want a lot of hits on.

1438
01:37:01,730 --> 01:37:02,990
Apparently it pays you something.

1439
01:37:04,130 --> 01:37:11,110
And, you know, you just go ahead and do YouTube with, you know, genetically modified octopus with purple tomatoes coming to destroy society.

1440
01:37:11,110 --> 01:37:14,490
And, you know, it'll get 30,000 views in six hours.

1441
01:37:15,130 --> 01:37:32,730
You know, so the sensationalism, the carnival bark, bark, barking and the sensationalism, the yellow journalism, the all this other stuff has been always viewed distasteful as what's still prominent amongst society, at least for the next couple of years when the time again will shift.

1442
01:37:32,850 --> 01:37:36,230
Right now, folks, you're still in the waiting room as a society.

1443
01:37:36,230 --> 01:37:37,650
What do you do in a waiting room?

1444
01:37:37,690 --> 01:37:39,130
Well, what is a waiting room before?

1445
01:37:39,810 --> 01:37:47,130
Let's say you need to go somewhere to for a matter of significance and you're not seen at the time when you arrive.

1446
01:37:47,370 --> 01:37:54,810
You have you're supplied with something called a waiting room and you'll see them places throughout society and people sitting around.

1447
01:37:55,590 --> 01:38:02,990
And they usually have places to be seated and some form of entertainment, either a magazine on a coffee table or a TV or something.

1448
01:38:02,990 --> 01:38:07,830
And if you were to observe that objectively, you'd say, what a lazy bunch of people.

1449
01:38:07,950 --> 01:38:09,850
And they're all kind of interested in their own little thing.

1450
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:10,730
Well, it's a waiting room.

1451
01:38:10,830 --> 01:38:12,390
That's what people are supposed to do.

1452
01:38:13,790 --> 01:38:22,110
You know, so what's interesting, you're still in the waiting room aspect of society, except what's happening here is that you're being distracted.

1453
01:38:23,350 --> 01:38:32,550
So there's aspects of the distraction, there's frustration, there's confusion, there's you know, I've actually critiqued very much on what's happening in the alternative media.

1454
01:38:32,550 --> 01:38:49,150
There seems to be a cycle of a deadly virus, a missing airplane, a financial collapse and a bad political dictator, a deadly virus, a missing airplane, a financial collapse and a bad political figure, a missing airplane, a really bad virus.

1455
01:38:49,490 --> 01:38:58,830
You get my point. There seems to be this cycle of just nonsense over and over and over and over within the news feed, news media.

1456
01:38:59,630 --> 01:39:03,010
And no one is really pulling back and saying, what do these things mean?

1457
01:39:03,150 --> 01:39:03,830
What is coming?

1458
01:39:04,010 --> 01:39:06,050
What where have we been and where are we going?

1459
01:39:06,290 --> 01:39:10,970
And even from a purely secular sense, it is very clear and very easy to look at.

1460
01:39:11,270 --> 01:39:17,610
If one gets a notion of what's called, let's say, I'll just get to the point here.

1461
01:39:17,650 --> 01:39:22,970
I've said that what you're going to be looking for in the future is the formation of a Middle East Union type situation.

1462
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:26,450
That's going to be the home base for the new world order.

1463
01:39:26,990 --> 01:39:33,970
Right. The thing is, it's not going to form right now because the requirement is roughly 10 nations and only nine of those nations exist at the moment.

1464
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:45,550
And what I've said in the past is, you know, even four or five years ago publicly is that this will be coming in the new country that will be formed is the new Assyria, Assyria, A-S-S-Y-R-I-A.

1465
01:39:45,950 --> 01:39:50,010
There are people known as the Assyrians and they haven't had a country in twenty three hundred years.

1466
01:39:50,010 --> 01:39:59,910
Where it is is in northern Iraq and its ancient borders also took part in what we currently call is the political geographic landmass of Syria and Turkey.

1467
01:40:00,510 --> 01:40:09,570
So years ago, I stated that you're going to actually observe the precursors of the formation of this middle union and preceding that is the formation of a new country in northern Iraq.

1468
01:40:09,730 --> 01:40:18,550
But in order for its borders to actually have land near Syria and Turkey, you're going to have to also watch for conflicts within Syria and Turkey.

1469
01:40:19,050 --> 01:40:29,010
And guess what we're seeing very often today in the news, but no one really cares because it was just a good guess and no one's even told me that because no one really wants to hear that kind of stuff anyway.

1470
01:40:29,530 --> 01:40:41,170
So the point here is, folks, the seat of your future is going to be in what's called the Middle East or Western Asia or the Levant area, because it's actually part of that Asian landmass if you want to consider it as such.

1471
01:40:42,230 --> 01:40:48,770
And this is what you might use as a reference point or part of the jigsaw puzzle picture.

1472
01:40:48,910 --> 01:41:03,050
So when all these other pieces come in, you can field what is going on and you could see the interest and you could see, you know, the most ridiculous aspect is when I hear World War Three is coming or these people are being genocided or this is happening.

1473
01:41:03,150 --> 01:41:04,790
I mean, all those things are bad.

1474
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:07,190
And yes, there are things that are bad surrounding those things.

1475
01:41:07,190 --> 01:41:11,270
But no, none of that is, you know, how it's just swept under the rug.

1476
01:41:11,330 --> 01:41:22,950
I've actually confronted someone recently who was emphatically in a panic about a disaster, impending disaster, whether it was from a comet, a solar flare or a government crackdown or collapse of the grid.

1477
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:23,710
And I approached them.

1478
01:41:23,810 --> 01:41:28,670
I said, man, I'm so glad to hear you're in a much calmer state about all those things you mentioned.

1479
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:29,450
He said, well, what things?

1480
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:33,770
Oh, you know, you know, the collapse in the total disaster that was supposed to happen three months ago.

1481
01:41:33,850 --> 01:41:35,350
Oh, well, that was three months ago.

1482
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:38,050
I said, wow, what a waste of energy.

1483
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:49,050
The purpose of saying what is being said here is so you live your life with a little more efficiency than what you're hearing out there and out there or in there or wherever.

1484
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:51,270
It's about efficiency, folks.

1485
01:41:51,970 --> 01:41:56,570
So let's be efficient and let's try to make sense of things.

1486
01:41:57,190 --> 01:42:02,870
And it's very difficult to do that if you're just relying on all the casual input, no matter how drastic it sounds.

1487
01:42:04,610 --> 01:42:06,410
Oh, here, I got hit with another question.

1488
01:42:06,530 --> 01:42:08,010
Does one have to learn how to love?

1489
01:42:08,090 --> 01:42:08,570
Well, thank you.

1490
01:42:08,990 --> 01:42:12,050
And this is coming from a good acquaintance named Steve.

1491
01:42:12,350 --> 01:42:13,130
Thank you, Steve.

1492
01:42:13,570 --> 01:42:14,370
Yes, absolutely.

1493
01:42:14,690 --> 01:42:19,130
The concept of love, I've done a little bit of public speaking on that on a previous project.

1494
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:23,670
And, you know, what's interesting is it's another thing that's taken for granted.

1495
01:42:23,850 --> 01:42:28,510
And I'll tell you emphatically that most people don't even know what that means and they don't know how to do it.

1496
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:29,490
What?

1497
01:42:29,590 --> 01:42:30,490
What did you just say, Greek?

1498
01:42:30,510 --> 01:42:31,430
How dare you say that?

1499
01:42:31,470 --> 01:42:31,750
Yes.

1500
01:42:32,170 --> 01:42:36,190
Yeah, how many times have you heard I'm falling in love and everyone gets complimented?

1501
01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:37,210
Wait a second.

1502
01:42:37,790 --> 01:42:43,510
If I just stated to everyone I just fell, the first thing is you're concerned for my well-being because it didn't...

1503
01:42:43,510 --> 01:42:49,750
Falling actually might do harm to someone's well-being, but yet when someone falls in love, they're complimented on it.

1504
01:42:50,190 --> 01:42:52,290
I think we're a little sick here, Twisted folks.

1505
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:58,470
Because people that fall in love typically start high on the curve and then it's downhill from there.

1506
01:42:58,610 --> 01:42:59,550
Oh, don't think so?

1507
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:04,670
Look at the high separation rate and the casualness of how relationships are taken.

1508
01:43:05,630 --> 01:43:06,390
Let's just say it.

1509
01:43:06,470 --> 01:43:07,910
One has to learn how to love.

1510
01:43:08,690 --> 01:43:16,290
And I want to tie in something that I haven't really said much publicly about the physical aspect or the emotional aspect and all this.

1511
01:43:16,390 --> 01:43:17,630
And they're all separate, by the way.

1512
01:43:18,670 --> 01:43:21,750
But the thing that I want to say is there's this concept of fear.

1513
01:43:22,190 --> 01:43:23,970
And everyone says, don't have any fear.

1514
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:27,290
You know, there's an aspect of love that incorporates fear.

1515
01:43:27,290 --> 01:43:32,310
Like, for example, you might love someone so much that you fear that something bad happens to them.

1516
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:37,450
That's why you make sure that the tires in your wife's car are up to snuff.

1517
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:43,370
Or if, you see, you don't want them approached by some unknowing danger to bring harm.

1518
01:43:43,430 --> 01:43:45,770
And there's a certain fear involved and that's a healthy fear.

1519
01:43:46,310 --> 01:43:53,190
So, you know, there's this ambiguity that's being thrown and this absoluteness that's being thrown which need not be so.

1520
01:43:53,630 --> 01:43:56,670
And then there's an absoluteness that's being thrown which is ambiguous.

1521
01:43:57,950 --> 01:43:59,690
And this is what I see in society.

1522
01:43:59,930 --> 01:44:02,850
So, there's an aspect of things that need to be looked at.

1523
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:08,230
But regarding love, again, if we look at what the ancients, especially the Greeks, they had three various forms of love.

1524
01:44:08,310 --> 01:44:12,350
The friendly, the philia, the agape, which is a higher spiritual thing.

1525
01:44:12,730 --> 01:44:16,570
And then the eros, which is the lustful type of love.

1526
01:44:16,730 --> 01:44:18,730
So, yeah, love is an interesting concept.

1527
01:44:18,910 --> 01:44:20,330
Thank you, Steve, for bringing that up.

1528
01:44:20,910 --> 01:44:26,130
And the interesting thing also I've heard is the opposite of love is hate.

1529
01:44:26,590 --> 01:44:27,430
Wait a second, folks.

1530
01:44:27,490 --> 01:44:29,750
Let's just take a moment here and imagine something here.

1531
01:44:30,410 --> 01:44:31,970
It takes a lot of passion to love.

1532
01:44:32,410 --> 01:44:35,290
But I found that it almost takes equally as much passion to hate.

1533
01:44:36,650 --> 01:44:40,750
Now, could it be that the opposite of love is not hate and it's actually apathy and indifference?

1534
01:44:41,590 --> 01:44:42,790
Think about it for a moment.

1535
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:47,630
So, okay, we don't have Seth here with us at the moment.

1536
01:44:47,630 --> 01:44:52,390
His sonic connection has been severed electronically.

1537
01:44:52,910 --> 01:44:58,290
I just wanted to mention that to any of the audiences wondering where Seth is.

1538
01:44:58,410 --> 01:45:00,030
He is not available at the moment.

1539
01:45:00,550 --> 01:45:04,930
But I just wanted to also recap the message that we started this show off with.

1540
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:12,750
And hopefully we've gotten over the points that we said we would with a little more specific, specificity, I should say.

1541
01:45:13,350 --> 01:45:21,690
And from that point of view, we typically want to call this project or sonic venture as being uncommon sense.

1542
01:45:21,930 --> 01:45:28,790
And we sort of brought up this message that we read from an individual who apparently is listening to what has been said before

1543
01:45:28,790 --> 01:45:30,550
and tried to give a little more depth to it.

1544
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:31,670
I hope we've succeeded.

1545
01:45:32,170 --> 01:45:37,770
I guess, again, in the public fashion that we have available to us within two hours

1546
01:45:37,770 --> 01:45:41,050
to cover some of the points that were mentioned with more specificity.

1547
01:45:41,050 --> 01:45:42,590
But again, I just want to recap.

1548
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:44,670
This is perhaps the second time we've come around.

1549
01:45:45,230 --> 01:45:48,410
We're not as plagued with technical issues as we were with the first episode,

1550
01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:50,530
which is archived on American Freedom Radio.

1551
01:45:51,030 --> 01:45:58,050
But we want to just continue with uncommon sense as this project is titled.

1552
01:45:58,550 --> 01:46:04,010
And many other discussions, we're going to go into various systems and things that are considered in society

1553
01:46:04,630 --> 01:46:10,350
as aspects of their society, the institutions, the philosophies, the notions.

1554
01:46:10,350 --> 01:46:14,830
And as many of the things that people consider important to them,

1555
01:46:15,030 --> 01:46:18,630
like let's not say health, but yes, what the human body is,

1556
01:46:19,030 --> 01:46:21,650
the physical nature, what are called the sciences.

1557
01:46:21,850 --> 01:46:28,070
And always what is most uncommon is how these things can be explained with great simplicity,

1558
01:46:28,930 --> 01:46:35,390
without the technical jargon from the entitled classes that have hijacked these aspects of society

1559
01:46:35,790 --> 01:46:37,990
and these various bodies of knowledge.

1560
01:46:37,990 --> 01:46:41,330
It is possible to impart knowledge, yes, knowledge,

1561
01:46:41,430 --> 01:46:43,350
and things that people can apply to themselves.

1562
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:48,110
They don't have to go, they don't have to leave the room they're in or leave their body.

1563
01:46:48,370 --> 01:46:49,310
Let's not go down that route.

1564
01:46:49,390 --> 01:46:54,130
But actually beyond what they can experience within their own manifestations around them.

1565
01:46:55,070 --> 01:46:59,050
We've spoken on a previous sonic project around something called the container,

1566
01:46:59,210 --> 01:47:00,150
or how the body works.

1567
01:47:00,550 --> 01:47:03,590
And you don't have to go and read some ridiculous medical document

1568
01:47:03,590 --> 01:47:06,010
or some ridiculous alternative treatment.

1569
01:47:06,010 --> 01:47:11,290
It's just we discuss about what is really going on right there while you're sitting in your chair.

1570
01:47:11,770 --> 01:47:17,550
Discussing timekeeping, discussing various aspects of what many institutions,

1571
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:20,730
including government and science and things like that,

1572
01:47:21,050 --> 01:47:24,610
can be doing, should be doing perhaps, and what are they doing,

1573
01:47:24,710 --> 01:47:28,990
and how you fit in, not using again their technical jargon and rubbish.

1574
01:47:29,770 --> 01:47:32,930
And not to be disrespectful, but that is actually,

1575
01:47:33,430 --> 01:47:37,510
if the qualitative state of all of these subjects that I just brought up

1576
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:40,270
were to be explained politely, it would be called rubbish.

1577
01:47:40,390 --> 01:47:43,050
There are other words that could be used that would be more emphatic.

1578
01:47:43,970 --> 01:47:47,170
So with that said, remember folks, this is American Freedom Radio.

1579
01:47:47,430 --> 01:47:48,590
Throw something their way.

1580
01:47:48,650 --> 01:47:49,930
You'll find it on their homepage.

1581
01:47:50,410 --> 01:47:51,490
Please hit the donate button.

1582
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:55,330
Please send something because they are pretty much providing the venue

1583
01:47:55,330 --> 01:47:57,090
to hear this venue and other things.

1584
01:47:57,370 --> 01:48:01,750
Give American Freedom Radio some consideration here in the near future as you hear my voice.

1585
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:03,550
Again, this is The Greek with Seth Michael.

1586
01:48:04,110 --> 01:48:06,250
Thank you very much for listening to Uncommon Sense.
