00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,510
Greetings and once again, this is Uncommon Sense with the Greek and Seth Michael.

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,310
Today, Seth Michael will be joining us in the second hour and welcome everyone.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:16,370
And this is also on American Freedom Radio and uncommonradio.com.

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,890
You'll also see there is a Ustream if you so choose to catch it that way.

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,690
And also there are some archives on American Freedom Radio.

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,950
And again, for everyone that's listening, remember everyone that is involved in bringing you –

7
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,270
everything that you hear on American Freedom Radio requires your support.

8
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,090
So please keep that in mind and you know what I mean by that.

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:43,810
So again, hello everyone and let's just get right to things.

10
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,470
And the things we like to discuss are things that are uncommon.

11
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,910
And what could that be?

12
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:49,450
Guess what?

13
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,270
It's the obvious.

14
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,290
What does that mean?

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,250
Well, what is tangible?

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,290
What can we base things on or what are things based on?

17
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,190
And it seems like this has escaped humanity in wholesale.

18
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:06,090
So one of the purposes of doing this broadcast, if one could call it such,

19
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,510
is to probably bring things to mind or bring things to recognition

20
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,350
and maybe provoke some inquiry to the listener.

21
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,750
And by the way, we just have about five listeners and that's all we need.

22
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:29,030
Anyway, that seems to be the small little bit that is probably required to hear something

23
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,910
and maybe chew on it for a little while and maybe the word will get around.

24
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,030
But again, just to bring up the concept of things that I like to discuss

25
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,770
and Seth as well and anyone else that likes to listen to these kinds of things,

26
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,010
is that probably one of the last things that is left for mankind to discover is what is obvious.

27
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:57,090
Now, what's interesting about discussing the obvious is keeping sort of a perspective.

28
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,910
It might sound philosophical.

29
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,270
It might sound critical.

30
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:08,949
But if one says that man has completely descended into materialism, that might sound kind of harsh.

31
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:11,510
But, you know, let's keep that in the back of the mind.

32
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:17,170
You know, when you listen to people discussing things, they always discuss it from a materialistic point of view,

33
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,910
whether it's nutrition, whether it's scientific things, even philosophical things.

34
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,950
Metaphors are given in a material sense.

35
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,770
But yet when we look at information and inquiring on what things are about,

36
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,850
are we being told the truth about this matter or so,

37
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,870
sometimes they are slightly immaterial or intangible in that sense.

38
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:44,070
And we require upon communication perhaps things that have been memorialized from the past.

39
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:51,290
So we don't make mistakes or let's say or maybe short that term for a second,

40
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:56,730
but maybe so we don't have to rediscover things that are really in front of us.

41
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,290
And this approach seems to be very uncommon.

42
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,370
Like, for example, now is a time of seasonal change across the planet.

43
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,810
You know, let's say in one part of the world it's going into spring and pretty much full force

44
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,450
and the other part of the world is in fall, you know, going from a cold to a warmer season

45
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,510
and the other place is going from a warm to a cold season.

46
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,410
And what's interesting about this seasonal change,

47
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,450
it's not necessarily reciprocal where you have winter on one side of the world and summer on the other.

48
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:37,350
It's sort of an equalization time period where it is possible to have the same temperatures

49
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:43,830
or temperament across the entire planet for what may be common for a few days or so

50
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,270
where it's fall on one side of the world and spring in another.

51
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,870
The temperatures and temperament even of the people seem to be equal.

52
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:58,530
So these things we call seasons tend to not be discussed very much unless one partakes in agriculture

53
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:06,630
and even then, you know, when we consider the agriculture being mechanized to the point of, again, chemical oblivion or materialism,

54
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,830
you know, when we say agriculture, we mean the changing of seasons.

55
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:19,130
So consider, folks, when you see the change of seasons that it's more than just the mercury rising or dropping.

56
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:27,270
And I like to bring that up facetiously because it's interesting how the temperature measurement doesn't tell you anything about quality.

57
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:35,250
It's actually the expansion and contraction of this liquid form of metal called mercury, which is actually toxic, by the way.

58
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:41,850
So, well, we would like to discuss things that are perhaps leaning on the quality and the nature of things.

59
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:47,910
But perhaps to go back to the concept of the seasonal change and it being springtime and fall,

60
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:54,430
let's say in another part of the world, because I don't want to negate our friends that live on the other part of the world.

61
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,790
But for this part of the world, it's going into springtime.

62
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,890
And springtime is regeneration and a planting of things.

63
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,750
And let's consider mostly the planting or startups.

64
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,890
And what's interesting is the starting of things.

65
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,510
Perhaps, let's say, could it be a planting of seed?

66
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,290
Could it be an event?

67
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,250
Could it be a thought?

68
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,750
It's a cultural drive to start.

69
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,630
This is all tied into the agricultural cycle, the agricultural nature.

70
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:36,290
So when people are trying to reckon sense or rationale out of events that are happening,

71
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:44,430
whether it be economic, geopolitical, social, and in many levels also things that are put up by the entitled classes,

72
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,970
you know, the legal society, the scientific society, the religious societies,

73
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:53,190
you'll see that spring is a building up or, I'm sorry, it's a planting,

74
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:58,790
where summer would be the building up and fall is the harvest, not only of events but of ideas.

75
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:06,250
You see it within the culture and you also see it within the activities of all of these little groups.

76
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,150
I call them little groups because the main group is humanity as a whole.

77
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:18,990
People enjoy doing whatever they find to be their lot in life and they have to inquire amongst the specialists

78
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,170
when they want to go outside of the field of their personal interest.

79
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:31,490
So also watching what is going on from that perspective, what is being planted and discerning.

80
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,110
For example, one way of, you know, what am I talking about?

81
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,970
You know, one way of looking at it is how many times have you heard, for example,

82
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:45,610
in the media discussion of an impending financial collapse in the midsummer?

83
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:53,730
Well, not good and reliable information because typically those types of things happen in the fall.

84
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,030
The summer is a building up period.

85
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:09,010
So discussing the seasonal changes beyond just flowers blooming or it being hot or leaves changing color in the autumn,

86
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,270
it is a cycle, it's a grand cycle.

87
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:15,770
It's cosmic when it comes to surface-dwelling earth inhabitants.

88
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:23,030
You know, the interesting thing here also, just to go back to the surface-dwelling earth inhabitant,

89
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:29,270
in a sense, is the body, you know, how the human body, let's say,

90
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,730
or any body of a living creature is very susceptible to its environment.

91
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:40,850
And many people have discussed and heard about making balance and the concept of what is health or healthful.

92
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:48,210
And it seems, again, to be discussed in the nature of stark materialism,

93
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,630
almost as if you're discussing something in a chemical laboratory.

94
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:54,550
You know, like vitamins are good for you.

95
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,650
This chemical does this and this little bug does that.

96
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:05,270
And again, the seasons need to be considered when one is looking at harmony in their environment.

97
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:12,090
And one thing we like to discuss, let's say we, the colloquial we, would be perhaps eating seasonally as well.

98
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:20,130
And you wouldn't believe how much commentary it can be heard on people having a state of discomfort

99
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,470
or not well-being during the seasonal change.

100
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,310
And it seems to coincide with seasonal changes.

101
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,049
People have what they call colds, flus, not feeling well under the weather.

102
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:39,450
And it's always attributed to some materialistic, would you say excuse at this point?

103
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:47,710
But what's interesting is if we consider the harmony that is sort of required to maintain a healthful condition,

104
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,310
why aren't the seasonal changes considered?

105
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,090
And, of course, if anyone's listened to what might be dubbed as Greek speak,

106
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:00,250
there's a concept of eating not only seasonally but eating from climate sources

107
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:05,370
that would enable harmony in the environment that you're in.

108
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:12,110
For example, if you're in a cold climate and you are eating food that is grown in the tropics,

109
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:18,310
could it be that that food will adjust your body to living in the tropics while you're in a cold climate?

110
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:23,790
And your body might say, well, this isn't correct, and you have mucus and lack of levity.

111
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,350
By the way, lack of levity just means you want to be horizontal.

112
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,030
These are really formative things to discuss.

113
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:37,750
And it seems to be there's been a big divergence in the distraction because of man's descent into materialism,

114
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,810
how simple things can be.

115
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,590
And it's not necessarily a cure-all,

116
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:49,810
but it's interesting how when one has a discussion with those that do feel discomfort

117
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:55,590
or quote-unquote illness during the seasonal changes, with even the slightest examination,

118
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,190
if you ask them about their quote-unquote diet,

119
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:03,010
I don't like that word diet because it has D-I-E in it, but nonetheless,

120
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:10,070
you'll see that they have typically a very chemical perspective or this form of bioterrorism perspective.

121
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:16,490
And what I call bioterrorism is the idea that the scientists are terrorizing the public,

122
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,170
that these little critters known as bacterias and viruses are the cause of disease,

123
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,730
you know, strictly and nothing else.

124
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:29,230
So anyway, that is a form of terrorism in a sense where you inflict terror on the victim.

125
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:35,210
And people are just running around not paying any attention to what is obvious.

126
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:41,390
One thing to consider, folks, and this is not going to be a two-hour talk on this subject,

127
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,330
but just throw it in there, might as well.

128
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:57,810
Jumping into the concept that little bacteria and things like that create disease solely renders all refrigeration useless

129
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,990
because we use refrigerators to put these little things into a dormant state,

130
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:07,390
and people are always giving the excuse that it's the wintertime that they catch these little buggers.

131
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,610
So something to think about.

132
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,170
Let's just be sensible to some degree.

133
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:21,830
But in essence, sticking with the concept of being seasonal, what could that mean?

134
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,010
And what could support that?

135
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:32,210
It doesn't have to be just agricultural in the sense it has to be also viewed from its formative sense.

136
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,610
You know, and typically when we discuss spring, it's a time of planting.

137
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,410
Not much is seen when things are planted.

138
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:44,310
You might have a fallow or just a plain dirt field that's been plowed,

139
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,430
and even though all of the things that need to be done in the springtime are done,

140
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,010
it doesn't look like anything has changed.

141
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:57,610
So keeping that in mind, if anyone is inquiring, whether alternative or mainstream media,

142
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:03,410
about geopolitical events, economic events, social events, judicial events,

143
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,650
just about every aspect, the scientific community, every community,

144
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:11,030
you realize that they also follow this unknowingly.

145
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,210
You're sort of locked into this, these cycles,

146
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,730
and the more you acknowledge and know that the cycle is happening,

147
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:21,190
the more sense and rationale it puts behind what you're absorbing,

148
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:28,330
let's say through the mind, the eyes and the ears, if they work, meaning being able to discern.

149
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,770
So again, when you hear about breaking down events,

150
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,450
they're usually reserved for the fall or the autumn.

151
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,170
The building up events are basically for the summer,

152
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:46,250
and the planting and the new things that are initially set in place happen in the spring,

153
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,050
and that is basically the season right now.

154
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:54,030
So from that point of view, very often when you turn on what's called media,

155
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:57,870
it's something called the news, it's a television show called the news

156
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,730
or a radio show is called the news,

157
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:07,490
and it perhaps would behoove anyone to approach these things efficiently.

158
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,850
What I mean by that is how many times have you spoken to anyone

159
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,910
that got worked up into a lather about a quote-unquote story they just heard?

160
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:23,550
And one way to rationalize what you're hearing is look at the seasonal effects of it.

161
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,110
Again, bringing up the metaphor again,

162
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:30,470
if you hear of a financial collapse in the spring or the summer,

163
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,230
it's unlikely it's going to happen.

164
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,670
And dare anyone go investigate all of the, let's say,

165
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,470
main economic Western world financial collapses.

166
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:44,050
They always happen in what they call late September or October of some sort.

167
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,470
And if anyone, any of you history buffs, yes,

168
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,970
because if you want to buff that thing that I call history,

169
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:58,150
most people today believe that everything sprang into creation 100 years ago.

170
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:58,530
Yes.

171
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,530
Why do I say that?

172
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,230
Because any discussion, whether academic or not,

173
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,690
people can't go any further than that.

174
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,550
And when they do, it seems to be based on some kind of urban myth.

175
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,590
Very little is inquired about any time before us.

176
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,910
When I say us again, I mean it loosely.

177
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,270
So yeah, just in case anyone doesn't realize,

178
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:26,610
there is a history that goes more than 100 years.

179
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:33,710
So let's pretty much think about inquiring about things.

180
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,530
Give me an example.

181
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:40,910
I don't like to bring up specific points that are in the current events unless I

182
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,210
get them more than three times from three or four separate different individuals.

183
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:45,350
And one thing I'm going to bring up,

184
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,770
which I've received from several individuals,

185
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:52,470
is that something about a gold yuan or renminbi in Chinese currency replacing

186
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:57,890
the dollar or the Chinese not using the dollar or Chinese policies with U.S.

187
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,870
Treasury and this term, the dollar being used.

188
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:07,890
And what's interesting about that is, and I won't say anymore, is folks,

189
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,910
you've got to research what a credit-based economy is.

190
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,030
Now I know no one wants to do that.

191
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,090
You're not going to be popular.

192
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,210
You're not going to make friends.

193
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:22,570
But if you have any interest in anything that is regarding financial,

194
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,170
get a good grip or even a loose grip or stick your pinky or small toe,

195
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:35,790
not even big toe, into looking or inquiring on what a credit-based economy is.

196
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,370
It's not a debt-based economy.

197
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,270
You're told that it is because, you know, like little children,

198
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,390
tell them little stories.

199
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,310
They'll believe anything.

200
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,310
Their child is an immature.

201
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,090
But essentially it is a credit-based economy.

202
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,050
Start digging into that a little bit and see how unpopular you are because the

203
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:58,890
closer you get to the truth, any truth, the less popular you are.

204
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,990
And that's where I like to bring up an old philosopher.

205
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:03,130
I believe it was Plato.

206
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,030
He says that a friend to all is a friend to none.

207
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:12,730
So the concept here is if you don't mind making your life miserable,

208
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,670
go ahead and study what things are based on and what things really are as they're

209
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,950
memorialized.

210
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,530
And if you like making things up and believing stories, then just, you know,

211
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:29,710
you'll probably be happy and have lots of people in agreement and you'll have a

212
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,110
concordance reality built around yourself.

213
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,330
Concordance just means that something is true because everyone thinks it's that,

214
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,130
right, this consensus.

215
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:44,930
And you'll be able to relish in plausible deniability and just move along and

216
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,490
just go along existing.

217
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:53,150
But researching and looking at things from an uncommon perspective will not make

218
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,610
you happy.

219
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:59,250
But then again, one should ask themselves, would I rather know some truth and be

220
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,730
maybe astounded, surprised, or a little unhappy about it?

221
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:07,250
Or would I rather just be in this concordant illusion about what everyone says it

222
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,869
is and agree with them and be happy?

223
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,329
So this is, again, a decision people have to make on their own.

224
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:16,530
But we won't waste time telling you what people think.

225
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:22,849
We will spend time on maybe showing you what you can see without really thinking

226
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:23,550
very much.

227
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:30,310
You know, what we like to do is say we, again, because Seth is usually with the

228
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,750
Greek here.

229
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:35,770
He'll be coming on the second hour and eventually we'll probably be taking calls

230
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:42,250
and also looking at input while we are on the air.

231
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:48,830
But the idea here that, as I started off saying, that the last thing left for

232
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:54,570
mankind to discover is what is obvious is not only quantitative but qualitative.

233
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:59,390
You know, for example, a couple of points that the Greek always brings up is,

234
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:03,210
like for example, you know you can't keep time with the Gregorian calendar.

235
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,310
It's essentially loosely called the Pope's work schedule.

236
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:14,090
You know, if your concept of recording events known as time is solely done from

237
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,710
using something called January through December or Monday through Friday with numbers

238
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,330
on charts and things you call dates, that is not a timepiece, folks.

239
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,220
I'll take a three-second pause before I continue.

240
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,960
It's not a timepiece.

241
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,620
It's a work schedule.

242
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:33,600
Yep.

243
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,360
Now, there's nothing wrong with it.

244
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,180
It's there for communication purposes.

245
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,980
But what I mean by it's a work schedule, it's arbitrary.

246
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,860
It's not based on anything.

247
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,280
Yeah, they tell you it goes about the Earth going around the sun and that and all that.

248
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,080
Yeah, show me.

249
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,440
It doesn't work.

250
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,960
You ever hear of a leap year?

251
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,160
You know, what if you date something what they call February 29th?

252
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,060
What happens next year?

253
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,540
It's gone?

254
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,920
Eh, it doesn't quite work that way, guys and gals and any other furry creatures that are listening.

255
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:03,600
The point here is are you paying attention?

256
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:09,520
Not to stay on that subject very much, but if you observe a certain date on that thing

257
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,040
they call the calendar, you notice how it's a different day of the week every year?

258
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,680
That's all I'm going to say about it.

259
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,200
Anybody paying attention?

260
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,600
Anyway, the other thing is people are making demands.

261
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,620
We want change.

262
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,480
We want this.

263
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,460
We want that.

264
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,520
Well, how are you going to do that in a comfortable, helpful way?

265
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:32,560
You know, the other thing I like to mention is, you know, everyone does whatever they like to do,

266
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,520
and they go to these entitled classes or specialists when they want to get something

267
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,320
or learn about something, right?

268
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,960
Even dentists need a dentist to work on their own teeth, or, you know, a haircutter

269
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,320
or a barber might have another barber cut their hair, so one hand washes the other.

270
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,880
We look at other people to fill in the blanks when we develop a blank,

271
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,640
but how are you going to do that in a helpful way, in a calm, cool, collected, rational way?

272
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,640
And what I mean by that is this is addressing all of humanity.

273
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,660
Where are you?

274
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,240
Are you paying any attention?

275
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,520
You ever notice when you heat or cool a room, the heat rises to the ceiling

276
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:14,340
and the cold goes to the floor, so you have a hot head and cold feet, right?

277
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,600
I thought we were supposed to have a cool head and warm feet,

278
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,220
but if we look at the natural environment, when it's hot in the valley,

279
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,780
it's cold at the mountaintop because perhaps in nature the cold is verified

280
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:32,240
and it rises and the heat descends, just like it should be in all biological systems,

281
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:38,580
but when you're creating that difference in heat and cold using degenerative chemical decomposition,

282
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,380
right, like you have a rising heat and a descending cold,

283
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,720
contrary to what's in the natural growth environment, and no one is paying attention.

284
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:53,800
In other words, why aren't the people on this planet knocking on the door of their heating

285
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:59,220
and cooling engineers and asking them for devices that heat or cool their homes,

286
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,680
buildings, cars, boats or whatever in the same way that nature does,

287
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,240
so you have a cool head and warm feet?

288
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,620
Why has this escaped everyone?

289
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,120
You can go on and on and on about simple things like this.

290
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,200
We've talked about the human body, for lack of a better term.

291
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,220
I call it the container.

292
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,340
They have this thing, they've convinced people that there is a blood pressure in the body

293
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,120
or a pressure.

294
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,520
Now, you don't have to go to any kind of special inquiry to realize that when you draw a vacuum

295
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,720
on a soft membrane, it kind of shrivels up, doesn't it?

296
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,160
Very much like your fingers and toes in water.

297
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:43,660
And you don't have to go to any kind of a specialist or anything to realize that when you have a soft membrane

298
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,460
or something and you put pressure in it, it kind of expands like a balloon or something.

299
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,860
So how many times have you looked at your body when it's cold or wet

300
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,600
and do your fingers expand like a frog or do they shrivel up?

301
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:01,980
Because perhaps there's a little bit of a vacuum in the body that keeps everything together.

302
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:07,080
And there's people running around even figuratively stating that I'm getting upset,

303
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,740
my blood pressure is rising.

304
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:16,220
Now, the only way you can evidence blood pressure is if you strap a cuff to a limb of the body

305
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,960
or the arm, inflate the cuff, restrict the flow of blood which moves under a slight vacuum

306
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:29,620
and then read some kind of diastolic, peristolic, ridiculous shop talk about blood pressure

307
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,960
when they're actually not even looking at blood pressure, they're looking at a zone between beats.

308
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,240
So why are we, anyway, why are we, you know, what's going on here?

309
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:48,980
Look how obvious things are around you or around us or the surface dwelling earth inhabitants.

310
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,980
What's going on?

311
00:22:50,660 --> 00:23:00,640
You know, how can one make the demands or groups make the demands as they do without first addressing the obvious?

312
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:09,560
Now, what's interesting is what kind of a culture would actually fully submit to an arbitrary work schedule

313
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:16,680
that you can't even keep time with and presumably operate as if they are keeping time with it

314
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:25,080
or not noticing that their well-being can be pretty much dependent on a cool head and warm feet

315
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:31,220
yet they're totally oblivious to the way they're functioning in their living spaces with a hot head and cold feet.

316
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,440
How can this be?

317
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:40,980
How can there be an arrangement where people agree that these little critters called bugs and bacteria

318
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:49,400
are causing disease where on one hand they profess that and on the other hand they all have refrigeration

319
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:55,240
and depend on refrigeration to keep these creatures in a state of dormancy.

320
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,260
So how can they, if they're in a state of dormancy when it's cold, be contagions?

321
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,840
It just doesn't make any sense.

322
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,700
Yet people are professing all these things which are contrary to what they can see around them.

323
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,540
Another aspect, folks, to consider, very stark, did you know that there's not a religion on the planet,

324
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,200
bar none, that does anything that's in the text that they allegedly subscribe to?

325
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,160
Not a one.

326
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,140
Regardless if it's spanned the world, going from east to west and back around,

327
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,020
no religion on the planet at all, bar none, does anything that's in the text that they allegedly subscribe to

328
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,860
in context or at all.

329
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,940
Fascinating to see that.

330
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,120
So how can people say they're spiritual? Based on what?

331
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,960
Things that they make up as they go along?

332
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,220
Well, you don't need a book, Greek.

333
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:53,700
Well, okay, maybe then you don't care about those that came before you.

334
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,280
And maybe you want to just invent things because you're modern.

335
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:04,380
So what's uncommon here is what should be common.

336
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,780
Stop and think for a moment.

337
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,600
Actually, most people think they get into a lot of trouble,

338
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,800
so you've got to really stop and think and stop and think and stop and think.

339
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,020
Don't jump into too many things too quickly.

340
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:27,560
Again, this time of change, just to go back to it, regarding the seasons.

341
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,400
What's being planted now?

342
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,060
It's springtime.

343
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,680
Okay, this is when things are planted.

344
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,340
And like I mentioned earlier, it's not only purely agricultural.

345
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:42,320
It's also based on the way the cultures of humanity operate.

346
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,500
In other words, what is being planted?

347
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,300
Let's look at it maybe perhaps a different way.

348
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,940
You ever notice that when a lot of noise is being made, it tends to attract attention?

349
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,720
Could that be what's being reported on?

350
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,480
It's just noise.

351
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,980
Could it be that the real stuff is happening where it's quiet?

352
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,900
Does a forest make noise when it grows?

353
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:04,920
You see?

354
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,760
So the thing here is during this time period,

355
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:15,460
it would be sort of advisable to when one partakes in what's called media of any kind

356
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,940
and is inquiring about any subject of any kind,

357
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,240
might want to start maybe paying less attention where it's really noisy,

358
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,600
like, hey, look here, and look where it's really quiet.

359
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,360
Because that's where when the planting is done, you don't really see much.

360
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,940
And this is what spring is about.

361
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,720
Now, one aspect of spring, which from the ancient point of view, is when wars were started.

362
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,160
It was a time when the sovereigns went out to war.

363
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,300
And that's another concept.

364
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,360
You know, there's the concept of war.

365
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,680
And one day mankind will realize that war is a sport.

366
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,540
So I like to call it, you know, world sport one, world sport two.

367
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:59,300
And now people are talking about world sport three.

368
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,760
You're not going to get a world war three because things are happening.

369
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,820
So that will not be conducive to that.

370
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,720
And it is possible to know the future, folks, if you start understanding cycles

371
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,620
and if you stop ignoring those that came before you.

372
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:21,560
And knowing the future is not necessarily predicting the future because it's already been kind of laid out.

373
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:26,900
A practical materialistic approach would be if anyone embarks on an endeavor,

374
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,720
whether it's in cooking or construction or machining or going somewhere,

375
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:37,480
they have a pretty good idea of what will happen next with all of these simple processes.

376
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:41,960
But it seems to fall apart when we look at it at a geopolitical level

377
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,140
or at a mass social or cultural level.

378
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:50,600
All of a sudden it's taboo to not be able to discuss about what can happen next

379
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,060
or what will happen next based on the repeating of cycles

380
00:27:55,060 --> 00:28:00,760
and also based on the anomalous nature of what's called prophecy.

381
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,160
And this is an interesting thing.

382
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,580
This comes up often and I usually tell people,

383
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,100
if anyone tells you that the prophecies can be changed,

384
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,340
well then those are not prophecies and they can't be addressed as such.

385
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:14,200
And every culture has them.

386
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:23,420
So the interesting aspect there is what are these prophecies?

387
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:29,470
They're anomalous events that are sort of not part of the regular seasonal clockwork,

388
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,140
the regular social repeating of things.

389
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,780
And that's where most people fail when they start bringing these things up.

390
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,570
And I can assure you right now publicly,

391
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:45,910
no one, very few if any out there have even been able to loosely touch on anything

392
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:49,010
with any accuracy about what's coming in the future.

393
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:52,670
And part of it is because there's very little or no discussion

394
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:56,010
on even the effects of the seasons on events,

395
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,730
whether they're social or personal or cultural and such.

396
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:03,510
So these things need to be considered and they're so simple.

397
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,790
You don't need a specialist.

398
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:11,830
You don't need anyone to read into anything or read out of what they believe

399
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,050
or that they heard from someone else.

400
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:21,010
There is a simple, let's say, pattern that is from archetypal things,

401
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:24,190
archetype meaning things that are the beginning or start of,

402
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,990
that seem to have been missed.

403
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:32,670
And that's why I like to perhaps today bring up the concept of the seasonality

404
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,330
and maybe strike that a little bit more.

405
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:42,110
Because the anomalies to these natural clockworks are what's called the prophecies.

406
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:46,910
And sorry, folks, very few people on this planet at this point

407
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:53,330
will be able to touch them with any accuracy because of the level of lack of inquiry

408
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:56,990
or correspondence to see how the seasons affect things

409
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,830
and also the lack of inquiry into the accuracy of what they're reading

410
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,330
and paying attention.

411
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,090
So the concept of things being prophetic, as you can see,

412
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:12,870
are being misused and very simply because it seems like no one can keep time anymore.

413
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:19,110
So anything that requires time marking or any sort of juxtaposition or reference

414
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:20,010
has been lost.

415
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:24,410
It's kind of like going to a construction site and seeing a bewildered carpenter

416
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,990
asking him, why are you so upset?

417
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,830
He says, I've been cutting this board twice and it's still too short.

418
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:35,110
So there's this concept that just because you're making busy work that you're doing,

419
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,990
you're going in the right direction.

420
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:42,930
You're not, as a society, in terms of inquiring and using what you've got.

421
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,370
So act with efficiency.

422
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,810
Be efficient in what you do.

423
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:52,510
Don't waste time, meaning you do what you like, but wasting time would be,

424
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:56,750
how many times have you heard people prepping for a geopolitical event that never comes?

425
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:02,910
So these things, understanding the seasons, understanding things to come

426
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:07,930
and how things operate makes one more efficient in what they're doing.

427
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:13,190
So I would say efficiency is really the key to anything.

428
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:16,190
And it's, believe it or not, uncommon.

429
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:20,910
Even the automobiles that have been around for 100 plus years are touted,

430
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,570
the best ones right now are touted to being 25% efficient.

431
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:29,490
That means that 75% of the fuel you put in it is wasted into heat.

432
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:34,110
And that is an interesting metaphor when you compare it to everything else that's going on.

433
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:38,770
So what do we see about the seasonal changes?

434
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:44,390
Again, just to perhaps be focused on the northern part of the world, let's just say,

435
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:49,310
could it be springtime, things planted require water?

436
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:52,230
Someone requested that I discuss that.

437
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:55,410
Well, you know, Greek, why don't you talk about water?

438
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,330
You know, you do a lot of work with it.

439
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:03,870
And what's interesting was one starts to discuss water and go into that subject.

440
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:08,970
First thing you do is try to inquire where it's easy to get information.

441
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:14,010
And what's interesting about that is jumping around and discussing water.

442
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,490
You know, that's all it is.

443
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:22,470
But if you're not going to jump around, it seems like people have come into agreement that it's H2O.

444
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:28,730
And when you discuss it as H2O, I say, wow, okay, if water is really H2O,

445
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:34,110
then why does a bucket of water weigh more than a bucket of air where it shouldn't?

446
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,090
That sounds like a ridiculous statement.

447
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,790
According to the material scientists, it should.

448
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:43,210
You know, the molecular weight of water should be roughly 18,

449
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,850
and the molecular weight of air is roughly 28, 29.

450
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:50,950
So we're not getting proper answers here if we're using their methodology.

451
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,470
Something very unusual about this thing we called water.

452
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:59,290
And even metaphorically, when you water an idea, water seems to impart growth to things.

453
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:05,530
But, again, speaking on the material side of it, you know, the tangible, clear liquid,

454
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:10,370
it seems to be appropriate to discuss water when you discuss the planting of things.

455
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:17,890
And just simply that someone requested that I did discuss the simplicity of water from a simple point of view.

456
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:23,850
There is so much being discussed about it, and it's hard to say that it's untrue, but it's not true enough.

457
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:33,430
What is true, though, is that what makes water unusual is that it's the only material that once it gets cooled down beyond a certain point,

458
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,850
it starts to expand again. Right.

459
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:40,070
If anyone has put water in the freezer, notices the container could rupture or burst.

460
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:44,490
So it has a very unique characteristic from that point of view,

461
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:48,630
and also that it's transparent and pretty much dissolves everything in it.

462
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:54,950
And it provides life and growth aspects to pretty much everything as well as cleaning aspects.

463
00:33:54,950 --> 00:34:03,390
So good water would require having water in the state that it likes to be in where its quality is the highest.

464
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:06,270
And where is that and how do you achieve that?

465
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:11,389
And very simply, one way to start with it discussing that subject is temperature.

466
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:16,870
Water is its densest at about 39 degrees Fahrenheit or four degrees Celsius.

467
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:21,409
So that means that if the temperature goes above or below that, the water expands.

468
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:26,170
Just like let's say the human body being healthy at ninety eight point six Fahrenheit.

469
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:32,230
If the temperature rises more than that or lowers more than that, the body doesn't feel healthy.

470
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:38,870
So the water body prefers a thirty nine degree Fahrenheit or four degrees Celsius point.

471
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:42,770
And when you get the water to that point, it develops a maturation.

472
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,909
It matures and it relaxes.

473
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:53,010
And that is a point where anyone can, let's say regardless what water source you have,

474
00:34:54,190 --> 00:35:02,150
experience a rise in quality in water simply by keeping it in the dark and letting it come to that temperature for a short period of time, preferably overnight.

475
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:11,330
And what's interesting about that is coincidentally most refrigeration that's offered is in that range at thirty nine Fahrenheit or four degrees Celsius.

476
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:19,090
So when water is discussed, it's astounding how little it's discussed that simply leaving water in a dark,

477
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,650
cool place overnight or for an interval of time will raise its quality.

478
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:30,690
This is not discussing the chemical aspect of what's dissolved in the water that you may or may not prefer,

479
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,450
but just the actual quality of the water body.

480
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:43,690
If that can be recalled and remembered, that water likes to be in a cool and dark place would raise its quality,

481
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:53,410
would pretty much bring the entire interaction of humankind with the water body or water substance to a new level.

482
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:56,050
And it's astounding how little this is discussed.

483
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:04,350
There are thousands, if not millions, of people and sites and information bits that are thrown out there

484
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:08,590
and that fail to bring up the simple point and anyone can try it.

485
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:16,050
Now, what's interesting, contrary to what I said to what you will see in the stark material reality,

486
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:19,770
is that if anyone goes out to purchase what they call water in the bottled form,

487
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:25,430
you notice that they're in clear containers exposed to light and not at that temperature.

488
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:36,310
Only the finest quality waters or liquids are kept in containers that obscure light and in some sort of refrigeration.

489
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:41,570
So this is a very interesting, very, very simple aspect.

490
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:47,570
And perhaps as Uncommon Sense continues, we might give more water bits,

491
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:52,990
because there's then the aspect of chemically and qualitatively treating the water beyond that,

492
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,850
which is very simple to do as well.

493
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:58,790
But for now, folks, I was asked to kind of bring up, what about water?

494
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:08,790
Just imagine being able to increase the quality of your water by simply considering temperature and light.

495
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:16,250
So lack of light and having it as close to 4 degrees Celsius or 39 degrees Fahrenheit for a period of time,

496
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:24,510
so the water reaches what Victor Schauberger called the anomaly point, where water is its densest.

497
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:32,030
So it's a real simple approach to anything that will give you an immediate quality change.

498
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:39,030
Now, obviously, if we go back and discuss, well, you can't keep time with the Pope's work schedule,

499
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,210
what's a real simple quality approach to that?

500
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:41,830
There isn't one.

501
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:45,290
But you can imagine that if time is going to be based on something,

502
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:48,230
it should be on something that doesn't change and isn't arbitrary, folks.

503
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,770
And that's the sun, the moon, and the stars.

504
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,250
That's how time was always kept.

505
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:57,350
Now, the other thing we mentioned regarding heat rising and cold descending,

506
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:02,390
well, probably prevents one from keeping a cool head and warm feet.

507
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:07,490
That's going to be a little harder to do with your entitled engineers and scientists.

508
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:11,190
You're not going to quite get that, perhaps, in this society.

509
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:17,530
But you must maintain a cool head and warm feet to promote a healthful condition.

510
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:18,330
Go figure.

511
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:26,010
But no one at all is inquiring to the entitled engineers.

512
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:33,030
And what I mean by entitled is they have social rank, seemingly, over the common folk.

513
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:39,870
And the common folk are not holding them to any sense of responsibility to provide them with the technology,

514
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:44,190
providing the common folk, let's say, with a technology that's conducive to a healthful condition.

515
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,550
Let's say a cool head and warm feet.

516
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:54,290
With all of your technological advances, you still ignored or still do ignore the basic premise

517
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,630
that one should have a cool head and warm feet,

518
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:01,950
evidenced by the way you heat and cool all of your living spaces,

519
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:06,790
and the lack of inquiry and demand.

520
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:13,210
So when people come and bring up topics of concern,

521
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:17,370
whether they be cultural, geopolitical, religious, social, what have you,

522
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,690
I'm like, but you're doing it with a hot head and cold feet.

523
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:27,810
Why don't you go request from your entitled engineers ways of perhaps maintaining a cool head

524
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:32,750
and warm feet in your living spaces, and maybe that might be a good place to start.

525
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:38,930
And I guess I'm going to drive this home to pretty much show it as something that's obvious that's being negated.

526
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:44,870
So if the more obvious closer to home that concerns your health and well-being is ignored,

527
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:50,570
do you ever feel like you're being ignored when you're asking about other things perhaps?

528
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:56,410
You want geopolitical changes and cultural changes, economic and judicial changes,

529
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:59,910
health changes with your scientific community and medical community.

530
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:07,230
You're getting really far away from what matters, having a cool head and warm feet,

531
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:13,750
and there still is no demand on the engineering entitled classes to develop such devices.

532
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:19,150
Now whether it sounds impossible, whether it sounds probable, is irrelevant.

533
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,130
The inquiry and the demand is not being made.

534
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,750
You've been distracted.

535
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:31,010
So if there's no concern in keeping headquarters, meaning your mind, your soul,

536
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:38,130
which is your breath and your body, in fair order, how are you going to manage and request change

537
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:40,830
in the other things that are way beyond that?

538
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:49,590
Because no one can negate that the most immediate concern would be one's comfort to a degree or avoiding discomfort.

539
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:53,130
And again, how are you going to do that with a hot head and cold feet?

540
00:40:53,430 --> 00:41:00,410
Because that's what you're propagating with the way your engineers are giving you devices to heat and cool your living spaces.

541
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:02,150
So just think about that for a moment.

542
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:06,050
And was there an element of hypocrisy there?

543
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,310
Quite possibly.

544
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,570
So I don't know, folks.

545
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:20,190
But that's all pretty much on the concept of spring from a materialistic point of view, and perhaps maybe not.

546
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:27,110
There's thought aspects and realization aspects behind everything,

547
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:32,530
whether you want to be materialistic or you want to look at the non-materialistic,

548
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:37,710
less tangible formative energies that also come through in springtime.

549
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:46,910
If you want to look at it as a building up period, as being a formative, hearing about things,

550
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,210
well, let's say a planting period that leads to building up,

551
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:54,550
hearing about things that are breaking down are not rational during this time.

552
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:57,530
They can happen but are very unlikely.

553
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:07,130
So leading and living one's life with efficiency might be the thing to consider when we look at the seasons.

554
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:09,430
So what's uncommon about that?

555
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,630
Well, it's pretty obvious.

556
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,230
That's what makes it uncommon.

557
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:25,990
There's a lot of discussion about topics that are global in sense, meaning worldly, affecting everyone.

558
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:34,990
And let's say in a negative way that have been coming across for many years now in many aspects,

559
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:40,350
whether it's academic or media or religious or whatever.

560
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:49,890
And it's interesting to see how no matter how much people or these groups are discussing this impending doom,

561
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:55,690
doom hasn't come yet because it won't, not in the way that it's being discussed.

562
00:42:55,690 --> 00:43:04,450
So the lack of efficiency that humankind is operating in, if that were to be reduced in some way,

563
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:12,790
that would leave more energy to do other things, perhaps think clearly, perhaps act a little better.

564
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:14,270
What is better?

565
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:20,390
Well, you have to figure that out on your own sometimes because very often what we're told is not the best.

566
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:29,190
So this is going to require some inquiry, again, which we will discuss as this continues,

567
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,130
this venture we call Uncommon Sense.

568
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:35,910
And, again, we've got about maybe 15 minutes or so, and Seth will be joining us as well.

569
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,930
So, again, this is perhaps the fourth time or so Uncommon Sense has come around,

570
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:43,930
and we've been wrought with certain tech issues in the past,

571
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:49,010
and we kind of feel like this is a project that is slowly being launched in terms of gaining momentum

572
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:54,250
and conveying things that will hold true to the name and what we promise on doing,

573
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:58,070
which is perhaps what's called Uncommon Sense.

574
00:43:59,690 --> 00:44:11,650
The simplicity of things and leading and living one's life with efficiency might be the thing to be considered,

575
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:17,630
simply because when we're not being efficient with something, we lose it.

576
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,790
It's considered a loss.

577
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:26,390
And what's interesting with the concept of being in an information age,

578
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:31,190
I found that no matter how much this is bestowed on people,

579
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:35,850
thinking that we are so full of information and easy to access,

580
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:43,090
tons of information from any subject or just rapidly through this thing that's been thrust upon society

581
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:49,770
known as the Internet with the silly phones and all these other things and computers and whatever,

582
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:54,210
where is the discernment on using these things?

583
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:55,990
Where is the discernment?

584
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,550
Is there discernment on information?

585
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,330
And can the information be vetted?

586
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:01,870
I hear very much.

587
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:11,030
I think that from having discussions with folks through the past few years regarding this information age

588
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:18,650
and things that are going on, people are less excited than they were years ago about it,

589
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:21,030
because they're saying, well, I know it's junk.

590
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:28,570
I know it's BS what's on the Internet, but I go there anyway, or I use it for this and I use it for that.

591
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:37,430
So when you hear these terms or when I hear them, I call them inefficient use of the medium.

592
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:44,010
And there's been a lot of, I would say, not necessarily social change.

593
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:49,390
Society hasn't changed much, but they've been numbed down now.

594
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:53,050
There's a lot of, what do I mean by numbing down?

595
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:57,670
There's a lot of talk about what's called the dumbing down.

596
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:00,210
Oh, yeah, society is being dumbed down,

597
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:04,890
or there's even like documentaries, the dumbing down of America or something,

598
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,130
and there's this dumbing down discussion.

599
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:16,410
By looking at this kind of closely, you'll see that it's really the numbing down that's going on.

600
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:26,830
And looking at it even closer, I would say that the majority of the people that are alive today have missed out on the dumbing down.

601
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,150
That began a very long time ago.

602
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:36,730
What you've been experiencing through this generation or one or two or three or four is the numbing down.

603
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:40,370
What I mean by the numbing down is the apathetic aspect.

604
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:46,770
In other words, no matter what is put in front of you, how good or how bad, how truthful or how deceitful,

605
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:52,850
if one is apathetic or numbed down to it, it will not take effect as it should.

606
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:59,410
So it seems like the people have not been reacting to the truth of many matters,

607
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:05,490
and they have not really been reacting so much to the deception of many matters.

608
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:08,130
And it's this numbing down.

609
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:13,650
And just to explain that slightly further is, let's say, from the conspiratorial side,

610
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:21,010
there are a lot of things that are being brought out as people being dubbed as conspiracy theories or conspiracy theorists.

611
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:28,150
And when you look at the subject matter or the topic involved, it's not that quite difficult to get to the bottom of it,

612
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,130
but they prefer not to.

613
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:31,870
It's really strange.

614
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:34,350
Like someone once says, there's no money in the solution.

615
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:35,730
The money is in the problem.

616
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:39,610
And I'm not saying the conspiracy theorists exist because of the money,

617
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:47,910
but it seems like there's an attitude that it's taken that might be branched out from Gustave Le Bon's book, The Crowd,

618
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:53,970
where in order to get people together under an idea, for everyone to get that idea generally,

619
00:47:54,170 --> 00:48:03,050
that idea is so simplified and mostly oversimplified that it no longer resembles the purpose of the original idea.

620
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:04,030
Think about that.

621
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:13,010
So the numbing aspect, you know, if you look at a lot of researchers, you know, they get stuck on a point.

622
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:18,870
And if anything, concordantly doesn't agree with that point, it's not true or it can't be looked at.

623
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:23,030
So it's a numbing thing because, folks, it's not in the information.

624
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:31,750
And also from the deception point of view, what's interesting is now I noticed like there's things called false flag events.

625
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:40,910
And no matter how severe they're painted, yeah, it'll be in a quote unquote newsworthy story for a day or two.

626
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:44,270
And then everyone sort of brushes it off like no big deal.

627
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:54,230
Right. So where is the information affecting the individual and how is information really effective at society at large?

628
00:48:54,530 --> 00:49:01,290
If you see this apathy throughout, it's an interesting thing to see.

629
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:16,870
Another thing is the extremist views that are abandoned almost immediately when there's a title change or a group of individuals decide that it need not be focused on.

630
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:18,510
Give an example.

631
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:33,390
Years ago, someone was felt quite compelled to do some serious survivalist storage, food storage, weapon hoarding type thing because of some comments that were going to destroy Earth and society.

632
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:40,330
And he was yelling at people that if they didn't do the same as his, he'd shoot them if everything went down and they came asking him for anything.

633
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:44,750
I approached this individual a couple of years later about his attitude back then.

634
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:47,030
He says, oh, oh, that's OK. That was then.

635
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:54,990
Now, now it's different. I'm like, wow, that was a very extremist point of view to take basically on nothing.

636
00:49:55,390 --> 00:50:00,990
It's seemingly. So what's interesting, it's not only this calm, passive apathy towards.

637
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:04,390
Oh, yeah. Whatever. You know, it doesn't matter. That's your truth or.

638
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:07,470
Oh, yeah. So they did it again. It's another deception.

639
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:11,470
No big deal. But it's the extremist aspect as well.

640
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:16,690
And then it's just seemingly abandoned.

641
00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:23,010
And I find that astonishing. I don't know if there's anything to do with having a hot head and cold feet.

642
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:31,290
But anyway, so this dumbing down that's being applied still, it's not as much as it was a few years ago.

643
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,870
I believe happened. I use that term loosely.

644
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:38,450
I believe I don't like to give a belief and opinion has ended a while ago.

645
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:44,870
And it's been the numbing down period in the 20th century through whatever events you chose.

646
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:56,610
So choose to inquire about. You know, so this this aspect again, the numbing down, the apathy, going back to it being a seasonal change.

647
00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:05,890
Isn't that interesting how it all applies? I find that the seasonal changes being ignored, not through knowledge or lack of knowledge.

648
00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:11,170
But it seems like there is an apathy, a numbing down of humanity.

649
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:17,270
And I have said it before on what I call colloquial Greek speak. Why? What's coming?

650
00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:21,850
It's pretty easy for anyone to see. It sounds arrogant when someone says this is coming in the future.

651
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:28,470
And I expect to you folks, if you ever hear anyone telling you what's coming in the future, I expect you to hold them to it.

652
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:33,570
Right. Give you an example. There's actually more than an example.

653
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:41,330
I'll make a statement and I'll claim that every economic commentator, period, out there is doing humanity a disservice.

654
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:47,530
Every one of them is discussing doom and gloom every month and no one is holding them to it.

655
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:55,470
As a matter of fact, the more erroneous economic commentators are, it seems that the more their wallet grows through subscriptions and memberships.

656
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:59,130
It's a direct proportion. It's very interesting.

657
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:09,730
Every single economic theorist or public pontificate out there is nothing more than a carnival barker claiming doom and gloom.

658
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:16,230
And none of them, not a one, is discussing the anatomy of a credit-based economy.

659
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:21,610
They might talk a little bit about gold and silver or the US dollar or the note.

660
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:25,030
But I am telling you, there is absolutely no substance.

661
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:29,970
Their value is not any more than the stuff you scrape off the bottom of your shoe.

662
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:32,950
But anyway, this is all of your economic commentators.

663
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:38,870
But they love it because they rely on people's ignorance and apathy.

664
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:48,150
And since they're relying on people's ignorance and apathy, they have discovered that people are very reliable and they're not going to stop what they're doing.

665
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:51,750
And no one is holding them accountable for what they're saying.

666
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:56,870
And here's our break and hopefully we'll have Seth Michael in the second hour.

667
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:57,650
Thank you everyone.

668
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:00,170
This is Uncommon Sense on American Freedom Radio.

669
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:02,490
Greetings for the second hour.

670
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:04,670
Uncommon Sense as usual.

671
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:14,430
And you're listening to American Freedom Radio and Uncommon Sense or UncommonRadio.com with the Greek and Seth Michael.

672
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:18,290
I hope Seth is with us on the second hour. If he is, we will get a sonic indication.

673
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:19,250
Hello.

674
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:21,350
Hey, how are you Seth? Great.

675
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:27,330
Yeah, I went ahead first hour, gave our listeners an earful perhaps and welcome.

676
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:29,010
Thank you.

677
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:31,790
It's good to be here and to be broadcasting.

678
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:33,250
Yes.

679
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:34,830
I'm audible.

680
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:37,990
I imagine as you can't hear me obviously, so wonderful.

681
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:40,990
Yeah, I just want to jump in as some of the thoughts.

682
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:43,790
I'll just let you know if you were not aware of it.

683
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:52,670
It did speak about how all the financial commentators are really doing a big disservice to the public at large by the way they're discussing things

684
00:53:52,670 --> 00:54:02,650
and they've discovered that the people are ignorant and fearful and they find that to be their hinge point or what they base their commentaries on

685
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:05,390
and no one is holding them accountable for their rubbish.

686
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:12,190
And people are still going around screaming about a dollar that's going to collapse and debt and such and such.

687
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:22,390
And just to bring up some comments in the chat, very valid about where does credit come from, the debt and all these IMF aspects.

688
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:29,510
And what people fail to realize is that the common person on the street, the public at large,

689
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:34,410
when they are dealing with anything quote unquote financial, that is all secondary market.

690
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:42,890
Primary market, the public at large has never even interacted with at all.

691
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:44,710
And what do I mean by secondary market?

692
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:51,610
Primary market, the primary market would be the rock concert and the secondary market would be the guy outside selling the T-shirts.

693
00:54:54,010 --> 00:55:06,070
So whenever you're dealing with an entity known as someone from the legal society or a bank outlet, a clerk, a manager, credit card bills, taxing authorities,

694
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:15,370
those are all secondary to uphold some kind of plausibility that there is money, viable money in the system

695
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:22,950
where everything that's memorialized about anything financial or economic shows the contrary, that it's credit.

696
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:31,610
In other words, you're going to function temporarily on something that is based on promises alone until money is brought back.

697
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:41,210
And because people have totally abandoned the substance, now they are functioning strictly within the promise of the function

698
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:45,630
and makes it completely lawless and unfounded and not even legal.

699
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:50,350
And people, when you say this is legal tender, it's not even legal tender.

700
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:53,730
It's kind of like giving a metaphor.

701
00:55:54,530 --> 00:56:08,670
If you look at any religion on the planet, what they are actually functioning in their traditions is actually considered an abomination in the text that they allegedly subscribe to, totally contrary.

702
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:11,700
So it's really a bizarre, bizarre aspect.

703
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:18,930
But in essence, one day we will probably do something about the money system.

704
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:24,350
But essentially, just to recap, the first hour was about the change of seasons, the planting of spring,

705
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:32,310
and just again the general numbing down that humanity has been experiencing for a long time and not the dumbing down.

706
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:33,810
The dumbing down phase is over.

707
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:41,550
It's all numbing down now, which leads perhaps to something else that people discuss.

708
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:45,750
I hate to use the phrase new agey.

709
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:47,470
How many times have you heard that, right?

710
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:48,670
This is new agey.

711
00:56:49,650 --> 00:57:00,330
People need to take that matter a little more seriously because what was put in place at the end of the 19th century to divert mankind, let's say, from anything tangible or real

712
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:07,210
and to set him on the path that he's on now of the materialism and such within his modern age happened through that movement.

713
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:09,250
It's a solipsism.

714
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:12,970
Is it soliphism or solacism, where nothing matters kind of idea?

715
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:16,850
Solipsism, where you are the entire universe essentially.

716
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:17,670
Yeah.

717
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:21,190
And this total removal of people talking.

718
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:24,790
How many times have you heard these morons talk about, oh, it's consciousness, man.

719
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:25,830
It's your intent.

720
00:57:26,390 --> 00:57:28,090
And I mean moron with a capital R.

721
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:43,050
You got to put the emphasis on that because this is now removing the creature, meaning mankind, from achieving any point of view that's going to be beneficial to anything that he does

722
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:48,410
and allowed him to be steered and guided by a small entitled group, whether it be known or unknown.

723
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,410
I'm not being a conspiracy theorist here.

724
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:52,410
And it's been working very, very well.

725
00:57:53,290 --> 00:58:00,410
And one of these things, these new age idiots and conscious and awake and intent people talk about is fear, man.

726
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:02,810
Oh, they put out this fear.

727
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:04,950
You know, it's going to get you.

728
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:08,750
No one is rationalizing this thing they called fear.

729
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:10,470
And very simple, folks.

730
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:17,870
If you lack mental fortitude or spiritual fortitude, meaning spiritual or mental strength, and you lack skill.

731
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,790
You're going to be susceptible to different types of fear.

732
00:58:22,590 --> 00:58:23,770
That's all it is.

733
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:31,310
The idiots that are out there, I'm using strong language because a high level of criminality requires strong language.

734
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:42,150
And the people out there, and this is not a rant, whether it's mainstream alternative or the man on the street that tells you that this thing called fear porn is going to get you and it's all about fear, is a moron.

735
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:44,490
Because it has nothing to do with that.

736
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:54,330
It has to do with taking advantage of your lack of desire to inquire and your maybe unconscious desire to remain lazy.

737
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:56,390
Let's discuss for a moment fear.

738
00:58:57,270 --> 00:59:07,250
Fear is something that disables the being when that being lacks the mental ability to discern it and also the skill to deal with it.

739
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:22,790
And the example there, which I believe we mentioned, is if you have no skills at all in how to use a dishrag, a sponge or a mop, the very factor act of a glass of milk falling over is fearful and terrifying.

740
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:33,210
But if a glass of milk falls over and you have skills with a dishrag, a sponge and a mop, you'll say, no worries.

741
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:35,410
It's just spilled milk.

742
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:37,970
You see the point?

743
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:42,610
So this blanket statement that, oh, it's all just fear.

744
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:43,330
Fear of what?

745
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:44,450
What are you talking about?

746
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:45,310
Who are you addressing?

747
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:46,770
What?

748
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:48,410
Where's the venue?

749
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:49,410
Where's the thought?

750
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:50,410
Where's the completion?

751
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:51,750
Where's the actuation?

752
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:53,130
Fear of what?

753
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:54,590
Just fear, fear.

754
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:56,450
And it's the same with love.

755
00:59:56,610 --> 00:59:57,930
They do this with love.

756
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,130
Oh, God is love.

757
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:01,050
You just need love.

758
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:01,930
Just got to love.

759
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:03,630
What are you talking about?

760
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:04,210
Love.

761
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:04,930
Define it.

762
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:13,830
You know, if the National Pedophile Convention or PDAVN, as someone once said, is a more accurate term for these folks.

763
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:16,710
They have a lot of love, don't they?

764
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:19,710
These child rapists.

765
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:21,750
What are you talking about?

766
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:22,310
Love.

767
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:23,290
What kind of love?

768
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:24,050
Where's the quality?

769
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:27,330
So this is the level.

770
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:29,530
I spoke about inefficiency earlier.

771
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:37,650
And there are terms that are, because of the apathetic sense and the numb down, not the dumb down, the numb down aspect.

772
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:39,790
Oh, fear, man.

773
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:40,630
You got to have love.

774
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:41,210
Fear is bad.

775
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:41,750
Love is good.

776
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:42,970
It's like, what are you talking about?

777
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:44,290
Qualify.

778
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:50,990
You've got to complete the thought because all of those things are based on what you know and how you can operate within those things.

779
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:56,930
So with that said, Seth, please add or take away.

780
01:01:01,150 --> 01:01:02,650
Fear is a tool.

781
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:11,590
It is used for many purposes by many different people, some of them not even aware that they're doing it.

782
01:01:13,930 --> 01:01:15,570
But the baselessness of it.

783
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:24,750
You know, like I gave the analogy of the if you have no skill with how to use a mop or a dishrag, the thought of something spilling over is terrifying, isn't it?

784
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:29,490
But if you can operate a dishrag or sponge or a mop, it's not a big deal.

785
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:31,410
Right.

786
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:36,550
So, like, again, going back to these these morons that call themselves financial, they have financial shows.

787
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:37,390
They're all over the Internet.

788
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:40,090
They have subscription newsletters, all of them.

789
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:42,630
They're always talking about a collapsing dollar.

790
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:47,930
Is anyone going to message this guy and tell him that there is no dollar and that there's a credit based economy?

791
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:57,770
By the way, folks, you know, maybe we'll give little tidbits whenever you hear, because I've had several morons send me stuff about the collapsing dollar.

792
01:01:57,770 --> 01:01:59,930
And yes, they are morons, with a capital R.

793
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:03,810
A dollar is a weight measurement, like pound or weight.

794
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:08,650
I think 271 grains of silver, precious metal and silver is measured in grains.

795
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:19,550
What they're talking about, let's translate for the lazy, because these are people that are spiritually, mentally lazy that talk about collapsing dollar and concern of it.

796
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:27,390
Well, let me just translate in simple terms what is being said, what is being put out there for the public at large.

797
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:32,050
When they say the dollar is collapsing, how can it collapse when there is no dollar?

798
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:50,190
What they're actually saying, let me translate this for you folks out there, is there are certain companies, American-based companies, whether they're IMF or New York banksters or whatever, that have preferential treatment on financial transactions,

799
01:02:50,190 --> 01:03:02,550
meaning that when you have something called the petrodollar, which is an erroneous term, trade being done with these large oil tankers or trade being done with bonds and stocks.

800
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:15,030
These American companies, because they're American-based, are given first dibs on the transaction and they broker the deal, whether who they're brokering it for is making a profit or not is irrelevant.

801
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:16,430
They are simply brokering.

802
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:17,830
They get a cut.

803
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:20,230
These are American companies.

804
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:34,010
So when you hear that the dollar is collapsing, what is really happening is that these American companies that are given preferential treatment on the initial front-end transactions are losing preferential privilege.

805
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:44,090
People are looking for other entities that are not American-based to have preferential treatment on managing these transactions.

806
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:47,350
There is no US dollar, folks.

807
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:49,410
There hasn't been for a long time.

808
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:56,410
And the price of gold is $20 an ounce, period.

809
01:03:57,390 --> 01:04:05,070
So when they say it's 1,200 an ounce, that is according to 1,200 credits, not dollars.

810
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:11,550
So the price of gold or the value of gold, I should say, has never changed.

811
01:04:11,630 --> 01:04:13,330
It's $20 per ounce, period.

812
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:14,970
There's no debating on that.

813
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:29,430
But the price that you, because you're functioning in private credit, you're going to have to come up with 1,000 or more credit notes or whatever you want to call them, book entries to get that ounce of gold.

814
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:47,550
But that ounce of gold would buy you a fine tailored suit 100 years ago, 200 years ago, 300 years ago, 1,000 years ago, and that same, it would buy you a fine tailored suit today.

815
01:04:50,490 --> 01:05:02,330
So again, just to tie this without going into the gold and the precious metals is when you hear about a currency collapsing, how can something that doesn't exist collapse when it's based on credit?

816
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:07,910
And if anyone tells you that it's debt-based, they are stuck on the secondary market.

817
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:10,630
In other words, they've never been to the concert.

818
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:15,990
They're outside selling T-shirts or buying T-shirts, but they've never seen the show.

819
01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:19,690
And the majority of the people have never seen the show.

820
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:24,710
They're outside on the sidewalk buying the T-shirt.

821
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:31,630
And you will very rarely, you can pretty much look through social media websites talking about debt-based currency.

822
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:34,370
There is no such thing.

823
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:37,190
You've been told that and you believe it.

824
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:51,310
Again, just to reiterate, maybe this is the third or fourth time, when you hear about the collapse of a currency, it's the preferential treatment of a particular brokerage house or banking financial firms losing that privilege.

825
01:05:52,050 --> 01:06:03,430
So when you hear again about the American dollar collapsing, all it means is that world trade is trying to avoid using these American or US-based brokerage firms.

826
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:07,850
In other words, they get the first dibs on processing the transaction.

827
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:09,490
That's all it means.

828
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:15,270
As a matter of fact, the more – well, we'll save this for another discussion.

829
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:18,690
Perhaps we'll do something on just the finance.

830
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:24,970
Today was pretty much speaking about the seasonal effect of spring because we're almost smack in the middle of the seasonal change,

831
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:29,730
and whether it's spring or fall, basing it on the other side of the world that's going into winter,

832
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:34,210
and now we're going into summer, you have these transitional seasons known as spring and fall.

833
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:44,510
And what's interesting about that, at some point, the whole world, it's possible within the spring or fall time period for the whole world to enjoy the same temperature or temperament for a couple of days or weeks.

834
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:51,730
It's a very interesting time period of a homeogenous kind of setting through the world.

835
01:06:51,730 --> 01:07:02,470
And it also – when you have this, what's interesting is when you have fall and spring on the entire world, again, not only is it temperature,

836
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:10,370
the temperatures can be the same, pretty mild and such, and leading into different degrees of next cycles.

837
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:13,170
Like in one cycle, you'd be going colder, and the cycle going into hotter.

838
01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:19,470
There's still the contrast of spring and fall where spring is planting and fall is harvesting.

839
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:26,710
So on one end here, we're in the planting, and on the other part of the world, they're in the harvest.

840
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:32,950
So the focus of the past hour was pretty much on what happens during planting.

841
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:40,970
It's a quiet time, and even when a field is fully planted, it doesn't look like much is growing or changed, but it's all in place.

842
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:47,190
And the suggestion that was made in the previous hour was whenever there's a lot of noise in the media,

843
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:54,030
whether it's geopolitical, economic, social, what have you, that is not in accordance with the season.

844
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:56,490
Look where it's quiet.

845
01:07:56,650 --> 01:08:00,210
Don't fall for the distraction was the point.

846
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:03,390
And actually, don't fall for the distractions ever.

847
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:09,650
But during these time periods, especially – see, fall would be noisier than spring.

848
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:18,290
And I notice it is fairly quiet geopolitically, and also I got into the idea that the future of many things can be known.

849
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:28,350
Such functions as cooking and machining and building things, one doesn't start on any of these endeavors unless they know the future of that endeavor.

850
01:08:29,569 --> 01:08:38,950
But there seems to be a tremendous resistance on applying that concept or methodology to the geopolitical scene or the geocultural scene,

851
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:42,689
or the whole world at large where mankind is going.

852
01:08:43,529 --> 01:09:06,050
People seem to prefer this really low-quality dribble and tripe and to negate anything that can be validated from a good – let's just say a good foundation or a good report that's been carried through a long period of time.

853
01:09:08,689 --> 01:09:17,689
And that's why, for example, I stated earlier, Seth, that there seems to be a massive failure in the discernment and interpretation of ancient prophecy.

854
01:09:18,609 --> 01:09:19,890
Massive across the board.

855
01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:24,090
And the misinterpretation, the lack of knowledge in these things is just astounding.

856
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:52,090
But these things, I mentioned as well, just to recap, is that the purpose of these prophecies that you see every culture have in various orders and various degrees of detail is to show you the anomalous events or the anomalies that will be occurring in the normal clockwork that mankind is used to, like seasonal changes, what's in the astronomical bodies, things like that.

857
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:57,390
The purpose of prophecy is to show you the anomaly and also to show you a reference point.

858
01:09:58,130 --> 01:09:58,970
But here's the point.

859
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:05,310
Being in this numbing down period, it doesn't really matter either way.

860
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:10,650
So it's not the dumbing down that mankind is experiencing.

861
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:12,510
That time has long been gone.

862
01:10:13,290 --> 01:10:17,830
It's the numbing down period that they're engaged in right now.

863
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:23,130
It's not being made numb to anything.

864
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:24,970
Anything and everything.

865
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:26,790
Yeah, it seems like it's a numbing.

866
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:36,770
And I brought up the example of no matter how truthful or deceitful the cause is or it's still just viewed as a big deal.

867
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:38,730
Right.

868
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:52,830
So the truth isn't being acknowledged.

869
01:10:53,050 --> 01:11:04,570
And also when you have let's say I brought up the concept of false flag events that seem very drastic and that it be the impetus of political change and new laws and things like that.

870
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:07,890
People just say, oh, that's just a news story.

871
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:08,710
We'll just put it out there.

872
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:22,570
So whether it's an element of truth being put through the venue known as the Internet or any kind of media, even academia, let's say, heaven forbid, I don't think they've put out anything viable in a long time.

873
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:27,790
If something could be beneficial, it's not really considered.

874
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:31,850
And if anything is viewed very negative or detrimental, it's not even considered.

875
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:35,770
It seems like mankind is under some kind of numbing.

876
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:36,030
Right.

877
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:38,010
And I think we've hinted why.

878
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:45,670
And perhaps going into some detail regarding that is seems like Greek speak repeat over and over and over.

879
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:49,870
But, you know, it's a really interesting thing.

880
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:53,190
But the thing we also brought up is the concept of water.

881
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:57,190
Water is very important during the seasonal change of spring and planting.

882
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:58,790
You know, you water things to grow.

883
01:11:58,790 --> 01:12:10,790
And I just brought up the simple point that comprehending that anything being at its highest quality or regarding water, Victor Schauberger called it the anomaly point.

884
01:12:11,890 --> 01:12:19,430
Water is at its highest quality at about 39 degrees Fahrenheit or four degrees Celsius, meaning that above or below that temperature, it expands.

885
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:20,470
The body expands.

886
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:21,910
It's not in its densest form.

887
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:25,170
And the suggestion was made that Greek, why don't you speak about water?

888
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:39,430
And I said, for now, the only thing that people can consider for just once is consider keeping water out of the light and keeping it cool, preferably at four degrees Celsius or 39 degrees Fahrenheit overnight before you consume it.

889
01:12:39,850 --> 01:12:43,850
And watch how the quality of the water itself is increased.

890
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:56,870
And just simply is that the other chemical constituents and other physical constituents of water will get into and how to, quote, unquote, treat water and how simple it is.

891
01:12:56,890 --> 01:13:01,430
You don't need much to do it to achieve a high quality of water.

892
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:09,050
And it's astounding with this tool they call the Internet how little to the point information is provided on this.

893
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:15,830
And the worst thing is when someone starts discussing it strictly as H2O and H3O and H506O.

894
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:22,850
And it's like they missed the point, you know, because if water is really H2O, why does a bucket of water weigh more than a bucket of air?

895
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:23,390
It shouldn't.

896
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:30,070
So and it's just astounding the ridiculousness that mankind is fully engrossed in.

897
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:31,490
But it's not the dumbing down.

898
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:32,510
It's the numbing down.

899
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:34,930
So, yeah.

900
01:13:35,670 --> 01:13:44,850
Here's something that I was speaking about the other day with someone they brought to my attention.

901
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:47,650
We talk we speak a lot.

902
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:53,030
You and I, you know, in particular of scripture, things like that.

903
01:13:53,030 --> 01:14:18,070
And it was brought to my attention that in Eastern scripture, where they talk about the the work of what we would call the Elohim or the gods, that in where they reference that in Eastern literature, it's it's referenced not as as the work of the gods, but as the play of the gods.

904
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:20,010
Yeah, as in the Mahabharata, perhaps.

905
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:21,210
Yes.

906
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:23,690
The Mahabharata, the Rig Vidas.

907
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:49,990
And it's just that's one of the interesting points, because we talk a lot about the similarities, not only of the fact that there is, you know, no one following these these scriptures that they claim to be basing their their belief system or their religious ideas.

908
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:59,950
But no one, regardless of the scripture, be it the, you know, the Vedas or the any of it.

909
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:19,890
But it is still interesting to look at some of the the differences in the way just the beginnings of this experience, if not the beginnings of all things, are viewed differently east to west.

910
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:32,990
And that was something that, you know, in considering it was quite beautiful looking at it as not not the work, because here in the West, you know, we've been we've been made workers.

911
01:15:33,290 --> 01:15:42,750
Right. Was it was it the Rockefeller, the one of the Rothschilds that said, you know, if I wanted, why am I giving so much money to the public school system?

912
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:45,630
Because I want a nation of workers, not a nation of thinkers.

913
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:52,550
It's like we are made, you know, we are programmed to work, to work, work, work.

914
01:15:53,150 --> 01:16:04,010
And even using passages out of the King James as, you know, justification for such things or as a basis for such things.

915
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:23,290
And it's just interesting to think of, as opposed to it being the work of, you know, El Shaddai as seeing it as the as the play of these Elohim, as opposed to the work.

916
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:38,710
Because in specifically in Kohalath or Ecclesiastes, which is one of my favorite pieces of literature anywhere, it speaks about taking pleasure in the work of your hands.

917
01:16:39,410 --> 01:16:44,790
And generally, when you're doing something that is work, if you were taking pleasure in it, it can be viewed as play.

918
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:50,930
So just I don't I don't really have anywhere to go with that, but I thought that I would I would bring it up.

919
01:16:50,930 --> 01:16:59,930
And, you know, yeah, Mark Twain, Samuel Clemens, I think he said, make your vocation or your vacation your vocation and you'll be happy.

920
01:17:00,930 --> 01:17:02,970
But the thing about the work that made your life.

921
01:17:03,090 --> 01:17:06,690
Yeah, well, what is work? It's change and all things change.

922
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:17,850
And once in a private Skype group, I've been frequently recently, I said, everyone is trying to judge what they see based on how it's different from another.

923
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:23,030
Right. And how about I'll just do this exercise in public here.

924
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:27,370
Once let's look at it a different way.

925
01:17:27,430 --> 01:17:30,110
What makes everything the same? Right.

926
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:34,330
What makes everything the same? And using that as a beginning of discernment.

927
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:41,770
And not only will you be able to discern the thing for its quantity, but you'll also be discerning it for its quality at the same time.

928
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:47,530
Yeah. You're ready for that. And and it's it actually works. Let's say we'll consider it four pairs.

929
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:57,670
The first pair is that everything what does everything have from an anthropomorphic point of view that we can interact with everything that we can perceive?

930
01:17:58,410 --> 01:18:01,270
Right. The first pair is everything has a front and a back.

931
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:04,790
The next thing is everything has a left and a right.

932
01:18:05,990 --> 01:18:08,430
The next thing is that everything has a top and a bottom.

933
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:12,590
The next thing is everything has an inside and an outside.

934
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:16,430
So let's just take anything.

935
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:22,670
Let's take something arbitrary not to beat up on these guys, even though they deserve is the legal society.

936
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:27,410
Let's discern the legal society. Let's look at what they're showing us in the front.

937
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:31,790
Let's look at what they're showing in the back. Let's look at what they show on the left.

938
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:34,930
What are they showing on the right? Right.

939
01:18:35,230 --> 01:18:38,410
If anyone's been in a courtroom setting, you'll see it's discerned and set up that way.

940
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:43,330
What's being shown at the top of that society? What's being shown at the bottom?

941
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:49,130
And what's being shown about its inside? What's being shown about its outside?

942
01:18:49,330 --> 01:18:53,170
And the same works for an orange, right? Same works for anything.

943
01:18:54,050 --> 01:18:56,430
And going through these motions, it seems pretty rote.

944
01:18:57,830 --> 01:19:07,150
You will not only get the quantity of the thing, but also a pretty, which what would I say, beginnings of the discernment of its quality.

945
01:19:08,170 --> 01:19:14,090
Even in the political system, how many times have you heard that he or a leftist or he's a rightist, right?

946
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:19,330
And you've got the front and what's going on in the back, right? The corruption.

947
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:23,670
The front is there are leaders in the back that's corrupt, right?

948
01:19:23,730 --> 01:19:26,870
And who's at the top? You got the different positions and entitlements.

949
01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:31,310
And who's at the bottom? How are they being treated? How is the relationship there?

950
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:35,230
And then what's going on in the inside? You know, you've heard political insiders, right?

951
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:39,650
And then what's going on on the outside and look at the contrasts within these four pairs.

952
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:47,130
And you will not only see the quantity of the thing, but begin to go down its qualitative nature as well.

953
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:49,390
Very simple.

954
01:19:50,150 --> 01:19:52,170
The next thing to consider is that all things change.

955
01:19:52,210 --> 01:20:01,450
Even a diamond, most finely polished of anything, gold, these things that seemingly appear empirical, meaning not changing, do change.

956
01:20:01,450 --> 01:20:06,670
They just don't change at a rate that's within one's lifetime or such, and we don't view it as such.

957
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:10,070
You know, it's interesting.

958
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:14,210
I've used on this experiment with many people.

959
01:20:14,450 --> 01:20:22,390
If you've ever grown up in a place as a child near a very large tree, when you visit, if you if you've left that place and visited back after many years,

960
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:24,850
you ever notice that tree doesn't seem so big anymore.

961
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:31,990
Even though you might have doubled in size, the tree seems really small.

962
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:36,330
It's quite an interesting experiment, thought experiment to do.

963
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:38,870
But it hasn't changed that much.

964
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:44,630
But it has changed, of course, you know, trees change, everything changes to a certain degree, it could be measured.

965
01:20:45,490 --> 01:20:48,230
So this rate of change is where the work comes in.

966
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:54,130
And before the work is done, the front, back, left, right, top, bottom, inside and out is considered, isn't it?

967
01:20:55,130 --> 01:20:58,430
Before work is done, before change takes place.

968
01:20:59,470 --> 01:21:07,430
So this is an interesting point of view, because if you look at what was just said about the four pairs and all things change,

969
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,870
that is how the formative energies appear to be working.

970
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:20,530
The formative before things are created, it seems like the front, back, left, right, top, bottom, inside out is considered,

971
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:22,270
because everything seems to have that.

972
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:25,310
And also it seems that everything seems to change.

973
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:28,170
Right? So these are formative things.

974
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,510
Could it be this is a discussion reserved for the gods?

975
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:32,710
Maybe this is what they're discussing.

976
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:41,730
And according to what's been memorialized through history, we are to join them at some time in our future, let's say.

977
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:43,450
Why do I say our future?

978
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:48,390
Could it be that when man writes history and records it, he's writing about past events.

979
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:52,870
And when the gods write history and record it, they're talking about future events?

980
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:57,390
From our perspective, certainly.

981
01:21:57,850 --> 01:22:00,390
Yes. It's like an inverted world.

982
01:22:01,810 --> 01:22:02,670
Here's another idea.

983
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:04,670
This is formative things now.

984
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:08,670
In man's kingdom, he always refers to things in a vertical sense.

985
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:12,190
You've got the king at the top and the street sweeper at the bottom.

986
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:15,510
You've got the top of the pyramid concept, right?

987
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:16,390
Right.

988
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:21,150
You've got the high and the low in a vertical fashion.

989
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:25,470
What's interesting when one looks at the ancient texts that's been memorialized.

990
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:27,350
And by the way, when I say ancient, people hate that.

991
01:22:27,570 --> 01:22:29,590
They don't want to hear about this kind of stuff.

992
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:32,930
And I'm not speaking for them, but I've gotten a lot of feedback about that.

993
01:22:33,330 --> 01:22:38,870
But when you look at what's been memorialized about the quote unquote gods or the Elohim or the plurality of them,

994
01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:41,690
is that they function laterally.

995
01:22:43,090 --> 01:22:44,450
They function laterally.

996
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:45,970
It's like, you know, the inner circle.

997
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:48,310
Right. Left and right.

998
01:22:48,370 --> 01:22:50,070
You sit on the left hand or the right hand.

999
01:22:50,650 --> 01:22:51,910
Right. You go in and out.

1000
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:54,790
For example, just to use the biblical text.

1001
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:59,830
When Solomon was asked, you know, he could have asked for anything, but he asked for wisdom.

1002
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:05,830
And the reason was so he can know how to go in and out, up and down.

1003
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:09,530
So it's very interesting.

1004
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:12,850
Kingdom of the gods or their realm is not vertical.

1005
01:23:12,890 --> 01:23:13,550
It's lateral.

1006
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:19,250
But right now, because they're interacting with us and we're interacting with the way we want to see them,

1007
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:21,670
we see it as a vertical aspect.

1008
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:24,460
It's quite interesting.

1009
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:29,380
So, yeah, I don't believe we just said this in public, but we might as well.

1010
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:30,300
Right. Right.

1011
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:31,260
Yeah.

1012
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:37,300
These are the formative aspects and mankind is.

1013
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:44,740
And also the point I kept bringing in earlier, Seth, was how can people rationalize clearly when they have a hot head and cold feet?

1014
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:49,620
I don't see anyone still making demands to their entitled engineering classes

1015
01:23:49,620 --> 01:24:00,060
or even inquiring for them to design and procure devices that create a descending heat and an ascending cold as it is in nature.

1016
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,660
So if they're not asking or inquiring about how do we make our living spaces,

1017
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:10,980
whether it's a car, boat, home plane, where the heat is densified and goes down

1018
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:14,000
and a cold that's verified and rises like it does in nature.

1019
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:17,540
How do we have cool heads and warm feet?

1020
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,420
And no one is inquiring yet.

1021
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:20,800
It's astonishing.

1022
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:25,360
I mean, recently I went into what they call the Yellow Pages

1023
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,820
and called all the heating and cooling engineers and physicists.

1024
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:33,680
Are you guys getting calls yet about designing and procuring devices that create an ascending cold and a descending heat?

1025
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:34,860
And they're like, never heard of it.

1026
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:36,860
Like, oh, boy.

1027
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:40,040
So no one is noticing the obvious yet.

1028
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:44,120
But anyway, I just thought I'd throw that in there.

1029
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,800
They're being distracted.

1030
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:52,480
How can you be so distracted to not realize that you need a cool head and warm feet anyway?

1031
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:55,300
Yeah, and there's no inquiry being made.

1032
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:58,120
And something so basic and so carnal and materialistic,

1033
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:02,700
and you have people trying to want to discuss spiritual matters in the realm of the gods

1034
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:06,700
and they're not even inquiring about having a cool head and warm feet.

1035
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:08,660
It's shocking and astounding.

1036
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:13,620
What kind of progress do you think are they going to make in any spiritual matter that's purely spiritual, meaning of the mind?

1037
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:14,840
Pretty much zero.

1038
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:15,860
And that's what you see.

1039
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:21,980
And there's a lot of discussion, by the way, about the new world order bringing in some new world religion, right?

1040
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:26,620
One can say that to a certain degree.

1041
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:30,100
But right now, what you consider, let's say, from loosely termed religions,

1042
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
there's nothing there.

1043
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:34,880
If you look at any of the world religions right now,

1044
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:36,900
they're based on nothing.

1045
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:40,960
They're based on the revival of ancient cultural traditions.

1046
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:43,060
Absolutely no instruction.

1047
01:25:43,700 --> 01:25:47,760
Some of them have some laws, like dietary laws and things, very loosely adopted.

1048
01:25:49,820 --> 01:25:54,840
The interesting thing is there's still a lot of commentary about the destruction of Christianity.

1049
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:56,160
There's nothing there to destroy.

1050
01:25:56,740 --> 01:26:00,420
If anyone professes to be of that faith, needs to inquire what it's based on,

1051
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:01,480
we'll find nothing there.

1052
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:03,980
It's just shocking.

1053
01:26:05,100 --> 01:26:06,420
It just shocks the mind.

1054
01:26:06,900 --> 01:26:09,060
You know, to realize this simple fact.

1055
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:11,420
The emperor has no clothes.

1056
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:14,460
So people are still up to do about nothing.

1057
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:19,140
They're frustrated and very upset about nothing.

1058
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:20,820
There's nothing there.

1059
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:28,180
And the commentary that you hear regarding, let's say, the biblical text or anything regarding that is erroneous still.

1060
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:29,680
Completely across the board.

1061
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:34,820
There might be little spatterings of truth here and there, but who's discerning it?

1062
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:35,900
Apparently no one.

1063
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:42,880
So there's a very interesting time that humanity is going to be heading into here in the next decade.

1064
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,580
Actually starting in the next year or two.

1065
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:45,900
I'd say two plus.

1066
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:50,020
That's going to lead to the next phase of humanity.

1067
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:54,160
So again, very uncommon, isn't it?

1068
01:26:54,640 --> 01:26:55,700
To discuss these things.

1069
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:57,080
Yeah.

1070
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:05,500
But nonetheless, I'd say it's about the middle of this transitional season known as spring here and fall in other parts of the world.

1071
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,760
And the things to be considered.

1072
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:15,660
If people consider the seasonality and how humanity is locked into the agricultural cycle, not necessarily for growing plants,

1073
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:26,180
but every aspect of every institution and every aspect of their, let's say, existence is also locked in more directly than they think into the seasonal changes.

1074
01:27:26,980 --> 01:27:31,180
And I guess that was the theme of coming together here today.

1075
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:41,580
Because the uniqueness of what they call spring or fall is the ability for the whole world to be almost homogenous for a certain period of time.

1076
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:44,620
It's, you know, you're transitioning from hot to cold or cold to hot.

1077
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:47,320
And this is mid ground that's happening now.

1078
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:54,180
And it's typically the planting or typically the harvesting, depending on which end of it you're experiencing, which are contrasting.

1079
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:58,140
But from the temporary point of view, they're very similar.

1080
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:07,220
And the discussion here for those folks going through the spring, it was to simply apply.

1081
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:16,200
What do you know about the spring season, whether it's purely materialistic, agricultural or even metaphorically where it's a time of planting?

1082
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,700
What what happens during times of planting?

1083
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:23,640
What's required? What what impedes it and what promotes it?

1084
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:30,720
And this type of thinking leads to the type of efficiency that one can incorporate in their lives.

1085
01:28:30,860 --> 01:28:34,780
So they're not wasting their energy or their thought energy or their motions.

1086
01:28:35,100 --> 01:28:41,380
Right now, you're going to come across, for example, political aspects.

1087
01:28:41,380 --> 01:28:44,300
Right. There's an election time period in the States.

1088
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:51,580
And you're going to come across people ranting about debt economy, debt based economy or viruses or, you know.

1089
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:54,480
And I suggest to completely ignore them.

1090
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:59,440
And even if it's ninety nine percent of the media, alternative or mainstream.

1091
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,200
Right. Why?

1092
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:12,280
Because, first of all, they're crying and screaming about things that don't exist or secondary or tertiary, you know, and have become victim to the prank.

1093
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:25,540
And very often in private, I do speak about people, let's say, coming together on certain subject matters, whether it be medical, scientific or judicial or legal society or political or even religious.

1094
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:33,400
And they're trying to find their ways around these systems or how they can benefit or avoid the pitfalls of those systems.

1095
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:38,980
And I'm like, the first thing you have to acknowledge that any of those societies or systems are not what they're saying they are.

1096
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:41,260
They are pranksters. They're pranking you.

1097
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:43,280
They're a victim of a prank.

1098
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:50,720
And one of the maxims there is perhaps that avoidance of a trap is knowledge of its existence.

1099
01:29:51,400 --> 01:30:03,880
So if you know the legal, medical and political and scientific society are there to prank everyone, they are not providing anything of what they each prospective field is supposed to do.

1100
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,680
They're simply pranksters.

1101
01:30:08,380 --> 01:30:13,080
You find that you have pretty much become a victim of a prank.

1102
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:18,320
And when you consider it that way, the thing becomes very, very clear.

1103
01:30:18,380 --> 01:30:28,040
Because, for example, if you address a scientist about anything scientific being erroneous or self-contradicting, they don't want to address what you're saying.

1104
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:30,760
They say, where did you get your degree and are you a scientist?

1105
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:34,400
And if you do not fit that and can't listen to you.

1106
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:38,260
The same thing with the legal society or the medical society.

1107
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:40,560
You know, it's a legal society.

1108
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:43,160
Well, you know, you guys have not followed this procedure or this law.

1109
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:45,040
The laws don't matter. You do what we say.

1110
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:46,640
Be a good citizen.

1111
01:30:47,820 --> 01:30:49,040
The same with the doctors.

1112
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:51,800
Doctors will say, well, are you a doctor?

1113
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:52,800
Well, then how do you know?

1114
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:55,940
And I have to do my job.

1115
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:57,840
I am limited. I can only say this.

1116
01:30:58,480 --> 01:30:59,860
Well, so you're pranking.

1117
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:06,260
It was society of pranksters on the rest of the society.

1118
01:31:06,720 --> 01:31:09,480
It's very interesting in that respect as well.

1119
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:14,620
And the pranking is going on across the board as well.

1120
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:16,920
It's not just a single aspect of society.

1121
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:22,020
It's the religious, especially every religion or pranksters as well.

1122
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:25,130
And the believers now are becoming pranksters.

1123
01:31:26,530 --> 01:31:28,010
It's fascinating to watch.

1124
01:31:28,370 --> 01:31:29,210
Self-consuming.

1125
01:31:29,810 --> 01:31:39,230
The difference between disinformation and misinformation.

1126
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:41,250
I think we went into that a little bit.

1127
01:31:41,730 --> 01:31:46,310
Yeah, the disinformers deliberately put it out to re-steer, re-guide.

1128
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:49,850
And the misinformers are the ones receiving it and believing it.

1129
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:50,950
And repeating it.

1130
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:54,590
Yeah, and repeating it and not knowing that it was structured to be deceit.

1131
01:31:55,130 --> 01:31:55,410
Yeah.

1132
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:02,710
And right now the disinformants have become the misinformants also.

1133
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:05,090
They're actually believing their own sauce.

1134
01:32:05,970 --> 01:32:07,830
They drank the Kool-Aid themselves.

1135
01:32:08,010 --> 01:32:13,490
I believe that was coined from back in the day when they were,

1136
01:32:13,650 --> 01:32:15,350
I guess they spiked the bowl for something.

1137
01:32:19,750 --> 01:32:20,990
Yeah, this is humanity.

1138
01:32:21,630 --> 01:32:23,570
Folks, you're not being dumbed down.

1139
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:24,770
That's long done.

1140
01:32:25,470 --> 01:32:26,390
You're being numbed down.

1141
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:30,590
I'm going to try to, in Greek speak, colloquial Greek speak, let's say,

1142
01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:33,050
bring up something called cosmic censorship.

1143
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:36,590
Meaning where the gods have actually censored mankind.

1144
01:32:36,770 --> 01:32:38,870
That started 2500 years ago.

1145
01:32:38,990 --> 01:32:43,490
Around the 500 BC, 600 BC is when that started.

1146
01:32:43,690 --> 01:32:46,870
That's when all the rise of most of your modern religions and sciences

1147
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:49,590
and philosophies have succeeded from.

1148
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:55,370
And you've been kind of pranked by the gods as well.

1149
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:57,110
Sorry, guys, I hate to admit it.

1150
01:33:01,390 --> 01:33:17,290
There probably was a cosmic bet to prank mankind into becoming atheistic, meaning that if you lose complete information about a thing, you no longer know nothing about a thing, it's the same as that thing doesn't exist.

1151
01:33:18,650 --> 01:33:28,810
Currently, most of mankind, if not wholesale, it's safe to say all of mankind has lost any concept of the gods to the point where they might as well say they don't exist.

1152
01:33:29,330 --> 01:33:40,710
Again, you approach most people that are in any of the mainstream or alternative religions or even scholars, they cannot tell you anything about the gods that is founded anywhere.

1153
01:33:42,190 --> 01:33:44,530
So it might as well be atheist.

1154
01:33:44,530 --> 01:34:01,270
To me it means, I believe in this, and the whole concept of falling for the adversary is more than a concept, it's a realization.

1155
01:34:02,110 --> 01:34:06,050
The adversary is just going to be adversarial, it's going to be the opposite.

1156
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:15,610
So actually what's interesting is the more spiritual someone says they are, the more they're actually pranking, because there's nothing there.

1157
01:34:15,690 --> 01:34:16,930
It's the emperor has no clothes.

1158
01:34:17,010 --> 01:34:31,190
It takes a child to say the emperor is naked, because the adults have been so programmed into believing that he can afford invisible thread, invisible clothing, that they cannot justify or rationalize in their mind that he's being pranked himself.

1159
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:38,250
And it took the child's point of view to add clarity to that.

1160
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:42,160
Absolutely.

1161
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:50,780
So the uncommon thing which can be discussed for this sonic project known as uncommon sense is what is obvious.

1162
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:52,160
That's very uncommon.

1163
01:34:52,540 --> 01:34:54,040
And it hasn't been discussed.

1164
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:59,720
The obvious things haven't been discussed yet at all, at least for 2500 years, let's put it that way.

1165
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:05,280
And if anyone wants to start doing any research on that time period, let's say it was an axial period of sorts.

1166
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:24,820
If you've ever heard of, oh, the destruction of a lot of the ancient temples, the destruction of the Library of Alexandria, major shifts in power, switching over to the Greek system of mathematic philosophy and thinking.

1167
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:27,320
This was part of the cosmic censorship.

1168
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:35,820
And sometimes I have people pressing me, no matter how many ways they try to explain what cosmic censorship is to explain it.

1169
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:39,440
I'm like, dude, if you ask me one more time, you're censored yourself.

1170
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:45,200
You know, there's a level of cosmic censorship that plays itself.

1171
01:35:45,720 --> 01:35:49,700
But the interesting part about it, it's not very difficult to see through.

1172
01:35:49,820 --> 01:35:50,940
That's the whole thing.

1173
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,320
It's a very thin veil.

1174
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:59,080
But it's very universal across the globe about negating what's obvious.

1175
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:07,020
And then I've led the other concept that I've brought up many times is something called the dummy load.

1176
01:36:07,700 --> 01:36:08,660
What is a dummy load?

1177
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:16,740
It's something that when you develop a circuit or a device and you want to test it, instead of putting the real world load on it, you put a dummy load on it to test it.

1178
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:19,580
If someone, for example, a treadmill is a dummy load.

1179
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:23,440
If someone says, I just ran five kilometers on the treadmill.

1180
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:28,120
Well, you ran five kilometers, but you didn't go anywhere.

1181
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:30,580
A treadmill is a dummy load.

1182
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:33,120
Or a hamster wheel is another form of a dummy load.

1183
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:47,800
So what's being put out there right now about negating the obvious or taking something that is obvious, like the need for food, clothing, shelter, the desire to use money in commerce, the desire to have a spiritual belief?

1184
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:51,900
All of these things are hamster wheels that are being put out right now across the board.

1185
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:53,280
It's safe to say that, folks.

1186
01:36:54,100 --> 01:37:03,280
And the only way to defeat that, not that it needs to be defeated, but defeat as a function, let's say as a defeat function or a default function, is to start noticing the obvious.

1187
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:12,320
But the problem with that is that there's so much numbing down and there's so much laziness that people don't want to inquire anymore.

1188
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:18,780
Right. So one purpose of doing the uncommon sense is saying, hey, look, it's just right in front of you.

1189
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:22,460
Look. Right. The favorite one regarding the body.

1190
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:25,700
Someone asked to talk a little bit about supplements and things.

1191
01:37:25,780 --> 01:37:29,000
And you always got to go back to the basics of the body.

1192
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:32,460
Are you in accord with the seasons or cross latitude?

1193
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:44,360
Right. And are and are you have you been subjected to some anomalous fear that is contrary to reality, like little bacteria in cold climates causing disease?

1194
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:52,240
Where that would render all refrigeration useless because the reason we use refrigeration is to put them in a dormant state.

1195
01:37:53,340 --> 01:38:02,120
So when you these things need to be addressed commonly and they're not, it's still being put out there.

1196
01:38:02,420 --> 01:38:05,360
It's getting cold. So it's flu season. What?

1197
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:09,580
What causes that? The flu shots.

1198
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:15,560
Yeah. Right. Well, you know, the other thing, you know, there's never been any study on vaccines on their efficacy.

1199
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:23,440
You know, like, you know, a good what they call science, which is, you know, hypothesis, experimentation, conclusiveness and all that.

1200
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:31,380
It's a religion. Yeah. When people start to find that out and it's going to be kind of interesting, hopefully they'll take it lying down.

1201
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:37,580
It's it's it's a religion and a faith, both both any side of that argument.

1202
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:47,600
Actually, I've witnessed firsthand, you know, how they say you can't bring up religion or politics without upsetting people, making someone angry.

1203
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:50,600
Well, that's something I've gotten to witness recently.

1204
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:57,900
But what's interesting. Yeah. The interesting part about that is you notice there's less of it.

1205
01:38:58,860 --> 01:39:04,440
People are less likely to be upset when you bring up a divergent claim.

1206
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:12,880
Meaning like, you know, years ago, let's say 40, 50 years ago, if you were considered to be not nationalistic, people got upset with you.

1207
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:17,440
You were considered a traitor, not patriotic. Now it seems to be it's OK.

1208
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:23,940
You could voice that. Right. Many things now are being accepted because the numbing down is increasing.

1209
01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:34,120
It's quite gotten to the point, which is actually the heyday for the love and light people and the new agers, the consciousness intent people.

1210
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:39,360
Have you heard of them? Yeah. Knowledge doesn't matter. It's your intent, you know, or law of attraction.

1211
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:46,200
Yeah. Law of attraction. Yeah. Those people that this is their heyday, by the way, the jellyfish, you know, time.

1212
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:58,600
So, yeah. So, yeah, it's quite interesting. It doesn't mean that it has to disable those that are curious about living a life of efficiency and having some knowledge.

1213
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:06,880
And by the way, people still hate being knowledgeable or those that tend to pursue things like that because it goes contrary to what's been.

1214
01:40:07,660 --> 01:40:15,540
Let's say common or concordant, concordant, meaning if everyone agrees on something, that's what it is, even though it's contrary to the truth.

1215
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:25,900
So, yeah, it's quite interesting. But again, just to harken back to being springtime in this part of the world, what do you folks know about planting?

1216
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:34,980
What do you folks know about watering things after they're planted, meaning feeding them, even though you don't see anything being substantiated or emerging at the moment?

1217
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:38,380
What do you folks know about the conditions during planting?

1218
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:42,460
You know, it tends to be pretty quiet when the planting is done and things are starting to take effect.

1219
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:51,720
What do you know about the seasonal change? You're going from a cold to a warm or from a warm to a cold in another part of the world.

1220
01:40:52,580 --> 01:40:57,920
You know, what's what's required there, you know, for what we call the container or the body, you know.

1221
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:00,760
But just to bring up the point, it's still kind of in the back of the mind.

1222
01:41:00,760 --> 01:41:04,480
But you know, when someone asked me, what about supplements? Well, what about them?

1223
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:09,440
How can anything be a supplement? Others? I don't like that point.

1224
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:14,360
And then that would probably be referring to what we call vitamins, let's say.

1225
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:19,500
If anyone is concerned about that, you should go study a little bit of Rudolf Hoshka.

1226
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:28,660
I believe it's H-A-U-S-C-H-K-A, a man of German extraction or Austrian extraction back

1227
01:41:28,660 --> 01:41:33,420
at the turn of the century who did research on what gave food its vitality and played

1228
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:35,020
with extracts and things like that.

1229
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:40,240
And I assure you that if he was alive today and pursued and overlooked and examined what

1230
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:43,780
people are pawning as vitamins and supplements, he would light himself on fire naked and

1231
01:41:43,780 --> 01:41:44,700
run down the street.

1232
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:48,260
It's totally contrary to what his work had been about.

1233
01:41:48,260 --> 01:41:52,980
And he might be considered, or I would say consider him one of the granddaddies of that

1234
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:53,440
field.

1235
01:41:54,660 --> 01:41:54,880
But...

1236
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:57,060
I'm unfamiliar with his work.

1237
01:41:57,240 --> 01:41:57,980
Can you...

1238
01:41:57,980 --> 01:41:58,540
Rudolf?

1239
01:41:58,920 --> 01:41:59,220
Yeah.

1240
01:41:59,300 --> 01:41:59,680
Hoschka.

1241
01:42:01,060 --> 01:42:06,920
His name bears a brand of very high-end, high-quality women's makeup even today.

1242
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:12,500
I believe it's H-A-U-S-C-H-K-A, perhaps.

1243
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:18,200
But the wonderment of search engines these days, no matter how bad you screw up the search,

1244
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:21,080
you're going to get some form of refinement that will lead you to it.

1245
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:23,480
Interesting character.

1246
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:27,300
Now, the interesting thing, I don't view these things as vitamins or extracts or supplements.

1247
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,160
I view them as pairs or pairing.

1248
01:42:30,420 --> 01:42:33,480
If the next time someone tells you to take a supplement or anything, just look at it

1249
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,440
as something you would consider as food.

1250
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:38,560
And does it look like that to you?

1251
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,060
That's a wonderful question, it would be.

1252
01:42:41,060 --> 01:42:41,800
When I...

1253
01:42:42,540 --> 01:42:47,940
It's happened actually relatively rarely in the last few years, but when I start noticing

1254
01:42:47,940 --> 01:42:55,960
my body reacting to the environment negatively, if I start...

1255
01:42:55,960 --> 01:43:05,420
If my throat starts itching, something like that, I generally begin looking to, okay,

1256
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:06,780
what am I not...

1257
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:09,000
What nutrient am I missing here?

1258
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:10,220
What am I not eating?

1259
01:43:10,900 --> 01:43:14,260
Not what vitamin, but what...

1260
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:22,540
Harkening back to the Hippocrates, food is your medicine, medicine is your food.

1261
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:28,600
By the way, people say that's biblical and you will not find that in the biblical text.

1262
01:43:28,820 --> 01:43:29,820
Just throw that in there.

1263
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:32,220
Yeah, no, no, it's...

1264
01:43:32,220 --> 01:43:34,420
It's a Greek philosophical point of view, yeah.

1265
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:34,660
Yeah.

1266
01:43:36,360 --> 01:43:42,460
But that whole concept there, again, is if you look back at what's called supplement

1267
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:46,960
and vitamins, it was originally the study of what gave these substances their vitality.

1268
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:52,960
And just in short, what Hoschka discovered is that the vitality of these extracts was

1269
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:54,060
very limited in time.

1270
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:59,100
They only had an efficacy for a short period of time before they lost their efficacy.

1271
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:05,200
And also he noticed that direct contact or mixing from the organism, from the, let's say,

1272
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:10,320
the extract or the vitamin to the organism was not necessary, just proximity was enough.

1273
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:13,200
And, of course, you're not going to be...

1274
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:17,720
This is not going to be propagated to a materialistic mindset that is taught that the body

1275
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:20,900
actually absorbs things like a filter bag, right?

1276
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,320
I recently had a discussion.

1277
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:26,760
Someone said, well, Greek, if the body doesn't absorb food, then what...

1278
01:44:26,760 --> 01:44:28,000
Does it matter what you eat then?

1279
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,660
And I'm like, oh, boy.

1280
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:34,640
This is where a little bit of information is good and more information can be detrimental

1281
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:39,140
because the individual lacks the discernment of what's being said, you see.

1282
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:42,120
So this is very interesting.

1283
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:46,680
That's why very often I'd have a private discussion with someone and say, Greek, man,

1284
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:49,560
I had to listen to you for three months before I was figuring out what you were saying.

1285
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:50,300
Now I love it.

1286
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:54,260
And I'm like, wow, is that because what I'm saying is not simple?

1287
01:44:54,260 --> 01:45:01,120
Or is it in such a stark contrast to what you formally took in as communication?

1288
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:03,400
It was the latter, obviously.

1289
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:07,200
I don't think one should speak to you on a level that any...

1290
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:09,040
beyond any level that a child cannot comprehend.

1291
01:45:09,700 --> 01:45:11,920
Because, by the way, children are just small people.

1292
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:21,160
And I find, anyone should find, recommending this, the subculture of kids to be disgusting,

1293
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:28,080
creating an entire subculture with their own forms of entertainment and toys and shows

1294
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:30,020
and things like that.

1295
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:34,440
If you actually look at that, even though children are told they should be enjoying that,

1296
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:40,240
it has created a subculture that does not demark when they should stop using that

1297
01:45:40,240 --> 01:45:42,420
and create serious spiritual damage.

1298
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:49,040
They're just small people that lack instruction and maturity in many ways.

1299
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:52,960
If you create a subculture called the kids stuff, right?

1300
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:56,660
Kids toys, kids meals, kids this, kids that, which are baby goats.

1301
01:45:57,300 --> 01:46:00,960
You've actually created this subculture and it's really distorted.

1302
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:05,400
And if you don't think humanity has been distorted since the emergence of that culture,

1303
01:46:06,320 --> 01:46:07,600
you're not paying attention.

1304
01:46:08,160 --> 01:46:12,280
And that is a criticism, direct and harsh, as it is aptly deserved.

1305
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:14,700
The happy meal.

1306
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:15,980
Yes.

1307
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:23,880
And you look at the children and the small people and they've been thrust into this adversarial,

1308
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:26,860
almost ridiculous, I mean, Teletubbies, right?

1309
01:46:26,860 --> 01:46:29,020
Just look across the board, Disney, right?

1310
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:35,540
And the irony of it, look at the pornography and the lasciviousness that Disney has thrown in in the past, right?

1311
01:46:36,340 --> 01:46:39,580
Into their stuff subliminally and directly, not so subliminal.

1312
01:46:40,340 --> 01:46:42,540
I mean, we're talking about a level of depravity.

1313
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:49,720
What's interesting is, you know, if human, if mankind is dependent on,

1314
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:52,580
mankind's future is dependent on the young, the children.

1315
01:46:53,160 --> 01:46:58,660
He has no future because the children have all been turned into baby goats, kids.

1316
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:08,140
So, I mean, it's just, yeah, it's beyond comprehension to examine the level of it.

1317
01:47:08,140 --> 01:47:14,140
When does a child now become, go from a child to a kid to an adult?

1318
01:47:15,740 --> 01:47:16,200
All right.

1319
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:17,700
So, boys and girls, thank you again.

1320
01:47:19,140 --> 01:47:22,040
And say afar and uncommon sense.

1321
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:23,740
We'll see you again soon.
