00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,730
Greetings and welcome once again to Uncommon Sense with The Greek and Seth

2
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,570
Michael. You're on American Freedom Radio and it also is being streamed on

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:16,410
Ustream which you can access by going to uncommonradio.com and you will find

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,790
your instructions on pretty much how to do that. And welcome everyone again and

5
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,230
hello Seth. Greetings, salutations, how are you doing?

6
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:33,430
We're doing well, yeah, yeah. Again, so we're here again pretty much again like we

7
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,130
said you could find us on Ustream and we are on American Freedom Radio which

8
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:44,570
is a internet-based format and it requires your input not only just the

9
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,170
output that you're getting from listening to it through however you're

10
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,310
listening but the folks here or there at American Freedom Radio would appreciate

11
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:56,250
anything you could send their way and I've said with that but just to pretty

12
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,910
much interject one other thing Seth is on the on the feedback that we've been

13
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,410
getting let's say through emails and other messaging platforms we want to

14
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:12,430
just thank everyone for not only the extremely let's say positive response

15
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,730
but also the encouragement and also the inquiry about where to donate. Several

16
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:20,950
people have come forward and say hey I want to donate to you guys we appreciate

17
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:26,750
that very very much. There is no platform for that to do it to us directly other

18
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,030
than to perhaps support the platform known as American Freedom Radio and you

19
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:36,570
can donate to them by finding that out by searching their home page. I don't

20
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,110
know how prominent the donate button is but you will find something on there I'm

21
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:45,470
sure. So with that said I just wanted to bring that forward because it's kind of

22
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:50,270
like a little bit of something that has been brought up to us about donation so

23
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:57,930
there you have it. So absolutely in the near future we'll set up a way to take

24
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,810
donations for us directly as well but absolutely support American Freedom

25
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:10,350
Radio they're making it possible for our audience to get it on that platform so

26
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:16,730
yeah absolutely as well as you know Ustream we're using the free service

27
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:23,190
there as well but if we can get some sort of small regular income we can do

28
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:29,030
the professional Ustream side as well and that will be a lot no ads you know

29
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,690
things like that so that'll be pleasant but yeah that's all in the future so

30
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,930
yeah and it should be done democratically let's say by the by the

31
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,610
people if they want it they'll come up with it but you know you can't really

32
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:46,830
stop the signal we say perhaps and if we want to call this sonic experience a

33
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,430
signal it will go on you know there's always been talk about the internet

34
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,810
going down it's not going to go down folks because it's been at this level of

35
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,970
achievement or accomplishment to accommodate the population it will not

36
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:06,410
be taken away but we decided to do a Ustream when AFR was down for a short

37
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,950
time and also to cover that I think it would be interesting get some ham radio

38
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,870
people with some repeaters and perhaps even provide a in print form transcript

39
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,650
slash newsletter just to cover all the bases but I don't think it's necessary

40
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,810
because the internet is here to stay albeit all the ridiculousness that is on

41
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:32,210
it it is designed and structured to accommodate the population on the planet

42
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:38,390
meaning in a common way right okay it's sort of having a discussion with

43
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:43,010
someone recently set about you know the show it was I don't know I don't know if

44
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,290
I really even like calling this a show because I usually implies strictly

45
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,130
entertainment but one of the first things that came up in conversation

46
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,290
Seth was with this individual was that you know the word common it doesn't it

47
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:01,870
it doesn't mean anything good like yeah I know that's why we kind of like want

48
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:07,030
to talk about things that are uncommon and I think we kind of brought up maybe

49
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,150
clarifying a little bit of cliches at every show I don't have one to clarify

50
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,810
this week let's say but the last cliche I believe what might have been

51
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,490
clarified was a biblical one which says it's not what goes into someone's mouth

52
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:23,970
that defiled but what comes out of their mouth that defiles them and the actual

53
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:31,510
term there's the term being common not defiled so it's yeah being common is not

54
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:37,910
good so you know with that said yeah any other thoughts before we get into

55
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,270
something that we don't know what we're really going to get into other than

56
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:52,960
perhaps more thoughts about these things Seth any anything random perhaps okay

57
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,000
Seth all right he's just remains wants to be maybe quiet for the moment but

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,640
let's let's maybe get into it now what we're gonna get into this week we don't

59
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,560
really know but the same concepts keep coming up very often by looking and

60
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,780
hearing and seeing what's going on in the world and what's really interesting

61
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,840
if you want to pretty much look at something that it's not really discussed

62
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,300
much is something called mental health I'm kind of defining it as the aspect of

63
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:25,620
what is mental what is you know the mind and if you've listened to any kind of

64
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,160
Greek speak or with Seth and myself speaking we've always tried to bring

65
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,840
back definitions of things and bringing bringing a center or reference that is

66
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:40,320
accessible by anyone and the the mental state or the mind is essentially the

67
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,720
spirit so when you hear about things being mental or of the mind they are of

68
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,780
spiritual in nature intangible in a physical sense so from that point of view

69
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,100
in passing you know even though just mentioned don't have much on the agenda

70
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,780
let's say to speak about there's something about mental health it's been

71
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:08,340
coming up recently in conversation and even even from the perspective of what

72
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:14,280
is spiritual all the way down to little little things that people take to as

73
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,560
helpers you know like little pills and things like that you know and the in the

74
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,080
materialistic side and one thing that could be considered is what is mental

75
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,240
health you know what is the is it possible to restore it you know what

76
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,700
what's going on with the the aspect of the spirit or the mind and it's it's

77
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:40,320
very easy to see how it's being guided if you tend to pull back and be a little

78
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,460
more objective and see what's going on with your own faculties give you an

79
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,500
example not to harp on the alternative media but you know it's very interesting

80
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,000
I've kind of retracted from looking at the internet personally too much because

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,920
it's just seems to not being let's say put into effect and it's best and

82
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,320
highest use other than a telephone book or a telephone or pretty much looking at

83
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,840
weather or basic things like that even the weather is another subject one day

84
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,940
we'll get into but what's interesting what I noticed about the alternative

85
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,140
media very much is that they should thank the heavens that the mainstream

86
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,400
exists because every time I sort of tune in even albeit five minutes a week here

87
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,460
or there is the first thing you hear is a parroting of what was going on in the

88
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:31,140
mainstream media so essentially there there is not much going on other it

89
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:37,480
seems to be a massive movement of thought control and there is no real

90
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,100
alternative to it again just by bringing up the example of listening to how many

91
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:50,280
hosts have quote-unquote shows open their show or fill their show with what

92
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,830
the mainstream has done that day so that shows me that there is a a

93
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,500
complete tie-in there is still a almost a homogeneous movement on the planet or

94
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,220
homogeneous movement in consciousness that is guiding people and when you go

95
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:09,900
away from what is this mainstream thinking or let's say news parody that's

96
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:14,240
going on there is also the fringe aspect and if you look at a lot of the fringe

97
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,840
aspect of information being put out in the alternative again and that would

98
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,900
also mean a bookstore for example there's like these new-age bookstores

99
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,900
you know things like that that are called if you look at what they're

100
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,020
putting out as well I mean it sounds good it makes you feel good because it's

101
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,320
something different but if you actually look into what they're saying you'll

102
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,940
find this pretty much unfounded and it's not based on anything again one

103
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,980
thing we like to bring up is the baselessness of what humanity has been

104
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,580
pretty much been involved in and endorsing what I mean endorsing meaning

105
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,660
they are putting behind their full faith and credit and their word and

106
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,560
their actions behind things that are totally baseless whether it's the

107
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,480
financial system the monitor you know meaning the monetary system their

108
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:07,220
religions their sciences even their news again you know again that's a harp on the

109
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,680
alternative media but tune in to any alternative or majority of alternative

110
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,000
stuff you're either going to get this new-age baseless mindlessness that was

111
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,080
pretty much formed by some new-age movement a hundred years ago or you're

112
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,100
going to hear a parody or a parody of what the mainstream had put out that day

113
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:33,040
or the day before this endless cycle it's a self-consuming self-consuming how

114
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,240
would you say self-consuming circle where it's just if you know getting the

115
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:46,920
drabbiness of it is not that difficult to see so Seth are you back with us yes

116
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,720
yes I have been for a little while and I didn't want to interrupt yeah so this is

117
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,340
like I kind of spun off a little bit talking about like the state of affairs

118
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,120
when we because I brought up the idea of what is mental health this this kind of

119
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,220
came up in conversation during the week and again we've defined you know the mind

120
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,320
is being the spirit and they're not it's basically the same thing in a

121
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:13,700
different form of expression you almost don't need the word mental anymore you

122
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,640
could just if everyone just used the word spirit instead of the word mental

123
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,320
or mind it would actually simplify and allow economy of movement in

124
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:30,900
communication you know so that would be so mental is really a synonym of spirit

125
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,760
or spirituality you know which is it it just means communication it means a

126
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,460
state of being that is intangible it's of the mind of the spirit let's say and

127
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:49,860
this concept of mental health of being in a healthful form when you kind of

128
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,620
bring up the topic it's like what is it you know is it you know is it is it from

129
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,400
the ultra materialistic pseudoscientific point of view where it's chemical you

130
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,840
know where they tell you about all these synapses in the brain and chemical

131
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:10,060
imbalances and whatever or is it as defined the spirit of spirituality some

132
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:17,060
new-age rubbish or something that comes out of some religion you know is should

133
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:24,020
it be that because you look at that also it's it's rubbish rubbish meaning it

134
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:30,160
just it should be discarded you know you can go to look at things

135
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,740
qualitatively see if you go to a landfill there's a lot of garbage

136
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:41,840
everywhere that cannot be denied you know quantity but what is the quality

137
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,360
you know it's pretty low so when I say rubbish that's what I mean I mean

138
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,680
something that is a low quality or no worth is what people are pretty much

139
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:57,400
still engaging in wholesale from what they find to be alternative sources all

140
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:02,040
the way to mainstream and what makes it rubbish is that it's not founded on

141
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,340
anything or not founded on what they state it should be on so what is that

142
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:11,740
what effect does that have to do on the spirit or the mind you see it's quite

143
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:18,460
interesting isn't it what does the word sanity mean it perhaps you know it's

144
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,520
interesting it goes with sanitation or being clean or helpful doesn't it yeah

145
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:34,780
sanity is is health it's healthy insanity is unhealthy yeah and looking

146
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:41,880
at the you know the mind as spirits and not as the physical organ that the

147
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:51,100
spirit seems to use to you know interact with this with this body it's the root

148
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,040
the mind might be the root of the spirit that's why how many times I ever heard

149
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,940
of a kill shot to the head you've never really heard of a kill shot to the foot

150
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:09,360
or the arm or the shoulder have you so it seems to be the root of this maybe

151
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,220
it's an ethereal positioning but it does work you know a kill shot to the head

152
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,880
lights out you're finished where that's that's where the kill shot is guided to

153
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,980
so there is a found you can find the organ corresponding with the presence of

154
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,820
that spirit as well but to lean completely on the organ and the material

155
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:31,620
aspect of itself is kind of useless when you want to branch off it's even or

156
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,960
even the looking at it as a singular organ because there's one other place

157
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:45,210
the heart you will find what they call brain cells kill shot and it also seems

158
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:49,750
to be you know at least through observation and historically yeah yeah

159
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,310
that would be the heart yeah and by the way you're cutting in and out a little

160
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:57,370
bit so yeah so from that aspect you know here's another thing just to kind of

161
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,630
stay within this thing because we don't really need to come out and tell people

162
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,610
that they're mentally or spiritually not well maybe we could go around it even

163
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:09,770
though I kind of just did we can go around the roundabout way of just

164
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:14,930
describing maybe not the symptomology of it right which is attempted to be

165
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:20,530
mitigated through chemicals or through what they call spiritual awakenings and

166
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:24,570
con therapies and things like that which are mindless again and well they're not

167
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,630
really mindless because there is a spirit behind that or even albeit a low

168
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,970
quality one but you know what's interesting stuff I'm going to bring

169
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,250
this up I've been told Greek why don't you say this is very often when you when

170
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,670
you're discussing things in private with people from all walks they say yeah man

171
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,910
people have been dumbed down you know there's a big dumbing down but you know

172
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:49,510
what's interesting it's never them it's never someone they like a family member

173
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,310
or someone that's close them it's always just generally people that are that are

174
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:58,290
dumbed down you know you hear this pretty much from every aspect and guess

175
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:03,710
what folks you're all dumbed down you know it's at this point and am I

176
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:08,770
pointing a finger at anyone no it's it's we're all inclusive in this but it's I

177
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:21,610
last week I did discuss it's not only a it's that period has ended we're not

178
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:27,230
ended it's still continuous meaning on where let's say a cure for dumbing might

179
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:32,650
be information but is it really if you don't care you know being you know harsh

180
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:37,870
in discussion it was like well you know what do you know Luminati are really

181
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:42,090
controlling all this stuff for some oligarchical group but I'm like well

182
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:47,290
obviously if they're in control they don't keep their word what do you mean

183
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,310
well they're supposed to reduce the population down to 500 million I still

184
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:56,630
see 7 billion morons walking the planet obviously they don't keep their word not

185
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,550
that they should here but the point is what the hell are you giving so much

186
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:03,970
credence to all this stuff for you know what you know it's more than just

187
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,730
dumbing down now it's like no one's paying attention to what they're saying

188
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:16,710
but nonetheless to to look at again just the the idea of a healthy spirit or

189
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:21,330
a healthy mind if if the if it's intangible and it lies within the realm

190
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:26,390
of communication like I said earlier people are getting information

191
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:30,590
communicated to them that it seemed to be coming from some kind of a

192
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:35,290
homogenous mass or homogenous stream very simply again just not to harp on the

193
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:40,490
alternative media but look any pretty much effort that's being made in the

194
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,730
alternative is either going to parrot what is in the mainstream or some kind

195
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:52,030
of like sign of the times alternative new ag bullshit yep you got it

196
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:56,910
yeah bullshit's good for growing flowers but you know what makes it bullshit you

197
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,950
know that you hear on radio and print or in presentations that people are making

198
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:06,450
well you bring up discussions let's say regarding let's say ancient texts and if

199
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,470
you listen to what they're discussing about it you will not find it in the

200
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,990
text so what's going on right if they bring up discussions regarding

201
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,569
scientific matters you won't find it in the natural world because the scientific

202
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:28,170
matter or the science study of science is to pretty much give an explanation which

203
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:33,230
they fail to or description of the natural world give you folks an example

204
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:39,010
about that they speak about the the magnetic poles or magnetism or gravity

205
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:45,010
in the earth well this is a big subject but let's make it small and essentially

206
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:50,770
the consensus now is not by everyone but conventional is that magnetism of the

207
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:56,190
earth or let's say for us to say is gravity but specifically magnetism is

208
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:05,710
caused by the molten core molten iron core at the earth's center now okay that

209
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:10,210
sounds okay wow you know we know that iron is magnetic we put refrigerator on a

210
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:15,610
magnet or a nail or something and I mean put a magnet on something iron and it's

211
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,990
and it's ferromagnetic ferro meaning iron and it sticks so so kind of makes

212
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,750
sense that there's this huge molten iron core it's not just iron core that they're

213
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,630
saying that it's molten in the center of the earth that's causing this magnetic

214
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:32,890
you know bar magnet effect let's say with a north and south pole now no stop

215
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:38,170
and think folks okay that might sound good it makes you feel good right but

216
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:42,330
just all right don't stop and think actually don't stop and think why don't

217
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:47,030
you go and look at a little bit more about what iron and magnetism is about

218
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:52,430
and when you look at that you'll find out that when when iron is heated beyond a

219
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:58,830
certain point it fails to be magnetic it's called the Curie point right so and

220
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:04,550
the Curie point is where iron is no longer magnetic and that is well below

221
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:08,990
that temperature is well below before it becomes molten you know it might be I

222
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:14,670
think it's around 800 Celsius and the melting point of iron is almost double

223
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:19,610
that or actually a little less about 1300 or so so how can a molten iron

224
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:27,390
which is not magnetic be the cause of Earth's magnetic poles you know you can

225
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,810
look this up it takes a few minutes so when you hear a little bit of

226
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,690
information and it makes you feel good that's fine I'm not saying you shouldn't

227
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:41,090
feel like you're being made to feel good in a common way but just take an extra

228
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:46,150
step and inquire a little bit more now you not everyone has to do this but

229
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:50,390
there has to be a certain few that will and it seems to be lacking in the

230
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:55,350
society so again how does that tie in with mental health if people are walking

231
00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:04,590
around pretty much believing things that are untrue so from that respect is it

232
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:09,070
just informational based it can be you know having the wrong information or

233
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,790
erroneous information does that have anything to do with having a good sound

234
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:21,410
mind think about that for a moment you know and essentially when you hear

235
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:27,850
about the changes that are going in a negative way why is it that everyone not

236
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,950
everyone but particularly everyone tends to want to blame it on someone else

237
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:36,890
I've always suggested that if you want to know who the problem is get a mirror

238
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:43,490
look into it why because the simplest way to perhaps approach anything that you

239
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:47,730
don't like is to say do I want to be a part of this or do I want to separate

240
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:52,830
myself from it and what's interesting about that when you look up what's

241
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:57,150
called let's say the holy writs of the world or spiritual texts let's say of

242
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:01,970
the mind or of the gods they never suggest you need to thrust yourself in

243
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:09,230
the midst of society be the change you know create change never always about

244
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:16,110
separating yourself from it so if the if their problems that exist within the

245
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:22,830
society or the world are made up of the individuals if the individuals decide to

246
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:27,350
pull themselves out of that problem will there still be a problem that's kind of

247
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:32,930
like asking is a room a room if no one's in it well you know we're from

248
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:37,230
architectural perspective yes but from a social perspective maybe no that's why I

249
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:42,250
very often lead people back to look up a book called the crowd by Gustave Le Bon

250
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,950
L-E-B-O-N well it's not the be all end all it's a good place to kind of start

251
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,690
and what's interesting there is some of the commentaries you don't have to read

252
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,330
the book even though it is there's an audiobook on there but there's some

253
00:21:54,330 --> 00:22:00,450
pretty accurate commentaries about that book and what's interesting is it when

254
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:05,570
this these crowds form you find them through what's called activism or

255
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:11,630
activists or protesters or of any other level whether it's from the

256
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:16,890
geopolitical side known as lobbyists or political groups all the way down to the

257
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:22,110
earthy crunchy you know poncho slipper wearing people peace and love you know

258
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:29,430
all the way down to that from the suit and tie down to you know whoever you

259
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:33,490
will find that there's always a cause that they are gathered under and if you

260
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,210
ask the individuals within the crowd why are they doing what they're doing they

261
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:43,950
will pretty much cite that cause and if you take what they just cited and spend

262
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:48,230
a few minutes looking more deeply into it you'll find that what they had cited

263
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:52,590
as their cause really doesn't resemble what it originally was in the first

264
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:59,070
place you'll find this very much in a lot of the legal activism about

265
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:05,510
legalizing things have these people actually stopped to look at the

266
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:09,250
fundamental laws that were thrusted into society that made something illegal or

267
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:14,830
legal or they using the New York Times as their research and you will find it's

268
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:20,490
the latter so again what is what does this have to do with risk you know

269
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:23,650
keeping the health of the individual keeping a healthy mind because most

270
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:27,450
people can go throughout their lives essentially believing things that are

271
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:33,610
erroneous and untrue or unfounded now does you know they might seem happy they

272
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:38,310
might smile or whatever but when when it comes to the rubber meeting the pavement

273
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:44,410
and proceeding in any positive way it's tends to not really work well because it

274
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:49,550
could be because they're not really looking into what they think something

275
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:56,590
is you know one of my favorite things to mention is a lot of biblical cliches it

276
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:03,630
is an important text to consider I mean whether it's you know something to do

277
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,510
with some religious group or not is not the point because it really isn't by the

278
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:11,330
way like I've always like to reiterate there's not a religion on the planet bar

279
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:15,170
none that does anything that's in the text that they allegedly allegedly

280
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:19,930
subscribe to any religion Eastern Western or in the middle do not do

281
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:23,510
anything that's in the texts do not acknowledge anything in there they might

282
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:29,270
take something out of context I used to always discuss nature of religion is

283
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:35,630
basically meaning something that you do regularly but what what it has taken on

284
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:40,630
to is something to commemorate higher beings or gods or what again people like

285
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:45,430
to call spirituality and the state of humanity regarding these causes and I'm

286
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:49,830
talking also about the highest levels right now and we'll cite them like the

287
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:55,370
Vatican if you go to the Vatican the highest levels or your highest schools

288
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:00,650
of divinity your highest schools of biblical thought or teaching or your

289
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:07,450
highest schools of in the world of Islam or in the Eastern traditions as well if

290
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:12,790
you listen to what they say you will not find any of it in the texts that they say

291
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:17,530
their religion is based on I'm just going to take a pause there for a minute

292
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:23,290
to show you how ridiculous even that aspect has gone but but that is because

293
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:27,070
of the the way that the human mind is being led like right now any anyone in

294
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:34,150
the Western world can get a recipe for a chocolate chip chip cookie and bake one

295
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:39,570
in the form of the Virgin Mary and within a fact and if he tells people

296
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:44,090
about this you'll have a thousand people in a month worshipping that that that

297
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:49,530
whole scenario is and he'll be there standing about telling them how that

298
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:53,110
cookie crumbled and they'll all and he'll just take their money take their

299
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:58,010
effort take their mind and take their interest this is the level of stupidity

300
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:03,090
that humanity is is is involved in at this moment so again when when people are

301
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,450
when I hear people discussing yeah people are pretty dumb they're dumbed

302
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:11,130
down it's never them of course you know you know can't be you know think about

303
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:16,010
that folks for a moment you know are you common and look up what that means

304
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:20,510
so the sense here again you know how does that tie into being mentally what

305
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:24,750
what is okay the mental health aspect can it be restored well the thing is

306
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:30,690
what makes anyone think that it ever was in a position that you want to bring it

307
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:35,870
back to you know there's there's an interesting part of the formation of

308
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:41,050
things and if you look around society look at what's going on do you see

309
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:47,950
objectively a problem yes one can say that you know people are always yelling

310
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:52,550
about their problems in society well then can you see objectively if there is

311
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:58,590
a solution well no you know people want a solution or yeah they say this might

312
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,050
be the solution you know they're looking for things to save them they

313
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:07,670
don't know what they're going to be saved from but there's an insanity and

314
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:16,210
unhelpfulness that's going on and could that be also it's not only of the mind

315
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:22,370
but it's of the spirit which haha by the way means the same thing you know last

316
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:26,210
week we which which can be found in archives I kind of did a monologue for an

317
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:32,010
hour based on pretty much if I were to comment on it was do really people

318
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:38,550
deserve the truth if they're acting so undeservingly is that a judgment call

319
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:44,610
absolutely two of the things that I pretty much covered then and got into

320
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:48,550
for about an hour was first of all you don't even know how to keep time and you

321
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:53,390
don't notice and you don't care the Pope's work schedule or the Gregorian

322
00:27:53,390 --> 00:28:00,030
calendar is not a timepiece never was intended to be and it never will be and

323
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:04,750
you can't keep time with it it is a work schedule for the Pope subjects period

324
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:09,890
that's something that really can't be debated because it's so simply clear

325
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:15,050
when you see it for example anyone that observes any day of the year will notice

326
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,990
that it's a different day of the week next year and it has nothing to do with

327
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:24,530
the Earth going around the Sun in an uneven pattern wake up folks no one

328
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:31,310
knows how to keep time and time is just the recordation of events so if

329
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:36,210
something isn't really worth recording maybe it's not really worth having if

330
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:40,370
you look at a lot of the events that people have been vanquishing about or

331
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:45,370
relishing about or celebrating pretty much based in worthlessness yes I'm

332
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:50,970
sorry to say that but anyway the other thing that I brought up is the concept

333
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:55,370
of are you in is your body in a healthful condition where you require a

334
00:28:55,370 --> 00:29:00,430
cool head and warm feet how many times have people gone to their engineering

335
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:06,390
classes and requested devices that produce a rise in cold and a descending

336
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:11,190
heat like it is in nature so you have a cool head and warm feet if the answer is

337
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:16,170
none you are correct so you don't know how to keep time or record events

338
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:21,630
properly don't care and you've got a hot head and cold feet and you want the

339
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:29,310
truth that's a discussion for another subject but you see where that goes so

340
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:35,150
very simply there's something again about mental health and again you're not

341
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,590
going to get it if you're kind of like lazy and stuck in these things you know

342
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:43,850
there's there's a material aspect of it oh it's all chemical based that's fine

343
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:47,930
with Seth earlier we just mentioned you know the kill shot is the head you know

344
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:53,890
like the zombies cut off the head get rid of the brain you kill the zombie it

345
00:29:53,890 --> 00:30:01,010
even works with them but nonetheless this this concept of restoring things

346
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:06,050
also why would you want to restore something which wasn't good in the first

347
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:16,660
place there's got to be a redoing of things greeting Seth yes yes we have

348
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:21,720
that's we have suffered through a hard reboot but we're back okay great and

349
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,520
pretty much went around the block regarding several things so the the

350
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,200
aspect of the spirit and being a health in a healthful state or the mind being in

351
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,480
a healthful state is very grim for humanity at this point it's not going to

352
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:43,820
happen there's going to be a general let's say leading through of pretty much

353
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:49,100
the way things are until things change because the changes that have to come

354
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:56,940
have to come you see but to pretty much consider the state of being of health of

355
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:03,680
things it's it's not very good but it doesn't mean that it's fatal you see one

356
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,960
can be in an in a state of illness or disease and still function right and

357
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,920
just this is pretty much just carrying through the concept of the health of the

358
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:18,600
mind and you can pretty much hear it I use the example of you know magnetism

359
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:24,340
of the earth and many other things that people really very simple to understand

360
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,700
they but they refuse to look into it into things objectively even though

361
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,840
they're pretty much simple you know which brings like the the concept of

362
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,180
memory how many times have you heard well I didn't remember that or I didn't I

363
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,760
don't really know that you know even though they came across it one thing I

364
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,040
want to bring up regarding memory is that everything is in your memory before

365
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:53,700
you one speaks or writes or begins to communicate they're actually accessing

366
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,960
little tidbits and faculties words sounds and things that are already in their

367
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,900
memory you know so this whole thing about people saying well I don't have a

368
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,760
good memory or I don't remember that it's not just the faculty or the

369
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,440
function of the memory itself because the very fact that they can communicate

370
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,620
and use more than five words semi intelligent intelligently strung

371
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,640
together means that they have some sort of memory and what's interesting with

372
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:28,060
that is the more weight that you can carry the stronger you are you see so it

373
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:33,260
doesn't mean that you need to be memorizing and imprinting things but

374
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:39,280
when you pay attention to retaining things and paying attention to what

375
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:46,780
memory is let's say which by the way mem means water and or means light those

376
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:51,220
look at the point of the root parts of it in the Caldean Hebrew the ancient

377
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:57,240
tongue it's very interesting so it's almost like water and light is what the

378
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:02,660
word memory can pretty much be described as and we have a lot of water and some

379
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:08,680
light and in ourselves hopefully so but the point here about coming up with the

380
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:15,940
subject of the mental health aspect is a big subject but the whole thing with any

381
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:21,320
truth of any matter is how deserving is the population for it you know when

382
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,200
they are not even asking the most basic aspects of their you know functioning

383
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,280
existence to be clarified you know and the thing that I like to bring up in a

384
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:35,360
judgmental way is the people don't know what how to keep time and they don't

385
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,280
care about it and they're not noticing that they're existing indoors with a

386
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:44,380
hot head and cold feet and they don't care about it either you see and by the

387
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:48,240
way folks that's why we kind of like tend to go back and say we have about

388
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,620
five listeners which is quite quite enough there's only a handful of people

389
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,260
on the planet actually that may even understand what's being said here it all

390
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:01,860
be it even as simple as can be you know Seth I think you might have been around

391
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:07,320
one day you and I were on a roundtable that was being broadcast and it was a

392
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:12,780
someone who was also supposedly a host of an alternative media came to me and

393
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:17,060
said hey Greek every time you speak I need babble fish to understand what

394
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,739
you're saying and my response was you don't need babble fish you need a

395
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:27,840
lollipop in a padded room but anyway so you know yes it's pretty easy to apply

396
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:34,760
that to to what's going on on the planet right now but the the uncommon aspect of

397
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,400
the discussion of mental health is first of all the connections objectively are

398
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:44,179
not being made there's still a refusal to go away from the fractional

399
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,480
compartmentalization of the definition of things like oh heaven forbid does the

400
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,780
mind or mental mean the spirit right people just don't want to acknowledge

401
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,660
that and how easy is it to actually learn about that as a reference point or

402
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:06,760
a meaning of the word quite easy again just to you know bring up it's not just

403
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,660
the definition of words but it's scientific concepts and social concepts

404
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:15,280
as well you know I brought up one of the concepts of the magnetism of the earth

405
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,380
being blamed on molten iron at the center of center but people fail to

406
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:25,380
realize that molten iron is not magnetic it's way beyond the curie the curie

407
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:32,100
point it's it's actually iron loses its magnetism when it's about red-hot before

408
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:36,320
and it's still solid so how can you see and no one and the whole thing here is

409
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,900
is it required for the entire population to hear a bit information and

410
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,640
then validate it let's just say this in secret everybody cover your ears Seth it

411
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:54,500
is okay I'm back yes you do so but okay so let's say everyone doesn't do that

412
00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:00,840
because of their emotional or mental laziness is it is it up to maybe certain

413
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,780
individuals let's say a small percentage of the group to do it yet every again

414
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,940
everybody all listeners cover your ears Seth I'll tell you privately guess what

415
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:14,420
Seth it is they have to validate what they're saying yeah okay I'm back so how

416
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,660
many so how many people are actually validating anything you know you know

417
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:22,820
very little it's in it and how easy is it to and again the discussion whether

418
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:27,580
it's the definition of the mind what it is I mean people are not even shocked

419
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:31,220
when you bring up the point that the mind and the spirit are the same by the way

420
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:34,020
they're not even shocked anymore they just because they're in such a state of

421
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:39,900
refuel a refusal to acknowledge it right that it doesn't really affect them you

422
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,800
see just like when you bring up something in the scientific world or the

423
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:49,040
political world or the legal world those are all the same aren't they that's yeah

424
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,100
they're all aspects of religion again if we go to the religions you know right

425
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:57,320
now this is the Christian era secularly not to knock Christians you don't have

426
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,740
to because it's so easy I mean it's not fair to do that it's like shooting fish

427
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:05,140
in the barrel a lot of people are threatening that there's going to be an

428
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,300
elimination of Christianity by the New World Order and I'm like something has

429
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:14,100
to exist in order for to be eliminated because you won't find anything that is

430
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:19,740
Christian in anything that they say it's based on it is actually a culture or

431
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:27,080
tradition that's been developed it is not based on it's it's fiat the same with

432
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:33,240
any religion it's pretty much fiat when you look at their scientific aspect it's

433
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:39,940
fiat you know it's not based on anything they supposedly is but you cannot

434
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:47,960
validate it the same with the illegal society fiat I mean so how is one in

435
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,560
other words does does the very fact that pretty much what's being discussed

436
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,000
because remember I'm saying what's being discussed by people or what they believe

437
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,420
in is not based on anything meaning each corresponding subject that we just

438
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,000
brought up if you actually go look at what's been memorialized about what that

439
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,680
should be about it does not it's not in accordance with what people think it is

440
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,200
so does that have anything to do with mental health or one's mental well-being

441
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,020
you know I believe it does and when I say believe I'm meaning meaning that

442
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:26,100
it's a functional belief meaning something appears to be like this now and

443
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:31,800
it doesn't seem like it's going to change tomorrow so it is founded to say

444
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,380
I believe it is like this because it'll probably continue until it doesn't this

445
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:45,160
way absolutely I would I would say that looking at we refer to another way of

446
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:50,500
referring to mental health colloquially would be sanity or insanity as we

447
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:55,840
brought up earlier and sanity is a word that simply means health in the

448
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,980
language that it comes from English does that we like to take words and say okay

449
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:09,920
it means this now but if you look at sanity as as health and not just of one

450
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:17,300
aspect of existence but of all of them that you know we can observe body mind

451
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:24,200
soul you know soul being the breath not separate from you know spirit or yes

452
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:28,620
separate from spirit it's functional it's carnal it's carnally based well

453
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:33,520
like the body and the breath or the soul the requirements to contain the spirit I

454
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:40,900
know I would suggest that the things that are necessary for good physical health

455
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:47,080
for lack of a better term or good bodily health are the are the same things that

456
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:55,100
are necessary for good you know spiritual or mental health that when you

457
00:39:55,100 --> 00:40:00,900
are addressing one in a proper manner you are actually addressing both because

458
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:05,760
the body is how the spirit interacts with the world around it so if you have

459
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,620
a sick body you know there's been recently there have been studies

460
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:16,460
published that I have not read but I've seen the titles of and the titles would

461
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:23,840
lead one to believe that there is slowly a recognition going on in some at

462
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:29,000
least aspects of study and research if not you know readily available

463
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,820
publications that are starting to address such things that poor emotional

464
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:43,680
like relationships corresponds actually to physical ailments of the heart where

465
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,420
they've studied people that have you know poor relationships with the people

466
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:55,820
around them relatively and after you know and the thorough physical

467
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:00,600
examinations or as thorough as this culture can come to a physical

468
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:06,560
examination there's been actually problems found with the physical state

469
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:14,660
of their their heart which by the way just to throw this in and preface

470
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,080
before I throw this said you know when I did a show with Chuck Ocelli called

471
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:23,360
Ocelli and the Greek and by the way for anyone wants to hear more of let's say

472
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,260
background behind the recitations we give here go to Ocelli and the Greek

473
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:34,560
dot-com you very simply you'll find places to get archives it's 36 hours 18

474
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:40,840
episodes of discussion and a tremendous amount of initial initialization of

475
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:47,260
background of what we tend to discuss here what Seth is found there but part

476
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:53,260
of the that and part of discussion is having guests and bringing other people

477
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:58,340
in and pretty much I've said that anyone I'd want to interview or have as a guest

478
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,940
is pretty much dead there are very few people that I believe that exist on this

479
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:06,660
planet today that can I'd be interested in bringing forward and interviewing

480
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:10,180
let's say there's still actually a couple and one of them would be Frank

481
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:18,780
Chester Frank Frank Chester as a chest of drawers and a Chester CHE STER you

482
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,040
will find Frank Chester there's YouTube's on there and these are YouTube's

483
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,300
that'll make you feel smart if you watch them right okay that's very it's very

484
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,020
I'm sorry to interrupt but I'm going to anyways I just wanted to say that that's

485
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:35,960
very it's interesting that you bring up Frank Chester I guess when speaking

486
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:46,420
about the heart it's of course but I was reviewing and sharing some of his I guess

487
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:52,720
demonstrations is what it would be two nights ago wonderful yeah see how it

488
00:42:52,720 --> 00:43:02,140
coincides with yeah someone expressed a taste for patterns and things like that

489
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:08,740
and so I brought up a few patterns and like you you would take more from this

490
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:14,640
than the average person reviewing it you if you were already kind of aware of

491
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,380
some of these patterns so yeah again sorry to interrupt but please no no it's

492
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,400
not it's not it's exactly cuz I didn't really want to get into his work because

493
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,060
we just cited him and if you're if you're listening to us you're probably in

494
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:29,980
front of a computing machine and you could access Frank Chester you will find

495
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:34,340
the matters of the heart being discussed there by someone who I would call who is

496
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:40,020
one of the few master teachers or has mastership there are very few people that

497
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:46,280
have mastership and things anymore and he is one of them and he and also to sort

498
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,660
of use as a how do you say is an exception to the statements that I make

499
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:56,080
that older people have been reduced to fools these days he is one older people

500
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:01,160
that is not in in the matters that he discusses he is quite brilliant and I

501
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:05,920
would regard him as a master in his field to say the least would you agree

502
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,380
Seth I would yeah and it's quite an experience even if you have no interest

503
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:18,200
in the heart wink wink or haha it would be a well a well worth view or citing

504
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:26,380
this man's work again it's Frank Chester C-H-E-S-T-E-R as in Chester drawers so

505
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:32,160
Chester Frank Chester look him up you will be glad you did yeah yes indeed

506
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:40,060
regarding the heart yeah and we talk we we kind of harp on the alternative media

507
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:45,680
and the internet because it is well I mean that they it's so easy to do I

508
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:52,240
guess but statistically yes that is exactly yes and I would I would say that

509
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,240
a lot of the information that he speaks about is information that is not being

510
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,280
spoken of anywhere else in the manner in which he's doing it and he's he's very

511
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:10,040
good at it as well in illustrating these these concepts that he presents so I

512
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,340
would I would definitely second that encouragement to look up Frank Chester

513
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:20,700
and it's it's well worth the time yes absolutely and you will get more of

514
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,480
let's say a grip on you albeit a tight grip or a loose grip on what is going on

515
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,520
with the archetypal forms behind things so you know there's there's the aspect

516
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:38,040
of that you know that is pretty tangible and very easy for people to access you

517
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:44,480
know yeah absolutely but the the again that we kind of brought up out of the

518
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:51,040
blue let's say the idea of mentality or you know the the there's there's the

519
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:55,180
aspect of mental health you know and here's here's the interesting part of

520
00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:00,900
any health when you're looking at it in a common point of view is there seems to

521
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,340
be you know something called the bell curve or the minimal acceptable standard

522
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:10,500
of something and when the entire group or the entire let's say quantity of

523
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:16,260
something reaches a low level of quality that low level minimum is then lowered

524
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:21,520
again you see so then everything is above that you see what I mean so there's

525
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,060
this lack of referencing to what is quality and what is not because it's

526
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:30,660
always being changed you know I don't like using the grading form with people

527
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:35,340
but there is grading of things like fruits and vegetables and livestock right

528
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:39,400
and that's why very much I like to say that what is the most degrading thing you

529
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:45,160
can do to anyone especially a child is to grade them grade them yes well it's

530
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:49,820
not only the grading itself strictly but what happens when you put people let's

531
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:53,700
say for example when you say grading you think of school when you put people in

532
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:59,100
a group that let's say is called a school what is that purpose right what

533
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,320
is the purpose again what is it based on right it was you're supposed to go

534
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,760
there to learn things right and we've discussed how we don't have an operating

535
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,680
system and such so when you bring up the concept of grading now you are

536
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:16,280
motivating them to learn through penalty the motivation now is penalty you see

537
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,340
right yeah so the person getting the high grade is getting the high grade

538
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:25,160
because he what doesn't want the low grade you see so now the motivations

539
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:29,360
behind these things are penalty just like for example have you ever heard

540
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:34,300
whether this is an urban myth or not it's a really good example how the

541
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:38,760
regulatory the health regulatory agencies were going around to hot dog

542
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:45,120
factories and they found that they all had rat feces so they had a

543
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,520
choice either close all of them down and have a revolution yes the only way

544
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,600
to have a revolution America is to close on all the hot dog factories by the way

545
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:57,860
folks but anyway either close them all down or raise the allowable amount of

546
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:02,100
rat feces and hot dogs which would be lowering the quality standard right so

547
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:06,460
they could all stay open so now you can have rat feces but you you cannot go

548
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,720
exceed this level which would be the lowest level of quality so they keep

549
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:16,080
changing the bar you see so why is this happening you know you see so this

550
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:21,520
quality when we like to discuss what quality is is it based should it be

551
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,660
based on something that is always fluctuating based on the norm or what

552
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:29,560
that what's commonly accepted or is there really a set quality you see and

553
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:34,060
absolutely and I believe that there is a set quality that can be determined which

554
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,700
goes back to the health of things you know whether it's the health of the soil

555
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:41,640
the health of the mind the health of the body you know playing around with the

556
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,800
quality for political reasons or commercial reasons is really a death

557
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:53,840
trap you see certainly but for the sake of of one's own health you know what

558
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:58,080
there is information available look which which we could reiterate you know

559
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:01,020
if anyone listens to the archives on these shows we'll find that we're always

560
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:05,640
repeating almost the same things always and the simplest aspect of health is of

561
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,780
course you know people here they want information on their health they go to

562
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,240
the internet or wherever and find all these various various plethora of

563
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,720
approaches whether it's allopathic mainstream or alternative but what they

564
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:20,620
have figured out to have missed and omit as being forward in the discussion

565
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,700
is are you eating within your environment in other words if you're

566
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:29,520
living in a cold place what happens when you eat food that was grown in a hot

567
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:35,260
place well obviously it will change your body's chemistry to living in a hot

568
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:38,620
place and you will not do well and vice versa so this lead eating seasonally

569
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:43,700
thing is an interesting approach we always kind of harp on harping because

570
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:48,780
people don't really want to hear it let's say in general why do I say they

571
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,100
don't really want to hear it I've had discussions with thousands of

572
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:54,480
individuals and when we do discuss health I say well are you eating

573
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:00,460
seasonally or within cross-latitude oh oh I kind of heard you mention that but

574
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:05,860
I forgot well it's something that bears repeating because it's something that's

575
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:11,520
very very simple and when it's pointed out it seems well that's that's obvious

576
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:17,080
if you're eating just on a to reiterate a point that we've reiterated several

577
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:22,240
times but you know if you're eating a plant that grows heartily in the climate

578
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:27,580
in which you find yourself chances are that is going to be significantly better

579
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:34,480
for you than you know the the reverse of that so yeah it's it bears repeating

580
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:41,200
it's it seems obvious once it's explained and it's it's very simple you know so

581
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:45,320
yeah well the aspect of the chemical aspect of it for example you know like

582
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,180
they'll tell you open adders have you know potassium it's really good for you

583
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:55,160
or oranges have vitamin C and vitamin C's been proven to help with colds you

584
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:59,700
know it's and all that like but wait a second folks okay you know no one really

585
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:05,320
knows what's in a banana no one really knows what's in an orange and when I say

586
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:09,060
no one I mean well yes there are some people that just they put on white lab

587
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,920
coats and they have brick-and-mortar buildings that are well endowed with the

588
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,500
credit system and they take oranges and bananas and they cut them open and they

589
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,780
dry them out and subject them to other chemicals and fire which is called

590
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:25,940
assaying and mining for example and they assay these things and what they do

591
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:30,260
changes it so much from its original living form they then write reports that

592
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:36,980
bananas have potassium and oranges have vitamin C yeah those things kind of

593
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:42,040
emerge after you do all those things to them in a laboratory you know so it's

594
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:46,660
like no one really knows what's in food you see the close the one who came the

595
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:50,380
closest to it was Rudolf Hoschka which we've mentioned before and he's the

596
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:53,440
father of vitamins and he found was looking to see what gave food its

597
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,940
vitality I think we've mentioned him before yeah so less last week yeah so

598
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:04,660
there's been a major pull away from that but again we always bring up the idea

599
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:08,040
that if humanity is deceived about headquarters how are they going to

600
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:13,200
proceed from headquarters into other things and adventure into other concepts

601
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,000
and again ties into the health of the spirit or health of the mind and if

602
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,500
you're deceived about yourself aren't you going to pretty much it you know

603
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:25,620
resonate with deception and pretty much emit deception and that's one of the

604
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:29,720
things that hasn't been addressed just like earlier I was saying you know in

605
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,860
private conversation or even not so private people that you run into of all

606
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:37,600
walks of life will admit that people have been dumbed down but it's always

607
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,620
no it's not it's never them you ever notice that you know it's never them

608
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:44,600
that they know and the other meme that you hear in society is like oh yeah

609
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,580
we're psychopaths we're being run by psychopaths oh yeah but it's it's never

610
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:52,260
you of course it's never it's no one in your family no one you know no no no no

611
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:57,580
no I haven't forbid you know it's it's quite interesting how there is this

612
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:03,200
retraction from objectivity that tends to not be acknowledged and also the the

613
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,940
aspect of everything has been created in the past century or lesser actually

614
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:13,280
right now it seems to be everything sort of came into creation about 20 years ago

615
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,160
it's very difficult for people to go even beyond that you know by listening to

616
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:25,220
the discussions you know so again you know yeah the concept of a healthy let's

617
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:31,320
say spirit or mind you know what is it what is it hinged on psycho psychopathy

618
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:41,240
is the is you know the inverse of that psyche and pathos being the roots the

619
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:48,460
root words of the psychopath pain spirit right well being pain and psyche being

620
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:54,880
spirit yeah and again we could keep reiterating it in the language the way

621
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:59,660
we communicate let's say in English being the langua franca franca what is

622
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:05,020
it when you see the word PSY in a prefix what is it implying get back to

623
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:08,480
that in a minute we're listening or several minutes folks listening to

624
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,720
American Freedom Radio and hopefully streaming on UStream to Seth Michael and

625
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,960
the Greek at Uncommon Sense yes and we're back we're streaming again on

626
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,960
UStream and we're on American Freedom Radio and this is Uncommon Sense with

627
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:28,220
the Greek and Seth Michael so yeah we were kind of getting this week into the

628
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:32,860
aspect of mental health and showing how you know what what is it what's going

629
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:38,200
on and Seth where do we leave off I believe trying to use the colloquial PSY

630
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:43,040
prefix which we find in the English language yes what would you say on that

631
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:49,020
we've been beating this horse which is still alive hopefully about the PSY and

632
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:55,300
then the PNU prefix for years now how would you sum it up before because you

633
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,080
might do it really well we don't have to go into it again but what do you think

634
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:04,680
about that the PNU was found in words that are common in English such as

635
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:20,200
pneumonia or pneumatics is air and the PSY is spirit mind one in the same PSY

636
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:27,000
so psychiatry psychology psychology would be study of the spirits or the

637
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:36,240
mind and you know pneumatics is the use of air such as in pneumatic tools air

638
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:42,360
air powered drills you know impact wrenches things of that nature that's an

639
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:48,460
easy tangible way to look at it and see it and also an accurate way to think of

640
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:53,600
it in your mind if you're trying to deconstruct words and find out what the

641
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:59,140
maybe what the sounds themselves originally connotated when they were

642
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:04,800
first being used and it's about also being mindful as also like being

643
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:11,900
spiritual in a way about it meaning you know in the DNA language or the DNA

644
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:18,060
which are the DNA people which are I believe derogatory called Navajo there

645
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:22,560
are the DNA people even in their language the term I believe us Nick day

646
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:28,900
or Nick Jay which which means spirit it means that the leader right it's

647
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:34,180
something but it's intangible one right and I don't recall their word for soul

648
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:38,520
but it actually means the breath right when it's defined so every culture in

649
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:44,340
the world you will find that the mind is the spirit and the breath is the soul

650
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:50,740
every culture in the world throughout history sans this one by the way you

651
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:56,500
will find that when the body dies the body is dead when the soul is dead right

652
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:03,400
and the spirit departs and these basic aspects believe me and I say believe me

653
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,020
meaning well the word belief just means that you know a bit of information that

654
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:11,540
holds true right now and you're not so sure if it'll hold true later but it

655
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:15,620
holds so much truth right now that it'll probably hold that truth later right

656
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:19,720
that's what belief is based on you know like gravity you know you believe that

657
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:23,700
you know if you drop something right now it'll fall but due to gravity there's a

658
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:26,720
pretty good belief that if you do it in five minutes or five years it will

659
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,660
happen that's all belief is it has to be founded on something that's why I said

660
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:36,580
believe me when you when I state that if you approach if you find this out to be

661
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:41,560
a good reference point right like learning how to read a tape measure on a

662
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:46,180
construction site so you can build things right when you discover what the

663
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:51,660
mind the body and the soul are and you try to discuss this with people you will

664
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:55,620
be met with opposition not not because we're starting some kind of

665
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:59,140
revolutionary group or trying to get people to oppose others no that's not

666
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:03,920
the point the point is when you come to even just the person next to you or for

667
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:09,500
someone you might meet or someone that is allegedly a teacher or not you will

668
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:14,080
be met with resistance on this matter what say you on that Seth would you find

669
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:21,260
that to be pretty accurate statement oh certainly resistance on an intellectual

670
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:27,000
level actually like an almost unwillingness to consider such concepts

671
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,980
in a way that they have not considered them before correct yeah it's about

672
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:36,800
considering you'll find a lot of the entitled classes whether they are the

673
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:40,220
you know the attorneys the scientists the religious or a quote-unquote

674
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:45,140
spiritual leaders which are different by the way because you can be a traffic

675
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:48,260
cop and you're very religious because you're doing something very regularly

676
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:55,300
just means you're doing it regularly so you will find when you approach people

677
00:58:55,300 --> 00:59:00,720
in society that are specialists or self-proclaimed or others proclaim them

678
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:05,740
to be experts in a field if you actually look up what they are quote-unquote

679
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:12,160
practicing or putting out you will find major discrepancies and they will loosely

680
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:18,300
always state that they're basing their field on this body of work but if anyone

681
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:21,640
goes and looks into it you will see the hypocrisy that they're actually not

682
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:26,000
they're kind of making things up as they go along hopefully that other people

683
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,660
won't find out about it there's essentially one of the definitions of

684
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:35,540
what's going on in society right now I've seen this I've heard it I've

685
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:40,740
experienced it what I mean I've seen it by reading an article about something

686
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:44,320
and then looking up what that something is about and it doesn't match I've heard

687
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:48,620
it by listening to people speak on certain topics and then I look up what

688
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:53,140
they're supposedly basing it on and it's not there or it's highly inaccurate and

689
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:57,460
I've experienced it by you know wanting to let's say do something the way I told

690
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:01,020
it should be and then I look into it and study it and I realized that the way I

691
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:06,820
was told was not correct and there's a I don't think that most of the problems

692
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:11,840
or problems at all I think they're stemmed on a sick spirit or a sick mind

693
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:18,360
well one that is not doing well lacks lax levity you know and is also very

694
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:24,820
lazy mm-hmm lax nutrition and noxious there's there's there's a thought for

695
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:34,540
food perhaps yeah there are there are a few passages in scripture that uh that

696
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:43,620
speak directly to that and the idea is not to empower an individual to go like

697
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:49,660
a go-to type person this is what mankind likes to do right the idea is not to

698
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:53,880
empower them with all of your energy in that direction right like let's say you

699
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,420
run into someone who is says they're a healer or a spiritual person or a

700
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:01,960
scientific person or they like what they say you know someone who's got a radio

701
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:08,340
show or someone who is good at performing something in society the idea now has

702
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:11,880
been to empower that individual people just say oh I'll just send them whatever

703
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,660
they need and they'll just do what they're doing and I'll be fine because

704
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:20,020
what they're doing is what I need right see what's happening here is instead of

705
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:25,560
in fully empowering these people in society why don't you go ahead and you

706
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,860
know if you like what they're doing go ahead and support them but resist be a

707
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:33,480
little hold back a little bit a little bit of time and energy and look up what

708
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:38,700
they're telling you try to validate right so there's a lot of people out there and

709
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:43,620
let's say let's use the internet as an idea and they write books put out DVDs

710
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:46,800
some of them been doing it for 50 years they say and others just came on the

711
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:50,920
scene and everyone and everything in between and people I've seen it and

712
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:54,660
heard it wholeheartedly fall into subscribing to what this person is

713
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:58,840
saying as quote-unquote gospel and I'm not saying don't do this with

714
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:02,540
individuals but what I'm saying is if you're going to spend all of this energy

715
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:05,740
and giving them all of your energy to believe in what they're telling you

716
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:09,540
reserve about five or ten percent of it to actually look up what they're telling

717
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:15,660
you and see if it is so and the more energy you research what they're saying

718
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:20,780
you put into you the less you will find that you should be doing what you're

719
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:25,360
doing with them anyway and you become empowered you hear about a lot of these

720
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:31,260
gurus or teachers or masters or spiritualists or scientists or health

721
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:36,560
people or political people economic people and I've listened to them all and

722
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:39,980
I would say it's the opposite less than five percent of what they're saying you

723
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:45,340
will find to be true but yet most people give a hundred percent of their energy to

724
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:50,360
listening to these people instead of you know being more reserved and they

725
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:55,700
will find out if they start investing a little bit of time into checking up on

726
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:59,260
what they're saying there they will not it will be more conservative and not be

727
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:04,340
dumping energy I mean into here's a good example Seth are the megachurches in the

728
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:11,580
u.s. right I don't know if I would use the word good yeah but exactly a good

729
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:16,120
example of how people dump all their energy into something that is false yeah

730
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:21,880
certainly yeah it's a well yes yeah absolutely because what's being espoused

731
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:26,840
is not accurate right I have an interesting view of such things as just

732
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:33,900
simply being a social club like a like a brand a cult if you view the word cult

733
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:39,440
as the root of culture as opposed to taking it from the occult which I mean

734
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,820
is the same same root I'm not talking about something that's hidden I'm

735
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:46,020
talking about what's done in plain sight it's a it's the type of culture

736
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:52,920
it's a it's a brand it's a it's a brand of belief it's a brand of not having to

737
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:57,320
look anything up it's a it's the following the leader and if you're

738
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:00,720
following the leader the view never changes so but here's the thing just to

739
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,460
go back on what I said about them being false and what you brought up is

740
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:08,560
actually let's clarify they are not false for example this big evangelistic

741
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:15,700
whatever they always strictly tell you that this is about the church right they

742
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:20,620
they strictly they strictly tell you that pretty much law has been done away

743
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:25,520
with so now we have we look up the definition of what church means and it

744
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:30,480
comes from the word Circe or Kiriaki in Greek or Circe which is the goddess

745
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:35,840
which the circus was formed around which just means circus and then they tell you

746
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:40,140
there's no law so if you look at the two basic definitions on that they are

747
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:45,040
lawless and their circus so they're not lying to you really direct but the

748
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:49,400
thing is people are misinterpreting what's being said and is it spiritual

749
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:55,320
absolutely it's all of the mind right but then we go back to the rat feces and

750
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:00,460
hot dogs anyway that's another you see how they could what quality are you

751
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:04,740
doing you know what's the level of spiritual the quality is very low

752
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:09,220
obviously when you look at that right as it does it deals with an aspect of

753
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:15,140
the mind which is part of the crowd again we go back to the bonds comments on

754
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:20,260
that that whenever you find people in a group albeit how small or how large when

755
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:24,820
this group is forming because even a small group might stay small but the

756
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:29,760
mentality is still the same where they're joined regarding a certain

757
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:34,420
subject or a topic you know whether it's secular or non-secular and in

758
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:40,060
between you might find let's say a good example so is the UFO community right if

759
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:45,880
you look at you know the paranormal stuff they come under this concept but

760
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:50,220
if you actually look at what the end you know what it's based on you won't

761
01:05:50,220 --> 01:05:57,440
find let's say a continuous or anything validatable you know it's again he said

762
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:02,080
she said it's very much also in the religious movements he said she said this

763
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:05,200
is what I believe it doesn't matter you know what you believe that I'm fine with

764
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:10,560
I was what I believe the same with the scientific community you know this is a

765
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:15,380
theory you know and by the way we've always suggested that people look up

766
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:20,560
what the word academic means because right now it holds prestige in some

767
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:26,020
capacity but if you actually look up what it means it means to be impractical

768
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:31,600
theoretical and never leading to a conclusion and also just to tie that

769
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:34,620
back in when you bring up the word spiritual everyone thinks it's something

770
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:35,020
good

771
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,600
oh he's so spiritual but it's not telling me what quality of spirit is it an

772
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:45,100
evil spirit is it a good spirit is it a dark spirit you see is it is it a lying

773
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:49,880
spirit is it a spirit of truth is it a spirit of death is a spirit of life

774
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:55,020
you ever notice that people oh he's so spiritual like yeah okay what kind of

775
01:06:55,020 --> 01:07:01,680
spirit with quality of spirit oh well you know it's it's good what makes it

776
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:08,760
good well I like it like wow you know come on people let's get it together and

777
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:12,060
when I say come on people only addressing about five people I think we

778
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:14,660
only have about five listeners and by the way Seth we had about a hundred

779
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:18,960
somewhat views on the YouTube stream and we don't know how many archives are

780
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:23,600
viewed again you know meaning the archives and that's 20 times more than we

781
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:28,780
thought we'd ever get so appreciate that but this might be the only programming

782
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:32,560
that is put in digital format that is actually geared to about five or ten

783
01:07:32,560 --> 01:07:38,560
people on the planet you know so that's why perhaps the discussions tend to go

784
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:45,740
the way they do absolutely I would suggest that if anyone wants more

785
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:54,860
information on a particular point or anything to email us uncommon sense

786
01:07:54,860 --> 01:08:00,860
radio one right uncommon sense radio with the number one following it at

787
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:08,900
gmail.com or you can email me directly dear red shoes d-a-r-r-e-d-s-h-o-e-s

788
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:18,939
at gmail.com and eventually here and probably maybe perhaps even next week

789
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:28,600
we'll you know open the lines so to speak and have the ability for people to call

790
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:32,760
in and join the conversation for a little bit to further clarify anything

791
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:38,640
in particular because we do jump around quite a bit and the Greek and I have

792
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:44,540
spent a lot of time speaking publicly and privately on these on a lot of these

793
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:51,100
you know topics and subjects that brought up so some of it to us we might you know

794
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:58,319
blaze through something that is maybe not even difficult to grasp but might

795
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:04,319
need a little bit further explanation and so we'll we'll do that and until we

796
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:11,680
do that live you're you know you're welcome to use the this interesting form

797
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:17,660
of communication at our fingertips to contact us. Now Seth what's interesting is

798
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:22,040
I think you've also looked at the emails from all the emails we've gotten

799
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:25,680
have all been positive and encouraging and also we've had a lot of query a lot

800
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:30,220
of questioning and what I found to be in common with all of the questions they

801
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:36,979
tend to lead to the biblical aspect or topic of things and you and I briefly in

802
01:09:36,979 --> 01:09:42,120
public stated that it's not time yet to discuss that with accuracy at this point

803
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:46,200
and yes anyone can gain accuracy on any subject all you have to do is engage it

804
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:50,979
directly and don't read into it read out of it you will be surprised what you

805
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:57,700
might find but just to go back to that topic even just this week we've gotten a

806
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:01,640
couple of emails regarding the nature of things biblical and when I say that

807
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:05,320
term I'm using it loosely in communication and I believe you and I

808
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:11,220
Seth have spent great time in public discussing how even started a few years

809
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:16,680
ago in public discussing how as you see time go on people will have an increased

810
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:21,360
interest in that subject and not only biblical but all spirituality none of it

811
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:25,440
will be accurate or worth mentioning as being accurate but the interest will

812
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:30,100
increase in that subject and wow isn't it interesting when you start to find

813
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:36,100
things that you knew were coming that actually manifest certainly I think some

814
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:42,360
of that has to do with the fact that you know it's spoken of in an uncommon

815
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:50,320
manner here and it's something that is almost take it for granted as a part of

816
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:56,600
you know the Western culture that we find ourselves in and so for it to be

817
01:10:57,260 --> 01:11:04,820
discussed in a manner that is unique is there's going to be at least you know a

818
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:09,960
handful of people that realize that and catch on to it and want further

819
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:20,300
clarification and there's there's a lot of excuse me a lot of clarification to

820
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:27,240
toward any semblance of accuracy or before any any semblance of accuracy you

821
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:33,920
know I'm trying to learn languages specifically for the purpose of studying

822
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:38,780
old books but eventually what was something like the biblical text you'll

823
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:42,800
find out that there's no requirement to learn a special language and that's kind

824
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:47,560
of like the labor that's required in one way indirectly but I want to just state

825
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:52,620
one thing which is a fact that right now there seems to be holistically no

826
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:57,460
accurate discussion on the biblical text holistically there only is little

827
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:01,520
frack fragments someone might pick up something and say look at this it's not

828
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:06,560
what you guys think it is but as a whole there is nowhere to go on the internet

829
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:11,400
or in the physical world where you will get accurate information regarding that

830
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:16,700
text period what I mean by that is the way to identify what I just said is being

831
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:23,140
true is very simple if anyone it doesn't matter who it is high or low in

832
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:28,740
ranking social rank if they start giving something that is supposedly based on

833
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:33,420
the biblical text regardless of the character loosely defined or something in

834
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:39,440
an event if they don't preface what they're saying as reminding the

835
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:44,760
audience that even to this date what is known as the Bible has not been

836
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:49,040
translated out of Hebrew and Greek with the original scriptures what you have is

837
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:55,940
a version I loosely represent a loose representation that is actually more

838
01:12:55,940 --> 01:13:00,520
erroneous than correct that exists in the world today in any language in any

839
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:07,720
version and it in other words the original text has yet to be translated

840
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:14,380
into English or any other language to this day this must be prefaced you know

841
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:19,660
and it is not and you have people from every walk of life all the way from the

842
01:13:19,660 --> 01:13:23,440
schools of divinity which are an utter joke all the way down to the man on the

843
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:28,080
street who thinks he's got a good idea discussing matters that are biblical and

844
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:31,920
actually believing and thinking that what they have is the actual biblical

845
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:38,120
text in a version form and this is the first thing that will that needs to be

846
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:45,500
established that it is not available to the world in any accurate form even

847
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:51,120
today other than the how it's been preserved in the Hebrew and Greek and

848
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:56,200
that is really a sad state of affairs not because it hasn't been translated but the

849
01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:01,460
sad state of affairs is the discussions and things that are built upon what's

850
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:06,400
called the Bible on something that's completely erroneous known as the King

851
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:11,100
James Version when all of the versions by the way are based on King James how

852
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:15,620
do you know if you open up a Bible it doesn't matter what version it is if the

853
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:18,580
first verse is in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth that

854
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:26,500
is a King James Version period so there is no availability and accurate access

855
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:30,680
to the text right now outside of the Hebrew and Greek scriptures where it is

856
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:36,340
still being preserved so that would that right there makes discussion direct

857
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:40,860
discussion about the text nearly impossible the only possible discussion

858
01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:44,980
that can be a valid discussion on the text or any character in the text

859
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:50,000
whether it's Adam and Eve or Abraham or the Christ or anything beyond that the

860
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:55,940
only way to discuss these topics or characters or events or anything like

861
01:14:55,940 --> 01:15:00,480
that is by first correcting the mistakes that are in the versions and bringing up

862
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:05,840
what should be said about it instead of what is been delivered to the

863
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:10,580
public and I believe we've done that several hundred times already in

864
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:16,340
specificity Seth you and I in public including on other things like you know

865
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:21,840
what what people are doing is when they approach the biblical text even in the

866
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,840
poor version that they have they have already their minds have been

867
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:31,340
completely misdirected through Hollywood churchy entity Sunday school

868
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:37,120
their parents urban myth about anything and when they approach the biblical text

869
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:41,040
and read it they are reading into it not reading out of it you know like the

870
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:45,980
giving another example or a specific example on that I had there's some

871
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:49,860
discussion about the burning bush coming up here and there and I I kind of like I

872
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:53,460
couldn't hold back anymore I'm like you know there is no burning bush what are

873
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:57,020
you talking about burning bush is that let's like Hollywood stuff man that's

874
01:15:57,020 --> 01:16:00,100
stuff they teach you in church it's no go look at the text there's no burning

875
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:06,500
bush what are you talking about and one person said holy crap he's right look

876
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:12,240
it's right here and I'm like yeah where'd you get the burning bush from you know

877
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:17,400
it's it's really fascinating how that just it just took one person five

878
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:21,420
seconds to look it up and but yet you will go throughout the world and

879
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:28,470
billions of people think there's a burning bush absolutely so how do you

880
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:33,510
know and by the way should we just give them the spoiler absolutely it takes a

881
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:37,370
few seconds well there's a scene where Moses is a particular mountain or a

882
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:41,910
mountain or let's say we're alone in a rural area let's say and he sees an

883
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:47,450
angel that is giving off fire and the angel Moses is kind of astounded let's

884
01:16:47,450 --> 01:16:53,110
say and he and the the angel stands puts a bush between him and Moses and the

885
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:58,730
statement is that the bush is not being consumed by the angels fire so where's

886
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:03,270
the burning bush in other words the what's actually going on here is he sees

887
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:06,630
a spiritual being that is emitting what looks like fire but that fire does not

888
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:11,070
actually consume something that is combustible so it's a different kind of

889
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:19,150
fire well there's no burning bush where's the burning bush the bush does

890
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:24,310
not get burned obviously that was the point it's just misdirection what you

891
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:30,090
yeah oh I'm going yeah and this is this is pertinent to every subject there's

892
01:17:30,090 --> 01:17:34,770
people out there discussing Noah's Ark and the flood outside of there being

893
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:38,690
some rain and something that floats and some animals none of it is correct

894
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:43,570
none of the discussions none of the scholars there's someone who is touted as

895
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:47,490
the biblical expert on Noah's Ark or flood and you go to their website they

896
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:51,670
tell you it had three levels and you got to just do a double facepalm and say

897
01:17:51,670 --> 01:17:57,250
wow this is really sad because it's quite interesting that when you stood in

898
01:17:57,250 --> 01:18:02,010
the ark you had one floor below and two above you how many floors are there

899
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:06,090
let's say you walk into a building and I say you there's one floor below you and

900
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:11,630
there's two floors above you how many floors in total that would be four yeah

901
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:18,910
I mean we're talking about the most rudimentary basic discussion cannot be

902
01:18:18,910 --> 01:18:22,970
carried because it's all hinged on erroneousness because people are reading

903
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:28,570
in they're not reading out you know this is this is this goes on with pretty much

904
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:33,870
every topic you know so where is you know how is this considered a spiritual

905
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:38,930
is you know mentally or spiritually healthy you know well let's just say

906
01:18:38,930 --> 01:18:43,550
maybe people are really here to be based on stability on food clothing and

907
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:46,810
shelter I've ever heard that being discussed it's all about food clothing

908
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:51,650
and self shelter at this point and that would be the basics of existing and I

909
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:54,890
would say that most people on this planet have not gotten beyond that point

910
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:59,850
food clothing shelter when it comes to matters of thought when it comes to

911
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:06,810
matters of communication they are failing as a society I have a question

912
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:15,350
from the you stream chat here and that is are are the hosts familiar with the

913
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:22,050
scriptural works of Ernest L Martin absolutely I'm not go ahead yeah

914
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:28,030
Ernest L Martin was part of the UCG it was a movement back in the 50s and 60s

915
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:33,790
and I'm not going to be shy or about it but I'll tell you right now they did

916
01:19:33,790 --> 01:19:39,090
some very good work excellent work pioneering work I was very high marks

917
01:19:39,090 --> 01:19:43,730
from the grading point of view their pitfall was essentially greed the greed

918
01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:49,090
there was they didn't have the balls or the cojones or the guts to come out and

919
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:54,430
and blatantly show that Christianity is 100% paganism what they did was they

920
01:19:54,430 --> 01:20:01,990
mixed in the the cultural aspect of what's the cult the Christian era

921
01:20:01,990 --> 01:20:07,510
meaning the world religion right now into their works and that was their

922
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:12,350
biggest problem and and they're always addressing the Christian aspect and

923
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:16,810
there is no Christianity in the Bible biblical text period at all it's only

924
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:22,350
used once by Agrippa as a derogatory term and the word means Messianic or a

925
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:26,650
zealot or revolutionary so what's interesting about Ernest L Martin he's

926
01:20:26,650 --> 01:20:31,010
done some excellent work but you've got to really do shake your head and see how

927
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:35,770
he's directing it obviously from there's some kind of monetary gain you

928
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:43,650
see if you're discussing any religious text if you don't gravitate towards the

929
01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:49,630
religious group that has hijacked that text you will be broke you will not be

930
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:55,370
able to make a dime doing it so in other words if you go out and study scripture

931
01:20:55,370 --> 01:21:00,550
and actually do research to prove that it's historically accurate and do not

932
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:06,710
attach yourself to the human culture known as the human cultural aspect known

933
01:21:06,710 --> 01:21:11,210
as the religious group of Christianity or Judaism which would be the two major

934
01:21:11,210 --> 01:21:17,070
groups that have hijacked that text let's say you will be broke you will not

935
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:20,390
be able to fund anything no one will want to listen to you might have a small

936
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:23,930
little group of people here and there that are doing it because they want

937
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:28,090
clarification on the subject but I assure you no one will buy your stuff no one

938
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:31,670
will give you any money you will be broke you will be eating out of garbage

939
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:37,770
cans right and that is from the secular point of view but from a belief point of

940
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:41,930
view if you're doing the right thing even though it seems to be a bad business

941
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:46,190
decision because you're not accommodating a particular cultural group I believe

942
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:50,670
there's a higher force that will support you and because of that this group that

943
01:21:50,670 --> 01:21:54,890
Ernest Martin was involved in had failed and that's what I know and believe and

944
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:58,950
the reason I'm bringing this up is because it's very good to study their

945
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:04,150
work and other work of others but the problem is they are always stuck on this

946
01:22:04,150 --> 01:22:09,430
Christian aspect of things only because they wanted to support themselves what

947
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:12,750
there's nothing wrong with supporting themselves on that but what would it

948
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:17,730
obviously showed is that they had very little faith in a higher power even

949
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:21,890
though they proclaim to be bringing out accurate information on it that's that's

950
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:25,970
almost like a personal commentary on on Ernest Martin but otherwise he's done

951
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:30,570
very good work just avoid the allegory and comparativeness to what a Christian

952
01:22:30,570 --> 01:22:38,660
should be and you'll be fine with his work hopefully wasn't too harsh yeah

953
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:42,980
yeah he's written a lot of good stuff there are others that are written really

954
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:47,640
good things as well that you that are less popular during that movement that

955
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:53,900
came before him that is there's there's quite a bit of accurate discussion but

956
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:58,560
none of it in one place at all and you will not find it anywhere right now in

957
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:04,240
one place it's all in pieces in other words the kingdom is in pieces it's

958
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:11,080
fractured and part of the end let's say endeavor stuff you and I have discussed

959
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:16,820
it is quite possible to bring forward a very good accurate presentation on what

960
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:23,540
the biblical text is in a neutral positive very accurate way right that

961
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:28,540
will edify humanity and it hasn't done yet but I believe you and I have

962
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:33,180
discussed the formula of it and it's very clear that if anything's going to

963
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:36,780
be brought out into public you must understand the timing there is a timing

964
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:41,360
to do it right and there's a timing to not do it and right now is clearly not

965
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:47,980
the time to do it in as a project as you know bringing it out forward you

966
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:52,740
know what these things mean and how they were meant to be looked at based on

967
01:23:52,740 --> 01:23:57,240
what is in the text itself not what you think it is reading out of it this is

968
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:01,540
still not the time but getting very close getting very close and this is

969
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:06,220
regarding any subject whether it's scientific whether it's legal whether

970
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:13,460
it's biblical medical it is still not the time the let's just say the the the

971
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:20,040
wall of lies that people have been bowing down to as being the the be-all

972
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:23,060
end-all of all of these subjects is starting to fall apart the mortars

973
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:28,940
getting loose and the wall is cracking at this point but to break through the

974
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:33,100
wall to see what any of these subjects are truly about it's not time yet we

975
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:40,120
have discussed the basic parameters of it but not really presenting the truth

976
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:44,520
behind these matters whether it's legal scientific or religious I think we've

977
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:53,900
hinted quite a bit certainly certainly I would say that the method of

978
01:24:53,900 --> 01:25:05,950
communication is something of value in in discussing and but I mean we use

979
01:25:05,950 --> 01:25:10,830
words that's how we communicate thought and regardless of the language if you're

980
01:25:10,830 --> 01:25:18,830
you know looking at something that's old it's good to know how those words were

981
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:25,750
used then and what they meant just as it would be now in you know a technical

982
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:31,310
manual of any sort you know you can increase your knowledge of almost any

983
01:25:31,310 --> 01:25:36,530
subject by familiarizing yourself with the language that is used to describe it

984
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:47,320
be that you know anything anything at all so and it's all communication let's

985
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:51,680
just go back to the biblical text to show you a contrast of why it's not time

986
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:56,460
yet if you look at one of the institutions that's hijacked the concept

987
01:25:56,460 --> 01:26:00,740
of the biblical text is the legal society you go into a courtroom and they

988
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:05,020
still not as much as in the past they ask you to put your hand on a King James

989
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:10,220
Bible and swear right I say you want me to you want me to make an idol out of

990
01:26:10,220 --> 01:26:15,020
this this document here right exactly forbids idolatry and then you want me to

991
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:22,380
swear which this document also forbids very specifically yes go ahead yeah yeah

992
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:26,660
but the point here is this is say well okay so what is this book is it the

993
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:30,160
telephone book what is it a book set a cookbook no no it's the biblical text

994
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:35,680
okay so it's just black ink on white paper bound together that has a specific

995
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:39,520
communication known as the biblical text so it's not the telephone book it's not

996
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:44,580
a recipe you know a book it's not you know Mark Twain or anything like that

997
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:48,500
okay so it's still a communication of the biblical text but okay so if it's

998
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:52,900
about the communication of the information I have it downloaded right

999
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:58,200
here on a thumb drive I think I'm just gonna swear on that instead can I do

1000
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:02,940
that no no no no you can't do that it has to be this particular book so you see

1001
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:09,760
the stupidity of this it's paganism it's the rabbit's foot it's the paganism just

1002
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:14,640
means ignorant right it's the it's a form of low-level magic what's going on

1003
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:19,520
it's just a communication the biblical text it doesn't matter if it's simple I

1004
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:23,680
would reckon people yes it doesn't matter if it's printed on paper or on a

1005
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:27,340
scroll or on a thumb drive or download it on the computer or if you've

1006
01:27:27,340 --> 01:27:31,160
memorized it the thing is what are you getting out of the communication what

1007
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:34,200
are you getting out of the information if the answer is nothing you're close

1008
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:41,760
that's exactly what is going on you see it's like that with anything just let's

1009
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,380
just jump around real quick to medicine you know there's this thing right now I

1010
01:27:44,380 --> 01:27:50,200
call it a form of bioterrorism to terrorize right is to inflict I guess

1011
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:55,040
terror using the same word to define itself or fear on a population right now

1012
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:59,380
the population is under a form of bioterrorism by these by the Institute

1013
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:03,720
the medical and society by something called viruses you know you've heard of

1014
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:09,180
that everything is now caused by a virus and even the most learned people that

1015
01:28:09,180 --> 01:28:11,960
are speaking so I almost I got the flu I must have caught a virus I mean

1016
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:17,060
stupidity is just astounding but you know here's the thing if you go and

1017
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:22,560
research the medical society's works on viruses and very simply you will find

1018
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:26,140
the National Institute of Health and various other there's a corporation

1019
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:30,100
called the CDC and other things like that which people think is actually

1020
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:34,160
government it's not it's like GM General Motors you know it's just a company but

1021
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:38,420
if you go look at all the academic works on this they're very thick documents long

1022
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:44,040
PDFs and you say oh because this is 900 pages they know a lot about viruses but

1023
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:48,440
do me a favor folks go pull up a document on viral research and read the

1024
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:52,280
introduction it'll tell you the purpose of this research is to discover what the

1025
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:57,140
viruses are and they're in their relationship to disease okay now then go

1026
01:28:57,140 --> 01:29:01,420
to the conclusion and they'll tell you that we still don't know what viruses

1027
01:29:01,420 --> 01:29:05,040
are or there's it's inconclusive that they cause disease why the hell would

1028
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:09,920
you read the 900 pages in the middle well the same reason people swear on

1029
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:15,840
the Bible because it's paganism it's ignorance and this is how you're being

1030
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:24,870
ruled and terrorized by the way and by the way demos means terror and crossy

1031
01:29:24,870 --> 01:29:30,650
means to rule by or the state so you're anyway that's another concept right

1032
01:29:30,650 --> 01:29:36,740
there so again regarding the health of the mind or the health of the spirit

1033
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:43,060
could it be that if what's in the mind or the spirit is unfounded or not based

1034
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:47,620
on anything or it's just based on some kind of culture that is descended into

1035
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:51,960
materialism and paganistic practices does that lead to a healthy mind or a

1036
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:56,200
healthy spirit which by the way means the same thing and the answer would be

1037
01:29:56,200 --> 01:30:01,220
no and the question is here are you going to get one that is helpful no

1038
01:30:01,220 --> 01:30:05,400
you're not as a society you will get a little more clarity on these matters

1039
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:10,500
before future events take place and as they're taking place but you will be

1040
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:14,800
other than the few individuals that do the discipline in the work and get

1041
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:20,720
strength in their minds or their spirit will be able to do better just like

1042
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:24,760
people who are not feeling well when they tend to be recovering they say I

1043
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:29,000
need some exercise now get out of bed and walk around and you feel stronger you

1044
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:34,540
know the more weight you can carry the stronger you get and and that is a

1045
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:41,360
level of laziness people don't want to carry things or remember things or learn

1046
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:49,320
things so they remain in a state of weakness so you know the the aspect of

1047
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:55,880
talking about things uncommon might lead back to realizing that things that are

1048
01:30:55,880 --> 01:31:00,680
uncommon are things that are quite obvious if we're going to look at things

1049
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:07,840
as being common well that's fine too what is commonly being done that's okay

1050
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:12,100
we tend to relax and you know want to be part of a group let's say actually you

1051
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:17,560
shouldn't be but anyway if we start to try to validate what the common folks

1052
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:22,500
and what is commonly accepted you will see that it's basically not founded on

1053
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:28,400
anything there is no basis to it or what they tell you it is based on it's really

1054
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:34,200
not so how does that lead to being you know pertinent how can you actually get

1055
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:37,180
things done but apparently you might say Greek things are getting done we're

1056
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:40,920
still building houses we still have boats and planes and trains and we do

1057
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:44,380
all this other stuff yes okay you are getting a lot of things done in quantity

1058
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:48,340
but what about the quality of those things in order to mind the quality of

1059
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:52,940
something you must have a foundation to find out how you can measure and manage

1060
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:58,220
what it's based on in a simple way to look at it as well as looking at the

1061
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:02,340
financial system you know the legal system how can that be measured and

1062
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:06,680
managed if you see what these things are supposedly based on you will find that

1063
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:10,220
they're not in accordance with them at all they are not based on the things

1064
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:15,960
that you believe that they are and that does not lead to a healthy mind or

1065
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:21,200
spirit and it's very simple to to see that and the only thing here would be

1066
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:27,180
the you know is there is there an effort being made and the answer is no you know

1067
01:32:27,180 --> 01:32:35,140
again if we're going to discuss what is uncommon it's very simple the obvious is

1068
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:38,600
uncommon anything that's being discussed anything that's being looked at

1069
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:43,800
has to have a basis in something let's say albeit physical perhaps or material

1070
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:48,900
not always communication could be immaterial or intangible but it still is

1071
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:53,600
very viable it is primary informative to before things happen when a command is

1072
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:57,100
given that is a form of communication and the quality and the direction of

1073
01:32:57,100 --> 01:33:03,220
that command leads into action so you know again the you know how does this

1074
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:09,100
have to do with the mind being in a good state perhaps one can be in a good state

1075
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:14,800
of mind and everything they think they know is fictional or false or a lie you

1076
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,800
know and does that eventually catch up to them that's an interesting point to

1077
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:24,320
discuss as well because it can be easily easily assured that the majority

1078
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:29,920
of humanity has gone from the craved cradle to the grave and pretty much

1079
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:33,740
everything they believe or think exists does not and or pretty much everything

1080
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:38,980
they think they know is a lie ever since they were from the cradle and until they

1081
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:44,280
were an old man or an old woman everything they believe is a lie so how

1082
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:48,900
were they in a healthful condition well one might say well they were pretty

1083
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:52,800
happy all their lives you know even though they died believing you know that

1084
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:56,760
voting mattered and going to church had something to do with the Bible or the

1085
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:02,680
the molten iron core in the earth caused gravity you know I mean yeah they seem

1086
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:06,680
pretty helpful and all that so you know there's there's an aspect to this that's

1087
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:11,080
very subtle and what does that tell you maybe it wasn't meant for them to know or

1088
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:16,380
you know hey they had a pretty happy life I mean there is a lot of old cats

1089
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:20,760
right now on the internet still kicking around selling books doing websites

1090
01:34:20,760 --> 01:34:25,500
being interviewed all over the place and you know people flock to it and say hey

1091
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:28,000
these guys are old they know what they're talking about and I could show

1092
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:31,000
you how they don't anybody could show you how they don't eight-year-old could

1093
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:34,960
in five minutes but everyone still likes it makes them happy so there's an aspect

1094
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:41,800
to happiness and joy that can be pursued that that might might be transcending

1095
01:34:42,540 --> 01:34:48,300
mental health being even though the mental health being based on a lie you

1096
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:53,900
know or not in other words if again someone can go from cradle to grave and

1097
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:56,600
everything they think they know or believe is a complete lie and they could

1098
01:34:56,600 --> 01:35:02,760
lead a pretty happy healthful you know physical life and I assure you that's

1099
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:06,540
the case of most people that have come to this planet and have passed away and

1100
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:09,920
and the old ones that are still around and the young ones but the interesting

1101
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:16,160
part of this discussion is that there are things that people call problems

1102
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:23,420
things they call endeavors things that they consider to be things bigger than

1103
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:28,480
themselves things that they want to establish and have things that come in

1104
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:32,200
the way whether they're legal scientific political or what have you and they view

1105
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:36,240
these things as problems and without these things as probably view problems

1106
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:40,460
along the way that can't be solved or conundrums and the suggestion here to be

1107
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:45,520
made that's uncommon is very simply if you put things in order if a topic is

1108
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:50,440
brought up regardless of what the topic is if you spend a little bit of time to

1109
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:55,640
see if what is being presented in front of you can be validated you will also

1110
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:59,980
find this the source or the root of what you might call a problem to be there as

1111
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:07,800
well okay it's very it's very simple like regardless of what the topic is

1112
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:11,040
let's say religious matters you hear of all these religious groups always

1113
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:14,560
fighting well if you go back and look at what their religions are supposed to be

1114
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:19,020
based on you will find all the texts are very similar and it actually tells you

1115
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:22,800
not to fight but you know if you bring that back to the groups that are

1116
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:27,240
fighting they don't want to see it but they only want to see things that suits

1117
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:32,780
their purpose or drive the same thing with the legal community if you go and

1118
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:38,600
look at any legal societies texts that they supposedly are basing their low laws

1119
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:43,780
codes rules and regulations on them you'll notice that by definition they're

1120
01:36:43,780 --> 01:36:47,420
not doing any of it they're not even familiar with any of it right they're

1121
01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:52,660
only taking a small aspect of it and using it right and same thing with the

1122
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:56,680
scientific community same thing with the politicians as every aspect the

1123
01:36:56,680 --> 01:37:01,360
medical community does the same you know if anyone if you've discussed had

1124
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:06,600
discussions with people that had gone to the medical society for help if it's

1125
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:11,900
not a usual or common problem which you know what's another thing here they

1126
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:16,460
typically all they do is subscribe prescribe painkillers and antibiotics

1127
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:20,800
and if they don't want to acknowledge what you have they tell you you have

1128
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:26,620
some kind of unknown virus so again they're not really looking into what

1129
01:37:26,620 --> 01:37:31,600
their studies are based on I had once gone to a dental technician or

1130
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:36,040
practitioner also known as a dentist doctor and I wanted something done and I

1131
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:40,700
researched it and when I approached him how I wanted it done he said wow Greek I

1132
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:45,420
haven't heard that in 20 years since I was in medical school I said okay so

1133
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:49,300
you're not familiar with this procedure I guess I am I haven't heard of that in

1134
01:37:49,300 --> 01:37:52,980
20 years and I said okay so how many of these procedures have you done in the

1135
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:57,140
past 20 years says thousands of them I said when you mean you haven't really

1136
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:03,640
gone back and looked at how it should be done properly I guess not this is the

1137
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:11,760
level of existence of humanity at this point I think we have set back as well we

1138
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:20,580
do have set back as well excellent so again uncommon is just the idea is to

1139
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:25,080
just pretty much if you hear about something just investigate and you know

1140
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:31,800
there's there's any good did you share any any links to photographs of viruses

1141
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:38,480
yeah there no such thing by the way yeah you'll never find a photograph of one

1142
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:44,540
you'll find a computer graphic right yeah yeah you'll you'll find a color

1143
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:49,900
enhanced image of a damaged cell yeah broken mitochondria perhaps the smallest

1144
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:56,320
of the smallest aspect of the cell probably be the mitochondria yeah yeah

1145
01:38:56,320 --> 01:38:59,260
it's just and what's interesting by the way since you brought up viruses again

1146
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:04,560
if you look it up in any capacity the initial definition is a virology is a

1147
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:08,580
branch of toxicology and all of toxicology has to deal with things that

1148
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:16,420
emit through or by the liver so yeah there's there's a beauty in it you know

1149
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:20,360
even with discussing words Seth you know when I bring up a word and I said you

1150
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:23,160
know you use the word nice you know to people I said you know what that means

1151
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:26,460
yeah I know what it means I said no it doesn't really mean that according to

1152
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:29,620
the reference material well what does it mean then I usually tell them to look it

1153
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:33,700
up themselves the reason why is it seems like when they look it up themselves it

1154
01:39:33,700 --> 01:39:39,320
seems to have about 70 or 80 percent more impact on them as if you know it

1155
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:42,780
has to be done that way you know so you have to be kind of inefficient with

1156
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:47,760
spreading information because people are still locked into the shock value of

1157
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:53,320
seeing it for themselves which is actually appropriate as well you see you

1158
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:56,580
know I rather have people yeah look it up and read it recently I was on a

1159
01:39:57,500 --> 01:40:00,960
private call and they were discussing something about the academics this and

1160
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,880
academics that I said would you please go to an etymological dictionary and

1161
01:40:05,540 --> 01:40:09,760
they're like why and I said well do you would you just you know fulfill that

1162
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:14,040
request for me just for a moment and they did and I said put academic into

1163
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:18,480
the search box and I said okay why am I doing this I said because you'll see in

1164
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:22,920
a moment I said read the definition and use the

1165
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:29,240
terms they said oh my god is that what it means and I said yep that's what it

1166
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:36,000
means and they're like holy crap I've been using that word wrong along that

1167
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:40,480
thing academic means it's not doesn't mean anything good and I'm like yep

1168
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:44,480
that's right would you believe would you have believed me if I would have told

1169
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:52,740
you and they said no there you go absolutely and part of what we're trying

1170
01:40:52,740 --> 01:41:01,020
to do here is in part a sense of perhaps let's just say the more you the

1171
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:03,940
more weight you can carry the stronger you are just like an elephant you know

1172
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:06,580
why are elephants known for their strength well they inherently carry a

1173
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:11,280
lot of weight on their own anyway right you know so the more weight you could

1174
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:14,260
carry the stronger you will be anyone that goes to the gym will tell you that

1175
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:17,680
you know and which which is also also what I'd like to bring back since we

1176
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:21,260
were discussing mental or spiritual health how many times do you still hear

1177
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:26,380
on the alternative media being banded around oh that's all fear porn that's

1178
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:29,780
fear-based man you know these are the same people that tell you that you know

1179
01:41:29,780 --> 01:41:33,840
it's your intent love and light and your intention actually means something you

1180
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:39,460
know but but anyway this whole thing about fear so yeah that's fear it's bad

1181
01:41:39,460 --> 01:41:43,980
I'm like okay let's just look at this a little closely now well if fear like

1182
01:41:43,980 --> 01:41:49,040
love and other things exist within society are we to run away and avoid it

1183
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:53,100
or is it something that could be handled properly and efficiently and

1184
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:58,100
effectively and I would say the second part is true if you fear disabled by fear

1185
01:41:58,100 --> 01:42:03,780
if you feel disabled by fear that means that you lack spiritual or mental

1186
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:09,020
fortitude or strength and also you lack skill those are the two components that

1187
01:42:09,020 --> 01:42:16,100
are required loosely termed to deal with what is called fear and I've used this

1188
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:21,720
analogy before Seth if I could go do it one more time like for example if you

1189
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:26,840
do not know how to operate a dishrag or a mop you're in total fear of a glass of

1190
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:33,160
milk spilling over right but if you're in the presence or of someone or if you

1191
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:38,380
yourself know how to operate a dishrag or a mop and a glass of milk spills over

1192
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:45,460
well you then go into your skill set of operating a dishrag in a mop and you

1193
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:49,840
clean it up and the person who doesn't have that skill set is totally terrified

1194
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:56,820
and you're like don't worry dude it's just spilled milk right right so so the

1195
01:42:56,820 --> 01:43:00,900
lack of skill and the laziness of lack of skill in these matters also builds

1196
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:04,660
doesn't build but does the opposite atrophies the mind and atrophies the

1197
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:10,460
spirit and they get weaker and weaker and weaker so from one aspect the fear

1198
01:43:10,460 --> 01:43:14,660
aspect is disabling and weakening but it's actually those that are commenting

1199
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:22,460
on the fear that are promoting it you see so if you are disabled by fear or

1200
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:27,260
fearful of fear it means that you are weak minded weak spirited same thing and

1201
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:32,460
lack skill it's just again the alternative media how many times have

1202
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:36,480
you turned into an alternative media venue and the first thing they start

1203
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:42,500
talking about is what Fox News and CNN or the news of the day which shows me that

1204
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:47,720
there is a continuous thread that goes through the entire society whether it's

1205
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:53,280
mainstream or alternative it's the same stuff you know at one point I put a

1206
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:56,840
comment and I when it when our microphones gonna cost a million bucks I

1207
01:43:56,840 --> 01:44:02,200
think that's the best way to stop the nonsense right because then anyway so

1208
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:06,860
anyway if microphones cost a million bucks that'd be fewer people on the

1209
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:12,440
internet so any that's another comment there I guess you know bullets should

1210
01:44:12,440 --> 01:44:16,300
cost a million bucks right I think there's a little bumper thing on this

1211
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:20,500
tip yeah it's not the gun so it's the same thing so this is the thing is about

1212
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:24,360
this fear the other thing I hear a lot about still is the Federal Reserve being

1213
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:28,940
harped on nonsense you know Federal Reserve is just accommodating you the

1214
01:44:28,940 --> 01:44:33,260
petrochemical companies are just accommodating you the corporations oh

1215
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:37,620
no did you Seth did you know that there are evil corporations or corporations are

1216
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:41,920
bad did you know that Seth oh gosh man I've been listening to a lot of people

1217
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:46,280
talk about how bad corporations are did you know that gosh I didn't know that

1218
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:51,540
man I mean the position part of the corporation or not but yeah yeah this is

1219
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:56,880
just ridiculous you point yeah but they they they all love it like you know

1220
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:59,800
here's here's a deep dig and everyone's talking about the Federal Reserve is so

1221
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:04,880
bad but they love the PayPal I don't care where I don't care how I get it as

1222
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:08,560
long as I go to the store and get something for it but Federal Reserve is

1223
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:17,480
bad oh man you know it's it's not yeah it's not very good state because no one

1224
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:21,900
is really looking into it now here's the point when something runs you know that

1225
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:25,080
there's the horse running out of the barn yeah you know you have the horse in

1226
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:28,200
the barn you know you could deal with it if it runs out of the barn you got it

1227
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:32,220
you could still deal with the horse it just takes more effort right but what

1228
01:45:32,220 --> 01:45:36,440
happens if the horse has run out of the barn broken its leg was shot in the head

1229
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:41,000
and is in the glue factory what are the chances of getting that horse back

1230
01:45:42,540 --> 01:45:46,240
relatively slim yeah and that's the state of affairs of humanity right now

1231
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:49,700
but on the other hand we always kind of talk about what's coming in the future

1232
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:53,200
because yes folks we know the future and so do you if you put a little time into

1233
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:56,960
it what's coming in the future now is a series of events that are going to

1234
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:04,100
proceed before let's say come before you get what you have coming to you as a

1235
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:07,700
society and that will be a perfect society on this planet yes no war

1236
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:11,540
prosperity Liberty Liberty just means time off from the things you have

1237
01:46:11,540 --> 01:46:15,880
commitments to it's coming and it's right around the corner next decade

1238
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:20,200
you're going to be experiencing the bastion of perfection and it will be

1239
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:24,220
promised to you as lasting for a thousand years and you're all gonna buy

1240
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:27,800
into it yes you are all of you and you know who all of you are if you're

1241
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:32,060
listening to me and that is the great deception because it's only gonna last

1242
01:46:32,060 --> 01:46:39,520
for a short time so these things must happen but as a group as a society

1243
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:43,300
you're not you're not faring well and you're not going to do well and that's

1244
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:46,020
very easy to see I mean there's lots of people telling you you're going to do

1245
01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:48,920
better and there's lots of people telling you you're going to give doom

1246
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:53,740
and gloom but I assure you none of them are giving you any specifics on how none

1247
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:57,660
of them it's the same as going to a car mechanic to have the car fixed you tell

1248
01:46:57,660 --> 01:47:00,820
them what's wrong with it and before you leave you give them the keys and the

1249
01:47:00,820 --> 01:47:04,080
mechanic turns around and says to you by the way where is the steering wheel

1250
01:47:04,080 --> 01:47:09,380
and everyone says oh it's right there in the middle see ya whoa whoa whoa wait a

1251
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:12,380
second you're telling me you brought the car to a mechanic and he doesn't know

1252
01:47:12,380 --> 01:47:17,040
where the steering wheel is how do you think the rest of it's gonna go you're

1253
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:23,140
being had folks so this is part of what's being uncommon yes everyone on the

1254
01:47:23,140 --> 01:47:27,060
alternative media everyone in the mainstream when I say everyone I mean

1255
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:32,420
statistically 99.9999999 percent there probably there's probably someone out

1256
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:36,240
there saying something that we haven't heard of yet there's a small group of

1257
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:42,160
people that have mastery in their fields like we suggested Frank Chester you know

1258
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:47,700
there's a couple of more here and there but there's nothing going on folks the

1259
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:52,000
lights are on and nobody's home well the lights are on and everybody's home but

1260
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:57,220
