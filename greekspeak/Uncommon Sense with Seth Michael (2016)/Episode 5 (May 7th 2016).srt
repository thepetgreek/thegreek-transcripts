00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,310
Greetings once again and welcome to Uncommon Sense with The Greek and Seth Michael, when Seth

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:11,890
Michael can make it. And hello everyone. You can find us at AFR, which if you are listening to me,

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:18,730
you are probably on AFR at the moment, or on UStream, which could be found at uncommonradio.com.

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:27,430
That would be www.uncommonradio.com, and you will see the appropriate places to click on to listen

5
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:34,310
to this stream, whether it's AFR, American Freedom Radio, or on UStream. Now, being on

6
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:40,350
American Freedom Radio, of course, this is a, let's just say, listener-sponsored venue, and

7
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:47,770
without you guys, there is no AFR, so you know what to do. You should be able to figure that

8
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:53,930
out by now. On the homepage, you will see there is a way to contribute. So again, hello everyone,

9
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:59,950
and this is Uncommon Sense, and why are we doing the show? Why are we calling it Uncommon Sense?

10
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:05,770
Simply because we don't want to be common. Well, what is that? You know, why are we discussing

11
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,330
things that are uncommon if we don't want to be common, and who's we? And why do we want to be

12
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:16,750
uncommon? Well, you know, let's just say it this way. You know, sometimes I've been in discussions

13
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:23,070
with people, and they bring up the Greek philosophers, and the great religions of the

14
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:29,550
world, or science, or in scientific advancement, and all this other stuff, and I have to say,

15
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:36,130
hold on, hold on, hold on. Okay, if this stuff is so good, all right, it's so great, and such a

16
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:42,830
wonderful achievement, how has it served us? How has it served mankind? How has it served society?

17
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:53,330
Not well, has it? So maybe an examination about what people are noticing or calling with prestige

18
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:59,530
to be so wonderful is not so wonderful at all, maybe because it's commonly accepted to be such.

19
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,510
Anyway, speaking of uncommon, anyone know what day it is today? Yeah, if you're on that thing

20
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:10,250
called the Pope's work schedule, known as the calendar, yep, yeah, probably lost all the

21
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,430
audience right now, just by saying what day it is. Yeah, but there's about four or five listeners

22
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,990
out there that kind of know what talking about. You know, you can't keep time with that thing

23
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:25,970
called a calendar. And I keep repeating the same thing over and over. Why can't you keep time with

24
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,850
it? Well, very simply, you ever notice how if you kind of acknowledge a day on that thing,

25
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,190
comes on a different day of the week every year. But anyway, enough said about that. But

26
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:39,890
if those of you are interested, kind of reckoning it's the third moon or the third month, and it's

27
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:46,130
roughly around the 18th day because it's past noon here, it might be the 17th day where you're at.

28
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:54,050
But roughly, I'm saying it's perhaps around 17 or 18. Close enough. And, you know, one of the

29
00:02:54,050 --> 00:03:00,310
topics that can come up at this time of the year for this part of the world is springtime,

30
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:06,990
kind of dedicated a couple of hours more than a few, few four hours or so previous to springtime

31
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:12,410
thoughts. And what's interesting, again, about what's manifested in the spring is quietness,

32
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:18,010
except for the baby lambs that are running around, maybe with a little fledgling birds

33
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:25,550
and things like that. It's a time of quiet. And one little bit of heads up to folks,

34
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:32,510
you know, speaking of quiet and the opposite might be noise. You know, wherever the noise is,

35
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:39,270
by the way, is where the distraction is. Okay, the real stuff is going on where it's quiet.

36
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:47,790
You ever walk through a forest, or go deep sea diving, or in any of the completely, let's say,

37
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,910
engrossed natural environments, you'll see there's a lot of quiet. That's where all the growth takes

38
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:58,410
place. When you're sleeping, and the body grows and recovers, it's pretty quiet and you demand

39
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:06,010
quiet. In other words, formative energies, things that form things and grow are quiet.

40
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:13,250
So from a social point of view, because typically most people that tune into things like this,

41
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,870
basically broadcasts or sonic events, are interested in social things, social commentary,

42
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,930
telling them what to think. I remember being much younger one time, someone said,

43
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,910
don't read Time magazine, because it tells you what to think. And I kind of kept that in the

44
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:36,030
back of the mind. And I wondered, isn't everyone trying to figure out a way to find something

45
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,150
that's going to or someone else that's going to tell them how and what to think. I was kind of

46
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:46,230
found that interesting. But people kind of tune into these various media formats. So they could be

47
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:51,250
told what to say, but well, not necessarily what to say, but how to think, you know, they have a

48
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:58,430
certain amount of energy to dedicate to learning things that are quote, unquote, new. And not only

49
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:07,710
are they partaking in various formats, written, internet, sonic, visual, as in video, and they

50
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,170
look at what's called the news, and they got television shows and radio shows and alternative

51
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:18,410
media shows called the news. Yes, they're just shows. And very often they get noisy. You know,

52
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:24,010
you have people discussing things in a way, look here, look there, you know, and this is not where

53
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:32,010
it's at. The real stuff is happening where it's quiet. You know, so again, we don't want to

54
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:38,190
necessarily lean to social commentary and things that are about society. But this is, for example,

55
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:44,910
a sonic event like this, or why people do tune in is to hear about social things. You know, there are

56
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:50,450
some ideas about perhaps doing a cooking show or discussing how the body works and how other

57
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:56,290
things might work in certain specificity. But typically, people are curious about social

58
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:01,790
things. And which brings me to perhaps a comment I had a listener contact me, and

59
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:08,330
thankfully, to the Greek, he said, I had some people in the Jehovah's Witness protection program

60
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:14,710
come and knock on the door. And they kind of left bewildered scratching their head based on things

61
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,450
that I heard you say that I used on them. And I was like, Well, okay, well, thanks for letting me

62
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:24,470
know. And I was wondering what he had said that had never really come across in the message. But

63
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:32,430
what's interesting is perhaps it was interesting experience because he said the people in the

64
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,950
Jehovah's Witness protection program kind of walked away, scratching their head. So it might have

65
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:43,330
been maybe something uncommon. What's interesting about this when you interact with people that

66
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:48,110
join certain groups, well, albeit a quote, unquote, religious group, because that term is not being

67
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:54,910
used properly. But let's say a religious group, or political group or any other group, what have you,

68
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:02,690
there is something called the crowd mentality, which I like to refer to by a book written by

69
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:09,610
a man named Gustav Le Bon, L-E-B-O-N, at the end of the 19th century. All right, well,

70
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:15,490
hello, everyone. I don't know how, how I managed to do that. Apologies.

71
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,580
Says he's busy, he might still be on the call.

72
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:33,960
Okay, am I? Can you guys hear me? Yes. I just got word. Great. I just got word that,

73
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:44,320
for some reason, I dropped or was lost. Okay. So we are live. Great. Okay. Great. I just took a look

74
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,000
at chat real quick. So yeah, okay. So just maybe I'll do a recap. I don't know for how long I was

75
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,920
gone. But it was pretty much discussing and welcome, Seth, by the way. I was kind of discussing

76
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:06,280
just general social sentiments towards media, because people go to media, to hear things that

77
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,980
are socially based, you know, they might go to a cooking show or how to fix your car or whatever,

78
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,940
listen to music, you know, private interests, but generally, their public interests, you know,

79
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:21,380
in large interests, that people attend certain forms of media or all forms of media. Right.

80
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:27,360
So it kind of brought it brought that point up. And in order to understand, perhaps maybe

81
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,380
where one can come from, from an uncommon point of view, is typically people are discussing

82
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:42,940
things with prestige, oh, the wonderful nature of the great philosophers, or the true meaning of

83
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:48,280
these religions, or how wonderful and advanced scientific research is, you know, and I'm like,

84
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:52,880
well, hold on a second. Okay, well, that sounds real good. But you know, how well is that served

85
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:59,080
society, all that stuff that you guys think is so great? Right? How is it served? Has it served

86
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:07,860
as well? I would say not. And it's still commonly discussed, as if it's something wonderful.

87
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:14,100
So and just kind of tying that in, I'm reckoning roughly, it's the third week of the third month,

88
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,720
to put it loosely. You know, and of course, right there, we're going to lose pretty much anyone who's

89
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:25,100
tuning in, except for four or five people that have realized that you can't keep time with the

90
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:33,680
Pope's work schedule. And, yeah, I wanted to also bring up, you know, again, why people tune in,

91
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:40,480
you know, it's for social things for to hear about what they've been, what they're being

92
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,740
told is going on. So they know how to think about it, right? Even things that they that are far

93
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,520
reaching and far away from their personal location. So I think it's interesting how,

94
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:58,220
how, how the how and why people tune into, let's say, even, you know, what we're doing,

95
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:04,100
or what anyone else is doing, or that show called the news, you know, and maybe giving a little bit

96
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:10,360
of a truer perspective. But not based on truthism, by the way, because by the way, folks,

97
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,920
this word truth has been hijacked. And anyone who uses it is highly suspect at this point.

98
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,540
So when I say anyone, I mean, generally, you have something called the truth movement,

99
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:30,880
and it's really truthism. It's, yeah, it's, you know, billions of billions are served,

100
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:37,540
right was the golden arches and billions, billions, yes, are served. Yes, with this truthism.

101
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:45,320
So yes, you're not going to do well. So with that kind of stuff. So yeah, I like going back to

102
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:54,220
Gustav Le Bon's The Crowd. And because that is a I would say it's a good ref, objective referencing,

103
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,880
let's just put it that way. You know, if it's objective, and it's rational, and it's clearly

104
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:07,500
communicated, and well defined and accurate, why not write stuff? Absolutely. And, you know,

105
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:14,640
I want to just discuss something regarding the crowd every time I come on, and I was thinking,

106
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:20,240
instead of doing that, that there's a fellow on YouTube who put together a synopsis of the book,

107
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,060
and he did a really good job. So it's going to play a few minutes of that maybe three minutes or so.

108
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,420
But I wanted to bring up also a listener, I don't know if this came out through the air earlier,

109
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,600
who kind of thanked the Greek, he said, Well, thanks, you know, I had some people in the

110
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,140
Jehovah's Witness Protection Program come and knock on the door. And I discussed some of the

111
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,460
things I've heard on common sense, and they walked away scratching their head. And I just

112
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,160
wanted to bring that up. I don't know what he said. But, you know, listen, folks, just just

113
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,460
by the very virtue that the letter J was invented around 500 years ago is a good way to kind of keep

114
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,720
the chronology accurate. You know what I mean? Right. Yeah. And names, by the way, are exempt

115
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,520
from language, right? So Seth, right. If you were to move to China, and they wrote your name in the

116
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:10,780
Chinese script, if anyone that just only spoke Chinese read that script, it should sound like

117
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:18,000
Seth. You know, that's correct. Yes. So regardless of what the name is, or the sound when it's

118
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,460
communicated, it should retain that sonic character or quality to convey that communication.

119
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,740
It's, you know, I had someone once said, Well, that's my Chinese name. I'm like,

120
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,420
well, okay, that's accurate. But that's not your name and written in Chinese. That is the in other

121
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:39,500
words, you have been renamed, you know, so. So, yeah, my favorite is a woman. It was an Asian

122
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:44,960
woman or Chinese woman that worked in a food establishment. And she had a name tag Jane,

123
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:50,840
J-A-N-E. And I'm like, that can't be your real name. You know, she barely spoke in English.

124
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,760
And she says, Well, my name is Tsane. So phonetically, it'd be T-S-A-N-E. And I was

125
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:03,860
like, wow, that's a really good phonetic approach. So Jane and Tsane, her name being Tsane in Chinese,

126
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:10,560
and Jane is really a very good, so a good phonetic approach like that is still retains a good amount

127
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:21,120
of precision and accuracy. So it can be pulled off. Yeah. So maybe should we go right into the

128
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:26,440
audio perhaps that I've just queued up about Gustave Le Bon? What do you think,

129
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:36,250
Saf? Any other thoughts on that? Or should we just go ahead? Okay, so with that said,

130
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:44,330
let's give it a roll. Yeah, let's do the audio. I kind of hope it comes through well. And this is

131
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:50,210
just to give a little bit of credit on this. This is on YouTube. Man, I feel smarter already. I

132
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:57,830
watched two YouTubes today. It's the channel, the channel is Academy of Ideas. And the thing is,

133
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,110
you know, when people ask me, I said, Go look it up on the internet, go do a video, because

134
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:06,930
sight and sound, you know, you show me and tell me, you know, works well. So it's called the

135
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:11,690
channel's Academy of Ideas. And it's Gustave Le Bon, the nature of crowds. And let's see,

136
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,710
we're going to start it at the 59 second mark, we're going to run it to about four minutes,

137
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:21,390
four and a half or so. And it's Gustave Le Bon, the nature of crowds on YouTube. So if anyone wants

138
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,950
to hear the complete synopsis, or that was put together by this gentleman, it's around eight

139
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,290
minutes, 41 seconds, I'm going to be starting at around the one minute mark going to about four.

140
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:36,030
So enjoy, folks. In this video, we will provide a summary of Le Bon's classic work. In particular,

141
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:41,210
we will investigate his insights into the nature of crowds, look at the role ideas play in

142
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:46,490
influencing crowds, examine the religious sentiment of crowds, and discuss the psychological

143
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:53,170
and emotional benefits one derives from joining a crowd. What is a crowd? Le Bon defined a crowd

144
00:15:53,170 --> 00:16:00,270
as a group of individuals united by a common idea, belief or ideology. The idea which unites

145
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:05,830
a crowd is not chosen by a process of clear reasoning and examination of evidence. Instead,

146
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:10,950
as we will discuss in more detail later, crowds accept beliefs and ideas superficially

147
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:16,170
and utilize them as fuel for revolutionary action. All right, I'm going to pause right there.

148
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:22,430
Seth, isn't that interesting? No evidence required, right? So all right, let's continue.

149
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:27,950
When an individual becomes part of a crowd, according to Le Bon, he undergoes a profound

150
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:35,150
psychological transformation. That is, he ceases to operate as an individual. He is no longer himself

151
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:41,030
but has become an automaton who has ceased to be guided by his will. With such a psychological

152
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:47,170
transformation, an individual no longer lives for himself but instead becomes a pawn who sacrifices

153
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:53,290
his own personal ends and goals in favor of those of the crowd. In a crowd, every sentiment and act

154
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:59,210
is contagious and contagious to such a degree that an individual readily sacrifices his personal

155
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:04,710
interest to the collective interest. As was mentioned earlier, Le Bon maintained that a

156
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:09,910
crowd forms when an influential idea unites a number of individuals and propels them to act

157
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:15,810
towards a common goal. These influential ideas, however, are never created by members of the crowd.

158
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,849
Instead, they are brought into the world by the minds of great individuals.

159
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:26,369
Since those who compose a crowd are by their very nature mediocre, they are incapable of

160
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:32,050
understanding these ideas in their original form. Therefore, in order for an idea to unite

161
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:39,970
and influence a crowd, it must first be thoroughly simplified. Ideas being only accessible to crowds

162
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:45,590
after having assumed a very simple shape must often undergo the most thoroughgoing transformations to

163
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:50,450
become popular. It is especially when we are dealing with somewhat lofty philosophical or

164
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:56,050
scientific ideas that we see how far-reaching are the modifications they require in order to

165
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:01,370
lower them to the level of the intelligence of crowds. However great or true an idea may have

166
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:06,910
been to begin with, it is deprived of almost all that which constituted its elevation and its

167
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:12,670
greatness by the mere fact that it has come within the intellectual range of crowds and exerts an

168
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:19,620
influence upon them. For example, a great philosopher could extol the nature of liberty

169
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:25,700
in an 800-page masterpiece. However, the crowd, incapable of comprehending such thoughts,

170
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:30,720
would require the concept of liberty to be thoroughly simplified in order for it to

171
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,740
stimulate revolutionary action. Le Bon proposed that this is where leaders come in, for it is

172
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:42,100
the leader of a crowd who communicates simplified ideas to the crowd and in doing so unites it

173
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:48,920
together and stimulates it to act. The majority of men, especially among the masses, do not possess

174
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:54,500
clear and reasoned ideas on any subject whatever outside their own specialty. The leader serves them

175
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:00,940
as guide. In the modern day, one can see how invigorated and rejuvenated crowds become when

176
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,740
they hear a leader pronounce that a cause is being fought in the name of freedom, peace, or

177
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,680
prosperity. Once these words are proclaimed, the members of the crowd nod their head in blind

178
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,660
obedience to whatever else follows from the leader's mouth, completely ignorant as to the

179
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,320
corrupt purposes that may be the true guide for the leader's actions. As Le Bon wrote,

180
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,700
How numerous are the crowds that have heroically faced death for beliefs,

181
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,480
ideas, and phrases that they scarcely understood.

182
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:35,820
Okay, we'll leave it at that. And how many times have you folks heard the ideas evoked in this

183
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:43,160
past three minutes of this fellow on this YouTube that I just played, repeated, let's say within the

184
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:53,830
but not being brought forward. You see the concepts of, let's do this, let's do that. And the actual

185
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:59,870
people that are partaking in these groups have no real perception of the depth of the

186
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:05,810
statements being made, or the concepts behind. And just tying that back to the fellow who had

187
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:11,430
communicated that some people from the Jehovah's Witness Protection Program came to the door,

188
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:16,430
and he spoke to them uncommonly, and they walked away scratching their head. I think I responded

189
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,590
something like maybe they should have been scratching more than their head. But

190
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:26,550
nonetheless, whether you're looking at a group as such, or any group, folks, whether they're

191
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:35,590
activists, whether they're reformists, political groups, religious groups, as such, you will find

192
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:45,190
the followers of these causes and crowds are pretty much adorned with the most superficial

193
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:54,310
and what you say, unfounded aspect of the reality of the formation of the crowd or the cause of the

194
00:20:54,310 --> 00:21:00,810
crowd. So I think there was a statement once about if you want to learn about voting,

195
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:08,570
have a five minute discussion with a voter. So and you'll figure that out. The same with all

196
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:14,170
these things. There's a lot of stuff going on right now that people think is new, but it's being

197
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:23,330
done in the same old way. And there's no objectivity that's employed by the crowd, other than being in

198
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:29,250
the crowd. You know, if I Yeah, I was gonna say there are hints in language as well, specifically,

199
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:37,490
rhetorical language or the rhetoric, which I guess is kind of redundant. But just like,

200
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:45,570
how often do you hear the word revolution being used? And that, that in and of itself, just the

201
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:51,470
word, you know, it means to, you know, spin around, it would imply a cyclical movement,

202
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:58,070
you know, a movement. Yeah, a movement in a in a circle. So you're going to get absolutely nothing

203
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:04,230
new from a revolution, you can you can look at history, and see, you know, see the effects of

204
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:11,410
the many different types of revolutions. Things may appear to be different from the starting point

205
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:16,570
on the circle that you're that you're starting from, but you're essentially just moving, moving

206
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:21,430
around in a circle. So if you would like a revolution, stand up, spin around, sit back

207
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:28,170
down there, you have, you've taken part in a revolution, and it will get you it's, it's less

208
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:33,970
likely to get you injured. Well, no, actually, it could get you, it could get you wrapped around

209
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:40,890
the axle, man. That is very possible. Yes. And also, when I said RPM, I kind of meant revolutions

210
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:49,130
per millennia. Yeah. Think about that for a minute. Yeah. Social revolution, political revolution,

211
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:56,650
activism. Yeah. I have some yeast packets, you know, for baking, you know, leaven. And it says

212
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:01,470
active, you know, activism, every time I see it, you know, I want to I want to do one of these

213
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,710
parody shirts. You know, I've got activism right here. Yeah.

214
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:13,410
Fermenting revolution. Fermenting. Yeah. Yeah. So when you hear these activists or

215
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:18,230
reformists or political commentators, and it branches off, by the way, into the

216
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:23,950
what you say, quote unquote, scientism, astrophysicism,

217
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:33,890
quackademia ism, economic ism. Yeah, and it's just right now, what's being put out wholesale

218
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:41,830
to society, whether it's macro or micro, it's just still using this same structure,

219
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:48,450
where can we say stuff like we've been saying for a long time? It's debased as well. Yeah,

220
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:58,220
absolutely. There is the basis for the even the ideas in, you know, that are espoused by

221
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:07,140
those that would consider themselves political revolutionaries. The you hear a lot of catchwords

222
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,680
and catchphrases and things that get your attention and are, you know, designed by the

223
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:17,440
people who originally espoused such ideas to elicit emotional reactions, because people don't

224
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:24,180
think as clearly when they are emotional. And when you get people, you know, that agree and tell you

225
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:38,580
that, yes, you're right, and things like that, then it's it it adds a a fake basis, a ground

226
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:45,880
of sand to stand upon, made up of many, many little rocks, rocks we don't generally think of

227
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:54,260
as being, you know, intelligent. And the smaller they are, the less, the less useful they are for

228
00:24:54,260 --> 00:25:01,200
the foundation, be it of a building or of thought. So, yeah, I wanted to go into,

229
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:09,420
you just evoked something that we commonly do in the uncommon sense venue here. By the way,

230
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,160
while you were speaking, it kind of jumped out and it's a we kind of try to dispel a cliche.

231
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:20,020
And maybe we'll display to cliche dispel two of them. Because they tend to be like a spell,

232
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:26,220
by the way, these cliches, you know, you know, like, you know, what came for you how people are

233
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,700
coaxed into thinking there's any value in the paradoxical quality of certain things, like,

234
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:39,340
for example, what came first, the chicken or the egg? Chicken? Yeah, the rooster and actually the

235
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:46,240
chicken farmer, because the chicken as it's known today is heavily domesticated and bred to be as

236
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,440
such. Right. But nonetheless, it's the the animal itself came first, because there are very various

237
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,360
animals that produce eggs. And because people are sort of coaxed into believing that this is

238
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,060
an accepted paradox, they tend to believe it. Also, that's another part of the crowd mentality,

239
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:08,900
where the emperor has no clothes is another part of the crowd mentality, a lot of the biblical

240
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:14,860
cliches. And the thing that brought this concept to mind was when you were mentioning building on

241
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:19,500
sand. And what's interesting is, you know, there's just paraphrasing here. There's a cliche

242
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:26,780
that, you know, who can build a tower on sand and will it stand right now, most people think that

243
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,140
people would go out when you hear that cliche is like, you know, when you're on the beach,

244
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:35,180
not necessarily like a sandcastle where the tide comes in, but just loose ground that you build on.

245
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,520
And then you come back and you have something that might look like the Leaning Tower of Pisa

246
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:45,800
or worse, right? Right. What's interesting when you study when this was written, places of study,

247
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,500
I think that we've mentioned before ancient libraries, there was reading out loud, there

248
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:56,640
was no silent reading. And I'm going to kind of go around the block on this concept here,

249
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:00,720
and we'll tie it back together. So if you were to visit an ancient library, you would pick up your

250
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,020
reading material and you would be if you were alone, you would be seated at a booth and you

251
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,580
would close the door and you would read out loud. So if you walk into a library, you hear all this

252
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:14,860
murmuring and rumble of everyone reading things out loud, even if you're in your personal space,

253
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,500
alone, you would be reading it out loud. That's why very interesting if you watch an old film

254
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:25,940
where someone opens a letter and they're reading it out loud. You might think it's for theatrical

255
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:34,740
or film purposes, but it's actually quite accurate to do so from that era, let's say 500

256
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:41,400
years prior. Now, other than that, when people had gathered, let's say in a conference room,

257
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:47,160
they have these whiteboards or blackboards or chalkboards. They had them as well. But what

258
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:53,620
they had also produced was things called these sandboxes. So they would have a table that you

259
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:58,000
would sit at and it had a large sandbox and you would have a pointer or a stick. And when you had

260
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,100
an idea, or if this was an engineering topic, you would actually draw out what you wanted to build

261
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:11,320
in the sand. It was like a sandbox on the table. And people would take notes on things called

262
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:19,540
Pinaxes or Pinax. It would be like a small piece of slate that you carried in a purse or a bag

263
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:30,080
and you would use a form of chalk or soapstone, like a white soapstone type thing to mark it.

264
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,260
Right. So it would be more indelible than just plain chalk. And by the way, these little

265
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:41,660
miniature Pinaxes that were used back then resembled the tablets of today. You know, those

266
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:47,320
five by eight or seven more, you know, they call them like 10 inch tablets or tablets. Yeah. So

267
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:53,620
it's really interesting when you look at that. It's a revival and no one is making the connection

268
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:58,460
because they don't know about these things in the past. So just to go back around the block here,

269
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:05,100
when the tower who can build the tower on sand is not necessarily on one hand, yes, you don't want

270
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:10,440
to build it on an unstable ground. But it also means that you have to take action because once

271
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:19,220
the tower is designed or its idea is incepted on the sandbox, right? It needs it needs further

272
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,380
action. You know, in other words, if you look at, let's say, the biblical cliche on that it states,

273
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:29,140
do you have the wherewithal to build it? Right. No one sets out. Why should you even set out

274
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:34,100
designing it if you're if you do not comprehend how are you going to get the wherewithal to build

275
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:40,680
it? Right. Is an interesting thing. So I just wanted to throw that in as a little tidbit of

276
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:49,360
uncommon history that people could look into the sandboxes that were used to draw on and also the

277
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,820
Pinax tablets that people used to carry around to take notes. If you look at what's called the

278
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:00,000
New Testament, there's several areas there where the scribes had when the Christ was speaking,

279
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:07,960
they had pulled out their little Pinaxes and had written on them what he was saying. And

280
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,920
even today, a board that one writes on in Greek is known as the Pinakos.

281
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:20,180
So that's one of the cliches, perhaps that is not necessarily dispelled, but perhaps we gave a

282
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:26,580
little more background into maybe we could say. So the thing that I want to dispel is someone

283
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:34,540
had once sent me recently, not too recently, but let's say recently, a made me aware of a group

284
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:38,780
that was supposedly discussing things biblical and historical in that in that text. And I said,

285
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,900
well, they're not really that accurate. Some of their points seem to be on point. And so I

286
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:50,580
are accurate, but they tend to have fallen away. And let me just throw this out. When you approach

287
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:57,260
any of these divine writs, if you put too much energy into them, too much zeal, and you focus

288
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:02,680
on just one thing, you will be rewarded with distraction, and you will be spun off. And then

289
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:10,820
you will be focusing on things that are not even in the text. I'm just going to repeat that for a

290
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:19,320
you will be rewarded with distraction. Is there a is there a mechanism here, either in thought or in?

291
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:27,260
Yes, greed and gluttony. A lot of people, a lot of people jump into a bit of information and try

292
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:35,900
to reveal it, which may be truth to help society. If anyone that embarks, by the way, and this is

293
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:42,440
might sound dogmatic, but it's too bad if it does. If you figure something out, and whether it's in

294
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:48,680
a discovery, materialistic, mechanistic, or spiritual, or whatever concept, an idea,

295
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,660
and you start promoting it heavily, as being the answer to saving the world, you will be rewarded

296
00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:02,640
with should we call them rewards, you will be sent down a path that will ultimately lead to

297
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:10,080
your destruction, if not physical, at least destructive causes. If you look at anyone

298
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,080
throughout society that says this will save the world, or we have to make the world a better place,

299
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:20,320
if they push the issue, they will be quickly stomped down. Sometimes not necessarily quickly,

300
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:25,700
it's not because of the malevolent forces, but also the benevolent forces. And we've discussed

301
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,240
this in some detail, we might pick it up in the future again. But just to go back to what this

302
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:37,460
information was regarding things biblical, this person had sent me this. And one of the comments

303
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,400
on the comments of what these people were saying, because we're speaking about the return of a

304
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,240
certain biblical figure known as the Christ, and the comment was, was no one can really know.

305
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,640
So this guy's full of crap. Now, what they do is they typically cite a verse in Matthew,

306
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:57,600
which is no one knows the day or the hour. Right? Well, that has nothing to do with his return. If

307
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,900
you look it up, I believe it's in what's called Matthew 24 area of Matthew 2426. Something like

308
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:08,100
that, I believe, I'm just paraphrasing in that area. If you look at when the Christ is asked,

309
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,640
and he says, well, people tend to extract that and say, well, no one knows the day of the hour,

310
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:18,480
they think it has to do with the return of a biblical character, it has nothing to do as such.

311
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:23,120
It has to do with the question that is asked prior that he is answering with that answer,

312
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:28,020
which is when will the earth and the sun and the heavens wither away or go away,

313
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:36,480
or wear out, and he says, no one knows the day or the hour. It's regarding the entropic

314
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:44,520
wearing away of the heavenly bodies. Isn't that interesting? Has this ever been brought up to you

315
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:49,740
personally, Seth, by the way, in context? I mean, no. Sometimes you and I can have a personal

316
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:54,980
discussion or private discussion on air. Everyone can just. Well, in day and hour, day and hour are

317
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:02,660
relatively specific as well. Yes. Apply the week or the week or the year. Yeah. Or the month. Yeah.

318
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:07,100
Or the month. Yeah. But the whole point is it doesn't even have anything to do with what people

319
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:16,360
think it does. Right. And it's seemingly tying that back in with the crowd audio clip that

320
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:24,900
was played. It ties in perfectly again. What I'd like to just say with that is that pretty much

321
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:31,280
anything and everything that I'm seeing right now, mainstream or alternative, is really following that

322
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:40,480
crowd outline. As you know, not to be overreaching, but it is quite accurate to say that that's spot

323
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:47,300
on. You know, the other point I wanted to bring up today is the other. Well, actually, the two

324
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:53,620
points. One was the crowd. And if anyone wants to look into it, of course they can. Gustave Le Bon.

325
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,900
But the other two things I wanted to bring up, which are large subjects or how people are addicted

326
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:07,080
to really low quality stuff as a general rule, as a general consensus, as a general application,

327
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:12,480
wholesale application, not necessarily specific because there are still some quality

328
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:20,160
things in the world. But the general majority of the people at large are addicted to low quality

329
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,720
stuff. Again, we mentioned what is it that was we could say golden arches, billions and billions

330
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:33,340
served. Right. Even having a conversation about that earlier, actually. Yes. And then a lot of

331
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:40,020
cheap goods at low prices, you know, which are actually, you know, fine with a couple, a lot of

332
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,460
sayings about what happens when you buy things that are cheap at a low price. You know. So,

333
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:52,240
yeah, this whole thing, also the information that's being put out. It's like the low hanging

334
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:59,860
fruit. That's it's not only low hanging fruit. It's just rotten. It's just decaying. It's past

335
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:04,840
its freshness, way past its freshness. But, you know, you could say that about the quality. But

336
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,660
and then, of course, within that quality would be there's no accuracy, no precision, and there's

337
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:16,120
actually no truth, even though it's expounded by those that are part of the truthism movement.

338
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:23,900
So these things are not necessarily frustrating, but it's just interesting to discuss. Not too

339
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:28,120
much, because if you want evidence of it, just tune in anywhere and everywhere, whether it's

340
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:32,800
mainstream or alternative, and you will see what we had just brought up, quality of a low ranking

341
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:40,040
or low quality addiction to stuff. And it seems like the less accurate, less precise and the

342
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:45,640
lower the quality of the information, the more subscribers you get and the more donations you get

343
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:52,240
and the more people discuss it. You got to be really excited about it, too. Yeah. And it tends

344
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:59,660
to create excitement as well. You can you can yell at people. You can. Not that they shouldn't be

345
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:05,780
yelled at. They should be. Yeah. But maybe with with some maybe with something with some substance

346
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:11,760
behind it. Yeah. And the other thing I wanted to bring up are the concept of the pranksters. Now,

347
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,940
like, what's a prankster? You know, well, it's interesting. I haven't looked it up etymologically,

348
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:22,300
but I think at one point I meant to do harm or against the will of another or something like

349
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:28,940
that. And when I when I say the pranksters, I'm talking about a third of you wholesale humanity

350
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:33,460
that are partaking in this and the other third are supporting it. And the other third are just

351
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:39,100
scratching their head, wondering what the hell is going on, either poised to be victimized by it,

352
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:44,820
because when I say victimized, yes, because there are spiritual entities behind it. And what I mean

353
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:50,260
by the pranksters are your entitled classes, you know, like your legal society, your medical

354
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:57,120
society, your political society, your scientific society. Even those offering services are

355
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:03,660
pranksters, you know, like car mechanics tend to be pranksters as well. You know. Yeah. And not

356
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:08,080
to actually put them down as a group. But, you know, there's once I saw a thing where they took

357
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:13,240
a car to be fixed and they were charged several hundred to replace a part and they did not replace

358
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:19,080
the part and they had to put like a secret marking on it. You know, this is not to get off

359
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:25,740
as a car mechanic. But let me to bring us back to the word prankster. It comes from prank and stir.

360
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:36,620
It stirs a suffix one who does. Yeah. But prank is a ludicrous trick. 1520s of uncertain origin,

361
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:43,900
perhaps related to obsolete verb prank, just decorate or dress up from the mid 15th century

362
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:50,980
related to the middle low German prank, which is to display or display a comparer,

363
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:58,640
also Dutch pranken, German pranken to make show or to strut. And the verb in the modern

364
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:08,160
sense is also from the 1520s. So a ludicrous trick is from decorate or dress up.

365
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:14,610
There's there's the etymology. What about the thumbtack on the seat?

366
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:20,090
Yeah, that would be. Well, let's see what's ludicrous.

367
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:35,350
Also spoke of spells earlier just before we get too far away from it. And that's one of those

368
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:41,310
words that's interesting because it means exactly what it says. We all spell. Right.

369
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:54,530
And words have, you know, there is I don't know if power is the right the right word to describe

370
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:58,850
what it is that words have. But there is a lot that can be done with them,

371
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:03,610
obviously, from giving someone direction and having that direction carried out. You know,

372
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:10,330
that's one very obvious, you know, use or power that words have.

373
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:10,770
Like sand.

374
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,010
Like, yes, absolutely.

375
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,870
Like sand on the sand table.

376
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:20,050
That's right. And if you throw enough of them into a bag, you have a makeshift weapon, right?

377
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:31,210
Enough grains of sand, enough words, right? Yeah. Quantity is certainly not greater than

378
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:35,910
quality in power as far as that goes.

379
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:44,770
Just to interject, folks, don't be impressed by large numbers because this is how the cosmos works.

380
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:50,430
The formative beings that created everything like big numbers, the cells in your body,

381
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:53,630
the cells and the atoms and the molecules in the room.

382
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,230
Yeah, pie.

383
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:56,950
Sample.

384
00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:01,110
Look up at the sky at a clear night. They like big numbers.

385
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:05,110
Don't be impressed by them. The numbers are not large to impress you.

386
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,950
They're there because that's how things are done.

387
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:14,210
But when we speak about quality and quote, unquote, truth and things of this matter,

388
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,910
that we're actually directing it towards the very few, like four or five people

389
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:21,030
on the planet, maybe, you know, really stuff we can get into a discussion,

390
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,110
which is very short in the future.

391
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:25,410
They're about 7000, which is the one out of the million deal.

392
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,690
You know, 7 billion or so.

393
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:33,550
Don't be impressed by 7 billion people on the planet and you have to save anyone

394
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:37,770
or get anything different to happen because there's more than that.

395
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:42,690
More, more cells than that in your body, perhaps, or who knows, right?

396
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,770
Or molecules in the room.

397
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:47,310
Don't be impressed by 7 billion at all.

398
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:52,550
There's always been a very few and there will always be a very few for the interim.

399
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,070
Let's say for this interim.

400
00:41:55,410 --> 00:42:00,010
So, yeah, the pranksters and let me just can I give an example regarding pranking

401
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:02,330
and the legal society, by the way, I'm just going to throw this in.

402
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:06,570
I was listening to a recorded court conversation yesterday,

403
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,670
and this was from a federal court case.

404
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:12,710
And without giving what the case was about, the person who had made the defense,

405
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:19,230
the victim, the defendant showed clearly how the prosecution was way out of bounds

406
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,650
and unfounded with their charges.

407
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,310
But the prosecution couldn't address that.

408
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:26,490
All they could say was, well, he had signed a plea.

409
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:29,490
And according to the plea agreement, he could not appeal it.

410
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:34,150
And because he got he agreed to a plea, he received a benefit.

411
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,670
So now he's operating under a benefit.

412
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:43,110
So this is pure pranking, you know, what you what you see in here,

413
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:47,370
this the same thing with the medical society, you know.

414
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:52,950
Well, you know, you agreed, you know, you came to me, you know, for it.

415
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:57,350
You know, you were given a list of the side effects, you know,

416
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:00,130
even though it's like one point font, right?

417
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:04,830
And, you know, the scientific community is pranking you folks.

418
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:06,170
Pretty, pretty good, too.

419
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,790
I mean, we don't need to get into how they're doing it.

420
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:12,610
But I mean, just I think I gave the example last week of how

421
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:16,190
alleged the alleged magnetic field of the earth is caused by molten iron.

422
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,050
Go look up how magnetic molten iron is.

423
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,030
It's not, folks.

424
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:24,730
Curie point is way below that means where it loses its magnetism.

425
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,090
So you're being pranked all around.

426
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:30,670
Now, when you combine that concept of being

427
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:33,910
would you say people are being led by pranksters?

428
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:34,830
I would say they are.

429
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:39,030
I will say certainly putting on a show.

430
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:40,010
Yeah.

431
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:41,830
And the pranks, are they harmful?

432
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:44,950
Yes, because, for example, going back to what the legal society did

433
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:48,670
to this individual, they had him in the can in jail.

434
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:52,290
They said, if you don't sign this, we're going to keep you in here for 20 years.

435
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:54,710
So they use threatened arrest.

436
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:57,570
The same with the medical society.

437
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:02,470
I've seen certain medical technicians and they say, well, legally,

438
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:07,390
I can't tell you, you know what to do, you know, regarding that treatment.

439
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:10,490
But I legally I can tell you this, which tells me that the legal society

440
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,350
controls medical society.

441
00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:17,350
And also I have run into an attorney or someone who worked like as a

442
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:21,130
paralegal type that was editing scientific textbooks.

443
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:24,310
And I said, well, what the hell do you know about scientific textbooks?

444
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:24,870
As I don't.

445
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:28,070
And he was part of the editing department.

446
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:34,550
So anyway, the level of pranking, the same if you look at what they call people

447
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:39,270
sitting at the pulpit or people that have degrees of divinity, degrees.

448
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:43,950
I mean, you go and you just bring up a five year old, let's say an eight year old.

449
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:45,970
Let's give him that because five year old would be too humiliating.

450
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:47,890
Let's say an eight to 12 year old.

451
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:53,210
Bring to anyone who has a degree in or speaks from the pulpit of any religion,

452
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:57,290
by the way, anything in the text that they allegedly subscribe to and what

453
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:59,730
they immediately shy away and say, well, see, it doesn't matter.

454
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:01,910
It's what you believe in.

455
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,550
It really that stuff doesn't matter.

456
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:07,930
You know, so pranksters, again, in the religious community.

457
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:13,770
And by the way, spiritually, the pranksters or socially from the cosmic perspective,

458
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:18,290
the pranksters in the religious using that term in air quotes, for example,

459
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:23,090
community are going to be held at higher regard than mass murderers also, by the way,

460
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:30,010
because a mass murderer is not taking up directly the representation of a spiritual being

461
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:34,330
where the religious culprits are.

462
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:38,090
So, yeah, folks, so I had an email question.

463
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:42,610
What happens to someone, for example, in terms of judgment, you know,

464
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,790
like a Mother Teresa versus an Adolf Hitler?

465
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:49,310
I just answered that question, I think.

466
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:50,590
So anyway.

467
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:58,150
Yeah, the three aspects of combining the elements of Gustav Le Bon's The Crowd,

468
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:03,630
humanity's wholesale addiction to low quality stuff, let's say stuff.

469
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:06,750
You kind of look up what that word stuff means.

470
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:10,550
Kind of it sounds it sounds good.

471
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:14,270
And it's got it's one of those phonetic words like slush or fluff or stuff.

472
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:17,230
Stuff to furnish with.

473
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:20,350
By the way, this is on Adam online.

474
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:25,530
Stuff a verb to furnish with goods, provisions or reinforce or troops to pad,

475
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:30,430
upholster, fill out from a stuff, a toffee or a toffee or a toffee.

476
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:37,250
Probably also part of stuff to fill, create a cram full fill with food, drink or gorge

477
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:40,650
to clog with padding.

478
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:41,950
Interesting.

479
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:42,710
Cookery sense.

480
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:44,670
OK, so yeah, it's to furnish with.

481
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:46,270
OK, so it's a verb.

482
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:47,050
Yeah.

483
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:50,390
And the noun is quilted material worn under chain mail.

484
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:51,230
Interesting.

485
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:54,790
Under chain mail.

486
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:59,110
So I wonder if it's so specific that it's quilted material worn under chain mail,

487
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:01,170
because chain mail is a form of armor, let's say, right?

488
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:07,810
Chain mail, meaning like armoring, you know, not like that, not as a chain or.

489
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,190
You keep going with that when it gets better.

490
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:15,950
OK, to equip or stock with, according to French sources from old high German stuff

491
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:21,350
fun to plug stuff or or from related Frankish where to stop.

492
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,490
But strong objections to this.

493
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:24,810
OK.

494
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:25,210
All right.

495
00:47:25,290 --> 00:47:30,250
OED has strong sense extended to material for working within various trades.

496
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:36,650
Matter of an unspecified kind, meaning narcotic dope drug is attested 1929.

497
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:37,230
The stuff.

498
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:37,510
OK.

499
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:39,710
Slang to no one's stuff.

500
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:43,350
Have a grasp on the subject recorded from 1927.

501
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:46,890
And by the way, since we're going on a little etymological tip here.

502
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,950
How many times have you ever heard of?

503
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:53,770
Someone saying I'm an academic, you should listen to me.

504
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:56,550
They don't say this directly, but I'm an academic, right?

505
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,410
So it's prestigious, right?

506
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:02,770
By the way, English professor or not an English major.

507
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:05,030
I'm sorry, not English professor, but an English major.

508
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:09,950
Let me know that he was an English major the other day in conversation

509
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:14,910
because I started talking to him about words and his I can quote him.

510
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:17,470
Did you know that you're talking to an English major?

511
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:19,750
Did he say academic club?

512
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:21,430
He did not say academic.

513
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:22,370
He was that was.

514
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:23,490
Yeah, where I was going with that.

515
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:27,570
That was what he said to imply that I asked him if he knew what the word nice meant.

516
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:28,950
He did not.

517
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:30,270
No, of course.

518
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:34,070
Yeah, because, you know, the more education you get, it's kind of here's another prank.

519
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:35,690
The education system is a prank.

520
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:40,050
Anyone that's gotten more than eighth grade education in the public or private school

521
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:45,830
system has you could generally say has suffered almost what could be known as irreparable damage.

522
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:50,750
And it would probably take you more than double the amount of time to clear yourself of it.

523
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:54,950
And then you have these people that actually progress through beyond the eighth grade and

524
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:59,670
are proud to say that they have gone to undergraduate graduate studies.

525
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:01,410
It's a prank, folks.

526
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,150
You've been pranked these.

527
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:06,810
And by the way, we're going to read the definition of the term academic.

528
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:12,730
And if you think this has any prestige to it, and we're going to tell you it doesn't.

529
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:14,230
And now that I've told you, it doesn't.

530
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:19,310
If you have the look on your face like a baby seal right before it gets clubbed.

531
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:20,170
Well, here it comes.

532
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:27,850
Relating academic on the item online relating to an academy collegiate scholarly from Latin

533
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:33,650
academic us or the or of the academy from academia, meaning you're ready.

534
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:34,570
Here it comes.

535
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:38,890
Theoretical, not practical, not leading to a decision.

536
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:45,150
So for all you academics out there, sorry to hear it.

537
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:48,050
Well, I'm not I shouldn't be sorry because I didn't make them do it.

538
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:54,070
But talk about wholesale low ranking addiction and pranking.

539
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:54,970
Oh, man.

540
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:55,970
And the crowd.

541
00:49:56,470 --> 00:50:01,790
Oh, how many times have you heard in public someone say, well, this person or especially

542
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:07,210
guests that are introduced as having these high degrees and things like that as being

543
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:07,930
something good?

544
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:11,330
I mean, talk about the crowd mentality.

545
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:11,910
Yeah.

546
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:13,210
Oh, this guy is.

547
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:17,390
I was on a recent discussion saying, well, I talk to people are from MIT.

548
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:18,770
I'm like, I mean, morons in training.

549
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:29,090
But anyway, so the idea of the of the low ranking wholesale, low quality addiction, the

550
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:34,510
pranksters and the crowd mentality all thrown together is an uncommon way to view what the

551
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,010
common existence is about.

552
00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:40,530
Yeah, let's repeat that for a moment.

553
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:44,910
Most people have a common existence, even in their timekeeping.

554
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:49,830
I think B.C. is before common era and a right and Anno Domini and all these things.

555
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:52,390
The work schedule that they're on is even common.

556
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:59,870
It's based on the crowd mentality, the addiction to low quality stuff and also being led by

557
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:03,590
pranksters and the pranksters you will find in your entitled classes.

558
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:11,230
You know, which which is not difficult to surmise in summary that they are pranking

559
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:16,790
you, because if you approach anyone that's a specialist, a publicly specialist and that's

560
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:21,130
part of a society that's known as such, they're simply pranking you.

561
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:28,070
So, you know, people are going out discussing, how are we going to fix the world?

562
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:33,970
And how many times have you heard it based on some religious group, right, or some evil

563
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:34,610
oligarch?

564
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:36,130
Right.

565
00:51:37,410 --> 00:51:42,110
I assure you that even if those groups did not exist, you would still be subject to the

566
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:46,970
crowd mentality and addiction to low quality stuff and the pranksters.

567
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:49,910
So at this point, you know.

568
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:55,970
This I could surmise and say this is an uncommon commentary on what is common.

569
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,910
Now, if that didn't lose most of the people, I don't know what will.

570
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:02,830
But Seth, you still with us?

571
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:04,970
I did not lose me.

572
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:05,870
I'm still here.

573
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:06,850
Okay, great.

574
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:14,770
I would say that's a very accurate, broad brush stroke of the common reality.

575
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:20,470
Those three aspects, the crowd mentality, again, the addiction to low quality stuff

576
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,190
and being ruled by pranksters.

577
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:27,070
Taking a little pause there, let it settle in for the five listeners we have.

578
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:29,430
But nonetheless, yeah.

579
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:31,750
All right.

580
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:33,150
So we've covered the pranksters.

581
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:35,690
Somewhat, somewhat.

582
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:40,030
Yeah, yeah, it's the aspect of the the pranking.

583
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:45,350
Did we mention also when I say, well, somewhat we yeah, we covered them broad brush in general

584
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:48,690
point of view, but there's so much specifics that could be gone into, right?

585
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:54,050
We didn't mention the financial society or the current, you know, what they call financing

586
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:56,190
that higher society.

587
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,290
They're pranksters also.

588
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:03,490
In the there's another way of looking at it, and it involves just a little bit of etymology,

589
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:04,070
I suppose.

590
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:07,650
But we're currently all aspects of society.

591
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:13,930
You mentioned it earlier that, you know, medical textbooks are edited by attorneys, by lawyers.

592
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:16,150
Here comes our music.

593
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:18,670
Yeah, we'll get into that after the break.

594
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:20,070
Yes, Uncommon Sense.

595
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:21,210
We'll be back in a few folks.

596
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:23,850
Greetings and welcome back to Uncommon Sense.

597
00:53:24,510 --> 00:53:25,110
Hello, Seth.

598
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:26,230
Are you with us?

599
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:29,350
OK, and Seth will be joining us momentarily.

600
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:33,410
And we were discussing just before the break.

601
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:35,430
What were we discussing, Seth?

602
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:42,930
We were discussing the society or at least the society that we're all experiencing right now

603
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:49,050
wholesale that we've been talking a little bit about pranksters and how we are.

604
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:53,190
Let's say that those that lead us, whether we're being ruled by them is

605
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:55,570
another another matter.

606
00:53:55,790 --> 00:54:00,570
But certainly those who are leading us currently or at least pretending to or

607
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:04,310
have that pretension are pranksters.

608
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:05,770
Pretty much.

609
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:10,030
To illustrate that a little bit further, I figured you had mentioned earlier in the conversation

610
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:15,330
medical textbooks and how they can tell you some things legally and legally.

611
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:20,610
They can't tell you some things and that their textbooks and their operations,

612
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:25,110
what they can and cannot do is dictated to them by attorneys, by lawyers.

613
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:31,150
And that's just medical textbooks, certainly, but not just medical textbooks.

614
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:37,630
All textbooks, all textbooks are are edited by lawyers.

615
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:39,610
They must pass through that.

616
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:41,430
That's that's how things get published.

617
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:47,090
I would go further than that and say just about anything that is published

618
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:54,250
for mass market distribution has some level of editing done by

619
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:58,990
legal staff, attorneys, lawyers, et cetera, not just books.

620
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:06,730
What we can say to each other in conversation, what we can wear,

621
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:12,010
what we can eat, what we are told is healthy, what we are told is unhealthy,

622
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:17,370
what we how we are allowed to travel, where we are allowed to travel.

623
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:22,430
All of these things, all of these things are dictated, enforced by varying agencies.

624
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:27,350
But the dictates all come from attorneys, from lawyers.

625
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:31,090
There's a word for that in another language.

626
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:37,850
That most of you will be familiar with on one level or another.

627
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,050
And that's how she done.

628
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:41,070
That's the word.

629
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:44,490
That's that's where in English we get the word Satan.

630
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:51,630
The originally in the language that we take it from the Hebrew,

631
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:55,530
or at least what is healthy and it's as well today.

632
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:56,750
Yeah.

633
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:00,570
Is is how she done the adversary?

634
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:01,030
Yeah.

635
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:01,410
Yeah.

636
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:07,490
The hawk being the and shut down being where we get the word Satan, which just means adversary.

637
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:12,710
And there are a few passages where it is specifically referring to

638
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:18,930
a particular adversary, but it is used in the text often to denote any adversary.

639
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:27,690
And so in in the courts, in in Hebrew speaking countries, Israel,

640
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:35,590
they they refer to the the lawyers on either side of any case is how she done as the Satan.

641
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:38,570
And we're currently so you can take that.

642
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:46,550
And very, very literally, we are currently living in a society in a society that is ruled

643
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:51,430
and governed by the Satan's hashtag on.

644
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:52,810
Yeah, no, it's interesting.

645
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:58,570
Just to comment on the ridiculousness of what one can call information gathering

646
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:01,210
is there's a lot of people more in the alternative.

647
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:04,210
Actually, I don't hear it much on the mainstream other than in Hollywood,

648
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:08,590
dubbing people Satanists because they have revived

649
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:13,410
certain minor deities from the ancient world of Egypt and Canaan.

650
00:57:14,910 --> 00:57:17,370
These people are not Satanists.

651
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:20,250
They're simply it's actually in a lot of their temples.

652
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:25,150
They use the name of the ancient dark lord or deity that they have revived.

653
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:28,690
You know, but because of the crowd mentality,

654
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:34,870
you have people that come out and say this is satanic or yes, it is adversarial,

655
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:37,670
you know, but but they call them Satanists.

656
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:40,710
What's interesting about that is, again,

657
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:46,090
it's the addiction to low quality communication or low quality information.

658
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:52,770
And the crowd mentality, but but here's the thing, you know, earlier, Seth to mention

659
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:57,490
how I mentioned one third of the humanity right now are clearly in the prankster mode.

660
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:00,870
The other third are clearly supporting them and the other third is waiting

661
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:04,370
pretty much are subject to it as well.

662
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:08,610
What's interesting is a lot of the people that are actually coming out

663
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:15,490
trying to make commentary on Satanists and all the bad ruling oligarchs,

664
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:18,330
you know, and, oh, corporations, you know,

665
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:22,210
they are actually taking on the form of pranksters themselves.

666
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:26,730
The activists, the what would you call them?

667
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:31,190
People coming out and trying to discuss these matters to inform society

668
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:37,910
and the alternative community are actually taking on the the characteristic of a prankster,

669
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:41,990
because I've noticed very often if you try to approach,

670
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:46,030
which many of them are approachable in the alternative community, let's just say,

671
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:48,290
regarding the accuracy of their statements,

672
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:52,450
they take on immediately the typical defense that a prankster does,

673
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:57,730
which is immediately try to reduce the information to the level of opinion

674
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:03,010
or discredit or discount the validity of it, even though anyone can see it.

675
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:07,650
So I just wanted to throw that in there necessarily as a dig to the alternative media community,

676
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:09,970
because it's not they don't need.

677
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:15,790
I mean, anyway, there's an old there's an old saying about a fool being presumptive,

678
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:19,390
you know, that it's not proven that they are such until they start speaking.

679
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:26,030
But nonetheless, we also wanted to bring up the point that

680
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:31,830
when people do use that term, what it really means.

681
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:37,050
And I think, Seth, it doesn't really mean anything sometimes to bring up

682
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:41,310
what something really means, because it makes their whole venue go away.

683
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:45,470
You know, venue, you know, meaning whether they have websites about it

684
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:48,930
or they get a lot of hits on YouTube, man, you know,

685
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:51,690
I think YouTube will pay a thousand bucks for a million hits.

686
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:56,610
So, yeah, you're really putting out a lot of rubbish information for pennies.

687
00:59:56,770 --> 01:00:00,690
But but but nonetheless, you know who you are out there.

688
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:08,470
Pretty much. Well, anyway, the whole idea to bring forward things about

689
01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:14,170
that are being discussed with precision and accuracy will not only make you unpopular,

690
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:18,850
not only will you have no listenership other than four or five people.

691
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,990
But but the thing is, I believe it's something that should be done.

692
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:28,970
And when I say I believe in it, meaning that if we bring up the definition of whatever,

693
01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:35,370
we're using a good reference that will not only hold as its definition currently,

694
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:40,070
but it did hold its definition in the past, but also will hold that definition in the future.

695
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:44,970
So these things tend to be unpopular and that's why it's called uncommon sense.

696
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:49,710
So Seth, I also brought up the concept of

697
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:54,230
the economic society or the finance society as being pranksters.

698
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:59,350
You know, the other day I was listening to someone saying that they were

699
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:04,690
concerned about money being transferred and the banking or financial institution

700
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:10,870
was delaying the transfer of the funds. And I just had to laugh my ass off, as they say,

701
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:18,790
you know, because banks cannot transfer money any more than electronically or by wire any more

702
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,430
than you can transfer a tuna fish sandwich by wire.

703
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:30,770
You know, this is still part of the addiction to the low quality thought

704
01:01:31,630 --> 01:01:38,550
by put on to the crowd by the pranksters and the people in the media, alternative and mainstream,

705
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:44,290
are still parroting this information as well as the information about making the world a better

706
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:49,630
place. How are they going to make the world better when they're rank and floating well

707
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:54,490
above their heads? They're way below the waterline in junk quality information.

708
01:01:55,130 --> 01:02:04,390
So, and of course, locked into the crowd mentality. There is no solution within

709
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:10,070
what is being put out right now, wholesale across the board, mainstream or alternative,

710
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:16,590
other than the suggestion would be to set yourself apart from it. There's nothing wrong with being

711
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:20,470
familiar with the ridiculousness that's being expounded out there or being put out.

712
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:29,250
But other than being familiar with it, being the familiar out, maybe too much coffee,

713
01:02:29,350 --> 01:02:34,470
I can't say that word, being familiar with it is there's no value in it at this point.

714
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:43,210
The only solution that can be granted would be to set yourself apart from it and focus on

715
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:50,050
food, clothing and shelter as being of the highest quality you want to afford.

716
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:56,210
And on the information side, if you had a filter for what is inaccurate,

717
01:02:56,830 --> 01:03:01,410
you would pretty much go to any venue at the moment and it would be silent. It would pretty

718
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:09,270
much filter out everything that you're listening to, except for the or is or basic terms like that.

719
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:14,270
Again, just to tie that back into something that's very important, which is the economic

720
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:22,590
society or the finance society is not only paramount in the prankster explanation of how

721
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:29,030
society is being governed or provided with, but the people that are supposedly giving out good

722
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:35,230
information are also subject to it. Why? Because I had heard an individual discussing that there

723
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:41,530
was perhaps potential controversy because the banking institution was delaying the transfer

724
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:48,670
or the wire transfer of money. So there is no such thing, by the way. And this would lead

725
01:03:48,670 --> 01:03:53,670
into a discussion of how the economic system works. And I've been threatening that for a while,

726
01:03:54,090 --> 01:04:00,930
discussing how finances or how the credit based economy really works. But Seth, I hear an echo

727
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:07,150
on your apologies, but it's OK. But nonetheless, it's just a threat at this point,

728
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:13,970
because it's so simple. It's almost in the sub sensible realm, because when you discuss the

729
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:20,830
credit based economy, people all of a sudden think, oh, we're discussing finance. It's debt based.

730
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:25,790
It's debt based. There is no debt if the credit is not based on any substance.

731
01:04:26,990 --> 01:04:35,630
So you're not given something on an IOU, folks. Yeah, debt is based upon something and their

732
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:41,830
debt being the lack of something and that something is nothing.

733
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:46,390
And yeah, there is there is no debt. A hundred percent. A hundred times zero is still

734
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:53,090
zero. Correct. So but the thing is, when people but the thing is, again,

735
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:58,610
let me just do this is not to condescend, but I'm going to just say it anyway. If we're not

736
01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:02,090
Seth, did you know that if we're not putting out low quality information,

737
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:04,910
we're not going to get any listeners? Did you know that? I do.

738
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:10,050
If we put out high quality information, we lose the listenership in general.

739
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:16,530
Statistically, yeah, there might be one one or two left. Someone I mean,

740
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:19,570
someone's bound to turn it and tune in on accident. So.

741
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:25,810
Yeah, there's got to be four or five, which I would suggest. It seems to be consistent.

742
01:05:26,030 --> 01:05:33,090
There's four or five people out there that can stomach, you know, the idea of quality

743
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:37,990
information, not not because we are putting it out that it's quality. It's that we are putting

744
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:43,710
out quality information not to tout anything and not to be arrogant about it, not to condescend

745
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:51,770
or anything. But if someone drives up in a Ferrari, that is a quality car, regardless of who

746
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:59,350
is behind the wheel. You see, fortunately and unfortunately, let me just this might get us

747
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:03,030
in trouble somehow, but I might just say this is the only place that I know of that puts out

748
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:08,390
quality information bar none that I've run into. There's got to be others as well, but I haven't

749
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:13,890
run into them. Hence, then, maybe the indirect necessity to do what we call in common sense.

750
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:18,190
But just to tie it back to threatening to discuss how the economic system works,

751
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:23,470
let's just do it in tidbits. I think we'd bring up the economic side of things every time we meet

752
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:28,850
here. But let's just say this. I'm going to say it a few times here in different ways,

753
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:37,110
maybe the same way. Financial institutions do not wire money. They cannot wire money any more

754
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:43,190
than a restaurant can wire you a tuna fish sandwich or a steak or a pizza or a vegan salad.

755
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:47,950
Think about that for a moment. Actually, don't think about it. You'll get yourself

756
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:53,270
into a lot of trouble. But listen to what is being said here. Financial institutions

757
01:06:53,270 --> 01:07:01,790
cannot wire money, do not wire money, period. Just think about that for a moment.

758
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:07,750
Well, what the heck is going on? We'll discuss that in the future. But you have to keep in mind

759
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:14,290
anything economic is going to be discussed based on the definitions provided on what is known as

760
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:19,830
a credit based economy. And of course, no one wants to look at that, right? Just like no one

761
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:24,490
wants to look at anything anymore. Actually, you do want to look at things if they're low quality

762
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:30,310
and they're based within the thought process known as the crowd mentality that has been put out by

763
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:37,710
pranksters. Think about that for a moment. Well, it makes sense. And the fact that if

764
01:07:37,710 --> 01:07:44,870
you've ever tried to find the foundations of thought or ideas that are currently taken for

765
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:52,770
granted as being accurate by different groups and individuals, and then you start to realize that

766
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:58,710
the foundations aren't really there to be found, if you'll forgive the overuse of the word found.

767
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:07,710
But then it kind of makes sense like, oh, I get it because it's all a prank. It's all a show.

768
01:08:08,370 --> 01:08:14,170
And everyone has just found their part to play. And those that are confused about things

769
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:25,410
have just not found their part to play. Well, the thing about the show is those on stage are

770
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:33,890
lying and those in the audience are swearing to it. You have a man sawing a woman in half on stage

771
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:38,689
and putting her back together and all the people in the audience will swear that they saw that happen.

772
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:46,050
You see this on how information is being dispensed. But you know, you have to realize,

773
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:52,490
though, from a single point of view, that the material aspect of the body, you know, the carnal

774
01:08:52,490 --> 01:09:02,729
flesh, toes, head, blood, breathing, that carnal side enjoys emotional stimulus. Right?

775
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:10,010
You know, there's no reason to be a robot. There's emotions for a reason. It ties in with

776
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:17,109
the biological functions quite well. And they tune in and if they hear information,

777
01:09:17,649 --> 01:09:22,529
that gives them stimulus. In other words, they can they recognize the information because they

778
01:09:22,529 --> 01:09:27,109
have heard it from memory. They recognize it because it's in their memory of something they've

779
01:09:27,109 --> 01:09:33,710
heard prior. Like, for example, radioactive material, you know, oh, that's bad. That's bad.

780
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:37,870
Okay. And then they will gravitate towards listening to hours of tripe that is completely

781
01:09:37,870 --> 01:09:44,609
inaccurate. Or they will hear about, oh, some very wealthy oligarchs are going to destroy mankind.

782
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:49,729
And they from memory bring up and recall they heard something about that before and they fall

783
01:09:49,729 --> 01:09:55,290
into it and they feel emotionally charged by listening to the low quality imparting of

784
01:09:55,290 --> 01:10:01,630
information again regarding that subject. Why? Because they have admittedly or unadmittedly

785
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:07,530
fallen into the crowd mentality, which is if the information is not superficial,

786
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:14,890
it doesn't quite resonate, let me just say, with them, right? Because they've tuned themselves,

787
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:19,350
just like a tuning fork resonates to its corresponding frequency with other tuning forks.

788
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:25,410
They've sort of tuned themselves, humanity at this point, and wholesale. There are a few people

789
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:31,090
that are not, let's say a few, meaning a couple of few left on the planet. Most of the people

790
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:36,850
have tuned themselves into this low quality stuff, just like what I might call a corrupted palate.

791
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:44,610
People that eat a lot of junk food tend to have a palate for it. And when they are presented with

792
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:51,530
something that is more wholesome or pure, they tend to not recognize it as such. The palate is

793
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:59,190
sort of corrupted or overwhelmed and desynthesized. And this would be the commentary on what information

794
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:06,110
is, because this is an information-based sonic experience. I mean, otherwise we could play Bach or

795
01:11:06,690 --> 01:11:12,910
YouTube or some other recorded information, or maybe Seth can play a live guitar.

796
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:17,850
This is a sonic experience, and what we're trying to do is sonically impart some uncommon

797
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:23,930
ways of looking at things, where someone that is listening to what is being said here, perhaps

798
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:30,930
can maybe retune if it's up to them, or use it as a contrast, because there is no contrast. You see,

799
01:11:31,730 --> 01:11:38,450
when there's no hot, there's no cold. You have a polarity. And what is going on,

800
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:45,150
and what has been going on in wholesale, and will, is this crowd mentality is moving people

801
01:11:45,150 --> 01:11:50,790
into this amorphous globule mass. And because there's a lack of contrast when the crowd is formed,

802
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:56,530
there is lack of seeing the difference if something is good or bad or true or not,

803
01:11:56,570 --> 01:12:07,150
or unfounded and superficial versus based on something. So in essence, trying to provide

804
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:12,890
information that is based on something or founded or lawful, you know, this is something, Seth,

805
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:18,810
we haven't been bringing up often in conversation, but one simple way, and by the way, people hate

806
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:24,010
the term lawful because they don't want to, well, anyway, that's another. Now I'm going to get into

807
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:30,190
like a personal commentary on humanity, but ask yourself, is it lawful? What I mean by that is,

808
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:37,830
if you see a triangle, it should, having three sides, and 180 degrees as the sum total

809
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:44,170
angle of the interior would be a lawful triangle. If someone shows you something with four sides,

810
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:49,430
it is not a lawful triangle. You see, there are things that are lawful and things that are

811
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:54,350
unlawful. And right now, the majority of society in what they're engaging in,

812
01:12:54,910 --> 01:13:00,730
even in the very dispersal or dispensement of information is unlawful.

813
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:05,510
Meaning that, for example, when you tune into a particular

814
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:12,190
venue that is giving you information or commentary on something, regardless of the topic,

815
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:22,350
if it's going to be opinion based, it should be reminded or should be discussed as this is

816
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:28,090
strictly an opinion or disclaimer should be given. And in many cases, what I do hear often

817
01:13:28,090 --> 01:13:34,150
being put out there to the public sonically or in print, should basically have a disclaimer and

818
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:39,230
almost for every other few things that are being said, because people are walking away,

819
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:45,690
listening to things that are unlawful. In other words, not based on what the subject can be based

820
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:53,790
on or should be based on, and memorializing that in their minds in memory, as something viable or

821
01:13:53,790 --> 01:14:02,590
something usable. So what that means, in essence, is this is like the anti crowd mentality, what

822
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:10,430
are you using the faculties, what we've been given as people, you have a mind that can

823
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:19,590
properly rationalize things, and it's not being used. It's pretty much basically taking in

824
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:26,670
information as an emotional experience, is what you're hearing in concordant with previous things

825
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:31,230
that you've heard, that make you feel good, or not necessarily make you feel good that get you

826
01:14:31,230 --> 01:14:37,170
agitated. And somehow guided the mind to say, Oh, yeah, we have to do something about this,

827
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:42,030
because it's a bad thing. But if you look at what's being discussed about what should be done

828
01:14:42,030 --> 01:14:47,310
about it is, and the thing itself that is bad, there is no basis for it. In other words, the

829
01:14:47,310 --> 01:14:55,210
basis for it is not there. It's again, fiat. No. So how does one get away from that, and

830
01:14:56,190 --> 01:15:03,550
not necessarily that one should most people are tend to have a level of freedom of choice,

831
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:10,970
let's say, they have a free will, and they go about their lives doing what they believe they

832
01:15:10,970 --> 01:15:16,410
they choose is right for them. And who is anyone else to tell them what's right or wrong.

833
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:21,870
But that's why I believe one of the outlines of today, coming together on Uncommon Sense,

834
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:27,390
discussing the three various aspects, a general outline would be the crowd mentality,

835
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:33,410
the addiction, the wholesale addiction to low quality stuff in general, and being ruled by

836
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:40,010
pranksters is a general is a very good general outline to explain what is going on. And this is

837
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:46,930
across the board, folks. There is nothing really going on right now, even though there is because

838
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:50,950
we've kind of discussed it's this part of the world is springtime, the other part of the

839
01:15:50,950 --> 01:15:56,230
world is fall. On one side, it's a planting. And on the other side, it's a harvesting.

840
01:15:56,230 --> 01:16:02,290
Let's say part of the season. And when you're looking at the planting or the springtime,

841
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:09,470
from a social aspect of planting things, you'll notice that it's fairly quiet. And just to tie

842
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:14,670
it back to the beginning of the first hour, discussing that people come to these information

843
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:20,490
type venues to get information that are socially based, even though I'll be at you might tune into

844
01:16:20,490 --> 01:16:25,850
a cooking show or how to fix the car kind of thing or something specific or reference material.

845
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:33,730
Generally, people go to media in general, to hear social commentary, what's happening in the

846
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:41,330
quote, unquote world, what's going on, right. And the best way to make things sensible is obviously,

847
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:49,190
where the noise is, is not really where it's at. Right. And not even when the dust settles,

848
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:55,710
because then the picture kind of changes again. It's always where it's quiet. And I believe

849
01:16:56,230 --> 01:17:05,430
you know, most people tend to gravitate towards various forms of media to see and hear about what

850
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:13,750
is in the news today. And they tend to take it in daily or weekly blocks, or sometimes seasonal

851
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:19,050
blocks, even though they they fail to refer to what is going on to the seasons. Like, for example,

852
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:24,170
I think there's still a little bit of talk about a financial collapse coming next month regarding

853
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:30,270
the US dollar, which is a complete joke on every aspect, because financial next month now. Yeah,

854
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:35,630
again, let me just put it this way. This is an open challenge. If anyone out there is a

855
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:40,730
commentator on economics or economic matters, I dare you and I challenge you to get in touch with

856
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:51,550
us at uncommon radio.com www.uncommonradio.com and we will bring you on air and we will tear you to

857
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:56,090
pieces within five seconds. As a matter of fact, Seth in the Greek will not do it. We will bring an

858
01:17:56,090 --> 01:18:03,850
eight-year-old on that we will coach for no more than 40 seconds before you come on air and you will

859
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:10,190
be discarded immediately. Any financial commentator out there, it doesn't matter who you are. You know

860
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:15,750
who you are if you're listening, because all of these financial commentators bar none are basically

861
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:21,810
discussing things as if there is still a substance-backed economy. If they don't discuss

862
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:26,550
in that realm, they bring up like there's any relevancy to a country's currency.

863
01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:31,290
They don't understand anything, but here's the thing. The more they threaten

864
01:18:33,990 --> 01:18:39,610
financial collapse or financial doom and gloom, the more people tune in and the more subscribers

865
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:46,410
they get. Why? Because it's the crowd mentality and people are addicted to low-quality stuff

866
01:18:47,150 --> 01:18:52,450
and all these guys that are commentating on economics are strictly taking their information

867
01:18:52,450 --> 01:18:58,790
by watching the pranksters. In other words, the pranksters are lying to it and the economic

868
01:18:58,790 --> 01:19:04,690
commentators are swearing to it. What are they lying about? That there even is a possibility of

869
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:08,630
financial collapse because you are under a credit-based economy, folks.

870
01:19:09,930 --> 01:19:14,830
How do we know? Just go read the codes and the laws. Oh no, he said I have to read, I have to

871
01:19:14,830 --> 01:19:22,250
study. Oh no, that's horrible. Why can't I just pay someone to do it for me like I can go to school

872
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:30,570
maybe? Is there a meme? Do we have a meme for this yet, Gregg? Well, the thing that we came up with

873
01:19:30,570 --> 01:19:39,650
is truthism is the new movement now, right? It's the truthism. Yeah, and there is no truth in the

874
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:47,550
truthism movement, folks. But anyway, it's so simple to demolish what humanity is basing their

875
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:54,110
reality on. It's not even worth demolishing. It's kind of like you can knock it over with a feather.

876
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:58,730
There's nothing really there that's in their minds, but yet they're being guided with what

877
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:04,330
they want to afford to be guided with. What I mean by what they want to afford to be guided with

878
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:12,290
is they actually dedicate energy into taking in junk information because wholesale, humans are

879
01:20:12,290 --> 01:20:17,570
typically addicted to low-quality stuff at the moment and it just tends to be the reality of it.

880
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:25,730
It's an easy thing to objectify. But in essence, going back to the financial reality, I like to

881
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:31,690
rant about the financial people because money is almost like a cure-all in a social setting,

882
01:20:31,990 --> 01:20:38,650
by the way, right? And we've in part discussed what money is and in part discussed maybe what

883
01:20:38,650 --> 01:20:45,010
credit is and things like that, but maybe one day we'll dedicate two hours to it and really lose

884
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:54,010
the crowd, quote-unquote. But in essence, it is springtime. It is slow and it's planting and it's

885
01:20:54,010 --> 01:21:00,930
quiet, supposedly. But one thing that you will always hear the Greek and Seth discuss, perhaps,

886
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:07,630
is what is coming. Yes, it is possible to know the future. Anyone and everyone that does things that

887
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:14,250
last more than a moment or so expect something from that action, right? And that expectation

888
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:20,110
is based on something rational, right? If your hands are dirty and you walk up to what's called

889
01:21:20,110 --> 01:21:25,910
a sink and you turn on the faucet and grab some soap and properly dispense soap on the hands and

890
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:30,990
let the water run and you move your hands under the water, your hands will get clean. That is

891
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:36,950
a simple action to define that the reason why people approach soap and water with dirty hands

892
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:42,110
is because they know in the future, in the short coming future, their hands will be clean. That's

893
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:47,030
why people engage in action, because they have a sense of the future event that will come if

894
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:53,090
they engage in that action. And this is how pretty much everyone operates. But again, just to tie it

895
01:21:53,090 --> 01:22:00,450
back to coming together to media, why people come to or go to media is to hear what's called the news

896
01:22:00,450 --> 01:22:10,470
based on social socialism or truthism, to hear about what is going on today or a week, because

897
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:17,950
they seem to have no more than about a week attention span, by the way. If you are wondering what is

898
01:22:17,950 --> 01:22:23,130
coming when we've again, just to tie it in with what we've discussed is what you're witnessing in society

899
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:31,070
right now is the precursor to a Middle East Union. So, if that helps, this is a very tall general statement

900
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:39,790
to make, but if anyone can take that to heart, we'll very soon realize that the true explanation

901
01:22:39,790 --> 01:22:46,970
behind what's going on, you know, when they approach media, and they see and hear what is called the news,

902
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:53,610
you know, because you will see, especially for the past decade or two, or three, there has been

903
01:22:54,190 --> 01:23:00,330
tremendous focus in that part of the world. And why? Very simply, if you look at a racetrack,

904
01:23:01,030 --> 01:23:07,130
where is the starting line? Same racetrack, where is the finishing line?

905
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:16,310
It's exactly what is going on, folks. It's really simple. So, when you understand and comprehend and see

906
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:25,030
that the soon-to-manifest future events will be focused in the, quote-unquote, what's called Middle East area.

907
01:23:25,070 --> 01:23:30,990
Now, when I say Middle East, if you took a map of the world, and you looked at the main landmass,

908
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:36,450
and you, let's say, eliminate the concept of the Suez Canal and such, you'll see that the entire continent

909
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:44,510
of Africa, Asia, and Europe are all connected as one mass. If you draw pretty much a diagonal through

910
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:52,230
that landmass, you will find the middle part of that landmass is in that general area we're discussing,

911
01:23:52,250 --> 01:24:00,990
from the shores of Judea, going all the way east, perhaps even as far as to India, and is perhaps

912
01:24:00,990 --> 01:24:10,130
north as Turkey, and a south as, hmm, would call the Negev and beyond, maybe the west coast of Africa,

913
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:17,970
or a bottom of Saudi Arabia, is that general area, that general central region. And also, what you

914
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:23,950
will be witnessing in the future is the southern Mediterranean, or let's say, northern Mediterranean,

915
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:33,330
or southern European rim countries like Turkey, Cyprus, and Greece, and northern, quote-unquote,

916
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:38,730
African countries, forming a loose alliance as a satellite group to this Middle East Union that's

917
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:43,450
going to be coming in the next decade or so. And the reason we keep bringing this up is because

918
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:48,610
we're getting closer that this time period, which will be ending in roughly two years,

919
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:54,450
will be the next seven-year time period where you will see the building up of this Middle East

920
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:59,430
Union. So you still have about two more years of the same stuff that you've been experiencing for

921
01:24:59,430 --> 01:25:07,370
the past five or so, which is this repeat of events in the Middle East, but a repeat of this weekly

922
01:25:07,370 --> 01:25:14,390
cycle of what's in the news now. And of course, let's put in another dig to our economic commentator

923
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:21,550
idiot friends, that of course, you will always, regarding the economy, be hearing of an impending

924
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:27,490
doom just about every month, which never comes, by the way. What you will see is a restriction of

925
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:33,730
credit. And of course, what the hell is credit? No one knows, right? Yes, you can find out if you

926
01:25:33,730 --> 01:25:40,570
go and study the laws that are put together for which corresponding country you might be living

927
01:25:40,570 --> 01:25:46,370
in. But of course, that requires study, and no one wants to do that, of course. Why do that? We

928
01:25:46,370 --> 01:25:52,490
have YouTube, or we have wonderful hosts and internet shows and things like that, that'll tell

929
01:25:52,490 --> 01:26:01,110
us and I assure you, you're getting no information. So anyway, you know, with that said, just kind of

930
01:26:01,110 --> 01:26:07,370
wrapping up the idea of why people go to the media and whether it's mainstream or alternative is to

931
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:15,730
find out generally, what's going on in the news. And other than looking at the daily or weekly cycle,

932
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:25,770
it tends to be still this irrational disconnect that people are wholly relying on this sonic

933
01:26:25,770 --> 01:26:33,310
stimulation of what or visual stimulation if they're reading on the topic. And fortunately,

934
01:26:33,310 --> 01:26:41,090
for the psyche or the mind, it has it perhaps a built in what you might call protection mechanism,

935
01:26:41,450 --> 01:26:45,630
because you'll notice that a lot of the things that they're reading about or discussing in the

936
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:53,150
news are unfounded, debased. And the protection mechanism does not allow for that to linger much

937
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:59,350
more than a week or so. That's why, for example, you know, if you look at the previous news cycles

938
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:05,650
that people discuss, especially in alternative media, is you have a missing plane, you have a

939
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:11,550
threat of an economic collapse, corrupt politician, and something is going to destroy the planet.

940
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:18,690
And then it repeats after a week or two or three or four, a missing plane, corrupt politician,

941
01:27:18,990 --> 01:27:23,490
economic collapse, something is going to destroy the planet, and it just keeps repeating. The

942
01:27:23,490 --> 01:27:29,530
reason why it repeats is because people have installed or pre installed perhaps a safety

943
01:27:29,530 --> 01:27:35,630
mechanism not to remember or to kind of like numb themselves out to what they're perceiving,

944
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:39,270
because they know it doesn't make any sense, but they don't want to look into

945
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:47,190
what does make sense about it, finding out what it's based on. So, but that's it.

946
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:56,290
Yeah, good. I've read a quote from was it was it Morgan or was it one of the presidents

947
01:27:57,010 --> 01:28:01,570
who said that if the people knew how the banking system worked,

948
01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:04,250
there would be riots in the streets the next day.

949
01:28:05,950 --> 01:28:11,630
So, yeah, yeah, well, essentially here, here, let's throw this out real quick. Essentially,

950
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:17,730
it's a credit based economy. So when you're when people are born, they they're pledged by

951
01:28:17,730 --> 01:28:23,370
their parents into their bodies and everything that they're going to do into a quote unquote

952
01:28:23,370 --> 01:28:27,770
system, whatever it is, it's a monarchy of socialist communist capitalism. And by the

953
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:32,730
way, capitalism just means that when you're done using or building something, you destroy it,

954
01:28:32,770 --> 01:28:38,510
so no one else can use it after you. But anyway, when you're when you put together a

955
01:28:39,210 --> 01:28:43,310
credit economy, you basically get everyone to put everything that they have everything they will

956
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:52,070
have into the system. So it works. And you have this giant trust that's put together and it's

957
01:28:52,070 --> 01:29:05,210
being managed by the legal society. Oops. pranksters. So there you go. That's it in a nutshell.

958
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:16,050
All right. Yep. So yeah, so people, you know, tend to ask questions like there's one in chat,

959
01:29:16,110 --> 01:29:21,530
how do you save a house from foreclosure? That is really a big question. It's actually a small

960
01:29:21,530 --> 01:29:26,430
question. You're dealing first of all, you're dealing with pranksters. The definitions need

961
01:29:26,430 --> 01:29:33,710
to be looked at. You're not saving anything from a foreclosure. There's there's many aspects to it.

962
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:40,630
And, you know, and that, at this point, I would not direct anyone in a form of advice on

963
01:29:40,630 --> 01:29:44,410
how to deal with that. But the more you study, the better off you're going to be.

964
01:29:44,610 --> 01:29:49,610
And don't be emotional about it. With anything that's critical, like for example,

965
01:29:50,530 --> 01:29:55,290
there was a couple of situations brought up, whether it's, you know, cliche or whatever,

966
01:29:55,410 --> 01:30:00,530
where it's difficult for a surgeon to operate on someone in his family. Right? They tend to

967
01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:06,110
have someone else do it because they're emotionally attached. You know, when you do

968
01:30:06,110 --> 01:30:13,970
things that are critical. So the more the more rational you are, the better off you'll be in

969
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:18,630
any situation. But but by the way, Seth, we didn't bring up which we tend to bring up very often.

970
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:24,190
You also illustrated earlier how the legal society or these level of pranksters have engaged in

971
01:30:24,190 --> 01:30:30,570
almost every aspect of society today. What we have brought up before, and at least the Greek

972
01:30:30,570 --> 01:30:36,190
has been saying for over a decade, is the legal society is nothing more than the priesthood for

973
01:30:36,190 --> 01:30:43,150
the revived goddess religion. What does that mean? They operate under what's called a justice

974
01:30:43,150 --> 01:30:48,330
system or a justice department or whatever. That is the revival of the ancient goddess religion.

975
01:30:48,330 --> 01:30:54,250
And if you're really want to bring up something that's obvious, I mean, it's right in your face,

976
01:30:54,790 --> 01:31:01,110
kind of tell you, you know, it's all about justice, people want justice. But no one,

977
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:07,490
when I say no one, I mean, statistically, actually investigates what it is. And if you do it

978
01:31:07,490 --> 01:31:13,310
objectively, you will discover that it is nothing more nothing less than the revival of the ancient

979
01:31:13,310 --> 01:31:19,350
goddess religion. What do you know about ancient goddess religions? And if you answered nothing,

980
01:31:19,650 --> 01:31:23,250
you probably answered right, because most people don't know anything about

981
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:29,570
ancient religions, and their and their revival. And this is exactly what you are in right now.

982
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:36,690
And why? You know, if you objectify the formation of societies and into nations,

983
01:31:36,690 --> 01:31:44,210
they tend to adopt what's called a patron, or in this case, a matron deity. All nations have them.

984
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:49,830
I'm going to stop there and pause for a minute. All nations and all countries and societies have

985
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:58,940
a patron or matron deity. Think about it. So what is the most prominently featured

986
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:06,420
deity in Western society? It's a statue of a woman. She's blindfolded, holding scales or

987
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:14,320
some variation thereof. And how many people are questioning its origin, its function as such?

988
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:21,880
None. And if you do, you will discover that is nothing. It's a liturgy of this

989
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:29,980
revived goddess religion in a loose sense. It's done in a modern sense. At least the ancients

990
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:36,460
were acknowledging this, where the quote unquote, moderns are not because it's not because

991
01:32:36,460 --> 01:32:43,040
moderns have been dumbed down. They've just strictly been numbed down. The dumbing down

992
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:51,100
ended a long, long time ago. The numbing down has been turned up. So you get it. Will that numbing

993
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:57,120
down wear off? No, it's going to get stronger and stronger. Can you actually acquire good sound data

994
01:32:57,120 --> 01:33:02,260
or information while you're numbed out? Well, that's up to you to decide. But if you're going

995
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:09,920
to look at the legal pranksters running the entire show, right, sawing a woman in half,

996
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,940
putting it back together and everyone in the audience swearing to it, you're going to have

997
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:18,820
to find out what their patron god is. And you will find out that it is a revived goddess religion. And

998
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:23,800
again, what do you know about the revived goddess religions? And if your answer is nothing, you're

999
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:30,080
in good company. But that is exactly what is going on. It is an oversimplification of a lot of the

1000
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:39,400
reasoning and social ills that you will see, but yet fail to recognize as such. So with that said,

1001
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:47,260
I hope we are fulfilling some uncommon sense here. Now the chances of being able to go out,

1002
01:33:48,300 --> 01:33:56,740
oh, let's say, or go in, or acquire other individuals to have a sensible, rational conversation based on

1003
01:33:56,740 --> 01:34:01,720
the things discussed herein are next to nothing. So if you are within the sonic reach of what we

1004
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:06,160
are discussing here, or what you are hearing, take good notes, you could always find it in

1005
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:12,380
archives. And if you go to www.uncommonradio.com, you will see there are links there either to the

1006
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:18,960
or to American Freedom Radio, which American Freedom Radio has provided a very well-organized,

1007
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:25,540
well-placed, easy-to-access archive of these programs. And again, American Freedom Radio is

1008
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:31,440
listener-supported, listener-sponsored, and actually here for the listener. I'm sure that

1009
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:36,420
those that have put American Freedom Radio together did not do it so they can listen to

1010
01:34:36,420 --> 01:34:42,220
themselves. They did it for everyone else. So you might want to give them some support.

1011
01:34:42,320 --> 01:34:45,980
As a matter of fact, you should support them in some way or another. You know how to do that

1012
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:52,060
by simply going to their homepage or anywhere on there and inquiring on how to provide some form

1013
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:58,600
of assistance. And it is simple to do and it should be done simply because of the service

1014
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:03,960
they provide, at least for what is being said here in its archival form and its ability to

1015
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:10,840
be broadcast or sent to you live around this time every week. So I just wanted to throw that in

1016
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:16,240
there because you folks know how to do it and you know what to do to support AFR and the folks

1017
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:23,320
there. And let's just say it this way, or again as it might be condescending to some, simply because

1018
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:30,580
they have uncommon sense here with Greek and Seth is a good enough reason to go ahead and sign over

1019
01:35:30,580 --> 01:35:36,820
your entire bank account or whatever is left into it. But anyway, so go ahead and donate something.

1020
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:43,620
I'll just go out and say it. So please help them out. And I'm saying please meaning politely.

1021
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:51,240
So Seth, are you with us again? Okay, we have Seth has a little grounding problem there. Okay, so

1022
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:58,240
basically fulfilling this week's mission on the uncommon sense is just to reiterate again

1023
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:05,180
because repetition does bear one of the elements of learning is what we want to do,

1024
01:36:05,300 --> 01:36:10,340
kind of evoke and bring forward is that the three parts that can be used as social commentary

1025
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:18,100
for your typical surface dwelling earth inhabitants these days is Gustav Le Bon's analysis of

1026
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:27,040
the crowd, the perpetual, seemingly perpetual low ranking thought or low quality addiction

1027
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:37,060
of humanity at large. And also considering that the level of prankstership and the level of

1028
01:36:37,060 --> 01:36:43,500
pranksters that are dominating human society as being those three being the simple elements,

1029
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:51,040
not the all the be all end all but a general brush stroke over the entire planet right now.

1030
01:36:51,460 --> 01:36:55,680
And what is going on here would say that is very founded and very accurate.

1031
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:04,880
Meaning that what we've based on describing human society as being part of Gustav Le Bon's

1032
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:10,420
description of crowd thinking, the humanity being again addicted to low quality stuff

1033
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:17,840
across the board and also being run by pranksters can be founded. If you do a little bit of research

1034
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:24,280
on these three aspects, you will find that it is a very good more than single category description

1035
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:33,160
or outline or let's say a description which underpins human society at large today.

1036
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:37,720
You would find that if you did a little bit of homework on these three aspects, the pranksters,

1037
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:44,780
humans, addiction to low quality information and things and the crowd mentality, you will find that

1038
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:51,500
to be true, not being true within the realm of this truthism that's being put forward today.

1039
01:37:51,800 --> 01:38:00,100
Because the idea of being common is not much of an idea anymore. It's just difficult. It's not

1040
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:04,440
difficult to do. Just walk out your door and look like everyone else and think like everyone else.

1041
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:09,380
We're not here to tell anyone that the world needs to be saved or changed.

1042
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:17,120
Into what? You see, but the idea of being uncommon and learning how to set oneself apart

1043
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:24,340
from the realm of the common might be the goal. Now, is it really a goal? Well, you know, it's

1044
01:38:24,920 --> 01:38:29,960
is it a be all end all? Is it something that you will achieve? No, because you're born and you die.

1045
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:36,640
But it's about what you do in between. And all you have in between is time. And by the way,

1046
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:43,500
if anyone says to you, I don't have any time, they're kind of delusional, because you're born

1047
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:49,820
and you die. And in between, all you have is time. So if you want to translate, when someone says,

1048
01:38:49,900 --> 01:38:55,200
I don't have any time, if you translate that into translate that into a rational communication,

1049
01:38:55,200 --> 01:39:00,460
is what they're really telling you is that they don't know how to manage their time,

1050
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:07,900
or they don't want to dedicate time. Right, that is the, the actual translation of that

1051
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:16,680
into rational communication. So all you have is time, folks. And what you make of it, or what you

1052
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:23,620
observe of it, or how you operate within that time that you have, you have a choice to either be

1053
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:28,600
common or uncommon. And what you will discover is when you discover the realm of the uncommon,

1054
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:36,560
you will see that what is being thought by the commoners or what is in common, it's best to

1055
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:43,460
leave it all alone, and set yourself apart. And what I mean by set apart, it is not necessarily

1056
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:51,440
a form of quarantine, but it is a form of if you're setting yourself apart, you don't complain

1057
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:59,400
about it. You don't, you don't put your energy, or your thought into hopeless things that are masked

1058
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:05,020
or described as being hopeful, or hope, a general hope, or a general faith, and things that are

1059
01:40:05,020 --> 01:40:11,220
unfounded. And that's all you pretty much see and hear everywhere today. As you hear things,

1060
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:16,520
we have to make the world a better place or to have hope or to have faith, or to hope for a better

1061
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:25,180
future. And there is absolutely no specifics. Let me just say it again. Absolutely no specifics.

1062
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:30,580
Why? Because you might say, well, Greek, that doesn't sound reasonable. This person said,

1063
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:35,940
if we do X, Y, and Z, or A, B, and C, that'll help us. Well, yes, they did say that. But if you go

1064
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:41,000
look at the sea, what it was founded on, or if it's based or baseless, you will find it to be

1065
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:46,980
unfounded and baseless, pretty much across the board. This is the state of humanity at this

1066
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:53,060
point. So it's going to be very interesting. Well, actually, it's not going to be very

1067
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:58,180
interesting, because it's very easy to see what what people engage in, what they are engaging in

1068
01:40:58,180 --> 01:41:04,500
last week, last month, last year, what they will be engaging in a week, a month or two or three or

1069
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:09,000
four or a year or two from now, it's pretty much going to be the same that they're doing in now

1070
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:15,700
uselessness, the same stuff. Well, it's going to take on a different form a little bit, at least

1071
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:23,080
for the next couple of years. Yeah, there's not much going on, folks. Other than realizing the

1072
01:41:23,080 --> 01:41:29,480
and objectifying and seeing what's rational, and setting yourself apart. Again, it just means the

1073
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:34,180
easiest way to set oneself apart is when you hear about something, or engage in anything,

1074
01:41:34,180 --> 01:41:40,160
is it lawful? What is it based on? You know, if something is being brought forward, let's say of

1075
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:48,020
historical reference, or of scientific or medical or social or legal ref, you ever notice how it's

1076
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:56,060
being discussed in a way that is to grab your emotions, or some du jour topic, but the actual

1077
01:41:56,060 --> 01:42:01,660
foundations are very rarely discussed, or what it's based on, are very rarely discussed.

1078
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:07,460
You know, whether it's hidden away or sequestered from public reality or public mind is irrelevant.

1079
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:15,140
You know, if you listen to what is being put out right now, through humanity at large, and we're

1080
01:42:15,140 --> 01:42:20,060
talking about the halls of deception known as university all the way down to, you know, click

1081
01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:24,920
away on a favorite place that you go to get information on the internet, from you're being

1082
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:31,000
entertained or used, or it's being set up basically in the mainstream by a set of pranksters,

1083
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:37,940
in the non mainstream, it's basically there to grab your emotional and garner emotional response.

1084
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:44,100
So when I say this, of course, there's not completely absolute, there are some things

1085
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:48,440
out there that are founded and based, you know, but when you start listening to a topic being

1086
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:51,560
discussed, whether it's in university or all the way down to alternative media,

1087
01:42:52,980 --> 01:42:59,840
just don't jump right in and take it for, you know, let's say what's being presented as the

1088
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:05,880
be all end all as such as if it just sprang into existence. You must understand its history or what

1089
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:11,380
it should be based on. Is it lawful? In other words, again, when you hear of an economic discussion,

1090
01:43:13,180 --> 01:43:18,880
is it ever discussed that it's at least preface that it's a credit based economy and the

1091
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:25,180
information herein is a discussion of it? Never. If you hear of anything regarding any political

1092
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:31,760
discussion, is it ever being discussed in a way that actually is based on the laws of the country

1093
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:36,940
or the patron deity of that country? Never. If you hear of anything scientific,

1094
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:41,420
is it ever discussed on anything found in the real in the real world?

1095
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:48,340
Never. Typically, some x, not an explanation, but a description of something. Of course,

1096
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:52,680
science is very good at giving descriptions, but never explanations, of course, because,

1097
01:43:52,680 --> 01:43:58,160
you know, for all, I mean, we already know that electricity is nothing more than electrons going

1098
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:03,060
down a wire, is it not? You know, I'll tell you, if you do this experiment safely,

1099
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:09,620
if you cut a live wire, you don't need a dustpan. You won't make a mess because you won't have

1100
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:14,360
electrons jumping out of the wire running, falling to the floor or floating in the air,

1101
01:44:14,580 --> 01:44:20,040
because there's no such thing. But is anyone bothering to check? You know, still people are

1102
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:26,620
revoking this intellectual giant known as Einstein. But by the way, if you have a society

1103
01:44:26,620 --> 01:44:32,240
of mental midgets, it doesn't take much to be a giant, just like if a society is blind,

1104
01:44:32,780 --> 01:44:38,460
the man with one eye is king. But nonetheless, has anyone ever gone and researched what Einstein's

1105
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:44,100
work was based on? Has anyone researched anything beyond that? Not really. They still like to parrot

1106
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:50,180
all this stuff. When you listen to comments on things biblical, has anyone ever read the text?

1107
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:55,300
The answer, if the answer is no, you're pretty much correct. Everyone says they have.

1108
01:44:56,120 --> 01:45:00,760
But go check up on it, you'll find they haven't. So you have a lot of things, you know, is it

1109
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:06,580
lawful? A lot of things being discussed and is what being discussed, is it lawful? You know,

1110
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:13,720
there's a lot of discussion to be found, a lot of information to be imparted. Is it lawful?

1111
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:19,880
You know, I think last week we did bring up a reference to a man named Frank Chester. If anyone

1112
01:45:19,880 --> 01:45:25,720
has gone back and viewed any of his work, credit must be given to him that when he does bring up

1113
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:30,320
any kind of geometric form or any idea that he's bringing forward before he proceeds, he says this

1114
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:36,700
works because you could see here it is lawful. Lawful in the geometric sense, meaning that if

1115
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:42,740
it's got four sides, it's a square. If it's got three sides, it's a triangle. That is a lawful

1116
01:45:42,740 --> 01:45:51,240
discussion. What you're hearing, folks, is that three sides means it's a square. Four sides means

1117
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:59,960
it's a pentagon. And one plus one is five. And no one is paying any attention. Why? Because again,

1118
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:06,300
the emotional stimulus to be garnered from tuning in to whether it's a visual experience or a sonic

1119
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:13,600
experience anywhere that you go seems to trump people's rationale. Why? Because you have most

1120
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:22,540
likely a mechanism of protection in your mind that has to also be in there if you're going to be in

1121
01:46:22,540 --> 01:46:29,640
the crowd mentality, addicted to low quality things and ruled by pranksters. How can you be aware and

1122
01:46:29,640 --> 01:46:36,580
how can you be perceptive and objective if you find yourself in the crowd mentality, addicted to

1123
01:46:36,580 --> 01:46:44,040
low quality stuff and ruled by pranksters? There is really no answer other than to numb yourself out

1124
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:51,120
and go by emotional stimulus. And if you ever wonder what I'm talking about, look at how much

1125
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:58,360
stress is being put into right now, into the stimulants and things like that of a certain

1126
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:07,900
variety, by the way. So yes, humanity at large, you're common. We are here to bring up what's

1127
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:12,880
uncommon. And if anyone other than the four or five listeners comes across this program,

1128
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:17,680
and you don't understand anything that's being said here, it's fine. It's normal. But what we

1129
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:23,960
try to do is be objective, be rational. And until the next time we come around, folks, remember,

1130
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:29,800
be uncommon, or at least in your mind, be lawful, be rational. And in the meantime,

1131
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:34,600
enjoy yourselves and all the best. And we'll see you again soon. Thank you.
