1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:06,590
Greek, hello and welcome. Greetings. Yes, greetings, Seth. Greetings, everyone, and this is Uncommon Sense.

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:12,410
On American Freedom Radio, we could be also streaming on UStream and maybe other places in the future.

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,670
So, greetings, everyone.

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,690
You know, it's interesting, Seth,

5
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,130
how novel would it be to tell people roughly something about timekeeping?

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,210
But I think it's reckoning around the 24th or 25th of the third month.

7
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:35,370
So, I just wanted to kind of put that in there, meaning it's still springtime, or almost the end of spring going into summer.

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,990
Does it feel like summer on your part of the world?

9
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:39,670
Not today.

10
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,990
Today and the next few days, they are

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:45,850
forecasting to...

12
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,750
It's chilly, actually. It's kind of chilly outside. I actually had to kick the heater on.

13
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:52,950
Yeah, there's...

14
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,490
Allegedly, somebody's mucking about with the weather and the

15
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,990
jet stream from the north is being pulled down, like someone having their pants pulled down.

16
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:06,850
I wonder how that happens. One day, we'll talk about the weather.

17
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,790
But you know what's interesting? I think it was Samuel Clemens. He said, or Mark Twain,

18
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,910
everyone's talking about the weather. When is someone going to do something about it?

19
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:22,190
I find that to be very interesting, and I assure you folks, we will not be speaking about it on the typical human

20
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,230
activism,

21
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,610
because activism is best kept for

22
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,310
making bread, as in yeast. But either way, we will be discussing things

23
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,610
perhaps that are uncommon, wouldn't you say?

24
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,230
Yes, yes, absolutely.

25
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,290
So, yeah.

26
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:49,630
Historically, when people have done something about the weather, it's ended up poorly for them, at least. I read a story about

27
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,210
a guy that did some cloud seeding for

28
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:59,190
I believe it was California, actually. I don't remember the decade, but it was like the 40s or 50s.

29
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,710
Oh, maybe earlier?

30
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,790
Possibly earlier. Hatchfield, perhaps?

31
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,810
He ended up getting sued, actually, because

32
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,130
there was flooding involved and

33
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,910
yeah, so.

34
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,870
He ended up getting pranked, yes.

35
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,030
For pulling a prank. Pranked, yes, absolutely.

36
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,770
Which is really interesting. Yeah, speaking of pranks,

37
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:32,470
this is just a thought, just before we get into today, because today we might want to talk about some messages we've had from the listenership,

38
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,350
which all in all, it's easy to contact us at

39
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,870
www.uncommonradio.com.

40
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:47,330
You'll find contact information there. The reason I stress the www, because if you just do an Uncommon Radio search,

41
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,010
you'll get a lot of

42
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:49,390
other

43
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,970
sites that use that term as well, but we are the only

44
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,990
www.uncommonradio.com.

45
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,110
So,

46
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,430
we might want to get into

47
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:05,470
some of the messages that you forwarded as well that were sent perhaps to Seth and then forwarded to the Uncommon Radio.

48
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,830
Yeah, so yeah, but before I want to get into it,

49
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:14,130
I just want to kind of like having you notice this show might also be, well, it's not a dog and pony show.

50
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,370
We've got to figure another way to call it. It's typically called a show,

51
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:25,170
but it's very interesting how, haven't you noticed, might also be a motto, you know, of Uncommon Sense. Haven't you noticed, you know?

52
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,150
It's very interesting how

53
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,850
there's two things that seem to be

54
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:38,050
sort of in the media or in people's mind or discussion, not forward discussion, but some discussion, is that something that

55
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,890
kind of resembles

56
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:41,550
the

57
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:49,250
1960s revived to a certain degree regarding two things like open drug use and certain sexual

58
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,910
things in the quote-unquote news.

59
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,450
Like, you know, there's a lot of stuff about the use of public bathrooms

60
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:03,610
regarding people who like to cross-dress, right? And also there's the

61
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,870
revival of what's called cannabis or medical marijuana.

62
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:15,370
So, isn't it interesting how the 60s is sort of defined as a sexual revolution and a free

63
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,670
yourself kind of, free the mind sort of with the drug use kind of thing.

64
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:25,750
I find it to be an interesting parallel. Not that we're suggesting or I am suggesting at all that

65
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,210
we're going into an era that is the revived 60s, because heaven forbid the next thing we need is

66
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,950
wide lapels and polyester bell-bottoms again.

67
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:40,510
But I just find it to be an interesting parallel how that's roughly a generation ago or 40 years

68
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:47,430
ago, you know. And there's a lot to comment, of course, on the topic regarding the gender.

69
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,450
Let's just call it, that's what they're using, gender.

70
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:54,270
The sex subject, meaning, you know, the rights

71
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:02,690
that are being discussed regarding that topic, just like rights were being discussed in the 60s. And then, of course, there's the

72
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:10,330
again, just to reiterate, the cannabis use being, quote unquote, legalized or used again, which was quite popular back then.

73
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,370
So it's just an interesting comparison.

74
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,450
And there's a lot to be discussed on both of those subjects, actually, that could be more eye opening.

75
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,930
So I just wanted to bring that up, just something to think about.

76
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:32,550
Absolutely. Things like that in with the things coming back around, just to reference it, I guess.

77
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:42,450
Is something that you notice in music and pop culture as well, being, you know, a musician and kind of paying attention to such things.

78
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:51,130
The trends that happen in music, even outside of the like the top 40 stuff and within it as well.

79
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:58,330
The trends seem to come back around every, I wouldn't even say 40 years on that.

80
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,650
I'd say it's more like every 15 to 20 years.

81
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:12,970
You see the same things that were being done 15 to 20 years before that being sort of regurgitated or revisited in appearance,

82
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:25,250
sonic quality and, you know, what things that are being said and discussed even topically within the music itself.

83
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,710
So, well, ultimately, with music, if it sounds good, it is good.

84
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:38,410
I mean, but some people think that it was a Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture without the symphony sounds good.

85
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:46,770
If you know, I'll just for those who don't know, 1812 overture, there's a crescendo with cannon fire.

86
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,630
Very basic. Yes.

87
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,090
Yeah. So some people think that is just that itself sounds good without the symphony.

88
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:55,030
But anyway, that's another topic.

89
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:01,730
Again, there's a matter of taste, you know, and things, you know, you heard the term like being palatable.

90
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:09,350
And I like to discuss palette sometimes in terms of being juvenile or mature or corrupted or whatever, you know, discerning.

91
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,930
There's many ways to discuss the palette as well.

92
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:19,430
But the thing is, you know, the purpose of coming together is being uncommon or maybe talking about what's uncommon.

93
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:25,250
And I just want to give a little footnote on the name of the show came about.

94
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:33,730
I keep referring it to a show loosely is speaking with someone at AFR about doing a another sonic project.

95
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:39,310
We had done one before called Ocelli and the Greek, which you will find at Ocelli and the Greek dot com.

96
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,690
You will find archives there.

97
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:47,590
And there's also a disclaimer on there, which is necessary because what you will find there is highly unusual.

98
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:59,170
But I was discussing perhaps another some a sonic project and how the things that could be discussed or the Greek likes to discuss are not really for everyone.

99
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,290
And it doesn't quite accommodate the masses.

100
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:09,810
And the response I got was, well, you're basically, you know, it's basically common sense was the response.

101
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,750
And I said, well, actually, it's uncommon sense.

102
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,350
And that's how we came up with the name Uncommon Sense or Uncommon Radio.

103
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:28,130
So I just wanted to throw that in there because there's a thing that can be said, you know, discussing with people about anything.

104
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,330
Just take whatever it is and turn it upside down.

105
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:33,429
And guess what?

106
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,070
When you do that now, it's right side up.

107
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,309
How simple can that be?

108
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,450
Maybe because everything's kind of turned upside down.

109
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,049
But I think it's a good thing to a degree.

110
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:45,860
Absolutely.

111
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,740
Topsy turvy.

112
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,100
Yes. Yes.

113
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,480
And it's really more complicated than that, but simply complicated.

114
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,960
That's a twist on words, meaning that all we have to do is look at what things are based on and is it lawful?

115
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:12,020
So, you know, there's a there's a level of futility, by the way, that I've noticed that is within the time span that people encounter at various events.

116
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,500
is there are certain desires that people express

117
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,060
that never seem to be fulfilled, right?

118
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,900
And they seem to still engage in maybe referring

119
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,820
to what that desire might be attached to.

120
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,240
That might be a comment on internet radio

121
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,560
or just study, even all the way to university, for example.

122
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,940
And the futility there is, you know,

123
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,740
very often people will discuss, you know,

124
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,360
we are so advanced or the Greek philosophers

125
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,480
were so wonderful or we know so much.

126
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,700
Well, if that is all true and so good,

127
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,920
how well is it serving you?

128
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,840
The answer might be by most, not very well.

129
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,720
So then there has to be something uncommon

130
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,640
that is the underlying root of all these things.

131
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,720
And we would like to suggest that it's very simple

132
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,840
when you encounter anything, just ask what it's based on.

133
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,080
What could it be about, right?

134
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,660
What is the history of the thing or what does it mean?

135
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,540
You know, it's like being on a construction site.

136
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,020
You know, what does two feet mean?

137
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,540
Is there a reference?

138
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,600
You know, is there something that we can communicate?

139
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,840
What do these things mean?

140
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,000
What are they based on?

141
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,080
I was having a loose discussion about this with someone

142
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,500
and says, well, all that stuff's made up.

143
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,420
Anyway, all right, so let's just discount everything

144
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,200
that's come before us as being made up

145
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,720
so we can make up new things now.

146
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,160
I wanted to play something, Seth, regarding,

147
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,320
hmm, let me just put it this way.

148
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,320
Have you ever noticed when,

149
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,120
I'm gonna go back to what I wanna play.

150
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,520
It's called the Aesop's Fables, The Fox and the Grapes.

151
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,620
But just to preface, you ever hear on,

152
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,200
especially in alternative radio,

153
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,320
people like to use movie metaphors a lot?

154
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,340
Oh yeah.

155
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,180
And it sounds plausible, you know, why not?

156
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,340
You know, using a metaphor, an allegory is fine.

157
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,900
But after a while, you know, listening to this,

158
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,420
you know, they like to use the movie, The Matrix

159
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,780
and other current films, let's say that might be out.

160
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,700
I was like, okay, why are they stuck on that?

161
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,080
Oh, because that's all they know.

162
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,920
It's very interesting.

163
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,400
This goes back to the, when you look at the cultures

164
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,400
that have come before, people went to get information

165
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,100
from the circus or the public gatherings

166
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,080
and that's all they knew.

167
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,140
They seem to, there seems to be a disconnect.

168
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,760
But that's fine.

169
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,820
If at least they are making a metaphor.

170
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,820
But when you bring up anything regarding,

171
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,260
let's say any of the holy writs of the world,

172
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,780
any ancient texts, the people just tend to either

173
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,760
not wanna hear it or discount it as being works of fiction

174
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,100
or they wanna tell you what they believe it says, right?

175
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,560
Versus, you know, or some common accepted

176
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,360
erroneous explanation or lack thereof.

177
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,120
And the reason I gave the movie reference

178
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,000
is because the film Pulp Fiction,

179
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,420
I think it was Jules or someone,

180
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,680
right before he pops a cap in someone's ass,

181
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,260
he reads Ezekiel 25, 17 or something like that.

182
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,660
You remember that film?

183
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,100
I do.

184
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,500
I use that slang term by the way,

185
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,660
pops a cap and whatever, right?

186
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,440
What's interesting, I like to do Aesop's Fables

187
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,600
whenever I have a discussion with someone

188
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,540
that I recognize as an imbecile.

189
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,480
And by the way, if you guys know what Napoleonic law is,

190
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,880
you're guilty till proven innocent.

191
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,720
That's how that works.

192
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,420
You've got 7 billion imbeciles on the planet

193
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,380
and you have to prove that you're not one

194
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,040
and that's how you operate efficiently.

195
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,440
But by the way, I guess I did say that.

196
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,960
But before you address an imbecile further,

197
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,220
you ask them if they've ever heard of

198
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,200
the fox and the grapes and typically they say no.

199
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,700
But that's Aesop's Fables and Aesop's Fables,

200
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,340
like for example, have you heard of the tortoise and the hare?

201
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,940
These are like little children's,

202
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,200
now they've reserved them for children's stories, right?

203
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,020
That's Aesop.

204
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,200
And what's interesting about the fox and the grapes

205
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,820
is they typically reserve a lot of the fox

206
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,320
and the grapes type stories in Aesop's Fables for children.

207
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,220
That's interesting because they're not kids, folks,

208
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,100
they're just little people.

209
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,920
But Seth, what do you think?

210
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,460
Should I play, it's a short one minute YouTube

211
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,960
and you know, I feel a lot smarter,

212
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,360
I watched a YouTube today, man.

213
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:34,080
So if, yeah, all right, it's about 49 seconds or so

214
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,260
and we'll just do that, yeah.

215
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,280
We're not planning on uploading any of this stuff

216
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,120
for doing the YouTube thing.

217
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,560
So just to give credit anyway,

218
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,840
it's a YouTube channel called Free School.

219
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,660
The title is the fox and the grapes,

220
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,120
hyphen Aesop's Fables for kids, free school.

221
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,300
So here we go.

222
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,800
The fox and the grapes.

223
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,880
A hungry fox saw some fine bunches of grapes

224
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,340
hanging from a vine that was trained along a high trellis

225
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,400
and did his best to reach them.

226
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,960
He jumped and he jumped as high as he could,

227
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,040
but it was all in vain for they were just out of reach.

228
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,880
So he gave up trying and walked away

229
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,660
with an air of dignity and unconcern remarking,

230
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,180
I thought those grapes were ripe,

231
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,500
but I see now that they are quite sour.

232
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,060
The moral of this story is that it's easy to despise

233
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,260
something that you cannot have.

234
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,020
Interesting.

235
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,800
And I know we'll just tie that back into comprehension

236
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,480
and understanding and it's not that many things

237
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,380
are difficult to comprehend or understand,

238
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,820
it's that people don't want to.

239
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,120
It's the, I don't know, I don't want to know

240
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,480
and I don't care attitude

241
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,080
that has befallen society as a whole.

242
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,740
And this is a pretty general statement

243
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,980
that is fairly accurate.

244
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,360
And anyone can pretty much see that

245
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,180
it's accuracy holds true.

246
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:06,780
Go ahead.

247
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,580
I would throw in, I don't like it as well.

248
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,120
Yes.

249
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,300
Yes.

250
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,600
While they're like touching themselves

251
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,180
and they have a blank stare on their eye,

252
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,780
maybe a little drool, you know,

253
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,220
this is your typical earth inhabitant at the moment, folks.

254
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,920
And if you don't see it that way,

255
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,040
they're using a lot of makeup

256
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,640
and current fashions to cover it up.

257
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,140
But typically, you know, what's interesting,

258
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,180
the level of futility, I call the dummy load.

259
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,720
I've done a show on it,

260
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,760
well, an episode called the dummy load.

261
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,420
And dummy load is basically a device

262
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,400
that just takes energy away from a system

263
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,980
before it's put into use.

264
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,760
Like, for example, someone running a mile on a treadmill.

265
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,040
That treadmill actually represents a dummy load.

266
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,280
It takes, it allows the runner

267
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,540
to go through the action of running,

268
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,020
but they're not going anywhere, right?

269
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,220
Or the hamster wheel.

270
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,760
Or people tuning in to various forms of entertainment

271
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,780
or information-based situations.

272
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,340
And they actually leave with a feeling

273
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,900
but don't know anything still.

274
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,540
And nothing is ever even being said.

275
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,540
They're just being dummy loaded.

276
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,660
In other words, there's a desire for people to hear

277
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,800
and be up-to-date and current or communicate.

278
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,700
And what I'm suggesting,

279
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,120
and I'm gonna be safe to say it's a suggestion,

280
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,280
everything out there at the moment is a dummy load.

281
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,180
And what I mean by that

282
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,900
is if you try to look up good reference material even,

283
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,740
you're gonna have to sift through some stuff

284
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,320
other than, you know, stuff that's non-literary

285
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,440
like, you know, scales and measurements and things.

286
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:49,060
So, yeah, so this is, I guess, 24 hours a day

287
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,740
by the wind-up toy known as the clock

288
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,960
times seven days in a week is roughly 168 hours.

289
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,800
So you've got 166 hours of dummy loading

290
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,160
and you've got maybe two hours of uncommon sense

291
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,599
which tends to be dummy load-free.

292
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,940
That's not, I guess, less than 1% or so,

293
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,540
a little bit over 1%.

294
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,079
So about 99% of the time, folks, you're being dummy loaded.

295
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,420
So with that said,

296
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:20,319
just to go back to the fox and the grapes for a moment.

297
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,740
So that's, I guess, the recap on that

298
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,440
is when people find something

299
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,200
that might require too much work or investment of talk

300
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,640
or investment of time to discover,

301
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,720
and they seem that initially they can't understand it,

302
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,760
well, guess what?

303
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,660
That information may not be good anyway, right?

304
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,180
That seems to be the idea.

305
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,440
There's even information out there

306
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,200
that you can link to on the internet

307
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,060
that is poor in quality to be generous.

308
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,100
There's, you know, the dummy load, as you said,

309
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,260
it's relatively ever-present,

310
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:11,020
and especially now with the technology available

311
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,760
at a large portion of the world's population,

312
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,300
why are we not all geniuses now

313
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,660
with the world's libraries at our fingertips?

314
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:33,500
Why are we watching cats be cats on the internet?

315
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,780
And that's probably a poor example, but.

316
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,080
Yes, no, no, it's appropriate.

317
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,560
Because maybe the metaphor of the computer,

318
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,920
you know, you need an operating system

319
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,420
to then you download the programs and then the files.

320
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,440
These would be the files.

321
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,220
The files are all accessible, aren't they?

322
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,060
But if you don't have the correct operating system,

323
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,260
even with easy access to the files,

324
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,760
you're not going to be able to read them.

325
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,960
Yeah, or programs download.

326
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,980
So I've kind of discussed,

327
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,540
this might sound dogmatic to people,

328
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,640
that your operating system comes from your deity,

329
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,400
from your God.

330
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,720
That's something to think about.

331
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,180
And right away when you say anything like that,

332
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,300
it kind of rubs people the wrong way

333
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,200
because from an academic point of view,

334
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,480
let's use that word loosely,

335
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,980
you could pretty much say the entire world

336
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,800
is fairly atheist or pagan at this point.

337
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,400
By definition, that would be very accurate.

338
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,660
I would say they're just unacknowledging

339
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,920
the fact that they're agnostics, but.

340
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,060
Right, yeah.

341
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,400
Well, the reason I'm saying pagan

342
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,600
is because pagan means ignorant typically

343
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,280
or like so simple that there's no advancement.

344
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,320
It was kind of used to refer to like country bumpkins.

345
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:41,920
Yeah.

346
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,320
Back when it was first being used colloquially.

347
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,160
And there's different.

348
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,020
Shouldn't be uneducated.

349
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,300
You could put an attenuator knob on there,

350
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,660
how severe or how mild the term could be used.

351
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,660
But typically, yeah, country bumpkin or ignorant.

352
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,800
But the interesting thing is some ancient place

353
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,480
wrote that people will take the curse upon themselves

354
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,300
and now they're actually people proud of being pagan.

355
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,420
So that's, and actually,

356
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,160
if you discuss anything with those people,

357
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,260
they actually tell you that knowledge doesn't matter.

358
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,620
So it's kind of like easy to prove,

359
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,240
but pagan meaning ignorant.

360
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,760
And then when I say atheist means lack of or no God,

361
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,500
what I mean by that is when you try to discuss that

362
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,240
with anyone who is a participant

363
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,740
in any of the world religions,

364
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,860
asking them about their God or the God

365
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,260
or whatever they're talking about,

366
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,120
they seemingly have no information,

367
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,580
lack specifics to the point

368
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,600
where it's as if they're talking about nothing.

369
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,280
You're gonna notice that?

370
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,120
Ask anyone that's in the major faiths of the world,

371
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,100
what do you mean by God?

372
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,460
And they're like, well, you know, you know, God, man.

373
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,240
You know, God, you know, you know.

374
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,240
Which one?

375
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,200
Which one?

376
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,040
What do you mean, man?

377
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,560
Like the one, you know, the one, you know.

378
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,960
Do you have any information on it?

379
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:49,940
Nope.

380
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,280
Don't know, man.

381
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,480
You don't know.

382
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,380
All right, so that's why I mean they're atheists

383
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,420
because they have no information.

384
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,440
In other words, it's almost unidentifiable.

385
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,120
There's no referencing.

386
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,840
There's no, it's almost as if in the realm of fiction,

387
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,320
right?

388
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,380
So that's why I mean they're predominantly atheists

389
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,900
by analysis, by the way.

390
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,200
You know, if you're examining the thing, you know.

391
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,440
Absolutely.

392
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:15,340
We're.

393
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,340
Well, semi-absolutely

394
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,900
because I had to really give those definitions away.

395
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,160
You know, the analysis might work out,

396
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,100
but yeah.

397
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,440
So yeah, Seth, do you remember

398
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,540
forwarding some of those messages?

399
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,680
What did you, did you read any of them

400
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,780
or did you kind of go into it a little bit?

401
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,420
What do you think of it?

402
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,360
I did.

403
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,920
It's, again, you know, it's pleasant to receive

404
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,420
such things as feedback,

405
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,460
even if it's, you know, few and far between.

406
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,140
It's good to know that there are people out there

407
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,640
or there is a person even out there

408
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,900
listening and wanting to know more.

409
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,100
You did mention the Ocelli and the Greek program,

410
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,920
which some of the questions that were brought up

411
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,220
in one of the emails or a couple of the emails recently

412
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,300
were addressed, you know, with more,

413
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,480
more comprehensively in talks that you've had

414
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,500
with Ocelli in the past.

415
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,340
So if you, I would strongly recommend

416
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,240
pointing people in that direction

417
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,860
just because you and I have spoken to each other,

418
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:34,300
you know, over the last two and a half, three years

419
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,800
extensively publicly and privately.

420
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,760
And so we're, you know, more familiar

421
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,060
with a lot of the subject matter that we're discussing

422
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,800
and we do try and make it accessible

423
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,940
for those who desire to listen

424
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,920
and perhaps learn a little bit.

425
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,160
But at the same time, for us to go back

426
00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:01,140
and rehash everything, you know, verbatim over and over

427
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,540
is, it can be kind of frustrating

428
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,420
because then it's like talking to a wall.

429
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,240
So there are recorded conversations out there

430
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,220
that can be accessed.

431
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,540
Is the website ocelliandthegreek.com?

432
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,080
Yes.

433
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,140
Spell that, would you spell that?

434
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:26,620
O-C-H-E-L-L-I-A-N-D-T-H-E-G-R-E-E-K.com.

435
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,500
By the way, just to cut in there for a moment,

436
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,340
it's called redundancy and it seems to be

437
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,100
one of the necessary aspects

438
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,460
for the surface dwelling earth inhabitant, right?

439
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,680
Over just repeating.

440
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,260
One of the, if you go through the email set,

441
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,920
if you look at some of the responses

442
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,640
for the past year or so or less

443
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,960
that I've given is, discussed this already,

444
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,020
please go to archives,

445
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,180
would be 90% of the responses that I give.

446
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,160
So I would say that redundancy is important.

447
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,600
Repetition, but you see, there's two types of that.

448
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,080
One is, is the repetition required

449
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,240
like working out in the gym

450
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,920
where an atrophied muscle starts to gain strength and grow?

451
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:09,900
You see?

452
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,020
Or like doing reps, you know, in a gym?

453
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,180
Does it make someone stronger

454
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,700
or is it because it eludes them

455
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,040
and they can't hear it in the beginning

456
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,520
and then they have to go hear it again?

457
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,080
Almost like as if, you know,

458
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,200
you ever watch a movie twice

459
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,880
and you see things you didn't see the first time

460
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,720
or read a book twice

461
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,860
and notice things that you didn't read before.

462
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,580
So either way, there's no fault, it's fine.

463
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,300
But it does seem to be required.

464
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,940
Yeah, and memory is, you know,

465
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,160
my own powers of memory are not as apt

466
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,240
as a lot of people that I speak with, actually.

467
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,100
So, you know, there is definitely value in the repetition.

468
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,840
That's, you know, that's a learning tool.

469
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,900
But at the same time, you know, like I said,

470
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,780
just being aware that there are

471
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,840
some archived programs out there

472
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,680
that people can go to for just a little bit more

473
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,480
comprehensive than we get into sometimes.

474
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,040
And there, I mean, you know, we,

475
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,660
again, we visit a lot of the same subjects

476
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,300
and we do get into things relatively comprehensively.

477
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,620
And if there, you know, again,

478
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,800
I do encourage people to reach out and email us

479
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,460
and with any, you know, questions or clarity

480
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,200
and we will respond as we can

481
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,540
or direct you somewhere

482
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,440
where you might be able to find that, so.

483
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,880
Now, without actually going into the email itself

484
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,720
specifically, the topics there, you know, being asked

485
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,920
are sort of a blend between political notions

486
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,420
and quote, unquote, spiritual ones,

487
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,960
meaning of the mind or of the gods, the realm of the gods.

488
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,920
You know, there's gotta be an easier way to sell that,

489
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,480
say that, basically the realm of the world

490
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,160
or society of the gods, let's say.

491
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,700
It crosses back and forth.

492
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,560
And one comment, and it could be taken as advice,

493
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,180
it could be taken as a comment for something to observe

494
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,400
and say, hmm, about, is you ever notice how people

495
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,600
that claim to be, have a strong faith

496
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,740
or subscribe to a particular religion

497
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,360
tend to blame the goings on in the actual physical reality

498
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,120
on their government or politicians

499
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:28,780
as if the gods have nothing to do with it.

500
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,420
So for example, I'll just use, you know,

501
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,800
a Christian fundamentalist, right,

502
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,600
is extremely concerned about the political condition

503
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,680
and is highly politically active.

504
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,800
The quote, unquote, born again Christians

505
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,840
are very politically active as if that matters.

506
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,540
The hypocrisy is just amazing.

507
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,540
So are you either, are you crediting the gods

508
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:56,220
with influence on this existence or with your mouth,

509
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,120
but your actions and other things you say

510
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,360
completely discredit the influence of the gods

511
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,480
and it's really some politician

512
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,060
that's actually been put there by the gods

513
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,180
to rule over you, by the way.

514
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,080
Isn't it interesting, do you ever find that,

515
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:12,960
do you ever notice that?

516
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,900
Absolutely, but then again, I view these groups

517
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,920
for what they appear to be and it's just social clubs

518
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,620
with varying constitutions of membership

519
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,340
and things like that, that they spell out

520
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,560
what they believe and why they believe it, baseless.

521
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:34,680
Yeah, baseless.

522
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,020
There's no basis to it.

523
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,600
But so I'm not, I'm less and less surprised

524
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,620
as time goes on.

525
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,380
It's not whether you and I do it,

526
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,380
it's just an interesting thing that should be pieced

527
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:51,100
together succinctly for the listenership.

528
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,320
Just to repeat it, watch how people that profess

529
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,840
to be adherents to a particular religion

530
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,560
or believe in God, because you can't say particular God

531
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,280
because they don't know anything about that seemingly.

532
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,080
If they did, they wouldn't be part of that religion.

533
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:11,200
How they are attributing the significance of politics

534
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,700
in their life and being the root cause of things.

535
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,780
You still hear people complaining about the Federal Reserve

536
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,580
and how the Federal Reserve, my favorite, by the way,

537
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,040
is we have to abolish the Federal Reserve.

538
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,540
Or there was a political figure that was insinuating

539
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,580
it should be audited.

540
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,700
You just gotta laugh at that, you know.

541
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,940
Federal Reserve isn't going anywhere, folks.

542
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,900
It's gonna be here till the end.

543
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,220
Yes, it will.

544
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,040
Why?

545
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,980
Because it is simply accommodating you.

546
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,020
Yes, it's accommodating you.

547
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,120
You love that kind of stuff, unlawful stuff.

548
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:51,760
How do I know?

549
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,140
Well, any time you look around,

550
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,160
you see people engaged in unlawful activity.

551
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,420
Something to do with legal or not.

552
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
It's just like you ask people,

553
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,820
why are they doing something they don't know?

554
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,840
Everyone else is doing it.

555
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,940
Which I like to hearken back to Gustav Le Bon,

556
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:08,540
I think we got into it pretty heavily last episode,

557
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,200
let's say.

558
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,580
Yeah, we touched on it across a couple of episodes,

559
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,540
actually, but it's worth repeating.

560
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,280
Yeah, someone, actually I've gotten some messages,

561
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,700
people ordered it on Amazon or such.

562
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,820
I'm not promoting it, but I'm just using it as a reference.

563
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,440
And by the way, it is available as an audio book, free.

564
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,440
And I do recommend audio books

565
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,300
because that was actually the lawful way

566
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,880
of engaging in literary works, by the way.

567
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,240
It wasn't until the 1500s or so

568
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,040
where silent reading was encouraged.

569
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,820
But prior to that, it was all reading out loud,

570
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:41,780
even if you were alone.

571
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:45,220
So an audio book tends to be in accord

572
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,020
with the way things were done for a very, very long time.

573
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,060
I am, I'm a big fan of audio books, actually.

574
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,220
I work with my hands,

575
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,340
but a lot of the work that I do is repetitious

576
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:02,860
and doesn't require a lot of vigilant thought.

577
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:06,360
So I'm able to read while my hands

578
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,240
and my eyes are busy doing other things.

579
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,640
And it's, over the last few years,

580
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,320
I've accumulated somewhere upwards of 70 audio books.

581
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,040
Most of them are just entertaining,

582
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:24,120
but I've gotten a lot of what they refer to as nonfiction,

583
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,140
which that's questionable.

584
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:32,040
But it's a, so you're someone who finds yourself busy,

585
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,400
but have the ability to listen to music or whatever

586
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,240
while you're doing your work,

587
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,440
consider downloading some audio books.

588
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,400
You can find them all over the internet for free

589
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,820
if you're tech savvy.

590
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,280
And there are companies out there that provide them as well

591
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,160
for relatively low cost and things like that.

592
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,920
And I enjoy them.

593
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,360
I do wanna, we did get a question in the Ustream chat.

594
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,420
I'm just gonna read verbatim here.

595
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,040
But it says, would you consider prayer as a patch

596
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,140
or upgrade to the operating system?

597
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,500
Continuing on with that metaphor.

598
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,840
I find my programs degrade without regular prayer.

599
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,020
Popular media is like meditation on the lower entities.

600
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:23,720
It is, well, look, very simply, prayer is a technology.

601
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,580
Just like if you joined the military,

602
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,160
I like to give military analogies.

603
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,860
As a radio officer, you're handed a radio

604
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,720
and you're shown how to operate it.

605
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,760
It's very simple.

606
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,520
And the thing is, what's interesting,

607
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:40,000
let's just go back for the Christian meme,

608
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,540
that culture, because it is a culture, it's a secular thing.

609
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,980
They pray in public and they're actually,

610
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,100
their leaders tell them, let's pray.

611
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:49,960
Have you heard that, Laura?

612
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,760
Let's pray at the dinner table, right?

613
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,300
People gonna say, well, Greg, what's wrong with that?

614
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:53,920
It sounds good.

615
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,000
Well, it sounds good, right?

616
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,720
But here's the point.

617
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,220
If you look at the text that they allegedly

618
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,800
supposed to be subscribing to, it forbids that.

619
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,000
It actually shows that as being something

620
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,140
that you don't do, right?

621
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,000
And if you study the architecture of places

622
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,300
that were lawful, temples, prayer areas

623
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:21,080
were small, sequestered things

624
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,540
that people didn't do it in public.

625
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,540
And this goes across the board.

626
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,140
You will see this in all the holy rites of the world.

627
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,280
I'm using that term loosely,

628
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,840
that prayer is something that's always done privately.

629
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:37,560
Just like, that would be the technical analysis of it,

630
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,720
how to technically access it correctly.

631
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,380
But most people, again, oh, I don't like that,

632
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,240
doesn't sound good.

633
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,240
What's wrong with praying at the dinner table?

634
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,500
What's wrong with it, right?

635
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,500
It's like, well, okay, just go ahead and make stuff up.

636
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,040
How's that working out for you?

637
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,240
I would, to further the technology metaphor,

638
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,800
I would suggest that there's a fair portion

639
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,680
of the population currently walking around

640
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,520
with dumb phones in their pockets,

641
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,080
which are little computers that are.

642
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,860
But hold on, hold on, they're not dumb phones.

643
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,680
They actually are smartphone relative to the user,

644
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,160
but go ahead.

645
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,260
But these little pieces of technology

646
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,560
that we use to communicate,

647
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,720
you can access the internet,

648
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,700
all sorts of things that you can do with them,

649
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,420
communication-wise, to take photos, things like that.

650
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,460
There's no one out there who knows anything

651
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:34,920
about the human body that would suggest

652
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,100
that these devices are more technologically advanced

653
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:43,040
than these bodies that we're animating.

654
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,660
Walking around in.

655
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:52,380
So to just as a further lending a little bit credence,

656
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,540
I suppose, to the idea of the prayer

657
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,440
as it's written about, at least,

658
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,000
being something technological.

659
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:07,400
We are capable, or these bodies, I would say,

660
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,000
are capable of things that we are not aware of.

661
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,880
Not that the information is not provided

662
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,520
in various forms, in various places,

663
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,980
throughout various times,

664
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,060
but just that we get blinded by the flashing light.

665
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,040
We like pretty things.

666
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,860
Or the cosmic censorship,

667
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,659
which I've gotten into quite a bit.

668
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,739
If the gods wanna censor you, you're censored.

669
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,219
And by the way, you said we were gonna read the email.

670
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,520
I've been glancing through it, Seth,

671
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,820
and actually, we've generally and specifically answered

672
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,260
all those emails because,

673
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,840
well, there were several emails that I was gonna address.

674
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:52,260
There was a mixture of the world of the gods

675
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,139
and the world of mankind.

676
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,040
And I just suggested that there shouldn't be any mixing.

677
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,880
You're either attributing the reality and responsibility

678
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,040
to the causality that you're experiencing,

679
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,660
control of reality, to the gods or to mankind.

680
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,160
But you can't do both from a formative way,

681
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,980
from a primary way.

682
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,340
Primarily, it's the gods that are doing everything.

683
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,540
Secondary, it's being manifested by mankind, right?

684
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,240
And where there's a lesson.

685
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:21,820
Yeah, yeah.

686
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:27,080
And there's an access to free will within that.

687
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,620
And it's a micro, not a macro free will.

688
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,120
And I think I've given that analogy with the cruise ship,

689
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,140
which is a cruise ship going from London to New York,

690
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:35,780
for example.

691
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:35,880
And it's a cruise ship going from London to New York.

692
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,720
And while everyone on that ship

693
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,180
is going from London to New York,

694
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,660
but while you're on the cruise ship,

695
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,440
you have a choice over the duration of the journey

696
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,220
to go on the top deck, lower decks,

697
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,580
go to the theater, the food court,

698
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,320
go to your cabin and relax.

699
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,760
Or, great, let's hear free will.

700
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,780
But the general scope of things

701
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,220
tend to be moved by the divine direction,

702
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,360
which people don't like to look at.

703
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,880
And we kind of discuss this in a way we're not discussing.

704
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,420
I don't think what we're discussing, Seth,

705
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,760
is accommodating the masses,

706
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,940
but it's accommodating maybe the four or five listeners.

707
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,860
Which, in one aspect,

708
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,380
actually dedicating a two-hour time slot

709
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:18,800
on an internet radio is kind of like overdoing it

710
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,380
for four or five listeners.

711
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:22,580
But nonetheless, who knows who might hear something

712
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,940
that might spark something off, plant a seed.

713
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,140
But just to go back to the cosmic censorship

714
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,720
and how the spark and things that,

715
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,720
if you're being censored cosmically by the divine force,

716
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,340
there's no way you're going to see it

717
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,180
if they decide to censor you on a subject

718
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,080
or for your whole life, for example.

719
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,820
I think there's even a couple of things written

720
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,480
that if I open a door, no one can close it.

721
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,680
And if I close a door, no one can open it, right?

722
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,940
So, yeah.

723
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,300
Yeah, and that's from the divine perspective.

724
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,980
But from even the cosmic censorship,

725
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,120
I mean, that's just a very simple way to explain it.

726
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,880
But if you don't acknowledge

727
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,880
that the gods are in control to a certain degree,

728
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,760
if not primarily the controllers,

729
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,620
you will not, the rest of it is meaningless, obviously.

730
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,140
Because again, we just said that most people

731
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,860
that tend to have faith or subscribe

732
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,140
to a particular religious affiliation

733
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,020
tend to always blame or have the inherent blame

734
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:32,520
of their woes and ills on someone else,

735
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,420
meaning of man or political or whatever.

736
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,900
Yes, they will dispense it,

737
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,020
but they are not the primary reason for it.

738
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,900
Well, actually the primary reason that goes around.

739
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,460
And by the way, Seth, you know,

740
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,080
I've been getting some questions like,

741
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,900
what is the meaning of this whole thing, you know?

742
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,500
This whole existence.

743
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,720
And I usually tell people in private,

744
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,400
but I'll just run it by in public

745
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,520
because, you know, there was a saying once,

746
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,760
if you wanna hide something from people,

747
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,120
put it in the public library.

748
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,860
So if you wanna keep a secret,

749
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,420
might as well just say it on radio, right?

750
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,900
Or what's called, you know, radio.

751
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,060
It's very simple, folks.

752
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:17,580
The concept of having the mind or the spirit animated

753
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,260
by a soul and a body.

754
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,760
And I mean what I just said accurately,

755
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,500
meaning that if you remove the soul and the body,

756
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,740
the spirit goes into unanimation, right?

757
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,740
Unconsciousness, which was another message

758
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:33,780
we got about consciousness.

759
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,520
But okay, so the thing is,

760
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,760
people are so impressed with big numbers

761
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,320
and the relative duration of their lifespan

762
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,140
to the relative duration of things.

763
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,680
The gods find that putting a spirit into,

764
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,760
in other words, melding spirit and material together

765
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,800
and have spirit animated by material, you know, biological,

766
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,180
is the highest form of creation.

767
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,180
But not only will they prototype or run this

768
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,580
for a year or two or three,

769
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,400
or do it once or twice or a million times,

770
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,940
they do it for billions of times and for a long time.

771
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,080
This is not an experiment,

772
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,120
but it is just to show that a spirit

773
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,040
can be animated through material.

774
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,520
That's all it is, folks.

775
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,420
That's why you're still subject to death.

776
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,480
You're subject to death.

777
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,520
And in the future, you won't be subject to death.

778
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,400
And that's like the next level of things.

779
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,760
That's basically the meaning of all this stuff going on.

780
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,440
The only thing is people are still simply impressed

781
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,300
by big numbers.

782
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,440
And I kind of touched that point.

783
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,780
You know, they're like, very often you hear,

784
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,840
well, there's 7 billion of us and so few of them,

785
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,900
meaning them, you know, of course,

786
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,640
the politicians or the rich oligarchs

787
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,160
that are making everyone's life miserable, allegedly.

788
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,480
And they're so impressed by these big numbers.

789
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:55,000
And those numbers mean not much

790
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,220
because having very large numbers

791
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:00,300
and long durations of time is very common in creation.

792
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,340
That's why I've kind of said very often,

793
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,920
just because there's 7 billion people on the planet

794
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,220
doesn't mean that there's any significance

795
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,460
of quality there.

796
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,720
There's a significance of the number.

797
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,260
But I assure you the quality is very low,

798
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,800
even though they semi-automatically conceive and reproduce.

799
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,440
How do you know it's very low?

800
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,340
Just look around.

801
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,860
When was the last time you've been outside?

802
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,600
When was the last time you turned on the internet?

803
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,280
When was the last time you turned on TV or the radio?

804
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,900
You getting any quality?

805
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,760
Answer that honestly, you will say no.

806
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,660
You wanna make excuses for it, go ahead.

807
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,960
It's not why I'm saying it.

808
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,560
It's very objective, very low quality at this point.

809
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:41,800
Why?

810
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,200
Because you're subject to this entropic existence,

811
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,300
which will be lifted and changed,

812
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,680
which is almost unimaginable.

813
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,020
It's very difficult to even imagine no entropy

814
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,020
in the universe or in existence,

815
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,160
meaning death at this point.

816
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,780
So that's pretty much the meaning of everything, guys.

817
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,780
It's very simple and it's not because I say so

818
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,280
or who am I to say that?

819
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,060
Well, you could say it

820
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,480
if you just do a little bit of homework.

821
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:10,860
And are you able to observe things objectively?

822
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,200
Can you objectify and what are they based on?

823
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:21,100
Well, we got a couple more comments in the chat here.

824
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,560
It's pleasant to see that that's being utilized.

825
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,500
But this is kind of a specific question

826
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:33,200
that doesn't really, I'm just gonna read it.

827
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,560
It says, arguably, Nebuchadnezzar's vision

828
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,880
of all the empires of the world places us

829
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,780
at the iron, quote unquote, or Roman empire.

830
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,520
What do you think the feat mixed of iron

831
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,860
and clay empire will be, question mark?

832
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,800
Well, it's defined.

833
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,500
Well, yes, you can think about it

834
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:53,360
once you discover the definition, correct.

835
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,280
Yes, you see how we could take apart a question

836
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,100
and actually the answer, right, is in the question.

837
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,080
By the way, the questions always come before the answers

838
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,280
and the solutions come before the problems

839
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,640
because if it was the reverse,

840
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,580
the entire universe would just fall apart.

841
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,820
It's there to make balance.

842
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:13,680
But what one thinks should be based on something

843
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,340
and it should be clearly defined and interpreted correctly.

844
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,820
And by the way, there's only one interpretation of a thing,

845
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,540
but there are many versions, right?

846
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,300
For example, this is kind of a spinoff answer here,

847
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,540
but if you're a prime minister going to speak publicly

848
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,580
in a foreign country, you bring an interpreter.

849
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,860
You better say what you're saying

850
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,880
as accurately as humanly possible.

851
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,860
Now, if you bring up something like Nebuchadnezzar,

852
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,360
and iron and the mixed feet and toes,

853
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:46,840
you could bet that, well, I shouldn't say bet,

854
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,000
that's not lawful, but you would,

855
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,320
I could pretty much assure you

856
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,000
that the answer is within that same text.

857
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,840
So now the answer is, should we spoonfeed this individual

858
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,740
or the public on what the meaning of that is?

859
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,380
And what do you think, Seth?

860
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,640
Should we just spoonfeed that?

861
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,160
Or should we just let them be

862
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,200
that they will find the answer

863
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,320
if they keep looking at what they formed the question out of?

864
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:10,060
What do you think?

865
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,460
Just give an answer to it?

866
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,100
Yeah, I think an answer.

867
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,080
Yeah, absolutely.

868
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,840
Very simply, you will see there are kingdoms there

869
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,320
that were resolved through a dream.

870
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,540
And the final one is a Middle East Union

871
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,500
that is the precursors of it.

872
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,780
The precursors of the precursors

873
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,980
are being put in place right now.

874
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,960
A Middle East Union, meaning a loose confederacy

875
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,660
of roughly 10 nations in the Middle East is what that is.

876
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,420
And that's why they, unlike the other kingdoms,

877
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,260
it's iron mixed with clay.

878
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,120
In other words, it holds them in position,

879
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,360
but it has very little structural integrity

880
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:53,520
because its purpose is to support all the others, right?

881
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,740
So, you know, and of course,

882
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,300
many quote unquote religious circles,

883
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,160
which absolutely cannot define anything,

884
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:03,180
tell you that it is a European Union, right?

885
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,040
But it doesn't quite make sense that way

886
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,020
because for first of all, the gods don't act in futility

887
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,620
and the chief God doesn't either.

888
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,420
And if you go down the line

889
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,660
and you look at the communication that's been given there,

890
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,780
it's basically the same stories given over and over and over

891
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,620
over a long period of time.

892
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,920
Attesting once again to the validity of repetition,

893
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:23,500
I suppose.

894
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:24,680
Yes, yes.

895
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:28,440
And where one picks up where the other one left off.

896
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:30,280
So that requires harmony, but very simply,

897
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,420
giving a very simple,

898
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,840
the text says it's very simple by the way,

899
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,720
but the text also tells you most people will be censored.

900
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,480
And that's another thing we just kind of briefly discussed.

901
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,900
And in regards to that, actually,

902
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,120
another listener in the chat asks,

903
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,440
in regards to cosmic censorship,

904
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,380
or I should say states that in regards

905
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,080
to cosmic censorship, I can attest to its validity.

906
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,720
Made the mistake of broadcasting widely and loudly

907
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,460
my intention to change the world

908
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,840
and paid the price rather dearly.

909
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,040
The question being, can one maintain these sentiments

910
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,440
quietly and silently and make them so?

911
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:13,580
I would say that you can't really do something quietly

912
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,960
and silently at the same time,

913
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:22,440
but broadcasting with the intent to change the world

914
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,740
would be kind of-

915
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,120
Inefficient.

916
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,300
Missing, well, inefficient and sort of missing the,

917
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,180
I don't know if there is a singular point

918
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,040
to the discussion that we're having

919
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,780
other than to encourage people to think

920
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,020
in an uncommon manner perhaps.

921
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:46,720
But that seeking out the idea of changing the world

922
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,000
is probably not a good thing to do.

923
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,500
If you want to change the world in a positive manner,

924
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,960
you could sweep your front porch

925
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,180
or you could help someone out that needs it.

926
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:07,440
But beyond that, it's, and I hate using the word,

927
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,380
but it's like a fallacy of egoism.

928
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,680
Well, setting yourself apart, Seth, is the solution.

929
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:21,200
But here's the thing, if everyone set themselves apart

930
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,160
from stuff that's crappy, then the crappy stuff goes away.

931
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:25,440
Right.

932
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:27,920
There's no reason to change it.

933
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,040
It's going to change regardless.

934
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,380
But the thing, here's the point about the efficiency.

935
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,300
If you know these things are going to happen,

936
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,900
so you have to understand what's coming.

937
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,700
If you don't, you'll be acting inefficiently.

938
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:41,080
It's kind of like you want to go on a cross-country trip

939
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,380
and the gas tank in the car is near E, right?

940
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,820
And you think you're not going to make it.

941
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,480
Well, actually you can, there's certain technologies

942
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:50,140
you can apply, but that's another discussion.

943
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,100
You're not going to make, so do you, right?

944
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,800
If you're going to bake a cake

945
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,700
or if you're going to do something,

946
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,660
you pretty much are familiar with its outcome.

947
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,840
But when it comes to things regarding the world

948
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:05,860
and big things, people tend to not want to look at that.

949
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:09,700
It's very easy to see, well, simple, not easy,

950
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,680
what's coming in the future.

951
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,760
And if you know what's coming and it can't be changed

952
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,280
because it's prophetic, and by the way,

953
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:20,500
a lot of morons say, well, we can change prophecy.

954
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,680
Well, if you could change it, then it wouldn't be prophecy.

955
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,020
Then it would be a certain scenario,

956
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,040
you know, and if this, then that, right?

957
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,120
Can't change prophecy, folks, that's why it's prophecy.

958
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:35,080
But anyway, if you understand prophecy

959
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,320
or understand what's going to happen,

960
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:37,440
you act very efficiently.

961
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,780
In other words, if you're going to bake a cake

962
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,020
and you know it needs 45 minutes in the oven

963
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,320
at a certain temperature, if you take it out

964
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,540
after five minutes wondering why it's not done,

965
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,760
it's no one's fault but yours.

966
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,340
Because you obviously don't know anything

967
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:55,140
about baking cakes, right?

968
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,660
So if you're going around thinking

969
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,240
you have to change the world or things,

970
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,380
are they going to get better or get worse

971
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,620
or what's coming in the future,

972
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,780
you don't know about prophecy.

973
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,240
You don't know about things that will come.

974
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,780
And by the way, the reason it's called prophecy

975
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,080
is because it doesn't change.

976
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,980
There are mechanisms in nature that show you time.

977
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,240
Like for example, it's in the stars, have you heard that?

978
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,160
You know, or in the cards, various forms of divination.

979
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,240
Those things tend to have a certain degree of accuracy,

980
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,660
but with the purpose of prophecy

981
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:26,000
is to show you the anomalies where that machine breaks down.

982
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,080
You know, it's very clear to see anyone

983
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,720
who works with metal in alchemy

984
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,340
that the certain planets rule over certain metals

985
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:38,560
like Mars rules over iron, the moon rules over silver,

986
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,420
lead is ruled by Saturn, right?

987
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,000
But that's another discussion again.

988
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,160
So, there's a level of efficiency.

989
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:52,540
The problem is right now all the information regarding prophecy that's put

990
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:56,640
out is either accurate in small little pieces or just absolutely incorrect.

991
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:01,000
And it's easy to say that, and you could say that with confidence

992
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,360
if you actually do the research.

993
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:11,160
So, I want to play, yeah, I want to play something, Seth, because another YouTube,

994
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,000
I hope everyone feels smarter since we're playing a couple of YouTubes.

995
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:22,480
This is, in short, we've been talking about a Middle East Union that's going

996
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,180
to be formed in the near future.

997
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:28,420
It's a very loose confederacy, just like the iron and clay, for example.

998
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:36,280
And one of the requirements is about 10 nations, but if you look at the count

999
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,580
or by name how many there are right now, there are only about nine of them in existence.

1000
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,680
The 10th one is not in existence yet.

1001
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:47,340
And the one we're speaking of, by the way, this is where things are quiet,

1002
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:56,060
not noisy in the news, is a nation called Assyria, not Syria, Assyria, A-S-S-Y-R-I-A.

1003
00:49:56,180 --> 00:50:00,380
Yes, there are a group of people known as the Assyrians, and they haven't had a country

1004
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:06,960
in about 2,300 or so years, and one of the reasons why is because if they did remain

1005
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,060
as a national body, there probably wouldn't be anyone left today

1006
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:12,260
because their primary industry was war.

1007
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:19,340
So, anyway, what I want to play, I'll just click on this here, I'll open it.

1008
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:24,440
It's Chris Bowen, B-O-W-E-N-M-P.

1009
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:32,020
He is in the Australian Parliament, and the YouTube is called Chris Bowen, Assyrian Motion.

1010
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,840
And I'm going to start it at around 420 or so.

1011
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:42,200
And he proposes something, and you know how we've said when things are planted, it's quiet,

1012
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,700
and everyone tends to like to look where the distraction or the noise is.

1013
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:54,160
So, I'm going to start playing this for about a minute, and listen to it, these folks,

1014
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,080
because it's a parliament, and this person standing up,

1015
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:01,360
his name is Chris Bowen, starts proposing, okay, at the Australian Parliament.

1016
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,340
...chance of a new life in Australia.

1017
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:11,980
This is the problem, Deputy Speaker, but of course, we must have a view to the solution.

1018
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:17,500
Having looked at this issue over many years, having worked with the Assyrian Kaldane communities,

1019
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:22,320
having done much in relation to working with the Australian government

1020
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:27,900
and the successive foreign ministers, Smith, Rudd, and Carr on this issue,

1021
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:34,540
I've reached a view that the only sustainable solution is an autonomous region within Iraq,

1022
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,660
administered by Kaldanes and the Syrians.

1023
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:42,360
Okay, I'm going to play that one more time, okay?

1024
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:49,040
...government and the successive foreign ministers, Smith, Rudd, and Carr on this issue,

1025
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:55,680
I've reached a view that the only sustainable solution is an autonomous region within Iraq,

1026
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,760
administered by Kaldanes and the Syrians.

1027
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:04,260
In the northwest of Iraq lies the Nineveh Plains, a 4,000 square kilometer area

1028
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:08,200
that is believed and is the traditional heartland of the Assyrian people.

1029
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:13,440
The majority of its population is Christian, including many displaced Assyrians

1030
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,560
who've come to the Nineveh Plains...

1031
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:18,660
Well, you guys get the point, hopefully.

1032
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:24,980
Now, that was not broadcast anywhere on mainstream or alternative media, was it, Seth?

1033
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,200
No.

1034
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:33,120
And it won't be, because the stuff you hear on mainstream and alternative is where the noise is.

1035
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:36,100
And that's where the imbeciles go, oops, did I say that? Yes.

1036
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:41,560
So, you always distract an imbecile with a noisy situation.

1037
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:47,180
That's why circuses and carnivals and shows and movies tend to be noisy and loud.

1038
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,520
And also, if you combine that with...

1039
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:56,480
By the way, combine that with Libon, the crowd, if you think I use harsh language, he does as well.

1040
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:00,100
The typical person who joins a crowd is considered an imbecile.

1041
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,880
You have to be, essentially.

1042
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,580
But, so, you're not hearing anything.

1043
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,920
Well, you do hear a lot of things.

1044
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,040
Unfortunately, no one is listening to anything.

1045
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,960
They tend to repeat things that they've heard somewhere else.

1046
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:17,040
And just a comment on the alternative media, we kind of always do that,

1047
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:21,280
is that now they've gotten to the point where they are self-consuming,

1048
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,840
where they're actually going to each other for their research.

1049
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,680
They're in a self-consuming, dog-chasing-its-tail point.

1050
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,700
So, anyway, we will be back after the break,

1051
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:40,580
and we will perhaps get into some more uncommon things with the Greek and Seth Michael,

1052
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,060
here at AFR and streaming anywhere else we can.

1053
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,200
Absolutely. We have a couple more questions, even, that have popped up in the chat.

1054
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,280
We'll address after the break.

1055
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,800
And, yeah, like the Greek said, thank you for being out there and listening,

1056
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:55,940
and we'll be right back.

1057
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,540
Greetings, everyone.

1058
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:05,800
Yes, welcome back to Uncommon Sense here on AFR, AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

1059
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:08,500
Thanks for being out there and listening.

1060
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,320
I'm Seth, and I'm here with the Greek.

1061
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:19,360
You can find us on the interweb at UncommonRadio.com,

1062
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:25,220
spelled just completely normal, www.UncommonRadio.com,

1063
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:30,400
and you can find a number of ways to get into contact with us there, if you would like to.

1064
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:37,900
We're also broadcasting on uStream.tv forward slash channel forward slash second hyphen foundation.

1065
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:41,180
I know that's a mouthful, but...

1066
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:45,500
Or they can just go to the www.UncommonRadio.com and click on the uStream.

1067
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,200
It'll be easiest way to be brought to it.

1068
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:47,900
Absolutely.

1069
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,720
Yeah, cool.

1070
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:58,240
We should mention that AFR is, you know, carrying the program here and broadcasting us,

1071
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:04,860
and that they can certainly use the help if you like what you're hearing,

1072
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:10,300
if you enjoy the program, if you're actually listening and learning something.

1073
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:20,460
You can go to AmericanFreedomRadio.com and follow the links through to support them in any way that you can,

1074
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,180
and we encourage you to do that.

1075
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:24,920
Yep, they could definitely use it.

1076
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,020
They don't do all this for themselves.

1077
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,120
They do it so everyone else can tune in.

1078
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:34,980
So, speaking of tuning in, I think we might have more, we might have been informed

1079
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,000
there might be more than four or five people listening,

1080
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:41,160
but nonetheless, we carry on as if there are only four or five people listening,

1081
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:45,900
because the interesting thing is, if you do carry on with a lot of the things that you hear here,

1082
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:53,100
and you actually impose it upon yourself to do some research and find out what we are telling you is look-upable,

1083
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,700
based on something, lawful,

1084
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:00,960
and you start repeating this to your average surface-dwelling earth inhabitant,

1085
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:03,100
you will find yourself alone.

1086
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:08,120
You will not make friends with this type of conversation.

1087
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:09,140
I assure you that.

1088
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:12,480
Now, there are friends to be made, friends to be had,

1089
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:18,900
but this is generally not the way to start it off unless you are encountering someone extremely special.

1090
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:24,740
So, we wanted to maybe address the question of the soul and the spirit again.

1091
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:29,020
I think that wouldn't be a bad thing to kind of bring up, not because we say it,

1092
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:33,800
but because whoever listens and does a little bit of work will also discover it to be true.

1093
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:41,660
Simply said, Seth, the spirit is the mind, the soul is your breath, as in inhaling, exhaling,

1094
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,120
and the body is the body.

1095
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,920
Now, these things are assembled technically in a biological way,

1096
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,880
what we are still seemingly can't understand completely.

1097
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,940
It's just a technology, folks, and it's a technology of the gods that you're witnessing,

1098
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:02,420
and obviously, if you're not acknowledging it as such, you are censored,

1099
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:07,200
and everyone has a little bit of censorship because the last thing you want to do is be fully aware.

1100
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:12,040
Actually, if you were fully aware and kept your cool about it and rational,

1101
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,860
you would pretty much leave this stinking rock.

1102
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:20,280
Yes, it is a beautiful planet, but what mankind is doing is pretty stinky.

1103
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,000
So anyway, I'll digress from that.

1104
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:26,820
Anything else we should bring up, Seth, regarding the questions?

1105
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:35,440
Well, I know we don't do this often, but something that might be of help

1106
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,500
to at least one or two of the people out there listening,

1107
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:45,380
where could one go to find clarity, literal clarity,

1108
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:53,020
as in something written in reference to the difference between the spirit and the soul,

1109
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:59,340
and what those are, at least in reference to old books, scriptures?

1110
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,480
Yeah, you will find it. First, the easiest way to do it,

1111
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:07,880
let's just hold the hand, so to speak, and walk through real quickly.

1112
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:14,580
Find any reference material, the closest one at hand, regardless of quality, and start there.

1113
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:19,560
What you will find is right away that you might be naive,

1114
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,560
and you might need more comprehension.

1115
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:28,060
What I mean by naive is if you pick up a reference piece of material,

1116
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:31,900
and it says the soul, it means the breath, it could also mean the spirit.

1117
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:36,620
Well, then you go look up spirit, and it says the spirit, it's the mind,

1118
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,920
it could also mean the soul.

1119
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:41,280
Guess what? You're being conned.

1120
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:45,140
By the way, con comes from confidence, like a con man.

1121
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,920
What they do is they build your confidence, and then they take advantage of you.

1122
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,100
It's known as pranking.

1123
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:56,820
Confidence, the operating words there being, what, fidelis or fidelity?

1124
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,360
With fidelity, yes.

1125
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:03,040
Yeah, with fidelity. Fidelity being, what, truth or faithful.

1126
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:09,220
You're going to do a lot of fun doing etymology of words such as truth, and faith,

1127
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:11,780
and confidence, and fidelity, and stuff like that.

1128
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,140
A lot of it leads in circles.

1129
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:17,420
And usually the more important the event, or the more important the information,

1130
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:21,500
more obfuscation and corruption is put in.

1131
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:26,640
But it's put in a very simple way that is accepted,

1132
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,380
or made acceptable because it's done at a certain time period.

1133
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:32,540
Here's another thing.

1134
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:34,860
Avoidance of a trap is knowledge of its existence.

1135
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:39,080
The more important the information, you can bet on that it has been corrupted,

1136
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,240
or twisted a certain way.

1137
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:45,500
If you look at major events throughout history, how they've been explained.

1138
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,780
You know, let's bring up 9-11, for example.

1139
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:52,980
Not only do you have the official story, you have an entire movement that's trying to research it,

1140
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,660
and they're all incorrect.

1141
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:59,420
And by the way, if, let's just digress for a moment using that as an example,

1142
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:03,180
it only takes objectivity to find out what happened there, right?

1143
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,760
The same thing with all these other things.

1144
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,460
If we're going to go back to the soul and the spirit definition,

1145
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:13,800
if we look at the Greek nomenclature that's used in Western society,

1146
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:17,080
even, by the way, when you look up soul,

1147
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:21,840
they reversed it in the, or spirit,

1148
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:26,220
they reversed it in the Strongsteens or Strong's concordances as well.

1149
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:34,300
But the soul is where you see the Greek prefix pnu, like pneuma, means soul.

1150
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,940
That's where you get the term that refers to the movement of air,

1151
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,920
pneumatic, pneumonia.

1152
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:48,920
And the mind or the spirit is where you get psi, psyche, or the PSY prefix.

1153
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:55,040
So whenever you see anything with a PSY, psychology, psychotic, psychic,

1154
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,740
means of the mind or of the spirit.

1155
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,080
So your spirit is your mind.

1156
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,500
It's intangible, right?

1157
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,900
And it requires the soul and the body to animate it,

1158
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:06,120
where the soul and the body are quite tangible.

1159
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:11,540
You can hold up a piece of glass or glasses to your breath, exhale,

1160
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:14,760
and it fogs the glass.

1161
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:17,240
That's your tangible evidence of your soul.

1162
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,540
Tangible evidence of your soul is if someone drowns

1163
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:22,320
and you pull them out of the water and they're not breathing,

1164
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,160
they have no soul because they're not breathing.

1165
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,880
You can put your soul into their body until they animate and have a soul of their own.

1166
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,880
Soul of animals and humans and insects are all interchangeable

1167
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:35,700
because they're all breathing.

1168
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,060
Very simple.

1169
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:44,940
And this is very, very, very difficult to internalize or view as a good definition

1170
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:46,980
because if you go out into the world,

1171
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:50,420
and supposedly those that profess to be quote-unquote spiritual

1172
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:53,560
and gurus and teachers and masters, they don't know it.

1173
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:57,460
So you being a common person doing whatever you do,

1174
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:01,820
going to someone who supposedly know these things disagrees with that,

1175
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,020
you know, how does that make you feel?

1176
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:04,880
Does it make you feel good?

1177
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,960
So you have to bypass these people that, yes, there are people

1178
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,620
and reference materials that have obfuscated the meaning and the clarity of it.

1179
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,160
Because a little bit of research,

1180
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,920
you could see what we are telling you in every language holds true.

1181
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
They tend to obfuscate or corrupt the meaning of soul and spirit

1182
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,600
because the last thing that those in power,

1183
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,200
secular and non-secular, want humans to know

1184
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,180
what headquarters is made of, what you are made of.

1185
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,260
If you are made of a spirit, a soul, and a body,

1186
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,720
and you could clearly define that,

1187
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,880
now you know what's going on, at least with yourself.

1188
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:45,120
And knowing thyself, that's the first thing that is sort of dealt with.

1189
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:47,740
So if you can get people to not know who they are,

1190
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:48,960
well, guess what?

1191
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:52,280
They're probably not going to know anything about anything else anyway,

1192
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:55,100
because you are headquarters for your spirit, yourself.

1193
01:02:55,740 --> 01:03:00,720
And if your headquarters is corrupted, well, you'll only resonate with corruption.

1194
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:04,580
So it's very interesting how simple it can be.

1195
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:07,560
It's not easy, because most people are social creatures.

1196
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,590
They like to socialize.

1197
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,960
They like to feel loved and befriended by others.

1198
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:16,870
And I assure you, if you start looking at what things mean lawfully,

1199
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:21,160
you will not make any friends with it.

1200
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,320
You know, there is always an exception to that.

1201
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:27,480
But, you know, then by all means, be the exception.

1202
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,600
It will lead to some interesting conversations.

1203
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:34,840
Yes, yes, until they start looking like they have a look in their eye,

1204
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:36,780
like they're fixing on putting violence on you.

1205
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:37,460
Right?

1206
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,320
Then you better start distancing yourself.

1207
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,280
Yeah, yeah.

1208
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:48,080
But you will have a good laugh when you look at how supposedly people

1209
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:49,240
who are trained in these matters,

1210
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:53,920
whether mainstream or alternative, religious or not,

1211
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,900
how they will give you a million reasons that the soul is not the breath

1212
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:59,140
and the spirit is not the mind,

1213
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:01,080
but they will never address what you're saying.

1214
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:04,300
A well-trained animal just simply does what you tell it to do.

1215
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:05,440
Yeah.

1216
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:07,400
And how well do they do in their natural environment?

1217
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:08,960
Could you imagine, by the way,

1218
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,080
a circus bear that can like juggle balls and stand on a stool,

1219
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:17,300
how well he'll do when he's put in with other bears in the wild?

1220
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:21,340
I don't think the other bears are going to find it too interesting.

1221
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,100
But anyway, even though he is smarter than the average bear,

1222
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:25,860
to who?

1223
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,240
So, yeah.

1224
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,420
So any other questions?

1225
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,400
No, no, not specifically.

1226
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,160
A few comments here and there,

1227
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:40,680
but it's all, you know,

1228
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:43,400
things that we've been talking about directly,

1229
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:47,820
such as the Ruach and the Strong's theme definitely need better reference material.

1230
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,900
To which I just replied, you know,

1231
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:53,940
in the text, what is being referenced is more clear

1232
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:55,960
than the commentaries would have anyone believe.

1233
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:57,120
And, you know,

1234
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,240
dictionaries just obfuscate it further.

1235
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:01,960
Lots of fun, sarcastically, of course.

1236
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:06,280
But if basically what you and I are talking about,

1237
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,080
when we say, you know,

1238
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:12,100
soulless breath and spirit is, you know, mind,

1239
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:17,540
is how the words as translated into English

1240
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:20,340
are actually used in the manner in which they're translated.

1241
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:24,100
This is not something that you're going to punch into the internet and find easily.

1242
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:27,600
Hence, the idea and concept of, you know, study,

1243
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,240
which I don't actually recommend anyone do too much of.

1244
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:39,860
Anyone who is studying or wants to make a study of scripture,

1245
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,360
what is commonly referred to, you know,

1246
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,580
colloquially as the Bible, you know, that grouping of many books.

1247
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:50,900
I recommend people start anyone, anyone at all,

1248
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,880
regardless of what translation you're working with.

1249
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:55,620
Or lack of.

1250
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,200
Yeah, or lack of.

1251
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:58,540
There is no translation, actually.

1252
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,900
Regardless of whatever version you're reading from.

1253
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,560
Start with what they call in English Ecclesiastes.

1254
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:09,120
It's Kohalath is the name of the book.

1255
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,440
But start with that and read it because it's very,

1256
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:17,400
it doesn't take much, much background to understand what's being said.

1257
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:19,820
And it's very, I would say it's wisdom.

1258
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:20,800
That's what I'd say.

1259
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:22,020
So I would start there.

1260
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:25,400
Which is extremely lacking, by the way, in the world today.

1261
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:26,700
Very much so.

1262
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:27,160
Yes.

1263
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:30,880
And we used to go to, when I say we, however you want to say that,

1264
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:34,440
to the older people in society for that.

1265
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:37,700
And now I assure you, they've all been reduced to fools.

1266
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:40,260
And I say all, all, but maybe a few, which I haven't met yet.

1267
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,880
But for all you younger people out there,

1268
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:45,700
go ahead and strike up a conversation with anyone older than 50

1269
01:06:45,700 --> 01:06:51,220
and tell me if you get any wisdom severely lacking.

1270
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:56,200
Generally, when, and again, this is generally,

1271
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:59,740
so it's certainly not anytime, but most, most of the time,

1272
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,800
when it comes up in conversation, just, you know,

1273
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:04,140
through my own personal experience,

1274
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:10,420
and after the conversation's gone on for more than two or three sentences or paragraphs,

1275
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,140
I just start being asked a lot of questions, actually.

1276
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,400
So regardless of the age of the listener.

1277
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:22,380
So just to tie things back, let's go back a little bit, Seth.

1278
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,340
I hit the rewind button.

1279
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:26,380
Someone asked about breath and ether before, soul and ether.

1280
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,940
This is an interesting thing.

1281
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:33,000
Breathing, you know, there's a pulse, there's a rhythmic pulse to it,

1282
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:36,860
which, what's interesting about it is that all living things have that

1283
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,520
and all things are living to some degree,

1284
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:41,760
like the earth inhales and exhales with day and night.

1285
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:46,580
But in terms of people, because most likely a people had asked that question,

1286
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:51,020
is that the main constituent in the air is nitrogen.

1287
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:56,280
And if one does research on nitrogen itself,

1288
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:58,320
you'll find there's not much information about it,

1289
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:01,200
other than that it's a very significant gas in many functions.

1290
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:03,400
But it's actually a pulsing gas,

1291
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:10,120
and it assists that pulsation that is accommodated through breathing,

1292
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,340
or by breathing, or to breathe.

1293
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:18,520
And if we look at, that's still materialistic, not answering the ether.

1294
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:23,359
But the thing about what is the ether, I like, and I'll say this,

1295
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:27,439
my mentor who recently passed away, or one of my mentors, Trevor James Constable,

1296
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:35,800
wrote a lot about the ether, as did people like Rudolf Steiner and Wilhelm Reich.

1297
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:42,060
It was sort of brought forward post-Newtonian again

1298
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:45,540
to sort of invent this thing to explain phenomenon.

1299
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:49,859
But essentially, when we say the ether, when I say the ether, let's say,

1300
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:51,779
I'm referring to the life force.

1301
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:53,979
There's an underlying primary force.

1302
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:58,859
And because it's so primary, it's very difficult to get a handle on it

1303
01:08:58,859 --> 01:09:03,100
being in a secondary existence, meaning locked up in this physical reality.

1304
01:09:04,279 --> 01:09:05,399
But it is primary.

1305
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,000
But just like Oliver Heaviside said,

1306
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,700
just because I don't know how I digest, it doesn't mean I cannot enjoy my supper.

1307
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,580
So we don't really have a handle on the ether.

1308
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:21,319
We do know how to technically access it, by the way, at this point.

1309
01:09:21,399 --> 01:09:25,340
That information is out there, albeit not very accurate in most places.

1310
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:26,359
But it is accessible.

1311
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:32,819
It can be manipulated to a certain degree regarding the weather and other functions

1312
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,560
that are very subtle.

1313
01:09:35,260 --> 01:09:40,880
One thing that I can't say about the ether is the denser the object, the finer the ether.

1314
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:46,200
And the less density an object has, the coarser or more dense the ether is.

1315
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:50,279
It's a concept that Steiner talked about as counter space.

1316
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:54,420
So now we're going to go off into an ether discussion.

1317
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:55,380
Probably not.

1318
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:57,860
But the life force is real.

1319
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:03,120
It is tangible when an attempt to access it technically is.

1320
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:04,960
Even not so technical.

1321
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:10,780
A lot of the ancient cultures were accessing it for rainmaking and healing purposes

1322
01:10:10,780 --> 01:10:15,380
and to imbue vitality and invigor things.

1323
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:17,440
So the ether is a big discussion.

1324
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:23,120
But essentially, the safest way to employ discussion on the ether is by dubbing it the life force.

1325
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:27,940
Just like there isn't any scientist or medical technician that could

1326
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:32,020
explain to you what it takes to stand up from a chair and walk across the room.

1327
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:35,160
They can't explain how that happens.

1328
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:40,540
And that would be evidence of the life force directly and indirectly because it's so intangible.

1329
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:46,700
But that was kind of a long, maybe direct, in some ways, indirect answer.

1330
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:49,680
But by the way, that spins me off into another thought.

1331
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:57,820
Folks, when you listen to things, you know, quote unquote shows, information, topics,

1332
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:03,000
I hope you're being entertained because generally that's what you will get out of it.

1333
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:10,460
Essentially, the ability to convey information and part information to humanity at this point

1334
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:12,700
has become almost non-existent.

1335
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:17,220
Everything seems to be in the entertainment phase right now.

1336
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:18,040
I'll give an example.

1337
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:23,820
I hear this often in the, not too often lately, but in the alternative media.

1338
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:26,660
Oh, no one knows how the pyramids were built.

1339
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:28,380
Wait a second.

1340
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,060
Wait a second.

1341
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:30,580
What do you mean no one knows?

1342
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:34,700
How did you, did you meet everyone to know that everyone doesn't?

1343
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,200
Did you mean everyone doesn't know?

1344
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:43,160
And they start bringing up these ridiculous comparisons to kind of guide you down

1345
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:48,540
this ridiculous assumption that no one knows how the pyramids were built.

1346
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:51,480
Even today, oh yeah, because today we're so advanced,

1347
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:54,720
we don't have any cranes that could lift those big stones.

1348
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,180
Excuse me.

1349
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:00,820
When something is really, really heavy,

1350
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:06,820
the most sensible way to move it is not to figure out a way to lift it, right?

1351
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:12,800
Gosh, I mean some of the discussions that are supposed to be informational,

1352
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:17,100
like bringing up the pyramids, how the pyramids were built again,

1353
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:19,600
because it's come across in passing privately,

1354
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:22,220
and I've seen certain people discussing it publicly,

1355
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:26,000
and it's an idiotic subject, especially when you listen to the reasoning behind it.

1356
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:28,240
You don't lift something that heavy.

1357
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:31,780
As a matter of fact, there's a fellow called Wally Wallington.

1358
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:34,900
You could look him up, and he moves 20-ton blocks by himself.

1359
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:39,640
He could move them at a rate of, I think, several hundred yards a day by himself.

1360
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:45,360
20 tons would be about the weight of five typical automobiles or motorized wagons.

1361
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:50,340
But no one wants to really, you know, look at that,

1362
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:55,060
because then the question of no one knows who built the pyramids kind of goes away.

1363
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:56,240
It's very philosophical.

1364
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:02,780
But the morons that do bring this up, no one knows how the pyramids were built.

1365
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:05,360
Start giving your reasons, like we don't have technology today.

1366
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:05,940
Who's we?

1367
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:08,780
And what technology do you have today that you would apply?

1368
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:11,720
That's the wrong way to look at it.

1369
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:14,340
And when I say wrong, it's because it's very simple.

1370
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:19,660
Yes, the pyramids can be built in a very short amount of time with very few people,

1371
01:13:19,940 --> 01:13:22,060
but you wouldn't be lifting anything.

1372
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:25,840
You would be actually employing, and I'm just going to get off the subject here,

1373
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:32,660
but the reason we call this uncommon sense is because part of it requires objectivity.

1374
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:36,180
If you guys ever heard of the thing called walking?

1375
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:39,160
Yes, when you stand up and put one foot in front of the other.

1376
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,220
Oh, Greek, what are you saying?

1377
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:42,440
It sounds pretty condescending.

1378
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:44,100
Why do you have to be such an ass about that?

1379
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:47,060
Well, here's the metaphor, and here's the reality of it.

1380
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,680
Do you realize what's happening when you're walking?

1381
01:13:50,540 --> 01:13:52,020
Well, here he goes again.

1382
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,320
Okay, you're standing up firm-footed, and you're balanced.

1383
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:01,900
What happens is you put one step, or you lift one leg or one foot, and you move it forward,

1384
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:06,320
and you plant it firmly on the ground, and you repeat the process, and we call that walking.

1385
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:11,040
Okay, that's all the obvious stuff that's typically discussed or not thought about.

1386
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:15,400
But what is actually going on, which anyone can see and admit,

1387
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:18,860
is that when you proceed into that procedure,

1388
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:21,880
which is lifting a leg or a foot to move it forward to walk,

1389
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:26,040
before the foot is planted, you are actually displacing your center of gravity,

1390
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:28,100
and you're in a state of falling.

1391
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:34,240
And when the foot plants down on the firm surface, the falling state stops.

1392
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,060
The displacement of gravity stops.

1393
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:39,780
The displacement of the center of gravity stops, and you repeat the process.

1394
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,800
An example to prove this is that if you were to take a step,

1395
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:47,080
and let's say someone put a banana under your foot, you would slip and fall.

1396
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:52,100
In other words, the falling process would not stop.

1397
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:58,320
So the way you move very heavy objects is by finding their center of gravity and displacing it.

1398
01:14:58,680 --> 01:15:00,740
And I think we're going to end it right here,

1399
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:04,740
because the last thing we want to do is talk about how the pyramids can be built.

1400
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:09,160
Because this is, I gave this as a long metaphor, perhaps,

1401
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:12,680
on are you really, are you folks really listening to what's being put out there

1402
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:14,140
as quote-unquote information?

1403
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:21,220
And that's why before I mentioned this is what's going on right now with communication,

1404
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:25,780
especially with alternative media, is the self-consuming idiocy.

1405
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,900
Like I, before the break, I said now it's gotten to the point where

1406
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:33,740
the alternative media is actually using other alternative media for research,

1407
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:34,840
which is kind of funny.

1408
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,660
I just want to bring up one more point.

1409
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:42,600
People in the alternative media researching, for example, 9-11 went through the Pentagon,

1410
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:44,420
five masonry walls.

1411
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:49,300
I heard one of them once suggesting a tomahawk missile.

1412
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:57,500
And did they ever lift a finger to go and notice that a tomahawk missile has a fiberglass nose cone

1413
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:01,320
that you could pretty much smash with a Fisher-Price hammer,

1414
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:05,040
and it cannot go through five masonry walls?

1415
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:07,980
But anyway, that's another discussion.

1416
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:13,000
See how simple it is to just destroy the arguments or the things that are being brought forward?

1417
01:16:13,100 --> 01:16:15,160
Not that they need to be destroyed, because I want to preface,

1418
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,700
these were brought up for entertainment.

1419
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:21,900
But people are starting to take what's being heard and said seriously.

1420
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,540
But are they really listening?

1421
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:24,340
I would say no.

1422
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:26,520
That's why we call it the dummy load.

1423
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:32,160
Yeah, I would back it up just a little ways.

1424
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,940
Edward Leedskalman comes to mind anytime I hear of the difficulty of building the pyramids

1425
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:40,600
and whatnot.

1426
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,220
Edward Leedskalman, the guy that built Coral Castle.

1427
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:49,700
Yeah, now you got to realize when he did Coral Castle, are we looking at it practical?

1428
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:53,560
See, what happens is we're shown something as being mystical and magical, and it's not.

1429
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,640
There is some good eyewitness testimony.

1430
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,080
He was very good at leverage.

1431
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:02,360
And also the stones that he was lifting are coral, which are pumice, very lightweight,

1432
01:17:03,700 --> 01:17:05,780
relative, albeit they can be heavy.

1433
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:10,280
A very large bay of hail can be very heavy, but it's still a bay of hail.

1434
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:12,640
He didn't use anything mystical or magical.

1435
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:17,380
He had a pretty firm grip on a lot of the energetic realities of things.

1436
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:23,140
But people are trying to switch it forward into that he used some kind of levitation.

1437
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:26,700
And just lifting your foot up off the ground is levitation.

1438
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:30,160
And by the way, you lose levity when you're not feeling well, right?

1439
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,440
That's why you lay down when you're feeling sick.

1440
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,840
So levity is all around us.

1441
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,700
It's direction of things.

1442
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,420
But Leedskalman had a pretty good handle on many things.

1443
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:43,180
His description of magnetism and electricity is fairly accurate.

1444
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,680
It's not the be all end all, and it doesn't go into the primary aspects too much.

1445
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:50,760
But if you do study Leedskalman's work, not what people write about him,

1446
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:55,620
you will find pretty much yourself better off than before you did.

1447
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:00,440
You know, it's very interesting reading, if nothing else.

1448
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:04,120
Yes, especially if you want to entertain working in the field

1449
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:06,700
of what's called electricity and magnetism.

1450
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:13,440
And I would say that it's relatively uncommon as well.

1451
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:17,900
I haven't read everything that he's written, but what I have read is...

1452
01:18:19,460 --> 01:18:22,480
Yeah, and it's somewhat validatable if you do his experiments.

1453
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:24,720
Perpetual motion holder works.

1454
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:30,440
And the spiraling of the electrical current is correct.

1455
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:36,820
And then, of course, I see in the AFR chat,

1456
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:39,400
someone put in attached lines of force, anonymous.

1457
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:44,540
What's interesting about that is that would be the work of J.J. Thompson,

1458
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:45,660
which is very interesting.

1459
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:49,380
You know, I had a discussion with someone regarding UFOs recently,

1460
01:18:49,460 --> 01:18:50,500
and they showed me a photo.

1461
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,020
It was more than recently,

1462
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:57,080
and it was basically an old 1930s submarine that was levitated.

1463
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:02,220
That's your cigar-shape UFOs that people tend to talk about.

1464
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:03,720
It was back in the day.

1465
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:07,240
They took J.J. Thompson's work and other work that he had done,

1466
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:09,240
other people at the time,

1467
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:15,580
and figured out that momentum and weight are not a factor of mass.

1468
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:20,140
They're independent manifestations where these ethereal, let's say,

1469
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:23,880
or semi-electric lines of force attach to objects,

1470
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:25,100
so they keep them in motion.

1471
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,200
Or when you try to stop them,

1472
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:28,440
you notice the object tends to want to keep moving.

1473
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:30,200
That is not the mass itself.

1474
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,700
It's what attaches to it.

1475
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:36,140
So if you figure out how to detach those electrical lines of force

1476
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:37,180
that attach to everything,

1477
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,960
you will have objects that could stop instantly or start instantly

1478
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:45,800
without any energy input or much energy input.

1479
01:19:45,860 --> 01:19:48,160
So the problem is finding out this virtual ground.

1480
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:52,560
And J.J. Thompson had stumbled upon this when he was trying to find out

1481
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,040
what was the electron mass equivalent,

1482
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:57,520
which is where you get the E equals mc2 formula,

1483
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,580
which has nothing to do with energy.

1484
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,800
It has to do with finding a relationship.

1485
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,440
So I just wanted to bring that up, the electrical lines of force.

1486
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:10,600
So if you really got more than one sharpened pencil in your pocket,

1487
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:11,380
see, years ago,

1488
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:16,620
a really good engineer was described as by how many sharpened pencils he had in his pocket.

1489
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:19,000
So you want to meet,

1490
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:20,740
so, you know, just for a common problem,

1491
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:22,560
one sharpened pencil in your pocket's fine.

1492
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:25,980
But something like detaching electrical lines of force from mass

1493
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:28,720
is going to require three or four sharpened pencils in your pocket.

1494
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,380
So if you think you've got that kind of capability,

1495
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:34,060
go ahead and start meditating and thinking on the subject

1496
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:37,100
of how do you find a virtual ground in space

1497
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:39,680
to detach it from a particular object?

1498
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,400
Right.

1499
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,100
In other words,

1500
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:47,180
if you find a ground that is not attached to anything physical,

1501
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:52,300
now you can neutralize the potential that is attached to moving objects

1502
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:55,020
and that object will cease to have momentum or weight.

1503
01:20:57,690 --> 01:20:59,090
And when you figure that out,

1504
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:02,250
you can actually stop it or start it instantly.

1505
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:06,770
And it's not affected by momentum or quote unquote gravity or direction that much.

1506
01:21:07,710 --> 01:21:09,930
So if you think you have that many sharpened pencils,

1507
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:11,730
we've just laid out the outline for you.

1508
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:13,630
And no one is talking about this, by the way.

1509
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:15,570
Eric Dollard has brought it up.

1510
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:18,870
There's a fellow named William Lyne who has brought this up.

1511
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:23,090
I think he has written upon this as well, William Lyne has.

1512
01:21:23,870 --> 01:21:28,190
But if you go and read J.J. Thompson's work and other people around that time,

1513
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,510
you'll find some very interesting things,

1514
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:35,530
especially regarding the UFO phenomenon.

1515
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:37,130
All right.

1516
01:21:38,210 --> 01:21:43,930
Well, we don't have any more questions in chat.

1517
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:46,250
Well, there's one.

1518
01:21:46,450 --> 01:21:47,750
I kind of already answered it, but it's

1519
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:51,570
what do you think will, if anything,

1520
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:54,990
restore soundness of mind to our numb, dumb world?

1521
01:21:56,530 --> 01:22:02,150
He says numb, dumb selves as a correction, I believe.

1522
01:22:03,270 --> 01:22:06,770
That's very interesting because it's very relativistic in a point,

1523
01:22:06,770 --> 01:22:10,050
not as Einstein said, but that's rubbish, but relativistic, meaning

1524
01:22:10,570 --> 01:22:11,870
you're born and you die.

1525
01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:14,730
You have about 70 to 100 years if you're fortunate,

1526
01:22:14,870 --> 01:22:16,550
let's say, in the typical incarnation.

1527
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:22,250
We tend to judge and rate severity and importance and significance

1528
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:23,590
based on that perspective.

1529
01:22:25,250 --> 01:22:28,870
Right now, yeah, you're in the credits part.

1530
01:22:28,970 --> 01:22:29,730
There's no change.

1531
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:30,890
In other words, live it out.

1532
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:34,930
We had one email from a young individual who was asking,

1533
01:22:34,930 --> 01:22:37,810
he wants to live his life efficiently and such,

1534
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:39,050
about food, clothing, and shelter.

1535
01:22:39,190 --> 01:22:40,090
It's a very good question.

1536
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:44,630
But the whole thing is, yes, exactly, food, clothing, and shelter.

1537
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:48,930
Make sure that your food, clothing, and shelter is of the highest quality

1538
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:52,970
you can afford and make yourself comfortable and be lawful,

1539
01:22:53,130 --> 01:22:54,130
meaning fit and proper.

1540
01:22:55,150 --> 01:22:59,670
But what will undo anything is just, I mean, what undo,

1541
01:22:59,990 --> 01:23:03,950
what does a glass of spilled milk, I mean, how do you undo that?

1542
01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:04,790
Just clean it up.

1543
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:08,290
The right now humanity is unrehabilitatable.

1544
01:23:10,290 --> 01:23:15,690
You have 7 billion pretty much unrehabilitable imbeciles on the planet.

1545
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:18,890
So it has to be ridden out.

1546
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:22,030
And you're going to have a mop-up crew going to clean it up.

1547
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:26,550
I'm not talking about UFOs or some religious figure that you might know about.

1548
01:23:27,810 --> 01:23:32,450
Because, by the way, if you go look at things about the end of civilization,

1549
01:23:32,450 --> 01:23:38,950
meaning mankind's society, it's in every culture, right?

1550
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:44,630
It has nothing to do with what religion you subscribe to or what god you believe in.

1551
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:47,790
But it has definitely to do with the gods, absolutely.

1552
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:49,430
And there's a hierarchy there.

1553
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:51,970
And you're not going to do anything about it.

1554
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:54,830
You basically wait for the mop-up crew.

1555
01:23:55,190 --> 01:23:58,930
But the problem with that is the last thing the gods want

1556
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:02,090
is some sniveling human to give them an excuse later on.

1557
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:03,670
You know?

1558
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:07,610
Like, oh, we never had a chance to have world peace.

1559
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:11,090
We never had a chance to learn.

1560
01:24:11,950 --> 01:24:14,850
We never had a chance to find out.

1561
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:18,110
Yeah, you're not going to...

1562
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:19,310
The gods don't want to hear that.

1563
01:24:19,550 --> 01:24:21,330
And because they don't want to hear that,

1564
01:24:21,910 --> 01:24:26,750
you're going to be thrust into, unbeknownst to you,

1565
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:31,570
into a seemingly perfect society in the next decade.

1566
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:33,390
It's going to last for a short time.

1567
01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:36,770
And you're going to be told that it's going to last for 1,000 years.

1568
01:24:36,870 --> 01:24:37,990
And you're all going to believe it.

1569
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:40,970
Because what is there not to believe?

1570
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:44,330
It won't be propagandized like the Soviet Union society,

1571
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:46,730
where they said, this is a perfect society.

1572
01:24:47,070 --> 01:24:51,710
And you have 3,000 people waiting in line in knee-deep snow for toilet paper.

1573
01:24:52,010 --> 01:24:53,450
I'm not talking about that.

1574
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:55,630
This is not going to be propaganda, folks.

1575
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:58,910
And it's all going to come out of the Middle East area part of the world.

1576
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:04,670
And I'm using the Middle East as the common vernacular.

1577
01:25:04,810 --> 01:25:06,130
Because if you took a map of the world,

1578
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:08,990
you'll find center mass of the world to be that area.

1579
01:25:09,790 --> 01:25:10,170
Okay.

1580
01:25:10,630 --> 01:25:13,950
And you're all going to fall for pretty much what's going to be coming.

1581
01:25:14,130 --> 01:25:18,030
And the reason why you're going to have world peace and liberty

1582
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:19,630
from things you have commitment to,

1583
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:24,910
and economic, let's say, gain and spiritual knowledge

1584
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:28,890
is because this way you will be without excuse.

1585
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:29,650
You will be without excuse later on.

1586
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:33,990
But when it's promised to last for 1,000 years, it will not.

1587
01:25:34,770 --> 01:25:36,450
But, you know, it'll be very convincing.

1588
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:41,910
So whenever you hear, this is the part about the efficiency that is very uncommon,

1589
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:45,250
is how many times do you still hear of pending doom and disaster?

1590
01:25:45,650 --> 01:25:47,990
Oh, let's prep for this disaster.

1591
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:49,830
You know, this is coming.

1592
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:50,450
No, it's not.

1593
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:51,190
None of that is coming.

1594
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:54,030
You're going into a veritable Garden of Eden

1595
01:25:54,030 --> 01:25:57,670
with a veritable, perfect, political, social, religious,

1596
01:25:57,950 --> 01:26:00,070
economic, judicial, artistic community.

1597
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:04,230
And it's not going to be brought peacefully, obviously.

1598
01:26:04,870 --> 01:26:07,350
It's going to be brought with quite a heavy price,

1599
01:26:07,590 --> 01:26:09,610
meaning a lot of things are going to be rearranged.

1600
01:26:10,530 --> 01:26:12,650
But once they're done being rearranged,

1601
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:14,910
it will exist for a short time.

1602
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:19,130
You will have a lawful society on this planet for a short time.

1603
01:26:20,830 --> 01:26:26,050
So that's perhaps the answer to what does one do or how does one do it?

1604
01:26:26,190 --> 01:26:27,410
You know, this is what's coming.

1605
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:29,950
This is where the cruise ship is going, folks.

1606
01:26:30,330 --> 01:26:33,610
Now, where you find your personal self in that main,

1607
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:38,870
let's say, worldly circumstance is up to you, right?

1608
01:26:38,950 --> 01:26:40,390
Do whatever you do really well.

1609
01:26:40,850 --> 01:26:42,490
You know, here's the thing still.

1610
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:44,130
People are told to go out and get a job.

1611
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:45,130
Why would you want a job?

1612
01:26:45,130 --> 01:26:49,570
Why aren't you encouraged to find out what your talents are,

1613
01:26:49,850 --> 01:26:52,690
your natural talents, let's say, quote, unquote,

1614
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:54,710
and encouraged to pursue those?

1615
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:57,450
Because if you do something really, really well in this world,

1616
01:26:57,910 --> 01:26:59,910
as long as it's not telling people the truth, by the way,

1617
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:01,410
you will do well.

1618
01:27:01,710 --> 01:27:05,850
If you fix on going out and making the world a better place,

1619
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:06,930
and you actually know how,

1620
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:10,110
you will be eating out of a garbage can.

1621
01:27:10,150 --> 01:27:11,210
I assure you that.

1622
01:27:12,330 --> 01:27:17,690
Now, if you tell people that you want to make the world a better place,

1623
01:27:17,730 --> 01:27:20,430
and it is a complete lie and a fraud, you will be quite wealthy.

1624
01:27:21,350 --> 01:27:24,450
That's just the way things are pretty much statistically,

1625
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:26,770
you know, if you do the math.

1626
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:29,710
So, by the way, whenever you hear anyone saying,

1627
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:31,130
I want to make the world a better place,

1628
01:27:31,150 --> 01:27:32,850
or we have to make the world better,

1629
01:27:32,930 --> 01:27:35,530
you ever notice how unfounded what they're saying is?

1630
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:38,170
If you ask them how, they don't really know.

1631
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:41,930
It's because they're just talking, taking up time.

1632
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:42,890
It's a dummy load.

1633
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:46,430
You want to go somewhere that is, quote, unquote, positive.

1634
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:49,290
That is giving you something that makes you feel good.

1635
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:52,210
Because you have all of this energy inside of you,

1636
01:27:52,370 --> 01:27:54,690
and you want it directed so it feels good.

1637
01:27:54,930 --> 01:27:58,150
Who wants to take the biological energy

1638
01:27:58,150 --> 01:27:59,990
that's built up in the body through emotion,

1639
01:28:00,290 --> 01:28:03,530
and have it feel bad or feel not pleasant?

1640
01:28:03,670 --> 01:28:05,030
Everyone wants to feel pleasant.

1641
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:10,490
So, you're going to gravitate to things that sound good and make you feel good.

1642
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:12,790
But I'm telling you they're unfounded and baseless.

1643
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:18,110
Well, actually, I'm telling you that because if you soon want to do research on this

1644
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:20,670
and learn a little bit more, you will find it to be true as well.

1645
01:28:21,330 --> 01:28:23,770
Or you can go the fox and the grapes route.

1646
01:28:24,190 --> 01:28:26,350
You know, or you can, you know, however.

1647
01:28:27,410 --> 01:28:30,450
But in the meantime, all you will be exposed to

1648
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:35,010
until this next two or year period or so is a dummy load.

1649
01:28:36,030 --> 01:28:38,990
There's lots of energy that's put out by systems,

1650
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:41,170
including human systems, people's bodies.

1651
01:28:41,310 --> 01:28:44,190
And that energy needs to be used somehow, used up.

1652
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:48,610
So, whatever you gravitate to, ask, is it lawful?

1653
01:28:48,670 --> 01:28:49,530
Is it based on anything?

1654
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:50,670
What is it founded on?

1655
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:53,970
And you will find that it's pretty much baseless or unfounded.

1656
01:28:54,010 --> 01:28:55,150
Or it's based on opinion.

1657
01:28:55,650 --> 01:28:58,950
Recently, I was having a discussion with someone regarding some technical matter.

1658
01:28:59,150 --> 01:29:01,210
And they were like, well, what is your opinion on this?

1659
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:02,850
Is that I have no opinion on that.

1660
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:05,610
I can give you a report on it that you will find to be true

1661
01:29:05,610 --> 01:29:08,310
if you replicate it or pursue it.

1662
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:09,750
But I have no opinion on the matter.

1663
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:13,850
And they kind of looked at me kind of like wondering what I was trying to say.

1664
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:17,610
So, I think the thing is, what's lacking is good reporting.

1665
01:29:18,730 --> 01:29:20,490
And there's even criticism in that, right?

1666
01:29:20,810 --> 01:29:24,290
The mainstream media, you know, that's all fabricated, right?

1667
01:29:24,530 --> 01:29:25,810
Well, guess what, folks?

1668
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:27,850
It's not just the mainstream media that's fabricated.

1669
01:29:28,590 --> 01:29:34,910
Yeah, I would say across the board as the colloquialism goes.

1670
01:29:37,390 --> 01:29:41,950
Yeah, in response to the question I just said, setting oneself apart,

1671
01:29:43,570 --> 01:29:50,730
whether or not that will restore soundness of mind is, well, I suppose not up to me.

1672
01:29:52,610 --> 01:29:56,310
But you can look at that as like you see a bulldozer coming

1673
01:29:56,990 --> 01:29:59,590
directly towards a group of people that you're standing in,

1674
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:02,410
regardless of distance or speed.

1675
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:06,750
Staying in that spot's probably not the greatest course of action.

1676
01:30:07,090 --> 01:30:11,510
You might, you know, walk over to the person operating the bulldozer

1677
01:30:11,510 --> 01:30:13,790
and ask them, you know, what they're doing and where they're going

1678
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:16,970
to better stay out of their way, perhaps.

1679
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:19,430
But don't lay down in front of it, right?

1680
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:22,430
Yeah, that's not going to stop the bulldozer.

1681
01:30:24,770 --> 01:30:28,450
You might even, you know, wave a few friends over and be like,

1682
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:30,230
hey, you might want to not stand there.

1683
01:30:31,530 --> 01:30:34,730
Yeah, well, that's where I discuss the thing about rights.

1684
01:30:34,810 --> 01:30:35,990
I always stand up for my rights.

1685
01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:39,750
Well, when they're fixing on busting people, it's best that you don't stand up.

1686
01:30:39,790 --> 01:30:41,170
Maybe have a seat at that time.

1687
01:30:42,750 --> 01:30:44,930
Because the tallest nail gets hammered first.

1688
01:30:45,450 --> 01:30:46,590
Yeah, and there's a reason.

1689
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:48,270
If you want to know who the gods are backing up,

1690
01:30:48,310 --> 01:30:50,950
look who carries the sword, who has the weapons.

1691
01:30:52,550 --> 01:30:53,390
And you may not like it.

1692
01:30:53,630 --> 01:30:55,490
Regardless of what they say, yeah.

1693
01:30:55,930 --> 01:30:56,310
Exactly.

1694
01:30:57,350 --> 01:31:00,070
So, by the way, there's something going on called an election

1695
01:31:00,070 --> 01:31:01,690
in this part of the world, in the states.

1696
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:05,770
And people are kind of paying attention to it and talking about candidates

1697
01:31:05,770 --> 01:31:06,790
and they all miss the point.

1698
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:08,730
When I say all, they all miss the point.

1699
01:31:09,450 --> 01:31:10,470
What point is that, Greek?

1700
01:31:10,970 --> 01:31:11,590
Very simple.

1701
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:12,410
It's an election.

1702
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:17,870
Who does, do voters elect people?

1703
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:19,810
No, you're being invited as a voter.

1704
01:31:20,550 --> 01:31:24,350
The word vote means to vow that the, that you will show up and register,

1705
01:31:24,530 --> 01:31:27,470
which means that form is worth about 50 grand or more,

1706
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:30,210
that they will monetize and you will get nothing out of it, by the way.

1707
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:33,130
But that just means that when you show up to vote,

1708
01:31:33,190 --> 01:31:36,970
that you are, have confidence that the system works.

1709
01:31:37,730 --> 01:31:41,830
And whoever the electors decide to put in is the one who's going to be

1710
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:42,390
your next step forward.

1711
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:44,450
Whatever leader of that particular position.

1712
01:31:44,610 --> 01:31:45,790
That's all the voter does.

1713
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:48,890
He vows that the, that confidence in the system.

1714
01:31:49,470 --> 01:31:52,150
And on one hand, that's what's the reality of it,

1715
01:31:52,170 --> 01:31:54,590
whether people want to acknowledge it or not, go look it up.

1716
01:31:55,170 --> 01:32:03,010
The other hand is that the system itself, it's not cryptic about it being corrupt.

1717
01:32:03,830 --> 01:32:07,970
So, what's really going on from an objective point of view is that

1718
01:32:07,970 --> 01:32:13,790
the people are vowing to support a system that is self-admittedly corrupt.

1719
01:32:15,350 --> 01:32:18,850
So, I mean, this is not a secret, folks.

1720
01:32:19,370 --> 01:32:22,070
And you're all vowing to go forward with it.

1721
01:32:22,350 --> 01:32:24,810
And in the meantime, you know, this is the heart of the matter

1722
01:32:24,810 --> 01:32:27,950
is that voters vote, electors elect.

1723
01:32:28,870 --> 01:32:32,690
So, your vote is just vowing that the system works for you.

1724
01:32:33,390 --> 01:32:34,670
And this is the ridiculous of it.

1725
01:32:34,710 --> 01:32:37,730
And people ask me, who is going to be the next president, Greek?

1726
01:32:37,730 --> 01:32:42,590
The who, meaning the actual body that takes up is irrelevant,

1727
01:32:42,750 --> 01:32:44,370
but I can assure you for sure,

1728
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:49,030
the next quote-unquote president is going to be worse than the one you have.

1729
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:52,210
And just like the one you have is worse than the one before.

1730
01:32:53,230 --> 01:32:54,170
For the country.

1731
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:57,810
Because the country is, boy, how do you get into that?

1732
01:32:57,870 --> 01:33:00,230
Here's the thing that people are not paying attention to.

1733
01:33:00,750 --> 01:33:04,170
How can you come across the ocean several hundred years ago

1734
01:33:04,170 --> 01:33:07,430
and slaughter an entire group of people

1735
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:10,670
that would tend to be sort of spiritually minded

1736
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:13,950
and not have them curse the land that you're taking over from them?

1737
01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:18,290
I mean, how naive can you be?

1738
01:33:18,490 --> 01:33:21,590
But anyway, that's an interesting thought.

1739
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:25,690
Well, and they're currently not even following their own literature.

1740
01:33:26,210 --> 01:33:31,030
And it's said, you know, they were following their own rules

1741
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:36,530
as put down when this conglomeration of countries was founded.

1742
01:33:37,790 --> 01:33:40,010
Because that's, you know, that's what the United States is.

1743
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:43,190
It's a conglomeration of, what, 50 something.

1744
01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:48,270
Maybe there's like 52 different countries that are represented.

1745
01:33:48,810 --> 01:33:50,190
They refer to it as a nation.

1746
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:53,150
I'm always amused when I hear people talking about America,

1747
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:55,890
America, this America, then like that's two continents.

1748
01:33:56,930 --> 01:33:58,030
But North and South.

1749
01:33:58,670 --> 01:34:02,910
But there's currently, you brought up the elections that are coming up.

1750
01:34:04,190 --> 01:34:11,350
And when I see the vice president being the one that comes in second

1751
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:15,150
as opposed to being chosen by the president

1752
01:34:15,150 --> 01:34:19,990
as is written down in the laws that they're not following,

1753
01:34:20,670 --> 01:34:23,410
then I will maybe begin paying a little bit more attention to it.

1754
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:28,010
But they have, yeah, why would they?

1755
01:34:28,270 --> 01:34:30,950
You see, we've gotten to the discussion of the prankster.

1756
01:34:32,290 --> 01:34:34,130
Why do you want to make the world better?

1757
01:34:34,350 --> 01:34:37,150
It's one third of the population are pranksters,

1758
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:39,830
are involved in prankstership straight up.

1759
01:34:40,210 --> 01:34:42,810
So we're talking about really the world needs to be made better.

1760
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:48,730
It's the, how was, how did the guy in chat say it?

1761
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:52,990
The numbness and numbness of ourselves,

1762
01:34:53,410 --> 01:34:55,930
not the world's works just fine.

1763
01:34:56,010 --> 01:34:57,250
It's been here for quite a while.

1764
01:34:57,610 --> 01:34:59,790
Well, the earth, the planet itself, yeah.

1765
01:34:59,870 --> 01:35:02,410
Wait till the people find out that the planet got a facelift

1766
01:35:02,410 --> 01:35:03,710
so man could be inhabited.

1767
01:35:03,930 --> 01:35:07,970
And the agreement was that the facelift, yeah,

1768
01:35:08,330 --> 01:35:10,910
the facelift will be done and man will follow these rules.

1769
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:12,210
What are the rules?

1770
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:12,950
Well, very simple.

1771
01:35:13,050 --> 01:35:16,050
If you get a job working in a pet food store, use the term loosely.

1772
01:35:16,570 --> 01:35:19,510
They'll tell you, for example, the rules, you know,

1773
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:21,310
you'll get 10 bucks an hour and all you could steal.

1774
01:35:23,470 --> 01:35:26,350
And you give the dog food to the dogs, the cat food to the cat,

1775
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:28,450
the fish food to the fish and the bird food to the birds.

1776
01:35:28,570 --> 01:35:29,430
Okay, yeah, okay.

1777
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:32,650
But you know, when no one's around, you know, you're a prankster, right?

1778
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:34,470
So you're going to give the bird food to the fish,

1779
01:35:34,510 --> 01:35:36,970
the fish food to the dog, the cat food to, right?

1780
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:39,030
You're going to just kind of throw everything around and say,

1781
01:35:39,130 --> 01:35:40,690
hey, look, man, they're eating it anyway.

1782
01:35:41,170 --> 01:35:43,110
It doesn't matter, right?

1783
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:46,030
That's what I mean by prankstership and rules, folks.

1784
01:35:46,050 --> 01:35:49,330
Do you know what people are supposed to eat to keep them helpful?

1785
01:35:49,650 --> 01:35:50,030
Healthful?

1786
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:51,470
Probably not.

1787
01:35:51,730 --> 01:35:53,330
Might sound religious, right?

1788
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:55,650
Do you know what you're supposed to wear?

1789
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:57,350
Do you know how you're supposed to keep time lawfully?

1790
01:35:58,930 --> 01:36:02,070
And just because a dog develops a palate for cat food

1791
01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:04,470
doesn't necessarily mean that that is now dog food.

1792
01:36:05,230 --> 01:36:05,950
Yes, exactly.

1793
01:36:06,050 --> 01:36:06,990
So this is what's going on.

1794
01:36:07,070 --> 01:36:09,350
So the thing is, there's nothing that's why I keep saying

1795
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:11,250
it's unrehabilitatable at this point.

1796
01:36:11,310 --> 01:36:13,710
You just have to wait for it to go down the drain.

1797
01:36:14,730 --> 01:36:18,470
And in the meantime, you know, do the best that you can.

1798
01:36:18,950 --> 01:36:19,890
Avoid the pranksters.

1799
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:22,630
That would be all of your entitled classes,

1800
01:36:22,770 --> 01:36:25,870
the legal society, scientific society, the medical society,

1801
01:36:26,510 --> 01:36:29,090
education society, the religious society for sure.

1802
01:36:30,170 --> 01:36:32,350
But, you know, people like socializing there.

1803
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:33,150
Here's the thing.

1804
01:36:33,190 --> 01:36:35,550
If you have 7 billion imbeciles on the planet,

1805
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:37,910
you grab some of the imbeciles

1806
01:36:37,910 --> 01:36:40,870
and you put them in a special building for four years

1807
01:36:40,870 --> 01:36:42,610
and you tell them that now they have a degree

1808
01:36:43,110 --> 01:36:45,690
and now they can go out and get all the other imbeciles

1809
01:36:45,690 --> 01:36:46,690
to do things for them.

1810
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:51,490
I mean, this is really bad, folks, what's going on.

1811
01:36:51,890 --> 01:36:55,090
But in the same time, food, clothing and shelter,

1812
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:56,890
you can still seek out good food.

1813
01:36:57,030 --> 01:36:59,210
You could still seek out, like I say, seek out.

1814
01:36:59,630 --> 01:37:02,750
By the way, if anyone enjoys the art of cooking, let's say,

1815
01:37:03,870 --> 01:37:07,030
you'll find that going out into eating publicly right now,

1816
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:09,850
it's getting harder and harder to find good places to eat

1817
01:37:10,290 --> 01:37:11,350
unless you're fortunate.

1818
01:37:13,310 --> 01:37:17,110
But food, clothing and shelter, find out what's lawful to eat,

1819
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:22,150
what's lawful to wear and how you should form your dwelling.

1820
01:37:23,890 --> 01:37:26,370
And it's going to be real hard going to older people

1821
01:37:26,370 --> 01:37:28,890
asking for advice because they've all been reduced to fools.

1822
01:37:29,070 --> 01:37:29,830
Oops, did I just say that?

1823
01:37:29,890 --> 01:37:30,390
Yes, I did.

1824
01:37:31,530 --> 01:37:34,170
So, yeah, it's really a tough time right now.

1825
01:37:34,270 --> 01:37:35,730
But it's also, it's never been a time

1826
01:37:35,730 --> 01:37:37,270
where things are so easy to get.

1827
01:37:37,850 --> 01:37:39,990
Energy is still relatively cheap.

1828
01:37:39,990 --> 01:37:43,430
Things can be sent anywhere in the world relatively cheaply.

1829
01:37:44,190 --> 01:37:45,570
Information can be accessed.

1830
01:37:45,710 --> 01:37:47,690
But if you have no program or operating system

1831
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:50,010
to process that information, it's pretty much worthless.

1832
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:53,610
So, by the way, just to sum things up,

1833
01:37:53,710 --> 01:37:55,730
because we kind of like tend to bring up things

1834
01:37:56,850 --> 01:37:58,450
redundantly, maybe repetitive things.

1835
01:37:58,950 --> 01:38:00,910
Your operating system, your law,

1836
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:03,710
I'm not talking about traffic law or tax law

1837
01:38:03,710 --> 01:38:05,430
or what pranksters like to call it law.

1838
01:38:05,890 --> 01:38:07,650
But your law is what you eat, what you wear,

1839
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:09,230
how you keep time, how you raise a family,

1840
01:38:09,230 --> 01:38:11,350
how you go into a contract, how you deal with a neighbor,

1841
01:38:11,530 --> 01:38:14,450
how you deal with an enemy, how you deal with animals,

1842
01:38:14,990 --> 01:38:16,010
how you deal with your God.

1843
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:19,510
All those laws come from your deity, from your God.

1844
01:38:20,290 --> 01:38:21,670
Now, I know you don't like that.

1845
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:24,630
Typical surface-dwelling earth inhabitant

1846
01:38:24,630 --> 01:38:25,910
doesn't need a God, they think.

1847
01:38:26,410 --> 01:38:27,590
And neither do they want to know.

1848
01:38:27,870 --> 01:38:30,870
That's why I go back to saying they're unrehabilitatable

1849
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:32,010
when it comes to this subject.

1850
01:38:32,130 --> 01:38:33,910
But those rules come from your God.

1851
01:38:34,930 --> 01:38:37,670
Yes, and my favorite is someone who says,

1852
01:38:37,670 --> 01:38:38,590
well, I'm an atheist.

1853
01:38:39,010 --> 01:38:41,110
What have you got to say about that?

1854
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:42,310
I'm like, well, that's very simple.

1855
01:38:42,850 --> 01:38:44,530
Do you believe in the laws of the state?

1856
01:38:45,450 --> 01:38:46,370
They're like, yes, I do.

1857
01:38:46,450 --> 01:38:48,810
Well, the state is your God and April 1st is your holiday.

1858
01:38:50,230 --> 01:38:50,990
Very simple.

1859
01:38:51,630 --> 01:38:53,310
If you want to see what people worship,

1860
01:38:53,770 --> 01:38:56,510
ask them where they get their rules and their laws from.

1861
01:38:57,330 --> 01:38:59,670
And most cases, who tells you what to eat,

1862
01:38:59,870 --> 01:39:03,830
what to wear, what to say, how to keep time.

1863
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:05,830
All your laws, in other words, all this stuff.

1864
01:39:05,830 --> 01:39:09,050
Now, what's interesting about it is when children are raised,

1865
01:39:09,170 --> 01:39:12,210
they have no concept of this higher deity form

1866
01:39:12,210 --> 01:39:13,150
in their formative years.

1867
01:39:13,230 --> 01:39:14,990
Their parents tend to fit that.

1868
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:18,850
And it's the higher forms of reality or knowledge

1869
01:39:18,850 --> 01:39:21,730
or instruction are pretty much given to children from parents.

1870
01:39:21,850 --> 01:39:26,410
But now the parents are lying to the children.

1871
01:39:26,830 --> 01:39:28,680
So now the children grow up,

1872
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:34,110
finding out that their initial perception of what was a God

1873
01:39:34,110 --> 01:39:39,390
or be all and all deity, entity or person, let's say, had lied to them.

1874
01:39:39,810 --> 01:39:43,690
So now you wonder why teenagers are so rebellious and rambunctious.

1875
01:39:45,990 --> 01:39:48,690
So the other thing is, the thing I give to,

1876
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:51,590
advice I give to inventors and parents are the same.

1877
01:39:52,110 --> 01:39:55,570
Like with inventors, the biggest mistake an inventor can make,

1878
01:39:56,070 --> 01:39:57,530
if there is such a thing, let's say,

1879
01:39:58,390 --> 01:40:00,190
is to fall in love with their invention.

1880
01:40:00,390 --> 01:40:02,470
Because now they could no longer objectify it.

1881
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:05,130
The biggest mistake parents can make with their children

1882
01:40:05,130 --> 01:40:06,750
is to fall in love with their children.

1883
01:40:08,530 --> 01:40:10,270
Yes, you've heard of favoritism.

1884
01:40:11,890 --> 01:40:14,070
Yes, some parents favor a certain child.

1885
01:40:14,210 --> 01:40:14,850
What does that do?

1886
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:18,090
And also falling in love with the child, you can no longer objectify.

1887
01:40:19,190 --> 01:40:21,710
You see, so, but then again, that's another,

1888
01:40:21,970 --> 01:40:23,550
that's probably an interesting thing.

1889
01:40:23,630 --> 01:40:26,190
We've kind of tried to touch on love before,

1890
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:29,750
how falling in love or falling into anything is not good.

1891
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:33,410
Like falling into a well or falling down, right?

1892
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:36,090
But why would you want to fall in love?

1893
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:37,190
You have to learn how to love.

1894
01:40:37,930 --> 01:40:38,850
You know, people just say,

1895
01:40:38,890 --> 01:40:41,390
my favorite is when the morons that are in media,

1896
01:40:41,590 --> 01:40:43,270
all media say, all you need is love.

1897
01:40:44,290 --> 01:40:44,690
Really?

1898
01:40:45,950 --> 01:40:47,370
What if you go to the national,

1899
01:40:47,630 --> 01:40:51,290
if you go to the national pedophile convention,

1900
01:40:51,470 --> 01:40:53,050
what kind of love are they talking about?

1901
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:56,310
What kind of a love does a serial killer have?

1902
01:40:56,330 --> 01:40:57,650
He loves doing that, doesn't he?

1903
01:40:58,650 --> 01:41:00,110
People got to define things.

1904
01:41:00,390 --> 01:41:01,490
That's why I keep saying,

1905
01:41:01,790 --> 01:41:03,810
humanity is unrehabilitatable at this point.

1906
01:41:03,930 --> 01:41:06,070
You just have to ride it through and set yourself apart.

1907
01:41:06,750 --> 01:41:07,750
Is that always, yeah.

1908
01:41:08,270 --> 01:41:14,170
I'm always curious if those who are telling others to follow their dreams,

1909
01:41:14,450 --> 01:41:16,070
if they've just never had a bad dream,

1910
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:18,350
or just assume that no one else has bad dreams.

1911
01:41:19,670 --> 01:41:21,210
Yeah, well, dreams are inputted as well.

1912
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:24,590
Follow your dreams, follow your heart.

1913
01:41:25,030 --> 01:41:26,630
We have to be asleep, right?

1914
01:41:26,930 --> 01:41:27,390
To do that.

1915
01:41:27,390 --> 01:41:30,390
Yeah, dreams, by the way, you're being plugged.

1916
01:41:30,630 --> 01:41:33,390
We did it on Ocelli and the Greek, did a discussion about dreams.

1917
01:41:34,130 --> 01:41:35,830
The dreams are not your own, they're a communication.

1918
01:41:36,570 --> 01:41:37,690
Yeah, we talked a little bit,

1919
01:41:37,790 --> 01:41:40,550
not about dreams necessarily in specificity,

1920
01:41:40,970 --> 01:41:44,330
but we did talk a bit, I believe it was last week,

1921
01:41:45,250 --> 01:41:47,390
about the input and output,

1922
01:41:48,210 --> 01:41:49,710
where thoughts come from,

1923
01:41:50,490 --> 01:41:51,610
things of that nature.

1924
01:41:52,650 --> 01:41:55,170
Yeah, it's all external input.

1925
01:41:55,890 --> 01:41:58,170
Humans, or let's say for lack of a better term,

1926
01:41:58,370 --> 01:42:00,770
you're not born with an operating system like an animal.

1927
01:42:01,050 --> 01:42:03,970
Again, the metaphor is if a puppy or a small,

1928
01:42:04,110 --> 01:42:07,850
very young, immature dog was raised by a family of gorillas to adulthood,

1929
01:42:07,970 --> 01:42:08,730
and you brought it home,

1930
01:42:08,810 --> 01:42:10,810
you couldn't tell it was raised by gorillas,

1931
01:42:10,890 --> 01:42:12,690
it would still behave like a dog behaves,

1932
01:42:13,030 --> 01:42:14,990
or how you would expect a dog to behave.

1933
01:42:15,610 --> 01:42:17,270
But if you had a six or nine week old,

1934
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:21,050
or even six month old human child raised by gorillas,

1935
01:42:21,710 --> 01:42:23,250
and if you brought him home as an adult,

1936
01:42:23,390 --> 01:42:24,790
guess what he'll be acting like?

1937
01:42:25,290 --> 01:42:28,490
It's because you don't have internal operating system,

1938
01:42:28,490 --> 01:42:29,710
it has to be downloaded.

1939
01:42:29,850 --> 01:42:31,610
That's why humans and people have schools,

1940
01:42:32,150 --> 01:42:33,330
and instruction and discipline.

1941
01:42:33,650 --> 01:42:34,850
I mean, there's a school of fish,

1942
01:42:34,890 --> 01:42:37,570
but that's a different concept or context,

1943
01:42:38,050 --> 01:42:41,050
where the only creatures that require instruction,

1944
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:42,190
discipline and training.

1945
01:42:42,570 --> 01:42:45,310
And right now, going back to the older people,

1946
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:48,670
go out in public or anyone you know, family or friend,

1947
01:42:48,810 --> 01:42:51,170
that's older than 50 and try to have a discussion

1948
01:42:51,170 --> 01:42:53,250
and try to sort out what they're saying.

1949
01:42:53,250 --> 01:42:57,090
If there's any wisdom in them at all, you will find not.

1950
01:42:57,610 --> 01:42:59,710
That's one of the sign of the times, by the way, folks.

1951
01:43:00,990 --> 01:43:01,990
It's rare.

1952
01:43:02,630 --> 01:43:05,690
It's very, very rare, much more rare than it used to be.

1953
01:43:06,690 --> 01:43:09,990
I would say that one piece of wisdom

1954
01:43:10,670 --> 01:43:16,690
that was given to me from someone that was older

1955
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:22,010
and actually secondhand was be happy.

1956
01:43:23,350 --> 01:43:23,750
Right.

1957
01:43:24,770 --> 01:43:26,290
Well, how do you do that?

1958
01:43:26,390 --> 01:43:28,830
Ask them how and they might fall flat on their face.

1959
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:32,290
It was the answer to a question,

1960
01:43:32,570 --> 01:43:34,970
what should I do?

1961
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:38,330
It was an answer to a question

1962
01:43:38,330 --> 01:43:42,090
that was very specifically seeking out wisdom.

1963
01:43:42,530 --> 01:43:44,850
But hold on, Seth, just be happy.

1964
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:46,390
I can get a T-shirt that says that.

1965
01:43:46,430 --> 01:43:48,030
I don't need an old fool to tell me that.

1966
01:43:48,030 --> 01:43:49,850
Right, no, absolutely.

1967
01:43:50,670 --> 01:43:51,070
Absolutely.

1968
01:43:51,070 --> 01:43:56,650
But it was and that was the end of it.

1969
01:43:56,910 --> 01:43:58,430
That was the answer.

1970
01:43:58,630 --> 01:44:01,970
And yeah, how it does certainly beg the question,

1971
01:44:02,450 --> 01:44:05,070
how exactly is it complete?

1972
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:08,410
People are still used to the half hour sitcom

1973
01:44:08,410 --> 01:44:11,630
or one hour sitcom where everything is falling to pieces

1974
01:44:11,630 --> 01:44:13,370
and they fix it in the last five minutes.

1975
01:44:13,770 --> 01:44:15,730
That kind of satisfies their notion

1976
01:44:15,730 --> 01:44:18,210
of being taken for an emotional ride and being lazy

1977
01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:19,890
because someone else will fix it

1978
01:44:19,890 --> 01:44:24,650
in the few remaining bits of interim of time.

1979
01:44:25,230 --> 01:44:27,430
But essentially, that is true as well.

1980
01:44:29,170 --> 01:44:32,730
If anyone's listened or wants to research the reality

1981
01:44:32,730 --> 01:44:35,850
that we've kind of laid out about the coming society,

1982
01:44:36,890 --> 01:44:39,670
you know, it will be cleaned up,

1983
01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:41,790
but it's not going to be like you think it is.

1984
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:45,750
In the interim, you've got another couple of years

1985
01:44:46,510 --> 01:44:48,750
for the same stuff that you've been experiencing

1986
01:44:48,750 --> 01:44:50,250
for the past five or six years.

1987
01:44:50,810 --> 01:44:52,510
Not much going to change, folks.

1988
01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:54,450
The next two years,

1989
01:44:54,530 --> 01:44:55,910
there's going to be the next little period

1990
01:44:55,910 --> 01:44:58,690
that's going to kind of click in next seven year period

1991
01:44:58,690 --> 01:45:00,450
and you will start seeing some changes.

1992
01:45:00,590 --> 01:45:02,810
And the changes there are going to lead

1993
01:45:02,810 --> 01:45:05,470
into the support of this Middle East Confederacy

1994
01:45:05,470 --> 01:45:06,350
or Middle East Union

1995
01:45:06,350 --> 01:45:08,470
or all eyes in the Middle East reforming.

1996
01:45:08,970 --> 01:45:10,210
It's going to get kind of messy.

1997
01:45:11,350 --> 01:45:13,330
You know, everyone is always looking

1998
01:45:13,330 --> 01:45:14,930
where it's noisy right now.

1999
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:18,870
Turkey, Syria, you know, a little bit of Iraq,

2000
01:45:19,070 --> 01:45:20,470
but they're not looking anywhere else,

2001
01:45:20,570 --> 01:45:21,330
but I can't blame them.

2002
01:45:21,410 --> 01:45:21,890
They don't know.

2003
01:45:21,970 --> 01:45:22,730
They've never been told.

2004
01:45:22,850 --> 01:45:23,850
They can't figure it out.

2005
01:45:24,950 --> 01:45:26,490
But if you do a little bit of research,

2006
01:45:26,630 --> 01:45:29,070
you will see that the country known as Jordan

2007
01:45:29,070 --> 01:45:31,470
is going to be going through a major upheaval.

2008
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:34,350
So is Lebanon, what's called Lebanon.

2009
01:45:35,910 --> 01:45:38,450
And yeah, and also Iraq will be split.

2010
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:43,230
And if anyone wants to look at the news in Iraq right now,

2011
01:45:43,230 --> 01:45:45,790
you will see that since the past two weeks,

2012
01:45:47,390 --> 01:45:49,670
several hundred people, if not a thousand people

2013
01:45:49,670 --> 01:45:52,110
overran the parliament that was set up

2014
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:54,230
in what's called the Green Zone,

2015
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:55,470
which is the federal district,

2016
01:45:55,570 --> 01:45:56,690
the foreign district there,

2017
01:45:57,190 --> 01:45:58,810
and ran all the politicians out.

2018
01:45:58,910 --> 01:46:00,250
They ran and they haven't come back.

2019
01:46:01,870 --> 01:46:03,030
Has this made the news?

2020
01:46:03,110 --> 01:46:04,170
Are you guys talking about it?

2021
01:46:04,210 --> 01:46:04,370
No.

2022
01:46:05,570 --> 01:46:08,510
You know, and actually there is a Australian,

2023
01:46:08,830 --> 01:46:10,770
Belgian and Dutch delegation formed

2024
01:46:10,770 --> 01:46:15,630
to discuss perhaps who should get what

2025
01:46:16,210 --> 01:46:17,810
in the northern part of Iraq

2026
01:46:17,810 --> 01:46:19,490
because it shouldn't be part of Iraq.

2027
01:46:20,170 --> 01:46:20,550
Interesting.

2028
01:46:22,230 --> 01:46:23,970
And none of these things are being looked at

2029
01:46:23,970 --> 01:46:25,610
at the moment or discussed.

2030
01:46:25,810 --> 01:46:27,190
Just Syria and Turkey, of course,

2031
01:46:27,550 --> 01:46:29,430
which I think you and I have discussed years ago

2032
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:30,990
to watch Syria and Turkey

2033
01:46:30,990 --> 01:46:33,770
because when this new country is formed in northern Iraq,

2034
01:46:34,130 --> 01:46:35,730
it's going to take some land from Syria

2035
01:46:35,730 --> 01:46:36,950
and some land from Turkey.

2036
01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:41,550
So also watch the country known as Iran or Persia.

2037
01:46:42,250 --> 01:46:44,270
They are going to be unified more than ever.

2038
01:46:44,610 --> 01:46:45,350
What would you mean?

2039
01:46:45,550 --> 01:46:46,910
You know, well, they actually have two forms

2040
01:46:46,910 --> 01:46:47,870
of government there.

2041
01:46:48,470 --> 01:46:50,510
Yeah, you could go and research that on your own

2042
01:46:50,510 --> 01:46:51,110
if you see what I mean.

2043
01:46:52,150 --> 01:46:52,950
And yeah.

2044
01:46:53,110 --> 01:46:56,270
So yeah, these things are all going to be forming.

2045
01:46:56,730 --> 01:46:57,470
Look at Israel.

2046
01:46:57,750 --> 01:46:59,410
People don't like to, you know,

2047
01:46:59,450 --> 01:47:01,430
the quote unquote Jews have been demonized.

2048
01:47:01,550 --> 01:47:02,930
Now that has nothing to do with Israel

2049
01:47:02,930 --> 01:47:05,830
because Jew being a Jew is a religion.

2050
01:47:05,830 --> 01:47:10,050
There is no such thing as a race, by the way, as Jewish.

2051
01:47:10,390 --> 01:47:12,310
If you want to get more specific,

2052
01:47:12,570 --> 01:47:14,990
that word does not exist in the biblical text.

2053
01:47:15,630 --> 01:47:19,010
The word that is translated as Jewish is Judean,

2054
01:47:19,530 --> 01:47:22,450
which is a regional part geographically

2055
01:47:22,450 --> 01:47:25,350
or a bloodline from Yehudah or Judah.

2056
01:47:27,130 --> 01:47:30,050
So the level of inaccuracy right now

2057
01:47:30,050 --> 01:47:32,050
that's pervasive in the world

2058
01:47:32,050 --> 01:47:33,670
makes it nearly impossible

2059
01:47:33,670 --> 01:47:35,990
to communicate anything clearly and succinctly.

2060
01:47:37,190 --> 01:47:38,570
So until the corrections are made,

2061
01:47:38,650 --> 01:47:40,790
which hopefully I think the mindset will be open

2062
01:47:40,790 --> 01:47:43,070
in the next couple of years for more correction.

2063
01:47:43,230 --> 01:47:43,970
That's why again,

2064
01:47:44,290 --> 01:47:46,950
dubbing anything and everyone can access right now

2065
01:47:46,950 --> 01:47:48,550
as a dummy load is fairly accurate

2066
01:47:48,550 --> 01:47:51,070
until the next time we come around in a week or so.

2067
01:47:51,950 --> 01:47:52,490
All right.

2068
01:47:52,790 --> 01:47:56,210
Well, thank you, Greek, as always for the conversation.

2069
01:47:56,850 --> 01:48:00,610
You can find ways to get ahold of us

2070
01:48:00,610 --> 01:48:02,790
at uncommonradio.com,

2071
01:48:03,370 --> 01:48:06,150
email links to the various sites and things like that.

2072
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:09,710
Again, check out ocelliandthegreek.com as well

2073
01:48:09,710 --> 01:48:11,990
for someone who's listening for archives.

2074
01:48:12,230 --> 01:48:12,730
Yeah, absolutely.

2075
01:48:14,130 --> 01:48:14,830
And yeah, great.

2076
01:48:14,930 --> 01:48:15,190
Thanks.

2077
01:48:15,790 --> 01:48:16,950
And we'll see you again next week, guys.

2078
01:48:17,010 --> 01:48:17,230
Thanks.
