00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,890
Greetings once again and welcome to Uncommon Sense with The Greek and Seth Michael.

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:06,690
And you're listening to us on American Freedom Radio.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:12,030
At AmericanFreedomRadio.com there is also a chat if you would like to participate in.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,570
And perhaps there might be a Ustream going on as well.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,370
You will find that at www.uncommonradio.com.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:26,130
That would be the site that we probably would also call for use of contacting The Greek

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,410
and Seth for this current sonic project.

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:34,690
And yes, this is a sonic project that we bring to you, we meaning The Greek and Seth,

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,870
perhaps to discuss things that are uncommon which tend to be obvious in many cases.

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,530
You might notice we don't like to be pedantic or academic

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,050
or basically discuss things that are not attainable.

12
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:55,590
I think the easiest way to consider what we're saying is maybe the last thing that's left

13
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,830
for man to discover is the obvious, right?

14
00:00:59,070 --> 00:00:59,590
What do you think, Seth?

15
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,190
I would agree.

16
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,130
I would agree.

17
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,510
And just for confirmation, we are broadcasting on Ustream as well.

18
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:05,810
Excellent.

19
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:06,730
Great.

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,270
Thank you.

21
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,950
So, Seth, what do you think about one of the things that we like to bring up are things

22
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:16,430
that are lawful or based on something or founded on something that are tangible versus this

23
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,470
fictional self-consuming lie that everyone seems to be engaged in.

24
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,950
When I say everyone, and I don't want to be dark about it, I mean pretty much everyone.

25
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,450
There's only a small handful of people on the planet that are left that are really willing

26
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,230
to pay attention to what's right in front of them and discuss it in a rational manner.

27
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:43,650
You know, the discussions that we like to bring forward are pretty much something

28
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:47,170
that is not really out of necessity but maybe a personal one

29
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,950
because they're not being said anywhere else or by anyone.

30
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,070
And I think they can be known and can be discussed to help perhaps, well, not necessarily help,

31
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:02,990
but necessarily maybe sonically present what can be presented that maybe should be presented

32
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,090
from an objective point of view, you know?

33
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,130
Yeah, absolutely.

34
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:14,950
The subject matter is certainly discussed in other forums and other venues.

35
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:20,370
But as far as how it is discussed, it's very uncommon.

36
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:30,650
And yeah, whether it's helpful or not is, I suppose, that can be argued one way or the other.

37
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,650
But that depends a lot upon your perspective, so.

38
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:35,410
Right.

39
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,850
And the thing is I found that there's a lot of discussions still going on about making the

40
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,530
world a better place or helping people.

41
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,270
People really don't want that.

42
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:48,570
And I'm not saying this from a point of view that I tend to want to deliver

43
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,710
because it's what I think.

44
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,110
It's because what can be observed.

45
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,310
There's a couple of sayings that say, you know, I want you to do well,

46
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,390
but I don't want you to do better than I'm doing, right, kind of thing.

47
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,050
That's what people think, you know?

48
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,850
Or in public speaking, I've seen when someone is doing a presentation,

49
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:04,690
if you look at the eyes of the audience, they're like,

50
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,310
when is this guy going to shut up and sit down so I can take the microphone

51
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,110
so people can hear what I have to say?

52
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:16,770
And what I've noticed, there's an old philosophical saying that said that a fool

53
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,570
has to say something, but the wise have something to say.

54
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:25,850
I get the feeling very often looking at media, all media, that people are coming on and showing

55
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:30,190
up and presenting shows or presenting projects, whether it's mainstream or alternative,

56
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,610
and it's filler.

57
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,430
Basically, they have to say something.

58
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,590
But basically, what they're saying is unfounded.

59
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:43,150
And you hear a lot of discussion on conspiracy theories, certain researches,

60
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:49,930
whether it's all the way from history, assassinations, all the way to 9-11,

61
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,550
going all the way to various forms of science and new aginess.

62
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,930
And I try to look up a lot of the stuff that's being brought up or seeing what it's based on.

63
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,390
And I just gotta.

64
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:08,350
And there's a lot of work being put in perhaps to present these things.

65
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:14,270
And there's an old saying that says perhaps a workman is worth his due or worth his wages.

66
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:20,310
But in this case, I think a parrot is worth a cracker because all I see is parroting.

67
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,790
You've heard one, you've heard them all in a way.

68
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,390
And it's very, very common in that way that it's just junk out there.

69
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,290
That's why we like to call it the dummy load,

70
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,830
which is like basically spending your time running on a treadmill.

71
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,930
Yes, the meter, the pedometer or odometer or whatever on the treadmill says you ran three miles.

72
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,770
But I'm telling you that you got dummy loaded.

73
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,150
You didn't go anywhere.

74
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:52,110
And that's exactly what's happening in all media right now.

75
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,390
And I mean all media with a capital L.

76
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:01,410
And yeah, so this is just one of the reasons why we tend to show up for this sonic project.

77
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,190
And all things come to an end.

78
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,190
Yes, this is a limited sonic project.

79
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,950
In other words, the title of Uncommon Sense will not be around forever and ever and ever

80
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,970
as people like to think or say, you know, that show's still around.

81
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,730
Well, you know, this is a limited sonic venture.

82
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,030
And one of the limitations is perhaps a numeric one.

83
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,710
I think this might be the ninth time we're coming together.

84
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,990
Who knows how many more we're going to do.

85
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,150
But I was kind of having some private discussions with the administrative side, you know, people who,

86
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,870
well, let's say people as in people, one that likes to help out behind the scenes.

87
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,270
And perhaps maybe rehashing a lot of the things that were brought

88
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,010
up on the last sonic project that was done on AFR.

89
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:50,590
And going over them, maybe filling in a little bit more information.

90
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:54,750
And one of the things which leads us to today's discussion, perhaps, Seth,

91
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:59,390
was there was discussion in the last sonic project of perhaps doing something

92
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:04,710
in quotes called a cooking show or food preparation or food or nutrition and things like that.

93
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,530
And there was a good reply.

94
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,030
And I kind of mentioned it briefly.

95
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,530
I don't know if you remember or the folks at AFR at the end

96
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,610
of the last program I mentioned I want to do something regarding food.

97
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:24,970
And interestingly enough, two days ago on Common Sense Radio, we got an email regarding that.

98
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:30,010
So what a better way to kind of underpin the thought, you know.

99
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:36,330
So might want to talk about something that might let the listener feel and actually

100
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:42,390
in practice have some more skill after the next hour and 50 minutes or so.

101
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:49,730
Because again, very often the dummy load doesn't leave you with a lot of anything to take away with.

102
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,350
You know, a lot of people listen to internet radio and mainstream radio

103
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,810
because it's background or they get emotionally excited.

104
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,130
Today we're going to try to do something that will perhaps leave the listener

105
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,910
with actually a little more skill.

106
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,550
Now if you're terrified of what's called cooking or not interested,

107
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:11,270
obviously you might clearly mark this as saying, well, I'm not interested in this subject matter.

108
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:16,790
But nonetheless, even if you're not interested, you might find it interesting.

109
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,150
Let's just suggest that.

110
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,230
So what do you think about that, Seth?

111
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,110
Are you ready to go on something like that?

112
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:28,910
You and I in private have shared various things about food preparation and food in general.

113
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,830
And what would you say up until now?

114
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,890
I mean, in private discussion, I think it might be worth bringing some

115
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,450
of it publicly is what I'm suggesting.

116
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,510
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

117
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,770
Good food, good drink, good company.

118
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:46,410
If nothing else, those are certainly what I try to achieve personally.

119
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,030
Those are words of wisdom, folks, by the way.

120
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,810
Good food, good drink, good company.

121
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,490
Those things are important.

122
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,290
You want to survive?

123
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,330
Good food, good drink.

124
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,890
I was thinking about this the other day.

125
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:05,850
You know, being on alternative media, those of you that do listen to it often

126
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:13,270
or even occasionally are liable to hear, you know, survivalists.

127
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,110
There's a word for them.

128
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:14,730
What are the preppers?

129
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,530
They call them preppers.

130
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,690
And that's fine if that's what you want to do.

131
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,630
That's I mean, it's it's vanity, just like just about everything else is.

132
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:25,970
But at the same time, some of the things that come up a lot when in the concept

133
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,590
of that is, you know, food, clothing, shelter.

134
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:35,169
And I like to add people into those as far as necessities and honestly, clothing

135
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:38,309
and shelter, you combine into one because clothing is shelter.

136
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:39,970
But so it's food.

137
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,430
And if you consider, you know, water, good water as part of that.

138
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,410
So you've got food, shelter and people.

139
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,150
That's that's what's necessary to survive comfortably.

140
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:54,170
And the scary part about that, Seth, is some of when you say people, the thought,

141
00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:00,530
even though albeit being dark, is that if you don't understand certain forms of meat,

142
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,930
you could be fed people and actually enjoy it and would not know that you were.

143
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,470
But anyway, that's what we'll get into that discussion, how scary that is.

144
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:15,210
And I want to also give a true account that someone who had a restaurant, what they had done

145
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,090
regarding that and how they got away with it.

146
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,410
And I took it to the next level for them and they didn't like it.

147
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,950
But it's the truth. So, yeah.

148
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,070
So what do you think?

149
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:30,450
I think getting into the food thing is really a big subject because we can discuss food prep

150
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,450
without actually discussing any direct food prep at all.

151
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:39,530
In other words, procedures or recipes, because there's an entire mindset that could be laid

152
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,170
down or considered just approaching the subject.

153
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,450
And maybe you want to get into the mindset a little bit, which would be, you know, there's

154
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:51,930
quality, there's types of food based on seasonality, which directly affect what's called

155
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,410
health and well-being or being able to adapt in one's to one's environment.

156
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:04,210
There's also, I guess, a level of in order to practice the art of cooking, there's a level

157
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,230
of equipment that might be required, right, to some extent.

158
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,610
And also discuss, you know, cooking versus non-cooking and all these other things.

159
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,970
These are just the mindsets.

160
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:23,430
And maybe just covering the first thing, which is perhaps, you know, people say you are

161
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,370
what you eat. I would suggest you are what you ate.

162
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:34,150
Right. So from that point of view, the suggestion and beyond suggestion, the

163
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:39,550
reality, the objective reality would be is if you were dropped here from a starship on

164
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,510
this planet, left for three days to take notes, you'd realize that there is a seasonality

165
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:52,830
on this planet that bears a different yield from the land, even from the animal crop,

166
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,390
let's say. All right.

167
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,970
Like a lot of the newborns are born in the spring on the animals and things like that.

168
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,530
So that bears on seasonality.

169
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:05,710
In other words, food is seasonal, like certain things grow at certain times of year based

170
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,850
on temperature and positioning and things like that.

171
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:13,690
And the suggestion and more than a suggestion that has been made is that could it be that

172
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:20,090
the from even just think about it from a biochemical or chemistry perspective, that what

173
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,850
you eat adjusts the body chemistry.

174
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:28,830
Right. And that holds true because if it didn't, people wouldn't take drugs.

175
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,010
Think about it for a moment.

176
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:36,610
Right. So what brings to mind the let your food be your medicine and your medicine, be your

177
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:41,270
food, which is not biblical, by the way, but it is a pretty good saying and it does rhyme

178
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,630
almost. Right.

179
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,230
Right. Interesting thing about biblical stuff, by the way, people, that's the book that

180
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,190
everyone loves to hate.

181
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:54,890
And yeah, I was just going to say that to me it brings to mind just the helpfulness of

182
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:58,810
food. And if you are in need of medicine, chances are you're just not eating.

183
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:05,710
Well, some properly right now, could it be again just that we've been kind of this

184
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,870
should almost be mentioned every time as a credo or get a T-shirt or hat.

185
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:14,310
Could it be that if you live in a warm climate and you eat food from a cold climate that

186
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:19,170
the food will adjust your body to the climate that it was grown in or harvested from?

187
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,790
I would suggest, yes.

188
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:26,650
And could it be if you lived in a cold climate or cold season, if you ate food that was

189
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:30,390
grown in the tropics, it would adjust your body to the tropics and you'd be pretty

190
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,450
miserable again, I would suggest.

191
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,310
Yes. Now, the interesting thing about this, Seth, I was having a discussion.

192
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:41,650
I've never I've never been met with any resistance on this concept, but I would like to

193
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,590
say that nine out of 10 people who try this find it to be successful.

194
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,030
Why not out of 10? Well, it's really 10 out of 10.

195
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,550
Well, why did I say nine out of 10?

196
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:53,370
Because there's one individual that I did run into and I did ask him how the eating

197
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,810
seasonally or eating cross latitude worked for him.

198
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,970
And he says, well, that doesn't work.

199
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,990
It didn't work for me. And I'm like, well, what did you do?

200
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,310
What did you change that you discovered it didn't work?

201
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,250
Your answer to the individual was, I didn't do any of it.

202
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,910
Yet they said it didn't work.

203
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,450
So this is a reaction that is super rational, of course, you know.

204
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,490
So I would say at that point, when you scratch that particular experience or comment or

205
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:25,450
feedback out, it's 10 out of 10, which is pretty good batting average.

206
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:32,130
So to continue with that thought just a little bit more, it's also a cross latitude

207
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:38,530
thing. There's an interesting thing that goes on that, you know, we've given many

208
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:43,350
examples where, let's say you're living in the northeast of the States here and you're

209
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,910
knee deep in snow and you have what's called a common cold and you are told that

210
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,950
vitamin C will help that.

211
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:55,650
The first thing you think about or remember is that you're also told that oranges have

212
00:13:55,650 --> 00:14:02,010
vitamin C. You start drinking orange juice, which has grown in a warmer climate out of

213
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:07,310
season. And typically people do not get better because that orange will adjust your

214
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:12,790
body chemistry to the southern latitudes and vice versa.

215
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,810
I can I can personally attest to that.

216
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:21,530
That's when all growing up, you know, I was encouraged to start getting a head cold,

217
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,810
start feeling under the weather.

218
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,470
You need that vitamin C and get that vitamin C from that orange juice.

219
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:32,730
And so I would start getting stuffed up or whatever, you know, mucusy, I'll say.

220
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,450
And then I'd be like, oh, I'm starting to get sick.

221
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,530
My throat's a little bit irritated.

222
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,010
I'm going to I'm going to drink.

223
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,870
I'm going to go get a jug of orange juice, you know, the fresher, the better.

224
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,190
And I'm going to drink as much of it as I can stand.

225
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,650
And without fail, it would it would constantly make it worse.

226
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:55,590
I would become whatever symptoms I was I had at the time would just be

227
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:01,690
exasperated. And in a conversation with you and me, it's probably been nearly three

228
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:08,170
years ago. You suggested that was probably a bad plan that I'm paraphrasing.

229
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:13,890
Yeah, I stopped doing that and started concentrating more on just constantly

230
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:22,230
drinking, you know, as decent a quality of water as I can attain currently, which

231
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:25,550
right now is basically just out of the tap and then chilled.

232
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:30,370
I'm not not poured over ice, but actually kept chilled in the refrigerator in

233
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,370
glass. I'm fond of drinking out of glass, actually.

234
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:39,330
But it yeah, it's I've stopped.

235
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,050
I'm getting ahead of myself.

236
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,890
But yeah, the orange juice I can personally attest to.

237
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:48,070
If you're living in the States in the winter, don't don't drink orange juice.

238
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:52,850
Well, yeah, the thing is, you've got to realize that everything's based on

239
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,970
commerce. You could even look at the days that people acknowledge and celebrate.

240
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,070
They're all it's the god of commerce, let's say.

241
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:04,830
So, you know, it's a very powerful god, by the way, this particular one that forces

242
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,830
this notion that things have to be done for the sake of commerce.

243
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:13,110
So, you know, but the water is another thing.

244
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:17,710
And but, you know, just just to go it's actually another it's the same thing, really

245
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:22,570
water quality, which ties in with a lot of questions as regarding overall health.

246
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:28,410
You know, the mismanagement, mishandling and mistransporting of water is actually

247
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,750
one of the causes of the major ills and ailments in society.

248
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:37,670
Yes, it is. And that's a that's I think we should do a discussion on water alone

249
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,890
because there is no rational discussion on water on the Internet right now at all.

250
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:48,490
We could dedicate an entire an entire two hours or an entire season of broadcast to

251
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,930
water. I've very, very easily.

252
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,030
That's why I said, well, I'm kind of getting ahead of myself because I ran you off of

253
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,390
the. Oh, that's fine.

254
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,210
Yeah, the tropical and all that.

255
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:04,230
It also works inverse if you're living in a hot climate, let's say in the American

256
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:09,109
Southwest and during the summer and you enjoy salmon or tuna, which is typically

257
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:12,609
harvested from a cold climate, you will not be able to cool down.

258
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,270
You see that will adjust.

259
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:19,190
You know, that's why the concept of people have heard of the people that live up in

260
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:25,690
the very northern regions of the Earth tend to eat very fatty foods.

261
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:32,130
Right. People know that, you know, there's a high consumption of fat and animal

262
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:37,430
product will thicken the blood, let's say colloquially, and, you know, high consumption

263
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,890
of other things that grown in the tropics thin out the blood.

264
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:44,830
And so these are very simple, basic concepts which are discussed by no one.

265
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,930
When I mean no one statistically, I have never heard anyone discussing them, especially

266
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:52,930
on alternative media. Now, I have someone in the background that did tell me that there

267
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,530
is a particular quote unquote doctor that did suggest that.

268
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,710
And kudos to them.

269
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,930
Of course, there are people that know about this.

270
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:08,830
There's a concept known as macrobiotics, but that is really so centered on the Asian

271
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:15,510
aspect of doing things, again, kind of dogmatic that they also suggest eating locally

272
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,790
and somewhat seasonally.

273
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:22,630
So there is this notion and this was done consistently, by the way, before this

274
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:25,090
international commerce was imposed.

275
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:29,490
So, again, you know, we spend quite a bit of time discussing something that we always

276
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:35,170
discuss only because it's very, very, very, let's say, critical in comprehending you

277
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,070
are what you ate.

278
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:41,850
So I think the next thing that you mentioned, we can dedicate quite a bit of time just

279
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,710
discussing water.

280
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,630
And here's the thing.

281
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:49,350
This is what is not being discussed that is critical, folks, is that water likes to be

282
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,990
kept cool and in the dark to have a higher quality.

283
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:57,610
If you want to raise the quality of any water, cool it down and keep it out of light.

284
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:02,910
That's why all of the majority of the waters that you buy are in clear containers and at

285
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,730
room temperature. Right.

286
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:07,010
The opposite. Yeah.

287
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,670
And you have morons with a capital R discussing.

288
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,470
These are water discussions on alternative media and some mainstream.

289
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:19,850
And they never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever bring those two

290
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,210
simple points of raising the quality of water up.

291
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,750
They'll tell you all these fanciful stories about their experiences and what water is.

292
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,410
And I'm telling you, it is idiotic to the core.

293
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,450
All of them, not some of them.

294
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,970
And, you know, here's the thing.

295
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:38,110
The reason I'm saying this is because if they weren't, we would not be planning on

296
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,150
discussing water, would not be discussing water.

297
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:44,750
We'd simply break the chain and give you a link to where you could find the

298
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:50,290
information. But sorry, guys, if you it's not out there, no one is discussing it.

299
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:57,710
Now, what is out there is the works of Victor Schauberger, VIKTOR, S-C-H-A-U-B-E-R-G-E-R.

300
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,450
He was a naturalist and he did a lot of work.

301
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,330
Don't get wrapped around the axle with the UFOs and all the fancy machines.

302
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,690
Go and understand the concepts that he found out to be relevant.

303
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:15,570
So with that said about water, keep it cool and keep it in the dark and you will

304
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,310
raise its quality immediately.

305
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,790
Well, meaning overnight at least with because the more duration it has to a certain

306
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:27,110
point in the coolness and in the dark, the more it will mature to that higher quality

307
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,630
form. Because the other problem, the main problem with water is the way it's being

308
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:36,150
transported. It's through straight pipes and in square boxes or bottles with flat

309
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,570
bottoms. So that's going to be very difficult to overcome.

310
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,830
But, you know, so so those are the two major points that we kind of always bring up

311
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,590
is sort of something regarding water.

312
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,950
Well, regarding eating seasonally and then the water being something that needs to be

313
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,210
considered and perhaps do a dedicated time to it.

314
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,390
But what about food?

315
00:20:55,790 --> 00:21:00,610
Let's get back to that. Now, we mentioned that there's many aspects to it, but the

316
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:07,930
general aspects are basically most food needs some preparation before it's consumed.

317
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:14,370
You know, even people that eat raw food tend to want to wash some of the dirt off, you

318
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,950
know, so there is some preparation there.

319
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:22,770
By the way, bringing up the concept of raw food, there is a lot of raw food discussion.

320
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,930
There was more, let's say, in the past somewhat.

321
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,550
This is the basic concept of raw food, and this is going to be a tall claim and you

322
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,890
might want to consider it.

323
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:42,370
Typically, the more active the being, the more raw food can be taken and the less

324
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:48,010
active, more sedentary the being, the more it should be cooked, let's say.

325
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:52,650
So if you look at all the wild animals that jump around and move around, tend to eat

326
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,650
raw food, they're fine.

327
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:58,290
If you're very active, for example, and by the way, just throw this in there.

328
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,930
Yes, raw food does retain more, quote unquote, nutrition and vitality because you're

329
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,230
actually eating something that's alive and transferring that life force to the body.

330
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:11,290
You know, you can't put a cooked carrot in water and have it continue to grow where a

331
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,070
raw carrot will.

332
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:18,970
But typically, if you're, again, the animals that eat raw food tend to be very

333
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,750
active. Animals that tend to be in creatures that tend to be less active tend to have

334
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:28,310
very strong secretions to almost pre-digest the food or dissolve it before they even

335
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:35,090
ingest it. But if you are, for example, a delivery driver, an athlete, a construction

336
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:37,110
worker, you get the point.

337
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:43,230
Even a orchestral conductor, you ever see how they move their arms for two hours?

338
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,130
Very active in that sense.

339
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:52,330
If you are an active individual, you will probably be quite happy and benefit much more

340
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:56,950
from raw food than someone who, let's say, has, quote unquote, an office job that is

341
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:00,470
sedentary or a truck driver who is sedentary.

342
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:07,030
Or so how you spend the level of activity that you pursue, whether it's high or low

343
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:11,750
should determine how much heat is applied to the food, because the heat just breaks

344
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,910
the food down and makes it more its constituents more readily available.

345
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,630
Give another example.

346
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:21,650
When someone isn't feeling well, they lose levity, they lose mobility.

347
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,050
They tend to be horizontal in a restful state.

348
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:28,230
Stews and soups are recommended, right?

349
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,290
Like chicken soup will make you feel better.

350
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,210
What doesn't have to be chicken soup?

351
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,830
It could be miso soup or vegetable soup.

352
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:40,110
It tends, you see, even like, you know, grandma suggests if you have a cold, you're not

353
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:43,090
feeling well, have a soup, right?

354
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:49,090
Some warm tea, something that has been broken down with heat, you see.

355
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:54,090
So that is the idea of the raw versus the cooked.

356
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,950
Let's say it's your level of activity.

357
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,510
Now, what happens if you're if you're sedentary?

358
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:04,310
And I've seen this from being around proponents of raw food and having discussions.

359
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:08,870
And I brought this up and one guy stood up and said, yes, yes, you know, I work at an

360
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,590
office job and I try the raw food thing and I was constantly gassy and I couldn't go to

361
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,850
the bathroom. And then other times I went to the bathroom too much.

362
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:20,350
I said, well, yeah, because the body is not properly, let's say, applying enough energy

363
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:24,650
to the raw food to break it into a state that you can use it.

364
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:30,210
And I was I was probably told to shut up about it because this was a these were raw food

365
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,090
proponents. They had things to sell.

366
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:36,550
So DVDs and books and things like that and also raw food.

367
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:41,850
So they didn't like what I had to say because it actually might have disturbed their

368
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,590
volume. But anyway, of sales.

369
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,590
So again, the commerce thing.

370
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:52,410
So the food prep just covered their idea of being raw or so there's there's a level

371
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:57,950
of prep and prior to prep is obtaining the food, you know, like, you know, there's a

372
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,430
talk now about organic versus GMO.

373
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:08,530
And the first thing I want to say is the body, most natural organisms, men and animal

374
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:10,770
and even plants are very robust.

375
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,430
They can take quite a bit of punishment and toxicity.

376
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:18,450
That's why most things still tend to thrive, even with poor quality food.

377
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:22,250
And yes, GMO foods, genetically modified organisms.

378
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:29,350
And there's a lot of discussion about GMOs and it's given in a way that I call it can

379
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,770
be called fear based and all fear is is designed to disable those that have weak mind

380
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,170
and have lack skill.

381
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:41,730
If you have a weak mind or a weak spirit and you lack skill, you are subject to fearful

382
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:46,190
communications. And I think we've given an analogy with how that works.

383
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:52,410
You know, if you lack, for example, skill in using a mop or a dish rag and milk falls

384
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,730
over, a glass of milk falls over, you are in terror.

385
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:59,850
But if you're next to someone who knows how to operate a dish rag or a mop, they'll tell

386
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,490
you it's OK. Don't be afraid.

387
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,090
It's just spilled milk.

388
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,190
We can take care of it.

389
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:11,070
So right now, it seems that the human culture, lack of a better term, has been sort of

390
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:17,170
modified itself into a state of a weak minded individuals that lack skill.

391
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:23,310
So you are subject to fearful, quote unquote, fearful type of communications.

392
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:28,390
But back to the GMOs regarding that, do a little bit of research.

393
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,770
What they're really doing is very crude.

394
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:35,230
You know, you guys, you guys know what a gene gun is.

395
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,790
I don't know if you ever heard of a gene gun.

396
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:42,990
They actually just inject vegetables and plants and fish and things with chemicals that

397
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:48,370
are attached to heavy metals because the heavy metal acts as a reflector, seeing how the

398
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:51,150
thing will modify and procreate.

399
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:56,870
So it's don't be don't be like, oh, mesmerized or these guys are so technically

400
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,150
advanced, man.

401
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:01,070
They're so like smart to be doing that.

402
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:09,870
Corn comes to mind anytime anyone brings up GMOs, specifically because currently I

403
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,370
think it's somewhere I'm pulling this out of the dark, but it's somewhere between 80

404
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,910
and 90 percent of the corn that's grown in the US for human consumption is genetically

405
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,790
modified. Probably more of the world.

406
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,270
But it's currently between.

407
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:28,950
Yeah, it's the difference between, you know, three heads of or three ears of corn per

408
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:30,990
stock and five years of corn per stock.

409
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,770
But, you know, here's the thing, you know, it's kind of like what came first, the

410
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:39,190
chicken or the egg, it's the chicken farmer, because when you say chicken, you kind

411
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,870
of get an idea of what a chicken looks like.

412
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:44,570
But before the chicken farmer, you know, before they were domesticated, there was a

413
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,810
tremendous variety of chicken.

414
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:49,230
The same with corn. Corn is a type of Bermuda grass, I believe.

415
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:54,930
Don't hold me to it. That was genetically modified, just like, for example, almost

416
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:59,390
all of your leafy green vegetables are genetically modified forms of cabbage that

417
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:03,690
have been begun thousands of years ago by crossing, cross pollinating.

418
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:10,910
Cross pollination is another way to genetically modify, just like a mule, a horse

419
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,390
and a donkey is a cross pollination.

420
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:18,530
And they tend to be sterile when you cross pollinate things in a very abrupt way.

421
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:23,230
But essentially what I wanted to mention, there's a targeted audience out there about

422
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,550
being terrorized about GMOs in the alternative media.

423
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:31,650
And there's also obviously the terrorism, the bio-terrorism that's being done by the

424
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:35,950
guys in white lab coats and certain agencies on the people, you know, because the

425
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:39,050
form of terror is to inflict fear and I guess terror.

426
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:46,830
So so there's a misunderstanding that there's there's genetically modifying genome,

427
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,570
meaning, you know, the hereditary of something.

428
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:53,890
There's been grafting of trees and plants for since time immemorial.

429
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,450
There's been cross pollination since time immemorial.

430
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:01,550
But the reason I brought up the gene gun is they have this really rudimentary thing

431
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:06,170
now where they actually just sit around all day, thousands of experiments of injecting

432
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,490
various things that are targeted.

433
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:11,190
Let's say, you know, what's on the plan to modify with various strains.

434
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:15,490
They call it DNA, but it's really just mitochondria, toxins, dead stuff.

435
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:20,750
And to see how if they could, through trial and error, get plants and things to change

436
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,530
the way they work.

437
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,650
It's very simple. It's very simple.

438
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:30,690
Like there's things called phthalates, P-T-H-A-L-A-T-E-S, phthalates.

439
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,630
It's with a P-T-H.

440
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,590
That's a plasticizer that's used in a lot of plastics.

441
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,710
And it's an estrogen mimicker.

442
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:45,470
So you have, you know, eight, nine year old girls going through menstruation and young

443
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:50,250
men growing breasts and other problems with organs because there is an abundance of this

444
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:55,110
estrogen mimicry through phthalates, you know, BPAs also, things like that.

445
00:29:55,150 --> 00:30:00,970
So there's more to genetic modifying, which means to modify the heredity of something

446
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:05,110
than meets the eye and how it's been purported in the idiotic alternative media.

447
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,110
Yes, I did say that.

448
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:13,670
So anyway, I wanted to bring that up in the prep because gaining access to your food.

449
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:18,390
And by the way, another comment on society would be this thing about organic food.

450
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:23,290
That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen from a social perspective, meaning

451
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:29,450
social tolerance, because what is being said there, not in protest, but just an

452
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:38,490
observation, is why would a society at large allow their food stock or foodstuff to be

453
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:46,290
separated as foodstuff that is toxic and other foodstuff that is not, meaning organic?

454
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:52,890
What kind of a sick bunch of individuals would exist that would allow that to happen to

455
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:57,390
their foodstuff? We're talking about a sick society here that you would actually allow

456
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:01,850
your food to be divided as organic and non-organic.

457
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:06,610
That is a sick group of people, if you ask me, because all food should be organic.

458
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:12,130
It should not. See, if you're so you've allowed you've allowed people have allowed all

459
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:17,030
seven billion of you, yes, have allowed your foodstuff to be divided into toxic and

460
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,630
non-toxic. And it's OK.

461
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:23,530
You know what? Pretty much everything else you've allowed is very toxic to you.

462
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,550
But anyway, that's another subject again.

463
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:29,850
So why turn every show into a rant, you know?

464
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:38,530
So the genetic modification aspect is to be considered simply that it is low quality.

465
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:43,650
And just like anything that is low quality can be damaging, like certain low quality

466
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:46,950
fuels can damage a certain engine and so on and so forth.

467
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,850
Right. So it's just view it as low quality.

468
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,510
Don't be in terror of it.

469
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:57,690
The more you study what genetically modified foods are, you will realize the real

470
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:02,690
reality of what it means to be on this planet with seven billion imbeciles.

471
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:07,310
Yes, I said it again. So, yes, to move on from that.

472
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:12,410
Yes. So it's just, yeah, mind boggling what's being allowed.

473
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,570
The food prep. Yeah. So gaining your food.

474
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,110
Let's not really go into part about growing food.

475
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:22,730
But, you know, when you acquire your food, try to always get the best quality.

476
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:26,730
Well, duh. You know, there's there's something else that's considered, you know, I want to

477
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:31,330
talk about, you know, so we're going to leave some notions that will actually people

478
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:34,830
skilled. We'll talk about certain things, you know, how to prepare certain grains and

479
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,310
veg and meats and things like that.

480
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,450
Let's say if you tend to want to eat meat, let's say.

481
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,510
But always get the best quality that you can.

482
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:45,930
And there's another thing about the bioterrorism that's put on you by the

483
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:50,970
establishment is this thing that certain meats have deadly bacteria.

484
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:56,430
Right. Like you have to cook it to death to get rid of these these buggers, you know,

485
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,750
that are on there. Actually, the buggers are the ones telling you that.

486
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:05,450
But whenever you hear of meats being tainted with various salmonella and pathogens

487
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,750
and things like that, that's because it is of low quality.

488
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:14,990
Commercial farms tend to jam animals together and they're standing in food and feces

489
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:20,610
just like you. If you stood in your own fecal matter while you were eating your dinner

490
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,950
every day, you will be one sick puppy.

491
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:30,270
Yes, you will. So whenever you hear about warnings of salmonella and this and that on

492
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:35,350
your meat, for example, on the meat you might want to purchase and consume, that means it

493
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:38,490
is a very low quality and it is dirty, folks.

494
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:42,350
Yes, it has nothing to do with this naturally occurring.

495
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:48,010
It is a condition that is induced based on the way these things, you know, animal

496
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:51,790
husbandry. They're actually now terrorizing people, telling them that there's deadly

497
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:52,790
bacteria on veg.

498
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:58,230
Yes. If you're transporting veg and certain inert gases so they don't go bad and

499
00:33:58,950 --> 00:33:59,890
whatever, whatever.

500
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,990
Yes, things will get kind of dirty.

501
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,950
So learn how to clean stuff, wash things.

502
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,430
Water is your best friend in this.

503
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:13,530
But again, on the food prep, high quality and look for the highest quality and don't be

504
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:19,929
a victim of this terrorism, this bioterrorism, mental bioterrorism about GMOs and

505
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:22,429
things being full of bacteria and such.

506
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:28,370
Just learn that you must seek the highest quality if you are looking for something

507
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,489
good. That sounds pretty obvious.

508
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:37,010
Highest quality. What's some easy what's what's what's easy ways to spot high

509
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:40,650
quality? It's getting harder and harder and harder.

510
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:48,070
Like, for example, with the veg, it seems like it's almost impossible to know, you

511
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:52,290
know, whether it was grown properly or or engineered somehow.

512
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,890
The sniff test, the site test is best.

513
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,830
Right. You look at it if it looks good.

514
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,790
And then there's a sniffing test.

515
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:02,350
Right. And then there's the touching test.

516
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:07,410
You know, there's a feeling that people have about certain things.

517
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,950
Also, you might want to go by that.

518
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:13,290
But actually, meeting your average surface-dwelling earth inhabitant lately, I don't

519
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,430
know if they have any proper feelings anymore.

520
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:22,350
But yeah, it would be if you ever remember some older people growing up when parents

521
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:26,470
or others, older people used to go and purchase melons or something, they would actually

522
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,870
sniff the melon. Right.

523
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,490
And the one with the most. Right.

524
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:34,090
Or yeah. So if it smells like a melon, you know, if it doesn't smell like a melon and it

525
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:37,050
looks like a melon, chances are the flavor won't be there.

526
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:40,650
And, you know, you won't get what a melon should be giving you.

527
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:49,770
So either way, another way of looking at quality is, is it in a situation that would

528
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,630
promote decay versus not?

529
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,630
Right. Like things shrink wrapped in plastic.

530
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,170
That's an anaerobic environment, guys.

531
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:04,870
You know, anaerobic bacteria tend to be nasty and a lot of things are now wrapped in

532
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,550
plastic. I think it was Brave New World.

533
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:10,990
One of the comments in there was, oh, no, these people are eating food and it doesn't

534
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,350
come out of plastic, you know.

535
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:16,770
So if you can avoid things that are wrapped in plastic.

536
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:21,590
Oh, wow. You know, that just, you know, how that's pretty difficult, believe it or not.

537
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:25,890
These days, there's a lot of things that are added.

538
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,590
I'm not going to be adamant about this, but let's just say when you look at ingredient

539
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:33,470
lists on foods, that is what's added to the food.

540
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,990
Things can be added to the package that you that don't have to be listed on the

541
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:41,570
ingredients, by the way, like fungicides and bactericides, by the way, can be added to

542
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:46,050
the packaging. But because during the mechanical process, it's not added to the food,

543
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,290
it's added to the package.

544
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,910
It does. They don't have to tell you.

545
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:56,950
Interesting. So looking for things that are not shrink wrapped too much is really one

546
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:01,290
way to start. I've even seen veg like cucumber shrink wrapped these days.

547
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:08,690
So, oh, yeah, you can buy individual potatoes and things like that that are shrink

548
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,610
wrapped in plastic.

549
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:16,450
And it's not that it's plastic, it's that it is in an anaerobic environment.

550
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,410
There's no breathing. Everything breathes, you know.

551
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:24,790
And typically, you know, a lot of on the meat side, you'll notice that if you were to

552
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:28,810
purchase meat, you know, they add blood and things and water even tells you that may

553
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:31,570
contain up to 10 percent by weight in water.

554
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,730
It's all commercial again.

555
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:38,150
If you do, let's say, get something that's wrapped in plastic, which is probably going

556
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:44,230
to be the the chance, get it out of the plastic as soon as possible and rinse it and

557
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:48,030
wash it and then store it properly, you know, in a dark, cool place.

558
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,150
Cheese is what immediately comes to mind.

559
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:55,070
Something that I purchase a lot of that does come wrapped in plastic.

560
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,930
Yes. Get it out of the plant.

561
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:02,190
You know, there's in high end cheese places, there's a job, let's say a job or a job

562
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,510
within the place.

563
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,270
By the way, no difference in a job and a job.

564
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:10,810
A job probably has, you know, sick days and workman's compensation where a job doesn't

565
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,510
have sick days or workman's compensation.

566
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:16,550
But anyway, yeah, it's cheese places.

567
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,470
They have someone called a cheese wrapper every day.

568
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:23,650
They change the wrapping on the cheeses so the culture does not develop beyond what is

569
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,510
garnered as the flavor of the cheese.

570
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:30,070
Yes, because cheese is based on its culture, unlike many countries these days.

571
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:33,950
But so, yeah, so yeah.

572
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,710
So, yeah, that's interesting.

573
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:39,810
You get it out of the package and do it and also change the packaging and the wrapping.

574
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:44,490
You know, if you do have veg, there's something used to be called a root cellar.

575
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:47,790
You could store veg in a cool, dry place, meaning cool that it stays cool.

576
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,470
And dark as well.

577
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:54,470
You can also practice by having veg in what they call the fridge in water.

578
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:58,050
If you do buy bunches of parsley or other things like that and you want to keep them

579
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:03,630
growing, there's nothing wrong with putting them in water, just as you would a vase with

580
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,170
flowers. Right.

581
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:08,750
Any kind of cutting can be kept alive in water.

582
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:13,290
So the food prep part is, you know, again, use your discretion.

583
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:21,230
As long as it's clean and fresh, you will have high quality and, you know, all things

584
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,890
about GMO put aside, study the GMO stuff, folks.

585
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:28,490
Don't be subject to the terrorism from the alternative in the mainstream regarding GMO.

586
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:32,070
It's been going on for thousands of years.

587
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:36,810
It's just that the level of how it's going on now is malicious, just like everything

588
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:43,270
else. You know, whether it's religious, scientific, judicial, political, religious,

589
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:47,430
what have you, education, you are surrounded by pranksters.

590
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:52,330
Yes. One third of the people on this planet are straight up pranksters.

591
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:56,110
The other third are supporting them being a milli, and the other third are just waiting

592
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:59,850
to be pranked, you know, or joining the pranksters.

593
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:03,790
You know, in the next decade or so, I'd say 90 percent of the people are going to be

594
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:12,170
pranksters. So anyway, you know, this I'm a brief aside, but talking about media and

595
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:17,030
stuff like this, I've heard that explained on a on a horrible television program in the

596
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:22,670
last couple of years. But it stuck with me because it was this guy sold a whole bunch

597
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:27,710
of people. These I don't even remember what it was, but it's something that would have

598
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:35,110
been easily available from, let's say, the things that are advertised predominantly in

599
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:40,430
alternative media, alternative broadcasts and things like that.

600
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:44,750
And he he did this, but he did it on a much larger scale.

601
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:49,270
And when it became obvious that what he was selling was completely and totally useless,

602
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:52,470
they were like, I don't why why did you do that?

603
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:56,310
And he just explains to me like, well, there's there's two kinds of people.

604
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:58,410
There's doopers and there's doopees.

605
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:01,030
I'm a dooper and you are doopees.

606
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,710
And so, yeah, it's just a very there are.

607
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:08,630
Yeah. Or like, let's go down the path for a moment.

608
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,710
We've got to get back to the topic as time is going.

609
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,810
But there's two kinds of people, those who want to be left alone and those who won't

610
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:19,970
leave them alone. And then there's three kinds of people, those who can count and those

611
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:23,130
who can't. But anyway, absolutely.

612
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,310
So, yeah, so the food prep is interesting.

613
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,150
Now, let's just jump around a little bit.

614
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,950
You know, I don't have any agenda or notes on this.

615
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:35,830
I'm just going off that, you know, I'm I'm I'm taking a few notes so that we can

616
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:38,390
kind of maybe provide a summation at the end.

617
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:41,510
But, yeah, let's let's bring up on the food prep, too.

618
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:45,110
There's something called a knife, cuchillo in Spanish, right?

619
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:50,670
Machete in Greek. So these things tend to separate and make things into smaller pieces.

620
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:56,110
I have yet to go into anyone's home, what they call a home, let's say, and find a proper

621
00:41:56,110 --> 00:42:00,870
knife. Knives have to be knives, have to be very sharp, folks, because

622
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:07,730
the sharper they are, the the easier it is to cut and safer it is to cut.

623
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:11,630
And always try to learn how to keep a sharp knife.

624
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:15,930
And the idea of having a serrated knife because it doesn't need sharpening will ruin a

625
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,770
cutting board. You'll get all those grooves.

626
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,510
You'll get a fuzzy cutting board.

627
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:25,530
Right. So if you want to learn about knife skills or good knives, that that would be a

628
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:32,370
good suggestion. Yeah, knives should make the whole process more pleasant as well.

629
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:37,650
Yes. Yes. And there and by the way, there are almost no commercial knives available

630
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:39,190
that have a proper edge on them.

631
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:43,130
Even if you were to go out and spend a hundred bucks on a kitchen knife, a chef's knife

632
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:46,790
or a santoku, which is more of like the blunt end, it doesn't have the point on it.

633
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:50,410
It's a Japanese variety, which means like three cuts, I think, santoku.

634
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:55,390
None of them really. They seem sharp out of the box, but they don't really have a proper

635
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:58,730
edge. So you're going to have to on your own learn how to put an edge on a knife.

636
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:06,210
And this was actually a pastime in many ways in the past because the having sharp

637
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,210
knives was important.

638
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:09,610
And not anymore. Well, it sort of is.

639
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:14,690
But you're being marketed things that promote laziness and lack of skill.

640
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:21,830
So learn how to adopt a good knife and a good cutting board and keep everything clean

641
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:23,850
and never put a knife in a dishwasher.

642
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:28,770
That will dull it out. Even if you isolate it for some reason, it's one of these

643
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:32,390
phenomenal things that water can do when it's done a certain way.

644
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:38,370
So sharp knives and good cutting boards, you know, kind of went over the general food

645
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:43,210
prep, you know, there, but not enough perhaps for someone to change what they're

646
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:49,830
doing. But maybe consider that, you know, food prep is about being high

647
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:52,570
quality, keeping it clean, getting it out of plastic.

648
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:55,710
Don't stress the genetically modified stuff too much.

649
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:58,290
You're robust enough to handle it.

650
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,510
Yes, it is pretty toxic, by the way.

651
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:04,030
But again, I'm saying you are robust enough to handle it.

652
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:09,250
You're not going to put anything out in the market that is going to have you drop

653
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,230
dead like a fly immediately.

654
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:14,790
It'll probably kill you slowly, but so are many other things.

655
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:21,470
So don't be too stressed about genetically modified stuff, even though it is to be

656
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:25,590
avoided. So it might sound kind of duplistic to say that, but this is, you know,

657
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,410
welcome to planet Earth, folks.

658
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,270
You do know you're on planet Earth, right?

659
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:30,610
You know what's going on here.

660
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:38,710
So the concept of meats having strong bacterias and salmonellas and eggs and

661
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:43,750
chickens and E. coli and all that stuff is simply because it is garnered from an

662
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:44,770
unclean source.

663
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:48,570
So this is the reality that you live in, folks.

664
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,970
But yeah, and the concept also of raw versus cooked.

665
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:57,170
Yes, there's always more nutrition to be garnered from raw food because it is still

666
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:03,070
alive. But if you are not very active, you will find yourself perhaps more comfortable

667
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,950
eating foods that are slightly cooked.

668
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:09,510
So those are like some of the basic things to consider that are not being discussed at

669
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:10,550
least at least directly.

670
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:16,950
But we've got about 15 minutes or less for this first segment of the show.

671
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:19,730
We might want to get into perhaps prepping certain things.

672
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:25,410
And there are two things that I wanted to discuss the prep of and let's say more on

673
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:30,790
the vegetarian side, which would be perhaps grains and starches, maybe potatoes and rice

674
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:38,190
or things like that tend to be something very common, very, let's say, applicable when

675
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:39,250
you think of food.

676
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:42,830
Common and inexpensive and relatively easy to acquire.

677
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:50,110
Yes. And perhaps maybe a simple flatbread concept, but maybe we'll cover the grains

678
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:51,830
first. What do you think, Seth?

679
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:57,770
How to make rice, a perfect rice, pretty much, which is fascinating because to me, how

680
00:45:57,770 --> 00:45:59,710
little information is put out there.

681
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:04,270
But just before getting into it, I've seen something called converted rice, various

682
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:05,290
modified rices.

683
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:09,790
So the rice doesn't become a starchy lump and you have individual grains and things

684
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:15,670
like that. So that shows me that there's a lack of skill out there and on how to

685
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:20,330
prepare it. And yes, even in the Asian cultures, unless you're getting a good, high

686
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:25,390
quality sushi preparation, I found that even most of the Asian cultures, which pride

687
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:32,670
themselves as rice being a staple of their diet, it is this white, tasteless, lumpy,

688
00:46:32,830 --> 00:46:35,050
sticky starch, typically, not always.

689
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:41,230
So, yeah, this would also we're going to give some suggestions that will even trump most

690
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:45,110
of the situations that you find in eating out as well.

691
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:50,090
How to make perfect rice, generally, if you're going to make rice at all.

692
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:52,610
Why not? So we'll get into it.

693
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:59,910
One of the simplest ways to approach it is if before you start to prepare the rice, when

694
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:04,370
I say rice, I mean, typically this would be a stripped grain or a white rice, like a

695
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:08,830
long or medium grain, a very short grain, which would be a sweet rice or a pearl rice

696
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:11,250
requires a slightly different preparation.

697
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:16,950
Something like a whole rice or a brown rice requires just a lot more cooking time.

698
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:22,750
So this this suggestion will be mostly for your average medium to long grain rice that

699
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:27,830
is cooked by most people and essentially will describe how to simply cook it and then

700
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:30,530
variations thereof. So here we go.

701
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:36,350
We said we, you know, let's we threatened perhaps giving some information about help

702
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,590
people and give them some more skill.

703
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:44,250
So here we go, guys and gals, before you start cooking your rice, depending on how much

704
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:47,050
you're going to make, you're going to decide what volume of rice you're going to make.

705
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:50,450
So you're going to measure out a given measurement of dry rice.

706
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:58,730
And when you measure out the rice dry, whatever form you measure, the cup or liters or

707
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:04,990
whatever, note where that measurement is and put it aside and remember how much dry

708
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:06,030
rice you measured out.

709
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:10,290
Now, what you're going to do, the first step would be to wash the rice.

710
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:16,690
What you do is simply either put it in the pot or mostly recommend it is in a strainer

711
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:22,090
or a colander that is fine enough or is fine enough screen or a hole that the rice won't

712
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:26,890
fall through. Most people tend to have a like a window screen type mesh strainer.

713
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:32,510
You know, when I say window screen, meaning that fine or you can just put it in the pot of

714
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:39,510
the rice. And what you do is you add water and if it's in a pot and dump the water out

715
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:43,530
without dumping the rice out and do it two or three times.

716
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:47,550
If you have it in the strainer, you could put the strainer in the pot, fill the pot with

717
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:50,970
water and dunk it once or twice and then give it a slight rinse.

718
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:56,130
Now, once you do this basic rinsing of the rice where you remove the water once, twice,

719
00:48:56,130 --> 00:49:02,730
three times, let's say at least twice, you want the rice to sit dry.

720
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:05,670
In other words, remove as much of the water as possible.

721
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:07,210
That's why the strainer works best.

722
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:14,070
Have it strained and let it sit after it has been rinsed in a drying or draining condition

723
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:15,250
for at least 10 minutes.

724
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:21,590
Right. Yes, I know how people everyone's got their own way of making rice, but this is

725
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:27,510
the suggestion. So once you rinse the rice, drain it and let it sit for at least 10

726
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:29,510
minutes. OK, minimum.

727
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:34,690
Then what you will do is you now you approach the cooking part.

728
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:41,470
Typically, you would place the rice back in the pot if it's already in the pot because

729
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:46,430
you didn't have a strainer and you have it tilted or an angled or drained as much as

730
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:50,870
possible. Place the pot over some heat and turn the heat on medium.

731
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:57,970
And start applying, I suggest when you're doing a Western dish to add some kind of fat,

732
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:01,730
you know, oil, butter, something like that, olive oil, a little bit, a little bit of

733
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:07,790
sesame oil, perhaps, or butter to the rice itself and maybe some salt to taste.

734
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:13,670
Less than a pinch, a little bit or more, depending on the salt that you have.

735
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:18,910
And stir the rice around over the medium heat for about 30 seconds to a minute until you

736
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:23,610
hear a little bit of a sizzling sound or just, you know, that the water is going up in

737
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:28,550
temperature. And then what you would do is you would add the volume of rice that you

738
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:35,470
measured out dry, equal volume in water to that rice, right, and turn the pot up a

739
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:42,450
little bit until you see the edge of the pot rolling slightly now, meaning a rolling

740
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:48,750
simmer on the outer edge, not the entire pot of rice, and then apply a cover to it.

741
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:52,930
Now, I didn't mention that before you started this, you must have a pot that has a

742
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:55,830
airtight cover or a very firm cover, not a loose cover.

743
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:00,830
If you don't have one, you can always use another pot over it that would, that the

744
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:06,470
bottom of the pot would breach the top of the lower pot to form a good seal, right.

745
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:10,970
And if you don't have even that, you could wrap a towel, a dish towel or a wet dish

746
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:14,970
towel over something to cover it and weigh it down and make sure that the towel is out

747
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:15,930
of the way of the fire.

748
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:20,750
And at that point, you would lower the rice to the lowest possible setting.

749
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:26,110
If you notice any overboiling at that point, even when it's covered at the lowest

750
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:31,890
setting, turn off the heat until the overboiling stops, meaning like steam or liquid

751
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:35,910
coming off the side between the pot and the lid, wait about a minute or two and then turn

752
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:36,830
it back on low.

753
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:39,550
And in this case, you might have to stand around while it's cooking.

754
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:43,170
And I've also been asked, why do I stand around and monitor food while I'm cooking?

755
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:44,670
And I said, because you're supposed to.

756
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:51,090
So at this point here, you're going to have the rice cook for at least 10 to 13

757
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:55,830
minutes. And you're going to have to manage your heat, have it on the lowest heat.

758
00:51:55,890 --> 00:52:00,190
Now, the lowest heat in some of these electric ranges is so low that it's a warm

759
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,890
setting and it will not cook.

760
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:06,770
So you're going to require a slight simmer for at least half of that 10 to 13 minutes

761
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:08,130
and you will see some steam.

762
00:52:08,730 --> 00:52:11,590
Now, this is just for your basic rice now.

763
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:16,390
So again, just to recap, you need a pot with a lid that is sealed pretty well, not a

764
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,650
pressure cooker per se, but a good lid.

765
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:23,870
You rinse the rice, let it stand for about 10 minutes and then you apply some heat to

766
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:26,310
the rice in a dry pot with some fat of some sort.

767
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:29,850
And I say fat, meaning an oil of some sort that you prefer.

768
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:36,070
Olive oil has a very low boiling point and goes rancid at low heat.

769
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:41,430
But because this is going to be a very short cook alone with the rice and it's not

770
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:44,610
just olive oil being cooked, that's a good suggestion.

771
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:49,990
Or sesame oil is a higher form of heat and maybe some butter, however you want to

772
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:55,910
taste. And you will be then adding the equal amount of rice, dry rice volume to the

773
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:56,870
pot in water.

774
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:00,750
Now, you could substitute the water with a broth or a stock if you want more of a

775
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,470
flavored rice, depending on the dish.

776
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:07,470
And then you would actually bring it to a rolling simmer where you see a rolling

777
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:09,310
simmer on the outer edge of the pot.

778
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:12,930
Put your lid on or you can initially have the lid on if you know what's going on in

779
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:17,990
there. Somehow with a medium flame, if you see some steam, you can start off with the

780
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:22,410
lid from the beginning and you cook that rice for 10 to 13 minutes.

781
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:26,450
And after that 10 or 13 minutes, you turn it off and you let it stand for 10 minutes

782
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:33,090
or so. Then you would remove the lid and bring a fork to the inside of the pot from

783
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:37,750
the outer edge of the inside of the pot all the way down to the bottom and gently move

784
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,010
towards the center, lifting some of the rice.

785
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:44,850
Just to give you an idea, if it's crispy on the bottom, you have too much heat or it's

786
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:46,370
really soggy, it needs more cooking.

787
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:50,730
The rest period also allows more cooking to take place and then cover it and let it sit

788
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:51,990
for another five or 10 minutes.

789
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:55,610
So this is a very simple way to make perfect rice.

790
00:53:55,730 --> 00:54:00,550
And I'm going to go over it one more time when we return on Uncommon Sense.

791
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:04,690
And we're going to talk about food prep and cooking today with Seth Michael and the

792
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:05,570
Greek on AFR.

793
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:09,490
Greetings and welcome back to Uncommon Sense with the Greek and Seth Michael on

794
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:10,530
American Freedom Radio.

795
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:15,410
And by the way, American Freedom Radio is brought to you by American Freedom Radio and

796
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:19,590
wholly subsidized by them, but actually relying on people's donations.

797
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,150
So they don't do American Freedom Radio for themselves.

798
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:24,890
They do it for you guys. So you know what to do.

799
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:28,430
Go to the homepage. You will find a way to apply some gratitude.

800
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:31,790
And enough said about that, folks.

801
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:33,350
So let's let's get to it.

802
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:34,290
Send them something.

803
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:39,610
And back here with the Greek and Seth, we were just speaking before the break about how

804
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,530
to make perfect rice.

805
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:45,190
And just to sum it up, because sometimes I can get a little wordy because I'm trying to

806
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:46,170
think of the process.

807
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:49,790
And if you've done something for a long time, there are a lot of fine points that

808
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:50,730
almost can't be conveyed.

809
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:53,090
And you might end up jumbling the process.

810
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:58,770
But the process is simple as such to make perfect rice, essentially rinse and strain

811
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:03,930
the rice. When you first apply water to the rice, let it rinse out and dry out

812
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:07,510
somehow, you know, whether it's in a strainer or whatever.

813
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:13,570
After it's rinsed, let it stand not in the water for at least 10 minutes.

814
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:20,190
And then the dry volume of rice should be accompanied by equal volume of liquid and

815
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:24,170
cooked for about 10 to 13 minutes in a good seal at low temperature.

816
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:29,250
And then let it stand for a few minutes and then just fluff it slightly with a fork.

817
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:33,470
And when you fluff the rice, make sure that whatever utensil you're using goes to the

818
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:35,670
bottom of the pot, gently lifting it.

819
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:38,690
Now, if you get to the bottom of the pot and it's hard and crusty, don't lift that and mix

820
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:39,890
that into the rest of the rice.

821
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:42,490
At least, you know, the condition of it at the bottom.

822
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:47,510
There is actually in certain Latin cultures, when they do get that sticky stuff on the

823
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:52,410
bottom, they remove the fluffy part of the rice on top and add some cooking oil and fry

824
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:53,830
that and becomes like a dessert.

825
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:58,390
But nonetheless, the purpose of bringing up rice is how to make perfect rice.

826
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:03,130
And what inspired that was years ago when I was traveling out in the countryside, somewhat

827
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:08,750
away from everywhere with some others, I decided to cook some rice and beans out of the

828
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:13,150
back of a minivan where everyone else wanted to find the nearest gas station to get frozen

829
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:14,010
pizza and burritos.

830
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:18,910
And when I mentioned I was making rice, they were amazed and they said, you know how to

831
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:21,050
make rice? I was like, yes.

832
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:27,490
And I found out how people are just not privy to how to make perfect rice.

833
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:34,670
And when I say perfect rice, you will have a starchy grain that has a wonderful flavor.

834
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:38,350
It is not lumpy like a massive starch.

835
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:43,150
You will have individual grains of rice and it will actually develop a beautiful sheen, like a

836
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,410
satin sheen to it of some sort.

837
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:51,210
And it will taste wonderful and you will get the pleasure of enjoying almost a nearly

838
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:55,090
perfect plate of rice every time.

839
00:56:55,290 --> 00:57:00,190
If you rinse the rice, dry it, let it stand for 10 minutes, cook it for 10 to 13 minutes

840
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:03,730
under a good seal, fluff it slightly, let it stand again.

841
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:07,730
And the fluffing also allows you to recognize whether it's underdone.

842
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:12,190
You can add just a little bit of water with the heat on and cover it again.

843
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:15,510
So that is the basic rudimentary aspect of cooking rice.

844
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:17,570
And this would be your medium to long grain rice.

845
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:24,150
If you're going to do a brown rice that way, I suggest a pressure cooker, actually has

846
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:29,410
been suggested, or you can let the rice soak in water for at least one hour before you

847
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:32,590
cook it. And you would have to double your cooking time and increase your water

848
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:33,070
slightly.

849
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:36,670
Is that after straining it, do you still strain brown rice?

850
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:42,070
Well, what you would do is soak it for at least an hour, I would suggest, and then

851
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:43,330
strain it and let it stand.

852
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:49,190
And then you would at least double or triple the cooking time depending on your

853
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:53,490
altitude. And yeah, and a very tight lid.

854
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,990
Now, there's some high end preparations of rice.

855
00:57:56,150 --> 00:58:00,810
There are some rice companies, let's say in Japan, that will not sell rice to you

856
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,030
unless you know how to cook it.

857
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:03,430
This would be on the restaurant level.

858
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:08,570
I think there's a fellow named Gido who has the most prestigious sushi shop in the

859
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:12,450
world. He received Michelin three stars.

860
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:18,170
He has a very specific reason for making the rice the way he does, because it's a

861
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:19,130
very special rice.

862
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:22,410
It's interesting. I had seen a documentary on him and someone said, well, you

863
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:24,530
actually do very similar things that he does.

864
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:28,710
And I said, yes, it's very important to understand the grain of the rice also.

865
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:33,670
That's why I brought up, prefaced, that this procedure of making perfect rice every

866
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:37,330
time by pre-rinsing it, letting it stand and then cooking it for 10 or 13 minutes

867
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:43,170
and fluffing it, letting it stand, works best for your medium to long grain or

868
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:44,550
medium short grain rice.

869
00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:48,030
It's not your specific sushi rices or brown rices or things like that.

870
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:54,070
Most people will commonly get in the Western world a medium long grain rice, and

871
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:55,770
this would be the best way to cook it.

872
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:58,610
There is no mystery behind it, just some skill.

873
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:03,630
So essentially, again, rinse the rice, let it stand for 10 minutes, not in the

874
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:09,050
water, drained out somehow and then resume cooking at a low temperature.

875
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:11,350
But you must bring it to somewhat of a simmer initially.

876
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:16,270
So, yeah, kind of like, you know, I'm thinking about four different ways of

877
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:17,850
cooking four different grains here.

878
00:59:17,950 --> 00:59:19,130
And I need to be specific.

879
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:23,750
This works best for your, you know, what's called a jasmine rice or a typical

880
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:25,910
medium long grain rice, even a basmati.

881
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:32,030
Again, rinse it, let it stand out of the water for 10 minutes, strained, apply

882
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:40,130
some fat oil or salt, add some heat while it's dry in the pan, add your

883
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:42,030
corresponding equal volume of liquid.

884
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:48,890
If you're new at this, bring it to a simmer on the outer edge only, not in

885
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:51,490
the center, and then cover it for 10 minutes to 13 minutes.

886
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:55,090
If you get an overboil, even on low, just turn it off.

887
00:59:55,090 --> 00:59:58,610
If you have an electric range, don't put it on warm, that will not cook it.

888
00:59:58,670 --> 00:59:59,690
It will have to be on low.

889
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:03,430
So, that's generally the perfect rice.

890
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:06,330
The thing to remember is to rinse it and strain it for at least 10 minutes and

891
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:10,790
then just basically following the rest of the instructions will also yield a good

892
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:14,390
rice, typically instructions given on packaging.

893
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:16,950
The only thing is you might want to cut back on liquid.

894
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:21,070
I think on most packages of rice, they do suggest using a little bit more

895
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:22,590
water than the volume of rice.

896
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:27,730
So, because it has been soaked previously or rinsed previously, you can just go to

897
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:30,170
equal parts liquid to rice.

898
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:34,130
And this is how you make a perfect rice just about every time or approaching

899
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:39,110
perfection instead of being shocked by the concept of cooking it or buying

900
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,470
something prefabricated.

901
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:45,170
So, the other starch I want to discuss is something called potato.

902
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:46,870
People like cooking potatoes.

903
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:49,870
I think, Seth, you mentioned they're inexpensive, they're easily available.

904
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,370
They are a nightshade, I believe.

905
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:57,870
So, in some health circles, they're not recommended, but albeit, there are things

906
01:00:57,870 --> 01:01:00,010
like baked potatoes and mashed potatoes to be enjoyed.

907
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:02,170
Now, here's an easy way to make mash, folks.

908
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:06,490
I've seen people try to cook mashed potatoes and they boil the crap out of

909
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:08,090
potatoes and they leave them in the water.

910
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:09,750
Guess where all the flavor is?

911
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,150
In the water or they cooked it away.

912
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:16,850
Now, when you do your potatoes, in order to conserve on heat, peel the potatoes.

913
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:21,670
And the smaller you cut the potato, the less cooking time.

914
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:27,090
Right. The easier it is for the heat to get to the center mass of the actual

915
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:31,130
piece. I have seen people put whole potatoes in a pot and boil them for an hour

916
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:33,310
and a half and wonder why they're so hard on the inside.

917
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:38,390
So, what I recommend typically doing when you're making a mashed potato type dish

918
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:44,870
or potato salad even, you know, you cut, let's say, a starchy potato or russet

919
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:46,330
type, which are the oblong ones.

920
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:51,950
Don't use a waxy potato, you know, the smaller round potatoes that are purple or

921
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:55,410
whatever. The red potatoes or yellow potatoes, those are very waxy.

922
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:57,390
Those are for different applications.

923
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:02,710
I'm talking about a starchy russet type or Maine or Idaho, let's say here in the

924
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:07,490
States. What you do is you peel it, cut it in half a long way, cut it in half a

925
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:11,150
long way again. So you have four long pieces and then cut those in four pieces.

926
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:14,710
So you can get roughly 16 pieces out of a whole potato.

927
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:16,290
Put that in some water and salt.

928
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:18,150
Just bring the water to cover the potato.

929
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:20,590
Don't you don't have to create an aquarium.

930
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:27,530
And you only need about 15 minutes to 20 minutes of simmering at that point.

931
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:32,370
Strain out the potatoes and make sure that they are barely fork tender, meaning

932
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:36,130
that if you put the fork through the potato and the potato falls apart, it's

933
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:40,950
overcooked. What I mean, fork tender is you can put a fork into the potato and it

934
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:45,670
still has the tiniest bit of firmness possible, a little bit of crunch in the

935
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:47,150
center. That is OK.

936
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:48,510
Do not overcook them.

937
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:54,890
And when you strain the potatoes, return them back to the pot, just strain, not

938
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:59,490
rinsed, with a low heat for about five to 10 minutes.

939
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:02,570
And you're going to have to mind this because some low heats are not that low.

940
01:03:03,090 --> 01:03:07,410
Now, in this case, if you had a warm feature on electric range, I recommend

941
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:09,510
using that for about 10 to 20 minutes.

942
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:11,290
And don't stir the potatoes.

943
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:14,210
What you are doing there is a stovetop baking now.

944
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:18,970
And then when you proceed with your mashed potato, whatever seasoning or fat

945
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:21,990
you want to add, people add milk and butter and things like that and start

946
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:23,150
mashing it in the pot.

947
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:27,130
You will notice that when you open the lid after the potatoes have been strained

948
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:31,990
and sitting on the stovetop low, you will get this wonderful potato essence,

949
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:34,250
almost like the smell of a baked potato.

950
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:41,430
And you have this wonderful potato flavor coming out of the potato that or

951
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:46,750
emerging that you tend to call very potatoey, let's say, or enjoyable versus

952
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:50,230
this bland starch that needs a lot of salt and butter and fat.

953
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:52,550
So you don't want to overcook the potato.

954
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:57,590
Cutting the potato into smaller pieces, not too small, but if you have very little

955
01:03:57,590 --> 01:04:02,690
energy or heat or time, the smaller, again, the faster it will cook.

956
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:06,190
Do not overcook it to the point where the potato falls apart.

957
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:07,430
It should be fork tender.

958
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:08,830
The fork should just penetrate.

959
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:13,210
Put it back in the pot for a low heat until you get that wonderful baked potato

960
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:16,670
smell and then add whatever else you're going to add to mash the potatoes.

961
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:19,770
And you will have some very delicious mashed potatoes.

962
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:25,870
It will taste like a baked mashed potato versus the standard just puree starch.

963
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:32,570
Now, there's a lot of, let's say, mashed potatoes being served up in what's

964
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:33,210
called America.

965
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:37,150
And the reason I brought this up is, like Seth mentioned, potatoes are easy to go

966
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:39,210
get and they're inexpensive.

967
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:43,610
And this is just one way to make a delicious mashed potato.

968
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:45,590
Do not overcook.

969
01:04:45,910 --> 01:04:48,030
Now, there's another concept of a baked potato.

970
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:52,150
I've seen people fire up an entire oven for one or two potatoes.

971
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:56,650
That is a lot of volume to heat up a space for doing a baked potato.

972
01:04:56,850 --> 01:05:00,430
Now, I know there's microwaving, but I will not even touch the subject of

973
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:04,690
microwaves. If you use a microwave, maybe you should open the door and put your

974
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:05,610
head in it. But anyway,

975
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:08,610
that's another bad thing to say.

976
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:14,210
But so what? If you're going to do a baked potato, one way to do it is what I

977
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:15,190
call a stove top.

978
01:05:15,310 --> 01:05:16,910
Go ahead and don't peel the potato.

979
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:17,970
Just clean it a little bit.

980
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:19,130
Even if you don't, it's fine.

981
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:23,450
Put it in a pot that is just about the size that fits the number of potatoes you

982
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:28,630
want to bake and just bring water up to the top level of the potato and plenty of

983
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:30,570
salt, more salt than you'd normally use.

984
01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:35,370
Bring it to a simmer and then a rolling boil for about five or ten minutes and

985
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:40,030
then turn the potatoes over very carefully with a set of tongs and then let it

986
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:43,530
boil for another five or ten minutes and then remove the potatoes very carefully.

987
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:44,830
You don't want to break the skin.

988
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:48,310
Place them back into the pot on a very low temperature.

989
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:53,050
Now, remember, there's no liquid in the pot, so you can burn a very thin bottom

990
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:57,390
pot. When I say a pot, it would be something with a heavy bottom and hopefully not

991
01:05:57,390 --> 01:06:01,730
aluminum. If you use aluminum or Teflon or a thin bottom pot, you will probably

992
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:06,390
fail in all of these suggestions, just like you would fail if you didn't have a

993
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:08,930
sharp knife getting into and you wanted to get into cooking.

994
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,210
So this does require some prep and some equipment.

995
01:06:11,870 --> 01:06:17,570
But the concept of baking on the stove top can be done, just like making a pizza on

996
01:06:17,570 --> 01:06:18,810
a barbecue can be done.

997
01:06:20,850 --> 01:06:27,650
You don't always have to bake in the oven or even grill on the top.

998
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:30,770
You can, as long as you have a heat source, if you know how to manage the heat

999
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:34,010
source, you can achieve the effect, the desired effect ultimately.

1000
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:39,930
But the concept here with the potato is they tend to taste better when they are in a

1001
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:41,990
dry situation when heat is applied.

1002
01:06:42,450 --> 01:06:44,410
That's why baked potatoes taste so wonderful.

1003
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:51,270
But you can do a stove top bake by first boiling the potatoes and then just putting

1004
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:55,350
them into the pot on a low temperature for another five or ten minutes and turning

1005
01:06:55,350 --> 01:06:57,810
them, because you'll notice the skin will brown where it touches the pot.

1006
01:06:57,810 --> 01:07:04,170
So now you can actually achieve a baked potato flavor on a stove top.

1007
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:05,530
That is another way to do that.

1008
01:07:06,210 --> 01:07:07,990
And also French fries are a concept.

1009
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:12,790
Yes, fried food is not bad for you if the oil temperature is high enough.

1010
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:18,870
What makes fried food, let's say, unpleasant or unhealthful is when the

1011
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:20,750
temperature is not high enough.

1012
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:24,670
So when you're frying something that has moisture content, if the temperature of

1013
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:28,690
the oil where it's being fried is high enough, there's always an outward movement,

1014
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:32,050
an ejection of steam that keeps the oil from penetrating the food.

1015
01:07:32,570 --> 01:07:37,550
If the oil temperature is too low, the reverse happens and you end up with a

1016
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:39,030
greasy piece of food.

1017
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:43,890
So, by the way, the best French fries are when they're cooked three times.

1018
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:50,330
You would actually cook the French fry first by blanching it in hot water, dipping

1019
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:54,410
the French fries in boiling water, letting them stand till they cool down.

1020
01:07:54,550 --> 01:08:00,830
And then you would either deep fry them or pan fry them until they, let's say, get

1021
01:08:00,830 --> 01:08:05,270
really hot before they turn brown of any or change color, then remove them, let them

1022
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:09,450
cool down. And then the third time cooking, which would be the second fry, is when

1023
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:13,410
you would fry them till they get the color that you desire.

1024
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:16,790
And that's a proper palm frit, by the way.

1025
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:20,689
That's why typically store bought French fries that are frozen that you reheat always

1026
01:08:20,689 --> 01:08:25,490
taste better or mostly taste better than single cooked homemade fries because they

1027
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:26,830
tend to be twice cooked.

1028
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:31,890
So that is your two basic starches of, let's say, potatoes and grains.

1029
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:35,310
Now, the other thing I want to address, since we're on the potato grain, let's talk

1030
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:40,590
about veg and that leads into maybe doing pot cooking where you do stews and things

1031
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:45,350
like that. I've been experimenting lately with adding flavor or bringing out the flavor

1032
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:50,970
of veg. And one thing to consider is if you're going to do a stew or a vegetable dish

1033
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:56,649
of any sort, I've lately been getting into roasting root vegetables and then rinsing

1034
01:08:56,649 --> 01:08:58,770
them off before I prep them or cook them.

1035
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:05,250
So if I was to incorporate, let's say, carrot or parsnip or turnip or any kind of a

1036
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:12,890
root veg into a dish, I found that actually roasting them in the fire, getting a

1037
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:17,170
carbonized layer on the outside of a carrot, let's say, just to give an example, and

1038
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:22,689
then rinsing that carbonized layer off, just like if you've heard of roasted red

1039
01:09:22,689 --> 01:09:28,050
peppers somehow available, rinsing that layer off actually changes the flavor and

1040
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:29,930
changes the consistency of the carrot.

1041
01:09:30,069 --> 01:09:33,630
And it actually brings more of a carrot flavor and a sweetness to it that you will not

1042
01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:35,550
get with other forms of cooking.

1043
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:43,050
There are certain Asian dishes, especially if anyone's ever had Vietnamese pho or

1044
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:46,710
pronounced pho, but it's spelled P-H-O as in pho.

1045
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:52,870
One of the secret ingredients there, or not so much of a secret, is to actually take

1046
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:56,990
ginger root and roast it in fire until it carbonizes on the outside, slightly rinse it

1047
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:58,810
and smash it and include that into the broth.

1048
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:01,730
It actually changes the flavor of the ginger.

1049
01:10:01,730 --> 01:10:06,650
And again, just like I brought up roasted red peppers that are carbonized to some

1050
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:10,270
degree and then rinsed off typically in some European or, let's say, Italian cookery,

1051
01:10:10,850 --> 01:10:12,610
that also changes the food.

1052
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:17,250
There's something about roasting that also changes and imparts a different flavor.

1053
01:10:17,690 --> 01:10:19,410
So that was the concept of the veg.

1054
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:23,830
Now, again, to go to the concept of the veg, since we brought up starches, potatoes and

1055
01:10:23,830 --> 01:10:32,130
maybe just included here just the roasting of veg, most veg, in order to be palatable,

1056
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:34,490
should be cooked.

1057
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:38,350
Now, I'm talking about root veg, tubers, things like that.

1058
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:46,890
Most veg that people consider veg are leafy greens, typically do not need to be cooked,

1059
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:48,710
even though they are done so.

1060
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:52,690
Like if you get spinach as a side dish in a restaurant, it's typically cooked.

1061
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:58,510
Now, or it can be in a salad as well, which has become more popular, certain greens.

1062
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:03,330
But in order to be palatable, like let's say you are growing a garden and you have collard

1063
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:08,650
greens or beet greens or things that are very robust green vegetables, like cabbage, for

1064
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:10,950
example, you can turn them into a slaw.

1065
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:17,150
You know, like cabbage, for example, is a very robust leafy green, very difficult to eat

1066
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:18,130
on its own raw.

1067
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:24,930
So but if it's cut very fine in a Julian fashion, you know, very narrow cut, it's what

1068
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:26,470
you call slaw, let's say.

1069
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:32,550
Right. So other vegetables other than cabbage can be turned into slaws like collard greens,

1070
01:11:32,690 --> 01:11:34,670
beet greens and other things like that.

1071
01:11:34,710 --> 01:11:40,250
So if you do either grow or purchase root vegetables that do have a leafy green

1072
01:11:40,250 --> 01:11:44,870
counterpart, that can be eaten also in the form of a slaw raw.

1073
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:48,390
And remember, when it's raw, you don't need as much of it.

1074
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:52,670
So it's essentially here with veg or actually anything.

1075
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:54,770
Don't cook it to death.

1076
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:59,130
Don't overcook it, meaning can't cook things, but don't overcook things.

1077
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:04,710
That tends to be a problem unless you have someone that is very sedentary or horizontal

1078
01:12:04,710 --> 01:12:09,710
and typically then overcooked things tend to help out because they are not moving.

1079
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:13,170
So basically, that was just the interjection.

1080
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:17,990
I think the the crown achievement of perhaps discussing food today might be just how to

1081
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:21,030
make perfect rice. I think we've pretty much explained that already.

1082
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:27,390
So that can I make would you mind if I make a request?

1083
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:30,910
Oh, please go ahead. Bread, flatbread.

1084
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:36,450
That's a good one. Yeah, that's and that's another thing that is we've spoken about

1085
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:40,590
before. It's something that I I enjoy a lot.

1086
01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:47,650
And it's also easy to acquire, readily available and fresh.

1087
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:52,490
Yeah, there's nothing like having immediate bread, meaning fresh bread.

1088
01:12:53,210 --> 01:12:56,730
And, you know, of course, that's why bread is always discounted or bread products should be

1089
01:12:56,730 --> 01:13:01,070
discounted if they're a day old, but not if they come in plastic bags like they do today.

1090
01:13:01,390 --> 01:13:04,430
But, yeah, you know, you know that concept, Seth, about day old bread.

1091
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:07,490
You know, what happens when you go to the store and they have this something they call

1092
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:10,850
bread in a loaf and it sits there, I mean, for a week, the price doesn't change.

1093
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:15,610
You ever notice that? Yeah, it takes it takes quite a while for the they do.

1094
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:18,290
They do drop it occasionally.

1095
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:22,290
But I've stopped. They don't do it after I bought bread like that.

1096
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:26,430
So but American American bread or white bread sliced in the loaf.

1097
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:30,570
I mean, if it's put on the shelf today, it's not reduced tomorrow.

1098
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:35,490
But typically the price of baked goods was always reduced the next day.

1099
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:38,430
So what does that tell you? Folks should be fresh.

1100
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:43,610
Now, Seth made the request to bring up the flatbread concept because it's very simple.

1101
01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:45,490
You're not looking for leaven of any kind.

1102
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:49,730
I would just weigh out some flour, measure out some flour on a board of some sort.

1103
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:57,330
And you can add a an egg to it or two eggs, depending on the volume, and mix it on the board

1104
01:13:58,210 --> 01:14:02,310
and some fat. Again, when I say fat, it would be butter or shortening.

1105
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:05,070
I would not add an oil because that would make it very hard.

1106
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:10,410
More like a pretzel consistency, like a hard piece of cardboard sometimes.

1107
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:15,510
But add butter or shortening of some kind and mix it on the board.

1108
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:22,610
Add some salt, perhaps, or anything else you want to add, sesame seeds or whatever, and make a dough ball.

1109
01:14:23,070 --> 01:14:27,030
Also, you're going to be adding a measurement of water of cold water to it very slowly.

1110
01:14:27,690 --> 01:14:33,750
You can make a little ring of the flour, by the way, on the board and add your liquids and things to that.

1111
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:41,090
Chop up the butter and just add all those ingredients together and mix it around until you get a dough ball.

1112
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:44,390
Meaning you might have to add a little bit of water at a time.

1113
01:14:45,630 --> 01:14:50,650
And if it gets too soft and sticky, you should have some dry flour on the side where you add that again.

1114
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:56,410
You know, you might want to press it flat and fold it and roll it again and then let it sit for about five,

1115
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:59,510
ten minutes or a half hour in the fridge or on the counter somehow.

1116
01:15:00,450 --> 01:15:04,870
And then break off pieces and roll it flat and you can put it in a hot pan.

1117
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:10,710
And or in the oven just for a matter of 30 seconds per side, wouldn't you say, Seth?

1118
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:12,810
In less than a minute or two, it can be cooked, right?

1119
01:15:13,490 --> 01:15:20,450
Very simple. Yeah, if you're doing it in the oven, you do it at a very high temperature to do it that quickly.

1120
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:24,910
But yeah. Yeah, the easiest way to do the flatbread, by the way, if you're in a kitchen setting,

1121
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:33,330
is to make it a round, thin, flat piece of dough, throw it into a hot pan that's on the stovetop

1122
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:38,070
and then immediately take that pan and bring it down to the broiler section of the oven.

1123
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:40,970
So now it's hot on the bottom and hot on the top.

1124
01:15:41,090 --> 01:15:43,190
And 30 seconds to a minute, it'll be done.

1125
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:45,110
You don't have to flip it or you can flip it.

1126
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:47,870
But either way, this is a very simple thing.

1127
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:53,430
Just adding flour, some fat, you know, in the form of butter or shortening of some kind.

1128
01:15:55,330 --> 01:16:02,810
And maybe an egg and some water until you get the consistency of a dough and have some flour and water on hand.

1129
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:09,290
So in case it gets too wet, you can temper it back up to being not too sticky and like a dough.

1130
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:11,910
Or if it's too dry, you can add some water.

1131
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:13,290
And they say add water very little.

1132
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:21,010
And the easiest way to do that is, of course, to make a ring that put the flour on the working area and just make a ring in the center.

1133
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:22,410
Would you have any other suggestions?

1134
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:23,910
You have some experience with this.

1135
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:31,710
Now, so how would you tell the listenership how you would do it, let's say, or how you have done it, maybe to add or take away from what you just said?

1136
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:34,370
That's that's I mean, that's pretty much it.

1137
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:42,130
I tend to add, you know, things to it, depending upon what I'm going to use it for, because I use the flatbread for just about anything.

1138
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:45,930
I'll make little pizzas with it.

1139
01:16:46,550 --> 01:16:48,330
I'll wrap anything in it.

1140
01:16:48,330 --> 01:16:57,870
It's basically, you know, depending upon you can smash it out then as a tortilla and that I mean, then you have tortillas and you can wrap anything in it.

1141
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:02,750
But I'll add like when I'm making bread, I'll add parsley.

1142
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:07,490
If I'm making pizzas, I'll add, you know, some different spices, herbs and spices.

1143
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:15,230
If I'm making something sweet, you know, I'll add a little bit of sugar just but it's very, very useful.

1144
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:17,910
It's and it's quick.

1145
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:21,570
It's easy and it's inexpensive if it's the budget.

1146
01:17:22,590 --> 01:17:25,530
Right. And it's super palatable being that it's freshly made.

1147
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:31,990
And it's not we're not talking about leavened bread here, folks, just a flatbread, which tends to be very popular in most cultures.

1148
01:17:32,050 --> 01:17:36,210
I was speaking to someone in Australia, by the way, and they said they enjoy burritos.

1149
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:37,270
And I'm like, what did you say?

1150
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:38,290
I said, I enjoy burritos.

1151
01:17:38,350 --> 01:17:40,910
And in Australia, you have Mexican food in Australia.

1152
01:17:41,710 --> 01:17:43,510
He says, yeah. And I was like, OK, great.

1153
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:49,370
Well, you know, interestingly enough, folks, every culture has some sort of sandwich or where some kind of food,

1154
01:17:49,470 --> 01:18:01,930
whether it be a meat, protein, vegetable or starch is wrapped in something, whether it's seaweed in the Japanese or a tortilla or a pita or an American or European sandwich.

1155
01:18:02,030 --> 01:18:08,010
Everyone else is the concept of wrapping something to be held by hand.

1156
01:18:08,070 --> 01:18:11,590
So what Seth mentioned, it's versatile in that respect.

1157
01:18:11,590 --> 01:18:24,830
Thank you for mentioning that, Seth, that it can be used many ways as a wrap or it could be just used as, you know, serving it on the side as well with any meal or making a pizza like.

1158
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:26,450
Yeah. So it's hummus.

1159
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:27,650
Yeah. Yeah.

1160
01:18:28,010 --> 01:18:28,490
And yeah, I think.

1161
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:29,650
Yeah. Yeah.

1162
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:37,850
And it's also I found out what's interesting is that sometimes the flatbread stored overnight or even a couple of days even tastes better the next day or two days.

1163
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:40,570
It just achieves a wonderful flavor.

1164
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:45,890
I think when it goes stale, it tends to get even more complex flavor to a certain degree and you can still warm it.

1165
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:47,650
You know, it makes a good leftover as well.

1166
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:57,010
And it doesn't give you it doesn't leave you with that overstarched feeling or of, let's say, full stomach kind of feeling that you get from a leavened bread.

1167
01:18:57,730 --> 01:18:58,750
Right. Notice that.

1168
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:01,250
Yeah. And it's very satisfying.

1169
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:10,810
So the concept of flatbread, it shouldn't be strange because there's a prevalence of flatbreads in Middle Eastern culture and in the Latin culture, let's say.

1170
01:19:11,470 --> 01:19:15,290
Well, it just takes less waiting to it's like I said, it's it's immediate.

1171
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:17,170
Yeah. It's very quick.

1172
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:18,690
You don't have to wait.

1173
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:22,870
Right. Yeah, I spent a lot of time working.

1174
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:28,690
So when I'm cooking, I'm I consider how long it's going to take to prepare whatever it is that does come in.

1175
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:32,590
Yeah. Coming to play for me a lot.

1176
01:19:32,910 --> 01:19:35,110
So. So perfect rice.

1177
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:41,850
Don't overcook your potatoes and also slightly undercook them and apply some heat in a dry form in the pot.

1178
01:19:41,970 --> 01:19:44,990
Don't burn the pot. And making flatbread.

1179
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:50,530
Now, there might be even some YouTube videos on making easy flatbread that I would suggest.

1180
01:19:50,770 --> 01:19:58,530
The other two, there may not be suggestions on YouTube, but I know that perhaps from looking and suggesting requests about flatbread,

1181
01:19:58,530 --> 01:20:01,450
years ago, I did find some things on what's called YouTube.

1182
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:07,510
But, yeah, getting into making simple flatbreads is just wonderful because it's fresh and it's wonderful.

1183
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:10,690
And again, you're making it yourself.

1184
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:12,410
It doesn't take much of an effort.

1185
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:15,430
And it is actually not much of a cleanup either for the effort.

1186
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:17,050
You know, it's very simple.

1187
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:19,970
So from that respect.

1188
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:25,510
Yeah. And I also wanted I threw in a little bit what might be considered exotic about roasting of vegetables for changing flavor.

1189
01:20:26,470 --> 01:20:32,050
So something to think about for those of you that already do apply cooking food.

1190
01:20:32,210 --> 01:20:35,630
Now, we talked about grain starches and veg and flatbread.

1191
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:42,810
And one of the emails was regarding health, you know, regarding the C word, A-N-C-E-R and food.

1192
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:51,190
Well, of course, just to go back to, you know, this is this is what kind of underpinned the thought of doing a discussing food is that,

1193
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:54,490
yes, there's a relation to food and being ill.

1194
01:20:54,970 --> 01:21:03,230
But I think considering eating seasonally and then, of course, what needs to be considered is there's something called your law.

1195
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,690
Your law comes from your God.

1196
01:21:04,910 --> 01:21:08,790
Yes. Not talking about traffic law or tax law or things like that.

1197
01:21:10,330 --> 01:21:17,430
There are laws for the food that man should eat, just like if you worked in a pet food store, you would give dog food to the dogs,

1198
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:20,710
cat food to the cats and bird food to the birds and fish food to the fish.

1199
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:34,070
But apparently mankind, well, actually living in the Christian era, somehow someone has the pranking idea to tell this group of people or the secular era that there is no law from any God anymore.

1200
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:37,030
And what is the most ridiculous bit of tripe I've ever heard?

1201
01:21:37,130 --> 01:21:39,350
But nonetheless, you get your law from your God.

1202
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:44,130
So if you don't have a God and you're getting it from the scientists or the state, that's fine, too.

1203
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:46,690
Then they're your God. And April 1st is your holiday.

1204
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:50,190
So this is another thing to consider.

1205
01:21:51,490 --> 01:22:00,750
And if you do consider, again, tying that back into what to eat or such regarding your health and the C word, there's more to it than just food.

1206
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:06,550
It's basically environmental and it's also energetic within the body.

1207
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:08,510
And that is a very touchy subject.

1208
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:21,930
So, but, you know, considering the amount of time you left, you have left as a society a decade and a half or so, it doesn't it could be a long time for some and not so long for others.

1209
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:26,590
You can prevail within a, you know, having a high quality existence if you pursue it.

1210
01:22:28,830 --> 01:22:38,490
So nonetheless, Seth, what else do you think in the well, actually, Seth, you know, what's interesting, I'll bring this up, you know, the concept of the biblical text that I'm going to read to you is this.

1211
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:43,990
That everyone loves to hate. No one has ever read, by the way, or seemingly no one has ever looked into it.

1212
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:50,110
But there's something in Leviticus 11 that if anyone were to go there and read that, I believe it's Leviticus 11.

1213
01:22:50,930 --> 01:23:00,330
And not only in the biblical text, but any of the holy rites of the world or most cultures indirectly, indirectly promote a vegetarian diet.

1214
01:23:00,530 --> 01:23:01,210
Did you know that?

1215
01:23:02,690 --> 01:23:05,130
I was aware that the biblical text does.

1216
01:23:05,570 --> 01:23:15,650
Yeah. Indirectly, though, and the way it does in the biblical text indirectly is by stating that if you touch the flesh of an animal, you're in an unclean state until noon, you know, where you wash.

1217
01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:25,250
Right. For example, and this is repeated in the Book of Haggai, where he goes to some priests and he says, is it not true that if a garment touches flesh, it's unclean?

1218
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:26,050
And they answered, yes.

1219
01:23:26,050 --> 01:23:33,970
Now, here's the interesting part. If you're eating a tuna fish sandwich, a turkey sandwich or a roast beef sandwich, are you touching dead flesh?

1220
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:35,850
Yeah, absolutely.

1221
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:46,410
So if you have enough of a rational mind, you will find this in many of the holy rites, ancient texts of the world that is unfit to touch a carcass of an animal.

1222
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:53,990
In other words, you are not in such a good state if you do until you clean yourself up, let's say, or wait a certain period of time and apply water.

1223
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:59,710
Right. So they do indirectly promote, you know, what's interesting, the Hindus about the cows and all that.

1224
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:06,070
What's interesting, I think it's in the Mahabharata and one of the chapters or might be in the Rig Vedas also.

1225
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:13,890
It states in the Hindu text that Brahma, I'm just paraphrasing here, Brahma created everything in seven days and goes on.

1226
01:24:13,970 --> 01:24:20,670
And then it also states that if you're ever visited by any of the angels of Brahma, you're to slaughter a calf and offer it to them.

1227
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:26,670
Isn't that interesting? This is in the Hindu culture. Right. In their own writings, by the way.

1228
01:24:27,610 --> 01:24:28,310
Isn't that interesting?

1229
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:39,650
So there is a concept of it being indirectly the concept of not even touching the carcass of an animal is being promoted.

1230
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:44,370
So if you're going to have lunch with animal in it, it's the same as touching it.

1231
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:53,350
So anyway, it's kind of indirect, you know, bringing up the there will be discussion on the lawfulness of what was written and delivered to mankind in the past.

1232
01:24:53,410 --> 01:25:00,330
And I think we've said we will probably end up discussing this sometime in the future because simply you folks are not ready for it yet.

1233
01:25:00,330 --> 01:25:04,710
Meaning you folks, meaning the general group of people on this planet, they balk at it.

1234
01:25:05,030 --> 01:25:06,330
You know, they don't want to hear it.

1235
01:25:06,330 --> 01:25:14,670
I've personally been attacked both on air and off air about discussing things that once were that are memorialized.

1236
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:18,310
So, yeah, it's not time yet, folks. So why push the issue?

1237
01:25:18,430 --> 01:25:26,250
But for anyone who is listening and is interested, yes, all of the ancient texts do promote indirectly a vegetarian form of eating.

1238
01:25:28,050 --> 01:25:41,530
So with that said, maybe should we move on to the concept of eating carrion or eating being carnivore or, you know, because carnivores, by the way, in nature, they devour and attack and eat an animal while it's still alive.

1239
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:49,830
In some cases they do store the carcass, but mankind in almost all cases does approach something that has been dead for a while.

1240
01:25:49,830 --> 01:25:57,210
I have a question. Maybe before we get into that, what about like eggs?

1241
01:25:58,410 --> 01:26:07,650
Yeah, good. Ovo, I call it ovo-lactic, ovo and dairy. I thought about it and kind of avoided it. Why?

1242
01:26:07,910 --> 01:26:15,190
Because eggs are the most heat sensitive substance or material or object one can engage into when they're cooking.

1243
01:26:15,630 --> 01:26:28,990
As a matter of fact, when I brought up Jiro in Japan, when you work at his restaurant, you must do at least a 10-year apprenticeship before you're allowed to cook any egg product.

1244
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:41,010
Yeah. So actually most people that do do the 10-year apprenticeship, it takes them about 100 tries before they get it the way that it's preferred in that restaurant and they break down crying when they do achieve it.

1245
01:26:41,010 --> 01:26:47,950
So think about that for a minute, folks. There is – yeah, eggs are interesting, very, very heat sensitive.

1246
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:54,270
So less heat, the better. Don't overcook the egg. It will get dry and rubbery. And if you put too much heat, you will release moisture.

1247
01:26:54,450 --> 01:27:00,830
But here's the point about egg before we might want to touch into, and that's a good part to start because it is an animal, quote-unquote, product.

1248
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:20,150
From an energetic and ethereal point of view, when you eat an egg minus the shell but the interior of the contents, it is pretty much similar energetically to eating an entire chicken, meaning not just eating chicken, an entire chicken where you sit down at a pub and have a roasted or fried chicken.

1249
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:26,750
I'm talking about eating an entire chicken, meaning the beak, the feathers, all the internal organs, the feet and the claws as well.

1250
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:37,470
Where does that fall in relation to, like we were talking about, lawfully touching dead flesh?

1251
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:42,750
Yeah, it is in a sense because here's – that brings up the interesting point of the right to life.

1252
01:27:42,870 --> 01:27:50,110
When is a human a human in the embryo and is it a conception or further on? That is an interesting point.

1253
01:27:50,110 --> 01:28:05,070
But it is flesh in a sense, is it not? It is just not flesh. It's flesh in a primary state because you can actually see – you put a little window in an egg if it's incubated and you could see how it develops.

1254
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:13,230
But the interesting part from an energetic point of view, it is an entire chicken from an energetic point of view.

1255
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:19,330
So that's interesting. It's also extremely heat sensitive because of the state the quote-unquote proteins and liquids are in.

1256
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:24,650
But essentially what I do suggest about eggs, of course, is always get the best quality you can.

1257
01:28:25,030 --> 01:28:36,470
Again, eat few of them because they are extremely potent even though it may not feel as such and be mindful with the heat on them, very mindful.

1258
01:28:36,990 --> 01:28:39,450
There are actually some stupendous things you can do with them.

1259
01:28:39,450 --> 01:28:50,150
Eggs are incorporated in just about savory and sweet dishes, right? Almost all – most – I shouldn't say all, but many pastries do include the use of eggs.

1260
01:28:50,290 --> 01:28:52,750
We just brought up the concept of egg in the flatbread.

1261
01:28:53,310 --> 01:28:56,790
You know why the French pastry chef only uses one egg?

1262
01:28:57,530 --> 01:28:58,550
No, why does he do that?

1263
01:28:59,390 --> 01:29:00,130
Because it's an oeuf.

1264
01:29:01,150 --> 01:29:02,470
Oh, okay, gotcha.

1265
01:29:03,950 --> 01:29:04,290
Cool.

1266
01:29:06,230 --> 01:29:07,230
So, all right.

1267
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:08,930
So, yeah, that's all right.

1268
01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:12,690
So the concept of eggs, yeah, that's a good one, yeah.

1269
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:19,870
But that is the pregenitor, I guess, for the early start into considering animal material.

1270
01:29:19,970 --> 01:29:22,330
And then milk is the other, you know, dairy.

1271
01:29:24,230 --> 01:29:27,910
Cheese, by the way, you know, and other products, dairy products, change the dairy.

1272
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:33,870
That's why some people might have an adverse reaction to drinking certain types of milk but don't to cheese, right?

1273
01:29:33,890 --> 01:29:36,250
So when you make a cheese, you've actually changed it.

1274
01:29:36,670 --> 01:29:40,850
Obviously, its form, its flavor and all that, and its reaction to the body also changes.

1275
01:29:41,410 --> 01:29:43,750
But there's many aspects to that as well.

1276
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:47,610
You know, if you find yourself intolerant, then avoid it.

1277
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:52,930
But the point here is with dairy, think about it.

1278
01:29:52,930 --> 01:30:04,990
The purpose of the dairy in animal or even human is to provide nutrition to the early or the young, right, newborn to young offspring, right?

1279
01:30:05,470 --> 01:30:14,530
And what's interesting is the potency of the rate of growth and the type of animal is also resembled in the milk.

1280
01:30:14,530 --> 01:30:27,310
So, for example, a very simple way to look at it is that it might be less challenging to the body for, let's say, a man or a woman or a human to drink goat's milk or sheep's milk

1281
01:30:27,310 --> 01:30:32,370
because the animal tends to be more in relation to the physical size and rate of growth to mankind,

1282
01:30:32,570 --> 01:30:37,950
where if you drink cow's milk, that is a much more potent type of dairy.

1283
01:30:38,110 --> 01:30:41,770
Some people might think this is an urban myth, but this is just the practical side of it,

1284
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:51,270
is the rate at which a calf grows is disproportionate, you know, at rate than other smaller animals.

1285
01:30:51,610 --> 01:30:55,710
So there tends to be a contention about milk in general.

1286
01:30:55,870 --> 01:30:58,510
People have an intolerance, and it's basically the cow's milk.

1287
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:01,550
It's basically like rocket fuel, you know, when people drink it,

1288
01:31:01,630 --> 01:31:06,430
where something like goat milk or sheep milk would be more benign to the human, let's say.

1289
01:31:06,770 --> 01:31:10,130
That's something that has to be considered as well, and it's not discussed that way.

1290
01:31:10,130 --> 01:31:13,970
It's kind of discussed across the board that all dairy is just dairy, right?

1291
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:17,870
And this is just the finer point, you know.

1292
01:31:18,450 --> 01:31:24,190
But it also, for some reason, milk being a whole product has sort of been banned

1293
01:31:24,190 --> 01:31:28,290
because it is such a whole product and complete food, so it's been fractionalized.

1294
01:31:28,870 --> 01:31:35,270
So again, just like going into the subject of, you know, people have certain wheat allergies, gluten-free and whatever,

1295
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:38,150
that's the most ridiculous thing that can be said.

1296
01:31:38,150 --> 01:31:42,790
What people are finding adverse reactions to with glutens and other things like that

1297
01:31:42,790 --> 01:31:47,270
is the quality of the gluten or the quality of the grain that is being provided

1298
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:49,250
and the things that are added to it.

1299
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:51,910
You know, have you heard of like gluten-free diet?

1300
01:31:52,010 --> 01:31:53,090
That's ridiculous, you know.

1301
01:31:53,870 --> 01:32:00,030
It's the quality that's being offered, again, and not necessarily whether it's organic or not,

1302
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:03,510
but it's actually the strains and the types of grain that are being raised for human,

1303
01:32:03,970 --> 01:32:05,470
quote-unquote, consumption have changed.

1304
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:08,190
So these are things to be considered.

1305
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:16,990
But just as we're running out of time here to get into those that do prefer or do consume animal flesh,

1306
01:32:17,410 --> 01:32:21,550
and what's interesting about it is, you know, when we, say we meaning in the Western world,

1307
01:32:21,690 --> 01:32:26,450
go to eat animal, you know, let's say beef, we say a steak or a rib or whatever, you know,

1308
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:28,950
we call it things like that, but it's actually muscle tissue.

1309
01:32:29,570 --> 01:32:31,710
You know, what's interesting, if you go to an Asian restaurant

1310
01:32:31,710 --> 01:32:39,050
that is predominantly accommodating Asians, and the menu is in Chinese or Korean or what have you,

1311
01:32:39,170 --> 01:32:43,090
and they do give you an English translation for the non-Asian patrons,

1312
01:32:43,770 --> 01:32:47,690
a steak will be listed as beef muscle, right?

1313
01:32:48,890 --> 01:32:50,970
So it's quite an interesting idea.

1314
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:55,650
So when you're eating the flesh of an animal, let's say,

1315
01:32:56,270 --> 01:32:58,930
you're actually eating parts that can be identified.

1316
01:32:58,930 --> 01:33:00,050
Is it organ meat?

1317
01:33:00,190 --> 01:33:01,470
Is it skin?

1318
01:33:02,010 --> 01:33:02,890
Is it muscle?

1319
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:04,370
Is it bone marrow?

1320
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:05,190
Things like that.

1321
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:07,210
Is it, you know, what type of organ?

1322
01:33:07,610 --> 01:33:10,150
And this is something that has to be considered as well.

1323
01:33:10,190 --> 01:33:13,310
And it seems to have been washed away, just like when young children are asked now,

1324
01:33:13,810 --> 01:33:15,750
in what they call the States, where does milk come from?

1325
01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:18,590
And they say it comes from the store, you know.

1326
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:21,850
So this is something to be considered.

1327
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:25,930
Now, the suggestions that are made with meat, let's say fish and fowl,

1328
01:33:25,930 --> 01:33:33,390
we mentioned earlier that it is almost indirectly recommended to be vegetarian,

1329
01:33:33,690 --> 01:33:37,130
but nonetheless most people still do engage in eating of those things.

1330
01:33:38,410 --> 01:33:41,430
The problems, the main problems you'll find here,

1331
01:33:41,590 --> 01:33:44,510
which are discernible is the level of quality that's offered,

1332
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:48,910
especially with the four-legged animals and the fowl or the poultry,

1333
01:33:49,090 --> 01:33:55,050
is the quality is going down and down and down because the profit margins are

1334
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:58,470
trying to be maintained and also maintaining low prices.

1335
01:33:58,730 --> 01:34:03,050
So the actual practices in the western world and eastern world now,

1336
01:34:03,230 --> 01:34:07,030
especially which is gaining popularity, is what's called commercial farming.

1337
01:34:07,710 --> 01:34:12,290
So if you had grown up, for example, 30, 40, or even 20 years ago,

1338
01:34:12,710 --> 01:34:14,510
if you have a discernible palate,

1339
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:19,250
you will notice that the quality of what's called meat and fish and fowl is going down.

1340
01:34:19,570 --> 01:34:23,010
It's because the conditions that these animals are being raised in,

1341
01:34:23,010 --> 01:34:27,890
in terms of husbandry, is getting worse and worse and worse.

1342
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:31,230
And this just happens to be the way things go.

1343
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:32,730
I mean look at what most people,

1344
01:34:33,010 --> 01:34:36,310
look at what pretty much everything mankind is doing at this point,

1345
01:34:36,370 --> 01:34:41,190
whether it's political, education, judicial, religious or so, scientific.

1346
01:34:41,830 --> 01:34:44,310
It's just getting worse qualitatively.

1347
01:34:45,350 --> 01:34:49,170
One thing I like to say, which is not necessarily to regress from the subject,

1348
01:34:49,170 --> 01:34:52,750
but today is a little bit worse than yesterday,

1349
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:54,830
but not as bad as it's going to be tomorrow.

1350
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:59,270
That is another way of saying the frog being boiled in the pot.

1351
01:35:00,030 --> 01:35:02,830
So yes, just putting that aside for a minute,

1352
01:35:03,630 --> 01:35:07,430
when you're going to deal with fish, fowl and four-legged animals,

1353
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:10,630
one suggestion that I would make with the four-legged animals,

1354
01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:13,070
well typically, just to put it out there, this might sound religious.

1355
01:35:13,190 --> 01:35:14,790
If you think it's religious, cover your ears.

1356
01:35:15,290 --> 01:35:17,850
But what's fit for mankind to eat if it's four-legged

1357
01:35:17,850 --> 01:35:19,970
is to have a clove and hoof and chew the cud.

1358
01:35:21,030 --> 01:35:22,250
Yeah, you heard it right.

1359
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:26,230
So most animals that are four-legged may or may not do that.

1360
01:35:26,350 --> 01:35:29,810
Like a pig has got a clove and hoof, but it doesn't chew the cud.

1361
01:35:30,230 --> 01:35:32,250
A rabbit chews the cud, but it has a paw.

1362
01:35:32,370 --> 01:35:33,610
A dog and a cat does neither.

1363
01:35:35,070 --> 01:35:37,910
And just to throw in a little joke, I think it was Malcolm X,

1364
01:35:37,990 --> 01:35:39,330
they asked him, why don't you eat pork?

1365
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:42,370
And he says, well, pork is half dog, half cat and all rat.

1366
01:35:42,450 --> 01:35:45,670
But anyway, that's not true.

1367
01:35:45,670 --> 01:35:47,870
But let's just say it's a joke against that.

1368
01:35:47,930 --> 01:35:54,210
And I think I brought up the concept earlier of the dangers of people who have a taste for pork.

1369
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:55,910
What danger is that, Greek?

1370
01:35:56,030 --> 01:36:00,170
Well, by the way, if you look at mythology when people were turned into pigs,

1371
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:02,950
and I'm not just suggesting or promoting anything here.

1372
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:04,150
Just listen up, folks.

1373
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:07,610
Pig flesh tastes identical to human flesh.

1374
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:09,970
So let me give you a little bit of a story.

1375
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:13,690
I was in Texas a few years ago speaking to an ex-restaurateur,

1376
01:36:13,690 --> 01:36:15,090
and they had a veal special.

1377
01:36:15,690 --> 01:36:18,410
And they ran out of veal, and one of the chefs suggested,

1378
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:20,410
why don't we just serve the pork instead of veal?

1379
01:36:21,370 --> 01:36:22,130
And they did.

1380
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:24,210
And the people ate it as if it was veal.

1381
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:27,930
And then I suggested, well, you could have served human flesh,

1382
01:36:27,930 --> 01:36:29,450
and the people would have eaten it also.

1383
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:31,970
And they found that to be ghastly.

1384
01:36:32,610 --> 01:36:38,550
And I suggested to them that from testimony that I've seen memorialized through the ages

1385
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:43,070
and even from watching an HBO special on a serial killer who ate his victim,

1386
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:46,550
suggesting that it tastes exactly like pork and calling the reporter a hypocrite.

1387
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:49,730
When he asked them if he ate pork, I am suggesting,

1388
01:36:49,990 --> 01:36:53,430
well, not suggesting and not recommending this for or against,

1389
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:57,650
but I am just making a statement here that if you have a taste for pork,

1390
01:36:58,150 --> 01:37:00,610
that could easily be substituted with human flesh.

1391
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:04,550
Use your imagination, and you will be quite satisfied.

1392
01:37:05,350 --> 01:37:11,970
So anyway, this is not to be conspiratorial, but let's maybe just dwell on it.

1393
01:37:11,970 --> 01:37:18,710
The Polynesian Islanders called when they were talking of the cannibals,

1394
01:37:19,670 --> 01:37:21,990
they were talking about human flesh.

1395
01:37:22,110 --> 01:37:23,670
They referred to it as long pork.

1396
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:24,570
Mm-hmm.

1397
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:30,150
Now, Americans have been promoted, and most Europeans in the past century, that bacon.

1398
01:37:30,570 --> 01:37:33,550
By the way, having pork with breakfast and all that,

1399
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:36,910
that started in the 1930s, the promotion of pork as such.

1400
01:37:37,790 --> 01:37:42,270
It was kind of like the same time when Skinner and these other guys came in with marketing.

1401
01:37:43,070 --> 01:37:46,870
It's like, watch, we could – it's kind of like the thing with P.T. Barnum.

1402
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:49,690
You know how they said a sucker is born every minute?

1403
01:37:49,950 --> 01:37:51,770
Well, the rest of it, I think, goes something like this.

1404
01:37:51,790 --> 01:37:53,010
A sucker is born every minute,

1405
01:37:53,070 --> 01:37:57,090
and you could never lose money by underestimating the intelligence of the American public.

1406
01:37:58,410 --> 01:38:06,990
But nonetheless, I've actually read once in an older literary work, a fiction, let's say,

1407
01:38:07,110 --> 01:38:11,130
where a man was introducing his son as being nine years old, and he's learning how to eat pork.

1408
01:38:11,450 --> 01:38:14,550
I found that to be very unusual, how that was brought into subject matter.

1409
01:38:14,610 --> 01:38:17,950
I don't think it was Dickens, but it's just a strange thing.

1410
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:21,270
And, of course, you know what's interesting, by the way?

1411
01:38:22,010 --> 01:38:25,830
People that live in the so-called Bible Belt in America love pork.

1412
01:38:27,070 --> 01:38:29,710
So I guess the Bible makes a good doorstop for them.

1413
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:36,730
But anyway, that's another – I don't think we need to harp on people that are mentally deficient.

1414
01:38:36,890 --> 01:38:41,110
But nonetheless, let's just say be careful, folks.

1415
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:43,790
If you have a taste for pork, you can be easily fooled,

1416
01:38:43,870 --> 01:38:50,650
and there are some pranksters in places that can provide you with something that's not pork that you will think is pork.

1417
01:38:50,810 --> 01:38:53,070
And let's just let your imagination run wild there for a minute.

1418
01:38:53,650 --> 01:38:57,810
Fried green tomatoes. Have you ever seen the movie Fried Green Tomatoes? It's an older one.

1419
01:38:58,290 --> 01:39:02,190
No, no. I've heard of it, though. Yeah, about the women in the hair salon or something.

1420
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:10,950
No, no, not really. There's human flesh that's served up and sold as pork in it.

1421
01:39:11,130 --> 01:39:13,510
That's why it is applicable there. Yeah.

1422
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:16,490
It's – I don't know. It's an interesting movie.

1423
01:39:17,410 --> 01:39:19,150
It's been many years since I've seen it.

1424
01:39:19,790 --> 01:39:23,190
The simplest suggestion I would make with meats is very simple.

1425
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:29,030
With any meat, actually, except for the fish, is learn to employ certain spices

1426
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:33,470
and things that were usually and typically reserved in the Western world for pastry.

1427
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:37,190
What does that mean? Well, there are spices called cinnamon.

1428
01:39:37,650 --> 01:39:39,890
There are spices called cardamom.

1429
01:39:40,190 --> 01:39:43,850
There are spices called anise, like star anise. It gives it that licorice flavor.

1430
01:39:43,850 --> 01:39:50,210
Learn to incorporate those in marinades or dry rubs in your what's called beef or lamb

1431
01:39:50,850 --> 01:39:57,050
or other, quote-unquote, red meat, and you will be amazed and surprised at the complexity of the flavor.

1432
01:39:57,430 --> 01:40:01,230
This is typically used in a lot of Vietnamese culture, by the way,

1433
01:40:01,930 --> 01:40:03,930
and also a lot of Middle Eastern culture.

1434
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:07,950
It is not uncommon to add cinnamon to a roast, right?

1435
01:40:07,950 --> 01:40:12,730
That's why very often Westerners or, quote-unquote, Americans or Northern Europeans

1436
01:40:12,730 --> 01:40:19,510
will go to eat something at a Middle Eastern-type restaurant or certain Asian restaurants

1437
01:40:19,510 --> 01:40:23,310
and be amazed at the flavor, and they wonder why they can't make it at home,

1438
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:27,870
simply because they're using a spice profile that is typically reserved for pastry,

1439
01:40:28,710 --> 01:40:34,670
such as cinnamon, anise, cardamom, even cumin, and some clove.

1440
01:40:34,670 --> 01:40:37,450
Clove is very strong, so use very little.

1441
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:42,470
But nonetheless, learn how to incorporate those when you're cooking red meat.

1442
01:40:42,630 --> 01:40:46,570
And the interesting thing about cooking any meat is I've noticed that very often

1443
01:40:46,570 --> 01:40:51,850
people take it from a cold climate, like what's called a refrigerator, to the pan or the oven.

1444
01:40:52,450 --> 01:40:56,090
Always learn to temper food, especially like when you brought up how to cook egg.

1445
01:40:56,850 --> 01:41:01,950
If you can possibly allow the meat before it's cooked to come up to room temperature

1446
01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:04,110
before it hits the pan or pot.

1447
01:41:04,190 --> 01:41:07,330
Now, of course, people will say, well, Greg, you're promoting foodborne illness

1448
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:08,750
because bacteria grow on it.

1449
01:41:09,170 --> 01:41:13,350
Well, if you actually look at the concept of a lot of these spices, they do retard that.

1450
01:41:13,470 --> 01:41:17,890
And again, if you are concerned about the food being laden with pathogens like that,

1451
01:41:18,590 --> 01:41:21,010
you have gotten a very low-quality piece of meat.

1452
01:41:21,090 --> 01:41:23,750
So you can cook it until it's black or eat it raw.

1453
01:41:23,890 --> 01:41:27,610
You're still going to have the field or the energy of that pathogen.

1454
01:41:28,410 --> 01:41:33,350
But nonetheless, be clean with these things because they are decomposing.

1455
01:41:33,610 --> 01:41:36,390
Once the animal dies, it is in a decomposing state.

1456
01:41:36,850 --> 01:41:40,150
But the quickest suggestion that can be made, as we're running out of time,

1457
01:41:41,090 --> 01:41:46,450
is to start including other spice profiles that would typically be reserved for pastries.

1458
01:41:46,570 --> 01:41:49,110
Learn how to use anise, cinnamon, and cumin.

1459
01:41:49,310 --> 01:41:54,550
And you might be surprised, either in a dry rub or a marinade of some sort.

1460
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:59,210
And there are various forms of curries that are formed as such.

1461
01:42:00,150 --> 01:42:07,110
On the aspect of cooking fish and cooking meat and cooking fowl,

1462
01:42:07,650 --> 01:42:11,230
what's interesting about the aspects there are your time periods.

1463
01:42:11,570 --> 01:42:16,490
With meat, it's either going to be cooked for a few minutes or at least an hour and a half.

1464
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:22,590
Anything in between there will render the muscle fiber very tough, depending on the cut.

1465
01:42:22,590 --> 01:42:28,390
Usually the more expensive cuts of red meat are such because they remain sort of tender

1466
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:30,630
throughout any cooking time period.

1467
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:37,350
But most cuts of red meat that people will purchase should be either cooked for maybe a few minutes or so

1468
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:41,410
or an hour and a half, like a stew, where it breaks the toughness.

1469
01:42:42,290 --> 01:42:48,570
The fish, in another perspective, would be something that requires very little time and temperature.

1470
01:42:49,290 --> 01:42:54,630
And something like fowl is always best prepared if it's dried.

1471
01:42:55,090 --> 01:42:58,210
Very often people cook chickens and turkeys and things like that.

1472
01:42:58,670 --> 01:43:07,270
One way to actually create a perfect dish with poultry is to hang it and dry it for a couple of hours before it's cooked,

1473
01:43:07,930 --> 01:43:08,910
which is very interesting.

1474
01:43:09,190 --> 01:43:14,370
There is a tremendous amount of moisture in bird flesh and skin and such.

1475
01:43:14,370 --> 01:43:19,870
Now, if you're getting fowl parts or chicken parts or turkey parts, it's kind of hard to dry it,

1476
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:21,110
but keep it in a strainer.

1477
01:43:21,450 --> 01:43:28,270
If you reduce the moisture content of bird flesh, for example, it will cook better and taste better as well.

1478
01:43:28,730 --> 01:43:33,950
And you don't get this soggy, steamy kind of stuff going on when you're trying to fry or broil it.

1479
01:43:34,910 --> 01:43:37,870
So those are just simple suggestions with preparing animal.

1480
01:43:37,870 --> 01:43:42,310
And, of course, you know, fish is also animal flesh.

1481
01:43:43,130 --> 01:43:52,270
But there is a concept of having people having, especially more and more, of avoiding animal or eating meat,

1482
01:43:52,930 --> 01:43:59,910
but perhaps still engaging in what I call ovolactic, which is egg and milk, and perhaps fish.

1483
01:44:00,690 --> 01:44:06,850
That is still animal product, but nonetheless may be a little better than eating the rest.

1484
01:44:06,850 --> 01:44:12,410
But the suggestions, again, today, if anyone can walk away with learning how to make perfect rice,

1485
01:44:12,470 --> 01:44:18,910
I think we have accomplished quite a feat because I found that rice is a sticking point, no pun intended,

1486
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:23,090
with most people in the Western world and European world, let's say.

1487
01:44:23,890 --> 01:44:29,090
And also, I'm going back to rice, not to avoid speaking of meat, but we have about 10 minutes left.

1488
01:44:29,710 --> 01:44:30,310
So I'm going to go back to rice.

1489
01:44:30,310 --> 01:44:36,530
And I think that the concept of cooking the rice the way we suggested would probably be the central point

1490
01:44:36,530 --> 01:44:45,650
of presenting food preparation today, because it really kind of upsets one to go down the aisle

1491
01:44:45,650 --> 01:44:51,590
and see that there are processed rice dishes, like converted rice or bags of rice or things like that,

1492
01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:57,690
that people buy and consume because lack of skill on creating a perfect rice dish at home

1493
01:44:57,690 --> 01:45:01,570
without having something processed like that, so nonetheless.

1494
01:45:02,410 --> 01:45:07,630
But yeah, the meat, fish, and fowl concept is, again, the easiest thing to incorporate there.

1495
01:45:08,150 --> 01:45:12,990
It would be on the meat side, you know, with, say, beef, lamb, and such,

1496
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:19,670
is learn to incorporate some of the spice profiles, again, like cinnamon, anise, cumin, cardamom,

1497
01:45:19,670 --> 01:45:26,350
things like that, and you will have a completely different and more digestible, let's say, dish prepared.

1498
01:45:26,850 --> 01:45:28,430
And use your discernment on that.

1499
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:33,150
If you actually mention to someone in the Western world that you'll be using anise and cinnamon

1500
01:45:33,630 --> 01:45:40,130
and, let's say, garlic powder and salt to season a steak, they will find that to be crazy sounding.

1501
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:47,750
But if you actually tried it and cooked it, they would be quite rewarded with a wonderfully tasting piece of meat, let's say.

1502
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:53,190
So this is something, again, unusual we wanted to bring up, but to be considered regarding cooking meat.

1503
01:45:53,610 --> 01:45:59,810
But, again, just to bring it up once again, if you folks out there are afraid of cooking rice,

1504
01:45:59,950 --> 01:46:03,710
and I think today was the central point was learning how to cook perfect rice

1505
01:46:03,710 --> 01:46:08,230
would have been the central point of today's discussion on cooking food.

1506
01:46:08,230 --> 01:46:15,690
And, again, sort of indirectly discussing the concept of health and food, which was brought up,

1507
01:46:17,490 --> 01:46:22,590
simply a way to overcome that is to learn how to eat seasonally,

1508
01:46:23,930 --> 01:46:28,650
pretty much understanding that food changes body chemistry.

1509
01:46:28,910 --> 01:46:36,850
If you're speaking to a chemical-based materialistic mindset, eating seasonally or cross-latitude,

1510
01:46:36,850 --> 01:46:40,030
if you're in a warm place, eat food that comes from a warm place.

1511
01:46:40,410 --> 01:46:43,290
And if you're in a cold place, eat food that comes from a cold place.

1512
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:47,750
Don't mix and match because the body will adapt on its input.

1513
01:46:48,570 --> 01:46:53,770
So I guess that would be like a simple way to sum up what people can get away with

1514
01:46:54,770 --> 01:46:58,350
from listening to what we have to say about food prep or cooking.

1515
01:46:59,450 --> 01:47:03,150
And water likes to be cold and stored in a dark place.

1516
01:47:03,150 --> 01:47:05,890
Yes, exactly.

1517
01:47:06,570 --> 01:47:10,690
That's why when people go to purchase water at the shops, let's say,

1518
01:47:11,070 --> 01:47:13,330
it's always in a clear container at room temperature.

1519
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:15,470
Ha ha ha.

1520
01:47:16,710 --> 01:47:22,350
It's never cold, and it's always exposed to light, and no one is paying attention.

1521
01:47:22,990 --> 01:47:26,610
And to make things worse, you have people seeking out, quote, unquote,

1522
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:31,170
better information, alternative media, and you have all of these morons with a capital R

1523
01:47:31,170 --> 01:47:37,410
who want to discuss water, and not a one ever mentions keep it cool and in the dark.

1524
01:47:38,030 --> 01:47:42,190
They want to tell you little stories about what they think is going on,

1525
01:47:42,230 --> 01:47:45,070
which means absolutely, Jack, you know what.

1526
01:47:46,350 --> 01:47:48,030
So, yeah, interesting point.

1527
01:47:48,530 --> 01:47:51,470
The water, the freshness, the quality, seek best quality,

1528
01:47:51,590 --> 01:47:55,930
and not only quality in your food and food in preparation, but in conversation.

1529
01:47:56,210 --> 01:47:57,630
What say you on that, Seth?

1530
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:00,930
Yeah, good conversation.

1531
01:48:02,890 --> 01:48:03,770
Absolutely, absolutely.

1532
01:48:04,310 --> 01:48:09,450
I know that when this is over, I'm going to go prepare something to eat.

1533
01:48:10,070 --> 01:48:10,750
Yes, why not?

1534
01:48:11,530 --> 01:48:16,590
Yeah, and also the thing about food, by the way, there are laws and requirements to the body,

1535
01:48:16,770 --> 01:48:18,010
and when I say laws, meaning, you know,

1536
01:48:18,110 --> 01:48:22,910
anyone who is around pets likes to give the appropriate creature its appropriate food,

1537
01:48:23,030 --> 01:48:25,410
but people tend to think they can do anything they want.

1538
01:48:25,410 --> 01:48:27,770
So consider that as well, what's fit and proper, folks.

1539
01:48:28,950 --> 01:48:29,390
Absolutely.

1540
01:48:29,770 --> 01:48:32,850
Thanks for tuning in and listening to the discussion.

1541
01:48:33,030 --> 01:48:37,710
We'll be back around this same time next week.

1542
