1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Do you want to jump into it, or would you like me to?

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,680
No, I'd like you to.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,040
I just wanted to say also there is www.uncommonsense.com.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,400
It's Uncommon Radio.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,760
Uncommon Radio.

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,780
Uncommon Radio.com.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,500
Thank you.

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:16,780
Sorry.

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,200
Uncommon Radio.com.

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,820
And use the www because there's a lot of other things you'll find in the searches when you

11
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,780
do Uncommon Radio.

12
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,020
So use the www.uncommonradio.com.

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,440
Thank you.

14
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,000
And you will find links there or on that page, the simple calling page where you can just

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,240
click and find archives directly and the Ustream directly and everything else.

16
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,780
So, yeah.

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,960
Do you want to go into the names or perhaps we were discussing or should we just carry on?

18
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:47,720
Yeah, okay.

19
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:48,840
Yeah, sure.

20
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,060
Let's go for it.

21
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,620
I was going to suggest something uncommon that I've been thinking about.

22
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:04,040
As I put it earlier, just kind of kicking around in my own mind this week is perhaps

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:11,620
the importance of names as a kind of as a hint to a lot of the things that we've discussed.

24
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:19,680
I know last week predominantly we were discussing food and water and cooking and such things

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,020
and I think that we're going to get into that a little bit more later on as well.

26
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,720
But I wanted to suggest the importance of names and them being something that is relatively

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:38,560
and keep in mind that I'm using the word relatively here, but it's relatively easy to research

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:47,580
as far as scripture, old texts go, is names.

29
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:56,740
And just one example is the name Elijah.

30
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,040
That's how it's pronounced in English.

31
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,180
KJV?

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:09,060
Yeah, King James Version, any sort of text based upon that which most of what's in English

33
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,540
is what it's based upon if it's not that itself.

34
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,200
So that's a biblical character that's known as Elijah.

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,520
That's right, biblical character known as Elijah.

36
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,600
And the name, it wasn't Elijah when it was being spoken.

37
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,320
He wouldn't answer to the name Elijah.

38
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:40,340
It's in common colloquial Hebrew, in common translation or untranslated even.

39
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:46,060
And by the way, Seth, I don't think anyone ever answered to that name before 1500 or so.

40
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,020
So anyway, go ahead.

41
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,500
Yeah, precise.

42
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,000
But it's Eliyahu.

43
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,160
That's how they would pronounce it today.

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,140
Now I wasn't around when he was walking.

45
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:08,420
So I don't know if that itself is perhaps even a degradation in pronunciation.

46
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:14,840
It's possible because there was a period of time where part of that name was not used.

47
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,040
It was forbidden actually for the people speaking the tongue from using that name.

48
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,480
Let's just say what it means.

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,080
It means that Yahweh is Elohim.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,660
Yahweh is my El.

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's what it is.

52
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,160
And there's a lot of hints in just that phrase

53
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:42,380
because it's suggesting, one, that there are more than one of these Elohim.

54
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,520
More than a suggestion, I guess, but yes.

55
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:46,800
Right.

56
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:54,160
Eli is what roughly into English we use the word God.

57
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,300
It's inaccurate.

58
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:03,740
But that's roughly Elohim being God's plural and El being God's singular.

59
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:11,200
And Eli is likened to the God of me or my God in English,

60
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:17,540
although the E is what denotes that it's a possessive belonging to one.

61
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,680
That's why they have a specific name.

62
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,800
Very often these things are taken for granted.

63
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:30,640
And the meaning and the definitions are, let's say, perhaps listened to, heard, understood.

64
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,940
But what is the common thing to do?

65
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,300
Just go back to what everyone else is doing, right?

66
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,340
It doesn't matter.

67
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,060
But what are you going to do?

68
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,260
Set yourself apart.

69
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,120
You're not going to go around making corrections.

70
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,760
You're going to sound like a real outcast at that point.

71
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,880
I don't think it really needs correction.

72
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,520
It's just something that's – well, it needs correction for accuracy.

73
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:02,160
But I don't think commonly it can be approached as something to be corrected until a later date,

74
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,920
until it reaches the top.

75
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:13,460
The inaccuracy and lack of precision and loss of meaning and all the other things

76
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,680
that go along with things that are degraded go out of vogue.

77
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:28,120
It seems to be in vogue to allow heaps of degradation and corruption in almost every aspect of the human –

78
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,920
humanality, if there is such a thing in man's existence.

79
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:39,180
It seems like there's no lower limit to how much inaccuracy and precision,

80
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,080
corruption, or just taking for granted can be allowed.

81
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,000
I think the names can be inclusive in that.

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,660
One thing we've also mentioned, Seth, in the past is names are exempt from language, right?

83
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,600
Absolutely.

84
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:58,720
It's a sound that denotes an object, a person, meaning man or woman or a thing,

85
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,960
and it's exempt from language.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,920
But I found that especially in the entitled classes now, whether it's scientific, judicial, education, legal society,

87
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:15,760
I should say because there is no judicial system anymore to be recognized as such by definition, let's say.

88
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,160
But what they're doing is they speak in verb and adverb and pronouns.

89
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,100
They don't use many nouns anymore.

90
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:23,880
You ever notice that?

91
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,620
There's no substance even in the language.

92
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:35,300
Yeah, it's become very commonplace for those that are loquacious to actually not be saying anything at all.

93
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,720
Okay.

94
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,160
Yeah.

95
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,020
So, okay, the name.

96
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:45,520
Interesting.

97
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,680
You know, there's a lot of talk in certain study groups, by the way.

98
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,580
You know, like I mentioned, study groups regarding legal matters and such about the use of the name.

99
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,080
And when I ever do any correspondence, whether it's sonic or written with anyone,

100
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:10,080
I always preface and I state that, you know, any legal matter that you might consider in today's world is actually a prank.

101
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,240
You do comprehend that, right?

102
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,100
You're being pranked.

103
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,260
There's no law that they're using or anything.

104
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:23,840
And so actually going after a particular aspect, there's many people that are considering the importance of using the name.

105
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,980
But, yeah, this is another thing that's commonly regarded, again,

106
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,840
is people think that a lot of the institutions and things that, let's say we call the entitled classes,

107
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,500
you know, people with social rank, doctor, attorney, professor, scientist, these ranks,

108
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:49,780
they think that these entitled classes now are holding any kind of information that is, let's say,

109
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,040
people approach them from a sense of convenience because they don't have time

110
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,380
or don't want to make the time to study these things on their own.

111
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,280
And they really shouldn't.

112
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,700
And there's an element of trust that man has bestowed on these classes of people known as the entitled ones,

113
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,320
the educated ones, the elite, let's say, the professionals, right, the experts.

114
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:18,240
People have taken for granted and have lost the ability seemingly to many extent of checking up on what is being put out by these experts.

115
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,700
And this is a time period, folks, that will be coming in the future.

116
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:27,600
People will be dedicating a little bit more time, like a minute a day,

117
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,799
into seriously considering what they're being told about things that they have not delved into

118
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,059
because they have their own lives to delve into.

119
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,740
So, you know, an example of that is if you are a baker and you bake bread all day for a living

120
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,460
because you're good at it and you like doing it, notice I didn't say the word job,

121
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,780
and you want to know something about astrophysics.

122
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,480
Well, you know, you're going to go and maybe today with the electronic convention, look up on the Internet,

123
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,540
you know, what your interest is in astrophysics.

124
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,860
And majority of the stuff that they give you there is bunk, you know,

125
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,480
or you might want to understand something about the human body or let's say the medical sciences.

126
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,640
What they're providing you with is bunk, so on and so forth.

127
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,200
You know, the legal society, you want to get some legal information.

128
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,080
It's bunk.

129
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:23,260
So right now it's just fascinating how the level of quality that mankind is operating on is so low.

130
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:29,220
Have you ever heard of the old comedian Henny Youngman or Kenny Youngman or Henny Youngman?

131
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,760
He says, I looked high.

132
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,560
One of the things he says is, I was looking high and low for you, but obviously I didn't look low enough.

133
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:36,620
Right.

134
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,380
So this is the state right now.

135
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,620
And this is meeting on a qualitative aspect.

136
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,320
And what makes it even worse really is let's just say,

137
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,540
could this society in the future be known as a society that had access to everything,

138
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,800
but threw everything away?

139
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:55,400
No.

140
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,140
So, I mean, look at the level of persecution, by the way.

141
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,040
Let's just go back.

142
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:09,080
Since you brought up the name concept and kind of narrowed it on the Eliyahu Elijah concept there,

143
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,240
you know that whether it's urban myth or not,

144
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,080
there's a lot of good evidence to suggest that several hundred years ago,

145
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,220
if anyone did any research or study, they were heavily persecuted.

146
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:20,480
Right.

147
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:28,980
I think, isn't it Don Quixote, that writing where he spent time in prison because he did a public reading of the biblical text?

148
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,340
Maybe anyone else familiar with that story?

149
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:32,440
Okay.

150
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:40,680
So you're in a time period now where you have so much access to information,

151
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,180
albeit it has to be sifted through and discerned, but it's just not looked at.

152
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:50,320
You know, one of the notes that I was putting together mentally was, you know,

153
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:54,600
the previous sonic project that I did here on AFR.

154
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:00,260
The first episode was kind of like a primer or preface to what would be discussed.

155
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:05,220
And the things there are like no one's really paying attention, right, and no one's really being objective.

156
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,040
When I say no one, I mean statistically most people.

157
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,280
And also that we're subject to external input.

158
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,500
We're unlike the creatures, other creatures that are pretty much born and ready to go with an operating system.

159
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,740
You know, I always give the metaphor of if you had a six-week-old puppy raised by a family of gorillas,

160
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,660
if you adopted that puppy as an adult, it would act just like a dog, would know the difference.

161
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:40,820
But if you had a six-week-old human baby raised by gorillas, if you invited him over or her over to your presence as an adult,

162
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,520
guess what they will be acting like?

163
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,800
So just like gorilla.

164
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:44,920
Gorilla.

165
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:56,400
So the interesting part about the external input is when you look at the bottom of the barrel scrounging for so many hundreds of years,

166
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:02,760
you know, the low-level quality of the mind that's been indulged in these low-level, you know,

167
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:12,400
aspect of thinking for so long that someone just researching a little bit on something that is, you know, a matter of fact,

168
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:20,560
all they have to do is a little bit of study and then just go out and profess this interesting factoid that's easy for everyone to access,

169
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,020
and they kind of build a career on it, whether it's an alternative radio or mainstream,

170
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:34,660
or they write treatises in university or papers, and they rarely consider furthering the study.

171
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:42,900
So even there's a lot of sources of sort of unique little factoids and subject matter that can be researched,

172
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,740
but it's – I'm not saying it should be exhausted, but there's still no depth.

173
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:56,160
And it doesn't mean that the depth should be arduous and long-lasting and, you know, just a little bit more.

174
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:03,960
And in other words, I think it's laziness, spiritual laziness or laziness of the mind, you know.

175
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,040
So I guess that ties in with names quite a bit.

176
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:14,020
I mean, would you say it's kind of laziness also that, you know, people kind of just don't care?

177
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,280
Maybe is it because they – you know.

178
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,380
Laziness, distraction, I'd say.

179
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,400
There's a lot of pretty colors being broadcast to people, a lot of pretty sounds.

180
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,660
You know, I'm setting it up for something else that could be a reason that I've always discussed.

181
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:37,580
It's something called cosmic censorship, being censored by the gods or, you know, the Most High, let's say.

182
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,960
It's a real interesting concept.

183
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:47,120
And by the way, censorship just means to block or redact or prevent, I guess, the flow of information,

184
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,620
whether it's visual or sonic or whatever, literal as well.

185
00:13:52,440 --> 00:14:01,620
And if you do notice that someone, let's say someone here, versus something is censored cosmically,

186
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,800
there's nothing you can do to make them see anything else if they're censored about that particular thing, let's say.

187
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,800
You know, you hear that often when you bring up certain facts in society and people say,

188
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,540
well, I really don't see it, I don't understand it, and it could be as simple as a popsicle stick, right?

189
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,640
So that's one of the things of discernment.

190
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,420
If you run into anyone who's cosmically censored about a subject and the subject could be really simple,

191
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,140
don't even bother continuing.

192
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,560
There is nothing you can do.

193
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,420
Now, it doesn't mean there will be a time when the censorship is lifted,

194
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,780
which is actually going to be coming around the corner here.

195
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:44,300
Roughly what you call 2018 is going to be an interesting time for the lifting of some cosmic censorship.

196
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:50,580
So anyway, these things are to be discussed in greater detail, perhaps.

197
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:57,700
But if you don't know, if you can't grasp what cosmic censorship is, by the way, guess what?

198
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,260
Chances are you're censored as well.

199
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,160
It's one of those things.

200
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:11,880
It's really simple, but it's difficult because it is pretty rigid.

201
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,260
And sometimes the censorship can be lifted.

202
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,160
Again, it's cosmic, and I don't think anyone can really do it,

203
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:24,520
but it appears to be lifted when certain realizations certain people have,

204
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,240
and let's say those realizations become what's called life-changing.

205
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,420
You've heard of that, right?

206
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,920
So that could also be attributed to some of that censorship being lifted on a personal level.

207
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:39,920
But yeah.

208
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,780
Oh, another thing I was thinking of, a mental note.

209
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,260
We speak often, you know, if you're going to come to Uncommon Sense,

210
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,660
you're going to hear definitions of things that are not just like, ha-ha, look at what this word means,

211
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,280
but things that are very practical.

212
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:01,960
We always tend to bring up the concept of soul, spirit and body,

213
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:08,000
defining them, and by now I think if anyone's frequented the show,

214
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,140
pretty much knows what we're going to say.

215
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,600
But if you haven't, the soul is your breath.

216
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,680
It's a very physical thing.

217
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,480
The spirit is the mind, and the body is the body.

218
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,160
Let's say the carnal, the flesh, it can be defined many ways as well as material.

219
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,220
Now, it's interesting about the mind, and you ever hear about people being spiritual?

220
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,980
Like, some of this guy's really spiritual, right?

221
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,780
I'm familiar with that brand.

222
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,100
Right.

223
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,700
It's supposed to be something good right off the bat.

224
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,460
Well, it's the mind.

225
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,280
You could be of a good mind or of an evil mind, let's say.

226
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,400
Let's just keep it real basic black and white.

227
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Spiritual doesn't necessarily always mean good, but here's the other thing.

228
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,260
There's a quality that I've noticed, and I've really never said this publicly on radio perhaps,

229
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,680
but let's just try it.

230
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,260
What do you think?

231
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,480
I don't think you know what I'm going to say, but let's go for it.

232
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,120
Anyway, on this end.

233
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,640
What I mean by that is you ever hear – well, before I go into it,

234
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:09,040
there's a level of – someone who is considered spiritual on a qualitative level

235
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,300
doesn't use the word or the terms me, my, or I very often.

236
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,339
It's interesting when you read a lot of the ancient texts,

237
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,380
and you listen to people who are sort of elevated on a better, higher quality of operation.

238
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,420
You'll notice they don't use me, my – like my hand, my finger, my car,

239
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:37,160
my kid, my money, my house, my wife, my show, my this, my that.

240
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:44,320
When you hear that often, that is someone who is on a lower elevation of spiritual development

241
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,400
or spiritual awareness, by the way, folks.

242
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,240
And I know this might sound kind of harsh and cruel and say, wait a second, Greek,

243
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,240
what's wrong with saying my kid or my computer or my –

244
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,980
I'm just making an observation here, and I'm giving you something to objectify.

245
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:06,360
So when you hear people speaking, and they start using me, my, myself, or I very often,

246
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,600
you're listening to a lower level or lower quality mind.

247
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,620
Now, let's just back this up.

248
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,360
Obviously, the Internet is going to be around.

249
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,440
I shouldn't say obviously like that, but it's going to be around for a while

250
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,320
because its purpose is not what people think.

251
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,960
It has nothing to do with information even though it purports to.

252
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:32,220
It's just a means of communication like the telephone was with audio and video.

253
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,120
That's easily available to anyone in the world pretty soon.

254
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,160
So if you go to these promotions that they give on browsers and things,

255
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:48,480
you notice they always say click here to claim your thing or this is my Yahoo or my whatever.

256
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,140
They use that terminology.

257
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,480
They're baiting a certain mindset.

258
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:01,000
It's very interesting because, by the way, if you really are a spirit animated with a soul and a body,

259
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,560
I would call it the container in essence.

260
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,460
The container is animated by the soul, and because of the life force,

261
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,340
then the spirit can be animated.

262
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,180
It's called consciousness.

263
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,160
Is it really yours?

264
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,480
Anyway, I think we can kind of keep going with this,

265
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:27,100
but I just wanted to put it out there because it seems like from feedback we've gotten on e-mails and such,

266
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,800
people like coming and listening to You and I Speak Seth.

267
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:37,060
It's basically a conversation we're having, and they say that they learn a lot of stuff sometimes,

268
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,940
and sometimes they look at the stuff as what we're saying as advice.

269
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,000
So that's why I thought I'd bring that up.

270
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:51,860
So, again, folks, if you hear people using this is my stuff or my whatever, me, me, me, I, I, I, I, me, me, mine,

271
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,980
you're listening to a lower level of mind quality or spirit quality.

272
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,140
Very interesting.

273
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,400
So just to top it off, if you ever go back and read any of the holy writs of the world or ancient texts,

274
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,600
people tend to refer to themselves in the third person.

275
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:15,580
So this is just something I figured I'd bring up because, you know, it's very common to hear that, right?

276
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,780
My kids, my car, my hand, my foot, my head, my computer.

277
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:32,080
So when you hear that, you right away know, yeah, Big Mac, French fries, Diet Coke.

278
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,180
So anyway, all right.

279
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,280
So keep rolling on.

280
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,180
Any more thoughts on that, Seth, or keep rolling?

281
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,240
No, no.

282
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,000
Yeah, we'll just keep rolling.

283
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:53,900
Spirit and soul is one of those things I think that bears repeating because that's one that's actually difficult.

284
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,780
That's kind of why I offered up the concept of names and, you know,

285
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,060
not them just being something that is referring to an individual,

286
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:15,460
but also possibly as a description and as a word that is a little bit easier to trace the history on

287
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,980
and find out its usage, its pronunciation, what the various parts of the word mean.

288
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:28,820
Whereas spirit and soul are actually, at this point in our recorded history,

289
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:39,540
especially in the language that you and I are using, have been obfuscated so much that it's like going back

290
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:45,880
and instead of being able to easily pull up where these words are defined with accuracy,

291
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:54,580
we actually have to go back to the text that they're used in and take them in the context in which they are used

292
00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:01,740
and then those words being translated or versionized into English in the manner in which they have,

293
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,840
you know, applying the definitions as they were used in context in the actual text

294
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:14,100
as opposed to actually just being able to punch it into like edamonline.com and come up with an easy description.

295
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:20,440
So names are a little bit different and some of them have been well preserved

296
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,680
and in that the information is transmitted easily, you know.

297
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:35,480
You can get into studying scripture and start just with the very first verse that is offered up in the King James Version

298
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:45,780
and get into that. I've been looking at that single verse for three years with what I would consider to be new eyes.

299
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,300
Do you mean the first verse in the first chapter of the first book?

300
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,220
Yes.

301
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:50,820
Okay.

302
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,880
It doesn't say in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

303
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:10,700
No.

304
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,300
Not even close, really. I mean, yeah, it does include, it has some things inclusive.

305
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:20,800
But here's the thing. If the first verse in the first chapter of the first book is in Hebrew,

306
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,820
it is just blatantly incorrect. What do you think is going on?

307
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:30,900
I mean, you're at a major handicap. I mean, you're thrown into the meat grinder right there and spit out the other side.

308
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,120
Yeah, interesting, isn't it?

309
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,220
It's very interesting.

310
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:47,260
And one of the more interesting things about it is even with the horrible versions that we have available to us in our language,

311
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:55,760
when it's taken as a whole, there is still quite a lot of information that makes it through.

312
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:02,860
I think it's in spite of the poor version that we are offered.

313
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,220
But they do tell you. They do tell you what's going on.

314
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:14,020
I had a brief discussion with someone a little while ago about the Gideon Bible and they read the preface.

315
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:24,380
And the preface, I'm paraphrasing here, was as such, this version taken from the original tongues, revised and amended.

316
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,460
And initially to the person who said this, it sounded fine. I was like, what?

317
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,220
That means that, wait, revised means to change and amend means to change.

318
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,860
So they're telling you twice they've changed it.

319
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:41,120
And you will find in any unabridged version of any of the Holy Writs, by the way,

320
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,200
they're telling you they're not giving it to you, right?

321
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,480
It's kind of like if you go and buy, let's say, a bag of rice, right?

322
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,060
And it says rice on it and you turn to the back and it says ingredients and there's a long list of stuff.

323
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,620
There's a chance that it's something that looks like rice, right?

324
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:05,040
Big difference. So, yeah, I find that, you know, and by the way,

325
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:13,340
this has nothing to do with any religious or dogmatic reaction or discussion or approach to what's going on in society,

326
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:18,020
which is absolutely ridiculous. It's just one huge dummy load at this point.

327
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,480
I think we've discussed why humanity has been dummy loaded.

328
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,160
But again, it's not that difficult to access source material.

329
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,480
But I think we bring up Gustave Le Bonde and the crowd mentality.

330
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,520
Most people are still locked into the crowd mentality, you know.

331
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,220
And it's basically it's the imbecile.

332
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,700
And this is a term used often by Gustave Le Bonde that is attracted to that, you know,

333
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:52,660
a simple idea that attracts people into being motivated into some sort of crowd or group.

334
00:25:52,800 --> 00:26:00,260
Now, if you go around the world, meaning man society and look at alternative media and mainstream university,

335
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:08,820
all of your sciences and legal societies, they are typically two or three or more people united in a group or united.

336
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,020
If you ask them what they're doing, they will always bring up some very oversimplified idea, which is nothing wrong with.

337
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:22,560
But if you examine what they are stating, the purpose of their grouping together a little further,

338
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,960
you will see that it has now changed and morphed away from what it was supposed to be.

339
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:34,100
So it's in name only. You know, how many times do you hear about activism?

340
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,200
You know, I know that too. Yeah, we've got to do something.

341
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:45,380
And like, OK, sounds good. But if I start looking at what they're discussing, oh, man, they missed the mark.

342
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,600
But, you know, they maybe the food is good. You know, they go out in the streets and they shout.

343
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,420
Maybe they're I don't know. Maybe they've got something we don't know about.

344
00:26:54,420 --> 00:27:02,840
It's an animated culture, you know, or it's just a group of imbeciles, you know, or you could be animated.

345
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:07,160
Yes, exactly. So you could look at this across the board.

346
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,500
So I think it's let's go back to the what we call the biblical version.

347
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:16,060
It's just accommodating them. You see, you see, in order to be successful in any venture,

348
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,360
you're going to have to be able to accommodate your audience or patron or your clientele.

349
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:30,420
Right. So I think these things have been carefully crafted to accommodate.

350
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,520
But then then you see, then it's a self-consuming situation.

351
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:39,320
There's no right. Things don't get better. It promotes stability, obviously,

352
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:45,620
because if you've got a lot of ignorant people and you accommodate their ignorance, there isn't much change.

353
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,520
Right. There's no difference of potential. So everything is calm and steady. Right.

354
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,000
So it's a pursuit of peace. Yeah. But so from that notion,

355
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:03,820
is it possible to still have peace and have radical change where you just have to look clearly at what's going on five feet in front of you?

356
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,760
And I would suggest it is. It's just not happening at this point.

357
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:14,020
So it will soon it will begin soon, by the way. Absolutely.

358
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:20,880
As you said, you know, it's not a religious group thing or a dogmatic approach to anything.

359
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:28,740
It's just looking at the text as it has been preserved and and making observations on that.

360
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:34,020
Speaking of religions, by the way, the Medical Society for over a decade,

361
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:41,620
been saying there's no such thing as a virus and no one that has any integrity in the medical society will say that there is a virus.

362
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:46,820
You know, they just they just present things, you know, graphics and things, you know, meaning as defined,

363
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,940
as people think in their minds, what a virus is. Right. And what's interesting, Seth,

364
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,680
is lately I've been looking at some of the media mainstream and some of the products.

365
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,520
For example, there's a commercial for a disinfectant and actually saw it on a shelf.

366
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,080
It's a spray disinfectant starts with an L. It's been around for a long time.

367
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:14,560
So, OK, and they used to have prominently in their ads and on the on the container itself kills ninety nine nine nine point of bacteria and viruses.

368
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,720
Now it doesn't say viruses anymore and neither do they promote it as such.

369
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:27,540
So it seems like they're quietly redacting or quietly just pulling back a little bit from the virus thing slightly.

370
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,120
It's interesting. See, it's kind of like.

371
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,560
Yeah, yeah, I think we'll pull that little piece of fiction away. Maybe we won't make too much noise there.

372
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,360
I think that has a lot to do with the time that we're going into.

373
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,520
It's better to start retracting the BS before people get to the point where they can see it clearly.

374
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,880
Right. Because there may not be so peaceful about it.

375
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,240
I just thought I'd bring that up because I brought it up with several people in the know about this.

376
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,020
And they said, yeah, you know, I've noticed that as well.

377
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:04,000
They're not using they meaning the established societies, the media are not using that term as much as they did before.

378
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,720
And I find that to be interesting how things just what is it called going away quietly in the night or something like that.

379
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:19,400
Uh huh. And by the way, since we're on the subject, if anyone looks up what viruses are and virology, it's a branch of toxicology, by the way.

380
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,900
Toxicology. Yeah. Which is toxins.

381
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,300
Yes. Waste products. Yeah.

382
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:32,180
So and I think we've discussed that. And it all ties in, by the way, with the food concept.

383
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,440
You know, what you're doing is you're feeding the body, you know, I guess.

384
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,580
Yeah. And the quality thereof affects the rest of it.

385
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:47,960
In a previous sonic project we discussed, we did an episode called the container and we kind of went through many of the aspects.

386
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:58,560
But again, the basic things are the integration of one of a being in its environment is the thing that needs to be considered first.

387
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:08,540
You know, from a holistic point of view, meaning, you know, how are you placed into the environment and the effect of the environment on the body or the container?

388
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,680
And the thing that we've always brought up and have been saying for many, many years is to eat seasonally or cross latitude.

389
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:29,820
Right. And because could it be that what you're taking or passing through the body is changing the body according to the environment or the source and the source environment where the plant or the thing came from?

390
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:38,580
Let's say the fruit or the flesh will adjust the body to the corresponding environment where it was sourced from.

391
00:31:38,580 --> 00:32:00,660
So, for example, if you're living in a hot climate or there's hot weather, middle of summer and you eat a piece of fish that is sourced from the Arctic, that will, let's say, use common terms, act as a blood thickener, change your body chemistry to living in the Arctic and you will not be able to cool down, you know, and vice versa.

392
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:14,720
If you're living in a cold climate or cold season and you're eating food that was sourced from the tropics and grown in the tropics, that food could adjust your body to living in the tropics and you will not be able to stay warm.

393
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:30,460
And this is one of the most basic concepts of the relationship between the material world to the material world crossed over by energies and things that you can't see in a microscope, but just make sense.

394
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:54,320
What about, and I know this is kind of getting into things we've already talked a little bit about, but things that always come to mind, what about when food is preserved, like in a can or like we've done for millennia with, you know, milk and yogurt and cheese?

395
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,180
We'll just look at it. It's different, isn't it? Doesn't it change it? It changes radically.

396
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:25,020
So if something, if you have two cucumbers, let's say, sourced as cucumbers, one is living, just picked, and the other one is preserved in salt, brine, and vinegar or whatever spices and it's several months old, it doesn't take much perception, whether it's visual, olfactory, or taste to see that they are completely different.

397
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:36,720
And once you look at it from using the senses directly that way, guess what? They are completely different.

398
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:45,320
The energetic quality or the quality that it will imbue on the being that is passing it through their body will be different.

399
00:33:45,440 --> 00:34:03,980
That's why traditionally, for example, crops that were grown during the agricultural season, spring, summer, harvested in the fall and preserved, whether they were dried or canned, canning meaning pickled as well, you know, with other constituents, brines and vinegars and things, changed them.

400
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:09,260
So they were more fit for consumption off season.

401
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,560
And this is something that can be proven out using good science.

402
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:23,659
By the way, speaking of science, I was in a conversation with someone about a week ago, very adamant about how science is the savior of mankind, you know, in parentheses there.

403
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:31,120
And I said, Well, that sounds good. But if you know, he was touting the scientific method, right, and how objective it is.

404
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:41,639
And I said, That sounds good. But right now, none of the sciences that are promulgated and put out into society would pass their own scientific method of objectivity.

405
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:51,600
So again, if it's a religion, can we go back and say that there's not a religion on the planet that's doing anything that they allegedly subscribe to?

406
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,720
Oh, yes. Are they beginning to deify science? That's a whole other plan.

407
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:06,440
I mean, I don't like I don't know, I don't like to speak ill of the gods, but we'll just say cold.

408
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,300
How about how about that? Does that work? Cold goddess.

409
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:25,540
And I can I can only imagine. I mean, I'm I'm actually well versed in some of the what they would call, quote unquote, scientific approaches to solving what is seen as some of the symptoms of humanity's problems.

410
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:36,600
And they're they're not pleasant for those who want to continue walking around with, you know, mind, body and soul.

411
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:57,840
Yeah, they there are some very well documented groups, actually, that, you know, we're sitting around in in prominent universities here in the States, you know, openly discussing how many people were going to have to be eliminated for them to be able to make things better.

412
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:07,980
So I don't know if I would I would call science even deified as as a savior of anything.

413
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:21,520
Well, each religion tends to centralize each religion tends to centralize their their key, let's say, notions as being in saviorship of some sort.

414
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:33,920
Yeah, but yeah, it's you know, what we say about that, you know, there's a there's a thing about overpopulation, you could reduce the Earth's population to down to less than 100 people, just 100 on the entire planet.

415
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:44,080
If you include a rabbi, an attorney, a minister, let's say a scientist or a doctor in 40 years, you're all going to be exactly in the same shape you're in right now.

416
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:49,200
The number of people is irrelevant. It's the quality of how you're operating.

417
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,080
But, you know, here's the thing, Seth, it's it is almost mandatory to know the future.

418
00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:07,340
And in the future, the God that is behind what's called science is not going to prevail over other gods, by the way, that are going to let's say one of them, could we consider the adversary of God?

419
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:13,740
Or I would say he was an Elohim, but he's more in the of the angelic venue, I would say, as an as a messenger.

420
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:20,960
That's his duty. Yeah, they will not prevail as as people think they do.

421
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:29,600
You know, yeah. Would it be what is it? What animals have a very short attention span? Is it a cat? I guess a lot of them were fish.

422
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:35,060
Oh, the shortest would be the fish, perhaps. Right. Right. Interesting.

423
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:44,420
Yeah. The age of the fish. Yeah. But what do you think? We're sort of a little bit halfway point of the first part of the show.

424
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:49,500
Should we touch on food a little bit? Are you OK with that? Yeah, I'm fine with that.

425
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:57,840
Before as a brief aside, I suppose the Greek and I were speaking for like maybe a minute and a half before we began the broadcast.

426
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:04,480
And I asked him to wait for the speaking on the food because I haven't done that yet today.

427
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:09,340
Right. But yes, I'm fine with it. And we have made bread.

428
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:19,140
You know, that's something that I make with the fair on a fairly regular basis in various forms and stuff like that.

429
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:23,580
As an unleavened bread, flatbread, let's say. Yes. Yes. Rapid. Rapid.

430
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:33,300
When I do if I do leavening of any sort, the only stuff I keep in the house for that really is eggs kind of act as a as a rising agent when you use them.

431
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:41,820
So I made I made I'd say that I made waffles a couple of times, but that would be inaccurate.

432
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:54,840
I mean, I made fried bread and it was the shape of a waffle, but I don't really follow any recipe for it other than just making making kind of a sweeter bread and then frying it on an iron.

433
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:02,340
But it's very quick. Well, I think a true waffle has yeast in it as an active, very active yeast.

434
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:09,700
Yeah, it would be right. And I don't I don't I don't do that. I've I've done it recently with was actually missing a few.

435
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:18,740
I didn't have any eggs. And I've you know, like I said, I'll just fry bread like that and put a little bit a little bit of sugar in it.

436
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:25,700
I always put oats in with it as well. A simple thing to do, by the way, if you're a fan or not, is mayonnaise.

437
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:35,340
A good quality mayonnaise mixed in with flour, a pinch of baking powder or baking soda and maybe an egg and some salt, let's say, will yield a pretty good biscuit, by the way.

438
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:40,380
Yeah, the mayonnaise. I haven't done that, but I've had it.

439
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,700
I've had it. Yeah, I haven't made them, but I've I've eaten them.

440
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:53,880
And they're pleasant. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't use the the whatever you're using it in with the flavor of mayonnaise.

441
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:59,220
It just mayonnaise or it's mainly, you know, eggs to begin with. So, yes, yes.

442
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:12,960
It's a good roundabout substitution. And by the way, since you brought up bread, that was one of the things I was mentally thinking about was almost true to that recipe of laying out flour, adding an egg and some moisture to make the flatbread.

443
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:28,440
It sends the fat, let's say the butter or anything like that. You can roll that out and really thin or not so thin, if you so prefer, and using the extra amount of flour and slice it very narrow in a noodle form.

444
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:39,180
And if you have some boiling water going in a colander, just about a minute of that same mixture for making flatbread will yield a pretty good noodle or pasta.

445
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:44,980
So I have to try that. I haven't. That has not occurred to me. It's the same thing.

446
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:49,720
If you're late, just exactly just imagine you got your flatbread piece ready to go. Right.

447
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:56,100
Well, instead of instead of baking it, why don't you just cut it in a narrow form?

448
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,960
You're going to have to use a lot more flour, though, within the layer.

449
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:05,920
Obviously, you don't want it to stick together where if it sticks together when you're rolling out, let's say, a flatbread, you can mitigate it.

450
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,460
Right. Right. If you start cutting it, you might and it sticks together. You might have to start all over.

451
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:19,220
But go ahead and make a flat noodle out of it and immediately drop it in some boiling water for a minute or so.

452
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:27,660
And, you know, you know what to do once you've got noodles and pasta. You can top it with just some oil, butter and garlic or sauce or however.

453
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,820
You're going to need some fat so it doesn't stick together afterwards. When I say fat, meaning, you know, oil or butter or something.

454
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,880
And now you've got a fresh pasta.

455
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:40,340
How does how do how do the grains and breads like that?

456
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:47,740
I mean, obviously, you know, in the process of making bread, it'd be significantly different than just eating like, you know, the wheat kernels.

457
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:53,780
But how does that fit into the eating seasonally and things like that?

458
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,340
You mean whole grain?

459
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:04,360
Well, yeah. Well, flour, more specifically. Speaking of bread, because that's one of the things I eat all year round.

460
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:12,480
Here's one that's great, because that ties into an email we got regarding, let's say, the toxicity of refined foods, meaning he didn't use that term.

461
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,200
I am the sugar sugars. OK, I want to tie that in together.

462
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,080
Flour is a processed product that's removed from its natural state of balance. Right.

463
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:33,000
Right. And anything that is in that state is is is, let's say, prone to rapid oxidation and degradation of quality.

464
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:43,940
That's why a lot of oils, you know, nut oils or just any food that is like an oil, an oil or a butter, a nut butter or even seeds like sesame seeds.

465
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,540
Things that you have in storage flour are good for, I would say, about a season, a season or two.

466
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,000
You know, if you get it in the spring, you should have it eaten by the fall.

467
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,740
Don't let it last too long because it loses its efficacy. Right.

468
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:05,120
Now, let's just put aside that most of the products that we that are bought today are bleached and heavily modified and denatured before we even get them, no matter how fresh they are.

469
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:10,260
The general rule is don't start a food museum. Right.

470
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:15,220
The key is good rotation and don't overbuy.

471
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,860
So you things go bad. Right. Things go rancid.

472
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:29,500
And and even considering that, I mean, they have best by dates, you know, best if used by, you know, on almost anything now. Right.

473
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:35,280
It seems like because people, especially in the Western countries, have created food museums.

474
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:43,660
I go to people's homes sometimes when they ask for me to prepare a meal and I go through their cupboard and it's so jam packed and they're constantly just replacing what's in the front.

475
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:52,060
And I would reach in the back and there's a bottle of something from what they call 1998, you know, that should have been eaten in what they call 1998.

476
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,560
So, yeah, don't don't start a food museum.

477
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:03,860
But just to go off on the thing about the question about sugar, I think one of the comments was it should be listed as deadlier than cigarettes.

478
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:08,700
OK, without getting into how the body digests, because, by the way, you don't absorb anything.

479
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,360
Things are created in the body as they pass through the track.

480
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:17,980
When you, for example, take something like sugar that exists, let's say let's talk about cane sugar.

481
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:23,460
And by the way, if you do go out and buy sugar these days, if it doesn't say cane sugar, it's probably made from something else.

482
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,480
It's common.

483
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:34,120
Yeah, sugar beet or other things mixed and matched to get the chemical constituents that they would classify it as sugar.

484
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,540
But let's say you have sugar in a cane.

485
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:44,260
When that material is in the sugar cane, it's connected to mineral and water and starch.

486
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:49,660
And when the sugar is presented to market, all of those other things are stripped away.

487
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:54,940
And when you pass that refined product through the body, it doesn't only have to be sugar.

488
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,760
It could be oils.

489
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,120
It could be flowers.

490
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:04,340
When it passes through the body, the body recognizes it as a refined product and tries to compensate for its deficiency.

491
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:13,240
And it would actually then has to lose energy, let's say, or borrow from other parts of the body.

492
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:21,300
So if you have refined sugar going through the body, all of a sudden the body needs to supplement it with mineral, starch and water.

493
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,620
And that's what causes a lot of the decay and illness in the body.

494
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:33,500
Where if you have a whole sugar, it would just be considered as a sweet constituent, you know, a food, not something refined.

495
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:43,840
So this refined concept, that's why there are some sugar substitutes that are so far refined that cause so much damage.

496
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:49,720
Because they're so far over that the body needs to create so much of this other stuff to bring it to balance.

497
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:55,700
So this is just the interesting concept of anything processed.

498
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,460
But it's really the quality.

499
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:09,760
See, highly processed foods were always considered fine foods or fine products because they were considered fine.

500
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:10,920
You know, like a fine cake.

501
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:16,980
Like you make a cake out of fine cake flour and it's a very pleasurable cake versus a whole wheat, right?

502
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,640
But it doesn't mean you'll be eating cake every day.

503
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,500
Very often I run into people that say, well, I don't want to eat this meal because it's too rich.

504
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,460
And I'm like, when was the last time you had a meal like this?

505
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,100
It was two years.

506
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:31,460
Well, if you have this event, enjoy it.

507
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:34,180
You're not going to be eating like this every day.

508
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:37,180
So it won't have any health problems, you know.

509
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:44,720
Like some people, though, would decide to remove certain foods from their diet altogether.

510
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:50,100
And through an act of discipline, don't even want to partake in a single event.

511
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,340
And that's fine as well.

512
00:46:51,340 --> 00:47:00,380
But if you're not clear about why you shouldn't partake in a particular food event, by all means, if it's of quality, partake and enjoy.

513
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,820
That's what we're here for pretty much.

514
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,300
I think we've mentioned before one of the words of wisdom is to have good food, good drink, and good conversation.

515
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:14,600
So I think it would be wise to consider having a good food event.

516
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:18,620
So I want to go back to what you asked, Seth.

517
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:22,140
Please rephrase that about the flour and the grains.

518
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:34,600
Well, just how we've spoken relatively at length about how eating seasonably might be beneficial to your health and your comfort.

519
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:41,840
I've shared that orange juice is something I don't – when it's cold outside, I don't go for orange juice anymore

520
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:47,120
because it was uncomfortable. It made things worse.

521
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,760
Or tomatoes when they're not growing or bananas.

522
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:58,180
Well, and tomatoes, that's another thing that I eat year-round but not fresh.

523
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,440
Preserved.

524
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:04,500
Preserved. Turned into a sauce, cooked in oil and herbs.

525
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:19,160
But that cheese and bread, preserved tomatoes, cheese and bread, that's actually a relatively large part of my diet all the time.

526
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:24,160
And cheese is not milk, by the way. Obviously, by looking at it, it is a milk product.

527
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:24,780
Yeah.

528
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,220
But going through that, yeah.

529
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,060
Absolutely.

530
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:33,800
Absolutely. So how does bread specifically – and obviously, I myself am curious and there's probably others out there as well,

531
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:43,820
maybe at least one or two interested in how does – do grains and not, as I said, whole grain flour perhaps,

532
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:53,860
but I'm specifically talking about what has been processed in turn, refined into flour for bread or cakes or waffles or anything like that

533
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:58,160
as well as how does that fit into eating seasonally?

534
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:07,020
Oh, what's interesting about that is most grains that are consumed are no longer in the state that they were in when they were alive.

535
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:09,700
So they've changed radically.

536
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,000
Preserved in a way.

537
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,060
Yeah, exactly. Going back to the pickle, the sandwich pickle versus the cucumber.

538
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,860
It's the mildest, most evident form of alchemy, by the way.

539
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:29,820
One thing that I suggest about that is that if onions or the onion, the general class of what's considered onion and garlic,

540
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:38,860
if those vegetables or roots were difficult to grow, they would be considered an expensive delicacy.

541
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,960
Think about the transformation that they go through with heat.

542
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:48,800
Take a bite of a raw onion or raw onion and then have it cooked in fat.

543
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:56,060
And what happens to it? Caramelized white Vidalia onions are probably one of the most delicious things,

544
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:01,680
if you go that way, as a complement to many dishes, roasts and things.

545
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:08,380
The incredible transformation, it's the most evident and basic form of alchemy, is cooking an onion.

546
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:17,680
Right. Going from this offensive, sulfurized kind of presence.

547
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:23,500
Absolutely. I despise onions that are raw. I avoid them.

548
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,480
You need them to be transformed for your palate.

549
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,820
You're looking for that absolute transformation.

550
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:34,640
And that's why I always suggest if they were difficult to grow, they would be considered a delicacy.

551
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,280
You know, so again, we're taking these things for granted to some extent.

552
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:47,000
But again, with the grains, I've had fresh grain and like a wheat berry type thing.

553
00:50:47,120 --> 00:51:03,100
Right. Very delicious. But from from the objectifying, the perspective on that question would be since when have can anyone encounter a living piece of grain these days?

554
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:08,100
It's always processed or cooked or dried or milled. And you see.

555
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,180
So it's changed pretty. Rolled rolled oats are pretty common.

556
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:18,580
Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, an oat berry is is very different from from.

557
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:24,300
Yeah. So that's one of those things that go into almost into immediacy are transformed into something else.

558
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:31,240
The thing that I still can't get over is for thousands of years, bread was considered to be a daily commodity.

559
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:36,540
Like, you know, day old bread is heavily discounted, isn't it? Right. Traditionally.

560
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:46,220
But yet I in many of the shops that I go through and look at, they have breads in bags.

561
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:52,520
Yeah. And they're dated, you know, weeks out and the price doesn't change.

562
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,040
You know, that's not really bread any longer.

563
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,640
They've added. So there is such a long list of ingredients.

564
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:07,580
Calcium carbonate, which is plaster and glycol, which is antifreeze for the car.

565
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:15,880
I've noticed those ingredients. I found very expensive and I've found very inexpensive tortillas that are made without lard or aluminum.

566
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:21,460
So probably three ingredients like corn, water, flour, salt, maybe.

567
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:28,720
Yeah. Even those things tend to be made. That is a corn based or flour based flatbread again.

568
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:35,280
Yeah. I've been including consumption of tortillas right in there with bread.

569
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:40,920
I'm not a fan really of corn tortillas. I guess in chip form.

570
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:49,400
But even then, I prefer, I much prefer flour. If I'm consuming corn, I'd rather have it in bread or in, you know, kernels.

571
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,840
Or fresh corn, maybe. Absolutely.

572
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:57,440
Yeah. What's interesting about this also, there's been this aspect of gluten free.

573
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:03,580
It's like there's always some form of, I call it bioterrorism by the scientific community, by the way.

574
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,220
Bio meaning biological things that are sometimes good for you.

575
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,180
And then a decade later, they're bad for you and then they're good for you again.

576
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,180
You're being terrorized, folks, by these communities.

577
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:18,540
But nonetheless, this whole thing about gluten has to do with quality, not the gluten itself.

578
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:24,460
So, yeah, here's an hour of Uncommon Sense with the Greek and Seth Michael.

579
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,500
And we're going to touch a little bit more on food when we come back.

580
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,360
Greetings and welcome back to Uncommon Sense here with the Greek and Seth Michael.

581
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:38,100
This is hour two. And this episode perhaps is a little bit of a mishmash.

582
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:45,980
We were revisiting a little bit of some of the cooking discussion we did on the previous episode,

583
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:52,900
which would behoove anyone to listen to just to kind of maybe reconnect to the second hour.

584
00:53:53,840 --> 00:54:00,240
Absolutely. I'm here. I would like to, before we go get back into what we were just speaking about,

585
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:05,340
I would like to remind everyone that you're listening to us on American Freedom Radio.

586
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:12,380
American Freedom Radio appreciates and requires the support of its listeners as well.

587
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,600
So to find out how to help keep American Freedom Radio on the air and broadcasting

588
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:22,380
and by such assisting with the broadcast of Uncommon Radio, Uncommon Sense,

589
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:28,320
you can go to AmericanFreedomRadio.com. It's easy to figure out from there.

590
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:33,340
And if you would like to get into contact with the Greek or with myself,

591
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:38,400
you can do that easily by going to UncommonRadio.com

592
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:45,400
and following the contact link there and send an email. That's the easiest way to do it.

593
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:53,320
You can also listen to us on Ustream. There's a chat on Ustream that I try and keep an eye on there.

594
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,620
If you have any questions or want clarity, you can do that.

595
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:01,440
And it's Uncommon Radio on Ustream.

596
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:12,320
Ustream.tv forward slash channel forward slash second hyphen foundation is the channel that we broadcast on.

597
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:15,960
So yeah, I just wanted to say those few things there.

598
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,900
Cool. And speaking of clarity, I've been told in the past in private Greek,

599
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,640
man, you got some good stuff, but you really got to dumb it down.

600
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:27,100
You got to dumb it down for the people. I'm like, no, no, no, no dumbing down what we do.

601
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:32,640
We'll speak simply. We speak in a very simple way that hopefully is clear.

602
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:39,820
But I think we mentioned in the first hour, there's so many variables, cosmic censorship, the crowd mentality.

603
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,740
You know, most people that listen to things, it has to be super oversimplified

604
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:50,000
and almost they won't resonate with the concept unless it's removed from reality

605
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,300
and promotes the forming of a group.

606
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,400
You know, this is what I define as the imbecile, the average human on the planet right now.

607
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:09,260
Unfortunately, you know, fortunately, people will find out that from a creation point of view,

608
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,220
animating a spirit in a material world, you know, animals, insects, people,

609
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:19,040
and people are not animals or insects, but they're very unique as the fortunate aspect.

610
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:23,400
The unfortunate aspect is the duration of time that mankind has to go through

611
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:31,640
just to prove that this thing can, meaning spirits animated in a physical body,

612
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:39,020
can semi-automatically reproduce and conceive and keep reproducing over a long period of time to us.

613
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,960
And, you know, that's the fortunate part.

614
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:48,080
But the unfortunate part, again, is just the censorship that's on humanity at this point

615
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:51,500
where they just can't see and appreciate what's going on, which is fine.

616
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:58,400
It will be better understood as time goes on, and definitely in the future, way down the future,

617
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:02,280
it will be reckoned and realized for what it was then.

618
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:09,340
So, again, speaking clearly is important, yes, and simply is important.

619
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:16,040
But I don't think at this point, because it's called uncommon sense

620
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,860
and because there's a pursuit of accuracy and precision,

621
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:27,300
I don't think accommodating the crowd or group mentality or what's considered

622
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:31,880
concordant thinking or conventional or plausible thinking is worth doing.

623
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:38,400
But I assure anyone listening that the pursuit of speaking simply and clearly

624
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,540
is what uncommon sense is about.

625
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:46,660
Yes, absolutely. The crowd is catered to elsewhere.

626
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,700
That would be common or uncommon.

627
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:54,500
There's 166 hours around the two hours after, you know.

628
00:57:54,860 --> 00:58:00,680
In other words, we'll be on again roughly 166 or 167 hours from now again.

629
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,980
And if you want to know what the crowd mentality, the imbecile mentality is about,

630
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:10,220
well, you've got 166 hours to partake and then revisit us again in a week or so.

631
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:14,300
So to have something that is not on the crowd mentality.

632
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:17,500
But anyway, it might sound kind of harsh or arrogant, folks, but sorry,

633
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,020
that's just about being objective.

634
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:24,920
Objectivity sometimes is kind of harsh and arrogant sounding, but not meant to be so.

635
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:28,740
But speaking of harsh, we were speaking about food.

636
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:33,480
And one of the things we brought up also was just having gratitude and realizing

637
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:34,300
what's going on.

638
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,380
And the comment that I brought up was the onion,

639
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:43,240
how something could be seemingly offensive transmutes essentially into something

640
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:47,440
quite pleasant by, you know, preparing it with heat.

641
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:53,480
And we were just discussing, you know, maybe doing a little bit more about food.

642
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,280
And maybe a lot of these things are very basic.

643
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:03,080
We're not getting into anything that I hope will challenge anyone's skill level

644
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:06,360
who is already partaking with some cooking skills.

645
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:11,020
So we also mentioned, I think, the things, Seth,

646
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:15,260
which might have been a slight surprise to you was perhaps crossing over

647
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,820
and using the flatbread recipe as a noodle recipe.

648
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:19,500
Yeah.

649
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:22,580
I think that you actually mentioned that in the past,

650
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:25,300
but it's something that had slipped my memory.

651
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,040
So revisiting that.

652
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,620
Yeah, because you've got it made.

653
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:33,880
In other words, if you're looking for inspiration and you do prepare the flatbread,

654
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,800
which is the flour and some cold water and an egg and some fat,

655
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,340
and you've got a lump of dough in front of you,

656
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:45,140
well, you might be inspired to make flatbread, you know, in a pan or in the oven.

657
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:51,060
Or you might be inspired to dunk it in some boiling water and make a noodle dish.

658
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:52,540
You can go either way.

659
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:59,820
So I think that's significant for the concept of variety at this point.

660
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:00,240
Absolutely.

661
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:07,200
And it's one of those things that is readily available and easy to acquire,

662
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,280
meaning that it's affordable.

663
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:12,600
And it's fresh.

664
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,080
And it's fresh.

665
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,680
And it is even after it's made, you know,

666
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:20,220
it's one of the things that can be preserved for a few days

667
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:24,660
without losing any of its efficacy and flavor.

668
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,540
In fact, sometimes flatbread is even better the next day.

669
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,440
Yeah, after it's cooked especially.

670
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:35,420
So the other thing I was thinking mentally that I didn't bring up

671
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:39,340
was we discussed, you know, cooking various starches,

672
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,380
perhaps touched a little bit on the meat products.

673
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:45,440
But one thing that I wanted to bring up also was pot cooking.

674
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,860
You know, when you're cooking something in a pot, a stew, a soup, beans,

675
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:54,640
things like that, what's interesting is sometimes I've noticed comments

676
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,180
on people, let's say, cooking beans.

677
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:02,300
And there's a colloquial or cliche about beans giving people flatulence or gas.

678
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,300
Okay.

679
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:04,920
Well, it's not only that.

680
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,820
It could be other foods that can do that.

681
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:10,060
And typically that's the body telling you that the food is producing gas

682
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:11,980
when it shouldn't be, right?

683
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:13,740
And they're like, don't eat that again.

684
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:17,040
But here's an interesting tip that if anyone is making, preparing,

685
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:22,780
let's say, a soup or a stew or beans, right, whether they are from scratch

686
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:27,260
or canned, yes, a lot of people do partake in pre-prepared meals

687
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:29,100
that they quote-unquote reheat.

688
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:32,240
One thing I've noticed, and this is a repeated practice,

689
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:35,620
and it's for many years, but I've never really been discussing it

690
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:39,420
with people until recently, is that when you bring a pot of a liquid,

691
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,480
you know, mixture, whether it's a stew, beans, or a soup,

692
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:46,280
to a simmer or a little bit more aggressive than a simmer,

693
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:49,800
you will notice that there is a foam that develops on the top of the pot.

694
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:53,260
Skim that foam off.

695
01:01:53,400 --> 01:02:00,760
That will be removing the agents, let's say, that would promote gas or indigestion.

696
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:02,460
So I'll say it again.

697
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:09,900
Let's say you are making a vegetable soup or stew or anything, or even beans,

698
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:14,220
whether they are from scratch, fresh, or from a can,

699
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:20,060
when you bring the pot up to some heat would be considered, let's say, a simmer,

700
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:24,680
where you see, you know, a very mild boil, bubbles rising to the surface.

701
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:28,300
You'll notice that a foam accumulates on the top.

702
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,880
And sometimes it's a very mild foam, like what you would see,

703
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,600
like small soap bubble-looking kind of foam.

704
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:37,720
And sometimes if you're doing, let's say, beans from scratch that are dry,

705
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:42,460
you can have something as a very aggressive, scummy-looking foam,

706
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:46,960
almost like a sea foam that washes up on the beach and stands alone,

707
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:50,940
almost like a shaving cream consistency foam.

708
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:52,720
Remove that.

709
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:53,860
Skim it off the top.

710
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:59,400
Now, typically, if you're making a, let's say, pre-prepared dish,

711
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,140
let's say a can of beans,

712
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:07,480
and add about a quarter of a can or half a can extra liquid to it, water or broth,

713
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:12,680
and that will give you a little more leeway when you're skimming off this foam

714
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:13,860
that appears on the top.

715
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,140
And this is done traditionally.

716
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:17,400
It's never really discussed, by the way.

717
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:21,640
If anyone is ever partaking in any kind of a chefing event,

718
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,180
which would be, let's say, a finer restaurant,

719
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:29,380
the making of soups and stocks and stews were always reserved to the most skilled

720
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:32,440
in the kitchen because there was timing on when to, you know,

721
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:36,820
remove some things from the dish on its initial simmer or boil.

722
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:39,360
And I've noticed these things were never discussed,

723
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:45,120
and that's why I'm bringing them up now to perhaps save some grief from those that do food

724
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:50,640
preparation of pot dishes, meaning a stew or a soup or a bean dish.

725
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,740
Now, unfortunately,

726
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:59,320
you will not be able to induce this kind of event if you have what's called a crock pot, right,

727
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,280
these slow simmer things, which I don't like, by the way,

728
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,700
and this is a personal preference, and I'll discuss that why.

729
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:07,820
That will not get hot enough to bring up this foam,

730
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:16,120
or you won't get enough of a rolling simmer to allow the separation for you to remove the top of this off.

731
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,780
And the way you remove it, by the way, is with a good-sized spoon or ladle,

732
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,300
and you don't dunk it down into the liquid.

733
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:28,680
You just try to skim it off the top and have a pot with a handle handy next to you.

734
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:34,200
If you use a bowl or something and your finger is in the bowl while you're skimming off this hot liquid,

735
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,800
you might burn yourself, so be careful.

736
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:38,220
If you don't have an extra pot, you know,

737
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:43,780
make sure there's a towel or something around and be prepared for some spilling, you know,

738
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,580
so take precaution on that.

739
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:50,000
But I want to go back to the crock pot mention.

740
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:56,720
You will not get this type of aggressive heat, an initial reaction to create this separation,

741
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:01,720
which also you will not get, even though in what they call the States or America,

742
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:02,740
they're quite popular.

743
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:09,810
I noticed that food that's cooked in these little slow-cook electric-type things is not as flavorful

744
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:15,900
as foods that are cooked over a standard range, albeit, you know, let's say gas or such,

745
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:20,640
but even an electric one, let's say, where you can modulate or change the temperature.

746
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:22,200
And the reason why is very simple.

747
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:26,260
There seems to be a natural order through the history of mankind.

748
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:35,700
Imagine a time outside of this where you have gas or electric piped to the range, the stovetop,

749
01:05:35,820 --> 01:05:37,300
and it can be consistent.

750
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:44,680
Imagine a time where you had to manually deliver fuel to the fire, okay?

751
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:48,500
So let's say you had a pot, whether it was an indoor hearth or a campfire outside

752
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,920
or an indoor stone oven or anything.

753
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,380
You were typically burning some sort of wood or coal,

754
01:05:55,380 --> 01:06:05,440
and that fuel would eventually lose its ability to continue cooking,

755
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:08,120
so you have to introduce more fuel.

756
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:12,880
So when the fuel was introduced or the fire was initially introduced under the pot,

757
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,960
it was hot and consistent and higher in heat.

758
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:20,620
Then it would diminish, and then you would install more heat, and it would go up again.

759
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:27,200
So an inconsistent delivery of heat to a slow-cooked meal tends to yield a better flavor,

760
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:32,600
maybe because there's an expansion and contraction in the pot that releases more flavor into the liquid.

761
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:36,740
Perhaps that might be a good suggestion,

762
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:42,080
simply because if anyone is into making sauces or certain stews,

763
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:46,460
you'll notice that they almost always taste better the next day,

764
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:51,800
especially whether they were sitting on a stovetop or reheated out of the refrigerator.

765
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:55,080
As a matter of fact, I had heard there are quite a few restaurants

766
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:59,560
that pride themselves in their quality of preparing delicious dishes,

767
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:04,420
and one of the mandatory things is when they made tomato sauces and other vegetable sauces,

768
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:07,500
it was mandatory that they go into the fridge overnight

769
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:12,180
and then reheated to the patrons the next day or the clients the next day.

770
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,740
So it might have something to do with this expansion-contraction,

771
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:23,720
or it might be just that the old way of doing things yields a slightly better, more palatable product.

772
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:28,700
So again, you're not going to get that with a consistent crockpot slow heater,

773
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,640
but you will get it on the stovetop.

774
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:35,500
Again, the purpose of bringing this up and the mental note that I made

775
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:42,280
that I wanted to bring up in the first episode was these are tips that will make not only a better dish,

776
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:49,860
but maybe in this case save some grief from flatulence or being gassy.

777
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:55,280
So this also works, again, any kind of a liquid pot cooking method.

778
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:58,900
Anytime you bring it to a simmer, try to bring it up a little higher.

779
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:00,680
You'll notice a foam that develops on the top.

780
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:01,720
Skim that off.

781
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:07,340
That tends to be one of the constituents that leads to this indigestion or gas

782
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:09,800
or flatulence when people eat certain things.

783
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,460
So I just wanted to bring that up as a cooking tip,

784
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:15,819
because even though we're speaking about food and cooking,

785
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:19,200
you may not consider yourself proficient in that.

786
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:21,080
Well, you might want to investigate it,

787
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:26,180
and at least you've heard some things that are very basic that are very different,

788
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,460
even though they're very common.

789
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:31,779
We've discussed about preparing common things like various starches,

790
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:35,819
like maybe potato dishes, whether it was potatoes for a potato salad

791
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:39,359
or mashed potatoes or making a perfect rice or, again,

792
01:08:40,279 --> 01:08:46,120
skimming off any kind of a foam that develops on top of a liquid when you're doing a pot cooking.

793
01:08:46,439 --> 01:08:52,680
These are things that I believe I've seen for a long time being done but not discussed openly,

794
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:57,100
and I think that it would help anyone in any of their cooking endeavors.

795
01:08:59,020 --> 01:08:59,880
And there you go.

796
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:05,520
I think I don't have any other mental notes on what I wanted to bring up regarding the food,

797
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:09,740
but that was just maybe about 15 minutes of this hour just to recap,

798
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:14,540
I guess, 15 minutes in the last hour and the previous episode.

799
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:20,819
I just think that food is an important thing to consider and food prep.

800
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,620
I was muted.

801
01:09:25,859 --> 01:09:28,640
I was agreeing with you, but you couldn't hear me because I was muted.

802
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:29,100
That's fine.

803
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:29,800
Yeah.

804
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:31,220
So there you go.

805
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:36,580
And, again, just to recap on the removing skimming off the top, again,

806
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:42,380
just people get intimidated by when we brought up the concept of fear.

807
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:43,000
What is fear?

808
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:46,979
Well, if you lack skill, you're susceptible to fear, right?

809
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:52,640
So if you're not a car mechanic, you're really afraid of a car breaking down,

810
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,660
where, you know, even if you're a car mechanic, you wouldn't want it to break down,

811
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:56,820
but you'd know how to handle it.

812
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:59,020
You wouldn't be deathly afraid of it.

813
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:04,060
So there's many people that are listening, especially in the modern Western world,

814
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:05,580
that are not into cooking.

815
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:11,120
But I believe that many of the things that were said, when I say I believe, I mean, you know,

816
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:15,080
it's up to whoever is hearing it on the receiving end if they do anything with it.

817
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:20,520
Even if you're heating up a can of beans again, just, you know, how do you prepare it so it's the best,

818
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,980
making the best of what you've got.

819
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:31,500
And I feel like that was a really good endeavor on our part to delve into the food or the, you know,

820
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:38,480
cooking aspect of it for the two hours plus now that we've done, you know, the previous episode and now as well,

821
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:44,240
and especially from the feedback that I've gotten in the past week about it, even albeit minor.

822
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:51,020
And you notice we haven't gone into many of the health, what's called healthful or health aspects of it,

823
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:56,560
because I think there's been a panic in that direction.

824
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:02,280
You know, what is causing us to be sick, you know, right, kind of thing, you know.

825
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:04,880
Is it the food? Is it this? Is it that?

826
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:06,260
Well, it's all of it, you know.

827
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,380
And the thing is a robust organism can take a lot of punishment

828
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:13,600
and be very tolerant to toxins in the environment.

829
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:17,660
So those that did have the questions regarding the food and health,

830
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:22,860
I think those have been discussed over and over and over again about the seasonality of things.

831
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,920
We did bring up the process nature of things, how they do deplete in order to go back into balance.

832
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,740
So that's where the whole food aspect is more balanced.

833
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:37,320
And also the having skill and preparing it.

834
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,920
So because look, if it tastes good, you're going to feel better.

835
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:43,340
And if you feel better, then, well, you're feeling better.

836
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:50,260
But there's an aspect of the mind also where people have been weakened spiritually, meaning of the mind.

837
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:52,760
And of course, if you when I say spiritually right away,

838
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,740
people go to a lot of the new age bullshit talk that you hear,

839
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:00,520
and also a lot of the conventional religions of the world.

840
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,740
Those are there to weaken you, folks.

841
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:06,540
And the reason I'm saying that is because, again, like we've always said,

842
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:11,220
there's none of these groups are doing anything that's in the text that they allegedly subscribe to.

843
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:13,820
And I've also caught in flag from saying people we don't Greek.

844
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:16,700
We don't need text to know this stuff. Oh, really?

845
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,740
Okay, well, you know, go off on your own.

846
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:19,720
You're a perfect imbecile.

847
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,000
You know, find a crowd to join.

848
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:28,240
This is the this is the idea of when we discuss the crowd mentality.

849
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:33,680
People tend to have an aversion to pursuing any form of knowledge that leads to accuracy and precision

850
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:38,450
and actually can be used as something that something is founded on.

851
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:46,450
Right. So, again, the the the discussion about health, a robust organism.

852
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:47,720
You know, here's the thing.

853
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:53,520
The mental and spiritual weakness, which is the same mental and spirit or mind and spirit, has been put on people.

854
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:59,460
It's the acts of terrorism that are put on humanity by the entitled classes, meaning, you know,

855
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,580
the experts and the professionals that you're going to are terrorizing you.

856
01:13:02,820 --> 01:13:06,160
In other words, they're instilling fear and uncertainty where there shouldn't be any.

857
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:16,560
So the the how does one recommend to another being or a man or a woman to be strong and have, you know,

858
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:19,200
fortitude, you know, in their mind, in their spirit. Right.

859
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:24,240
And indirectly, the way we say this, by setting yourself apart from the rest,

860
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:29,460
because the moment you get dragged into one of these crowd mentality things or one of these cause mentalities,

861
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:36,740
not that there aren't good causes to to follow or pursue or put your energy into.

862
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:40,620
But I assure you that when you start seeing what's going on out there,

863
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:44,840
either mainstream or alternative in the causality range, it's unfounded.

864
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:48,300
You know, the idea sounds good initially, but if you look into it a little bit more,

865
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:54,020
it's drifted away from what it's supposed to be, not because I say so, but because they say so.

866
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,280
And you will say so when you investigate a little further.

867
01:13:57,240 --> 01:14:02,760
So, again, just tying back to the causality of health and people, when you bring up food,

868
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:11,940
it's really a robust and strong mechanism or organism, I should say, is resistant to disease and unhealthy

869
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:18,640
and unhealthful situations. You know, I want to bring up just because we're a little bit on the health topic.

870
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:23,900
There's a man named Wilhelm Reich and a lot of he's very misunderstood and mispromoted, by the way,

871
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:28,760
in the alternative media and on the Internet. But if you study his work, what he had written,

872
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:36,660
he basically got into a lot of the non measurable or difficult or non material evident causes of things.

873
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:41,960
And he was one of the first people, let's say, in psychiatry, the field of psychiatry,

874
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:48,880
to discuss that emotional state is very important for physical well-being.

875
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:55,500
And that basically has become main mainstream since maybe 20 or 30 years now,

876
01:14:55,580 --> 01:15:01,440
where people who were physically ill all the way from mild illness to, let's say, cancers,

877
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:06,060
were asked to consider their stress level. Right. This is mainstream.

878
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:11,460
And this was not even considered back in the days of Wilhelm Reich.

879
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:18,860
And the reason I'm bringing him up is because I'm tying this up with the concept of if the mind is strong,

880
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:24,300
then the body can be strong and a strong organism. It would be more resistant, let's say.

881
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:28,520
To disease and discomfort and other illnesses.

882
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:34,700
So, again, just to round about recap, we've been talking about food and food preparation

883
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:39,040
and a little bit of wisdom, good food, good drink, good conversation.

884
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:45,060
Ecclesiastes, read Ecclesiastes people. Yeah.

885
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:51,320
And anyone who is interested in scripture at all, I recommend start there,

886
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:57,320
even if you're just reading what is readily available in the closest book to you that has it in there.

887
01:15:57,860 --> 01:16:00,280
And you might understand some of it. Right. Yeah.

888
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:05,120
The reason, by the way, I never recommend people read these ancient texts

889
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:07,940
because it's almost like setting them off on a futile mission.

890
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:12,860
They typically never understand anything in there. Typically. And I mean at all.

891
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:17,760
There's a lot of repetition in Ecclesiastes as well.

892
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:26,040
It's like it could be summarized in probably two sentences, but it's.

893
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:29,720
Yeah. So read, read Ecclesiastes. I pulled.

894
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:34,940
We've been speaking of food and drink and it always brings to mind that book.

895
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:40,420
There's a typical there's a message that I've gotten repeatedly from several individuals about saying,

896
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:43,120
should we stay away from the New Testament, just read the Old Testament?

897
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:46,480
Well, I just want to get into that just for a moment here.

898
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,620
Either way, here's the thing. There's a progression.

899
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:54,900
It's if that's why I'll use the term Christianity.

900
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:59,700
So it's really when you say Christianity, by the way, that is a secular term.

901
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:02,040
People kind of brand it with a religion.

902
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:09,940
But if you look in the secular historical nature of recordation, this is known as the Christian era worldwide.

903
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,480
OK, so it's also beyond it just shows you the state of man.

904
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,160
So if you if you shouldn't say we should blame it on that.

905
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:20,900
But, you know, you could you could and be justified.

906
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:23,000
But here's the thing.

907
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:31,280
Most of the quote unquote Christians or Christian era markings are that quotes and cliches and things gotten out of the New Testament.

908
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:34,480
And is that good? Well, it can be.

909
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:36,020
But I'll tell you why it's not.

910
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:46,660
When you've progressed that far down into the text, it the New Testament lightly refers to things that were gone into heavy detail in the Old Testament, let's say.

911
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:55,720
And if you don't know those details or have the maturity to comprehend that you're way down the line, you will not get anything out of it.

912
01:17:55,780 --> 01:18:00,160
And if you don't believe that, just look at what's going around you and have a conversation with a Christian, by the way.

913
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,320
But here's the point.

914
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:16,080
The metaphor to this is by the time you get further down the text, since it's cumulative, it will consider it just as a metaphor, college level physics.

915
01:18:17,260 --> 01:18:23,980
So if you have no knowledge of the biblical text and you and you are only talking about the New Testament or study it on your own,

916
01:18:23,980 --> 01:18:33,180
it is no different than getting a someone who is a kindergartner and putting them into college level physics.

917
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:39,820
And, you know, after a day, an hour or a whole semester of of this, you ask them, do you have any questions?

918
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:43,160
And they raise their hand and they say, yeah. Do you have any candy?

919
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:51,340
Right. And if and if you don't think this is going on with Christianity, have a conversation with a Christian regarding the biblical text.

920
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:57,100
It is that asteroid. They know nothing. And the reason why I'm not knocking them,

921
01:18:57,180 --> 01:19:04,780
I'm just saying that if you are, let's say, consider yourself to be Christian and you do study the biblical text holistically,

922
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:14,480
you will not consider yourself Christian at the end of the day after your study or Jewish or Muslim with the Koran or in the Hindu or Buddhist or whatever.

923
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:22,760
And this goes back to stating that there is no religion on the planet that is doing anything in the text that they allegedly subscribe to

924
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:29,020
or any of the things that it was supposedly based on. It's kind of like the money, how it's fiat based on nothing.

925
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:35,280
Some people like to say it's based on debt. So if we're going to carry that over to the religious matters, what kind of a debt are they creating?

926
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:41,320
This is not one particular religion, folks. This is all the religions are like this and all of their followers.

927
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:47,360
So beware of people that profess a certain faith, by the way, publicly or privately,

928
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:53,660
because if you are one of these people that pursue things known as knowledge and truth and accuracy,

929
01:19:55,300 --> 01:19:58,780
if someone proclaims a particular faith, regardless of its Eastern or Western,

930
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:04,580
go ahead and do like a 10 minute study on the faith that they're professing or their religion,

931
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:13,580
and you'll come back and realize they know nothing. It's just one of the most phenomenal things of the state of mankind at the moment.

932
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:21,580
It's just it's just pathetic, really. But anyway, let's let's keep the conversation lively.

933
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:29,480
Or a question from a question from chat. Does eating the muck foam harm the body?

934
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:34,760
Talking about the beans. I just saw it in chat. So I wanted to. Oh, cool. Define harm.

935
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:41,160
I would say you would if you're here's the thing. When I started speaking about it,

936
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:47,320
it was attached to the concept of being gassy or having some indigestion or having flatulence.

937
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:55,160
Let's say being uncomfortable. Yeah. So if you're one of these person, people that are super tolerant of things,

938
01:20:55,160 --> 01:21:02,060
you may not know or it may not matter. But the thing is, if it does appear in preparation, skim it off.

939
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:07,060
And not only will the food taste better, it will digest more readily. Right.

940
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:13,420
Many people I've noticed that don't know about this, stir it back down or just leave it alone.

941
01:21:13,540 --> 01:21:21,160
And then after, you know, something like a pot, a stovetop pot cooking dish over a matter of time,

942
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:26,260
it will dissolve back into the liquid, you see. So you want to remove it on the initial simmer or initial boil.

943
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:35,560
Will it harm? I don't think harm is the term to use, but it will not yield a fine or better product if you if you don't do it.

944
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:42,100
And again, I've shown this to people, you know, just camping, you know, where, you know,

945
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:46,240
you're in the most rudimentary, inconvenient conditions typically when you're camping.

946
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:52,940
And they would, let's say, open some cans of beans or even have sometimes had soaked beans for the day.

947
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:59,280
And when they're cooking them, let's say in the evening, I just walked over there and started skimming all the top off.

948
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:03,840
And they one person once got upset. They were like, why are you doing that? You know, so you're wasting the food.

949
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:07,420
I'm like, no, actually, this is going to yield a better dish. And they all agreed.

950
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:15,900
Because the last time I was also told that the individual who had, let's say, resisted skimming it off,

951
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:18,940
they didn't like eating their cooking because it always gave them gas.

952
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:23,700
And this was the first time this person had prepared something that did not give them gas.

953
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:33,540
And lo and behold, see, so it's a matter of comfort or just a better quality preparation.

954
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:39,340
This also works with like chicken soups, preparing, let's say,

955
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:43,520
if anyone has ever experienced a Vietnamese dish called pho.

956
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:49,660
Pho is how it's pronounced in Vietnamese. It's spelled P-H-O or pho, typically,

957
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:56,400
as Westerners, but in Vietnamese, it would be pronounced pho, is a bone marrow soup.

958
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:01,940
And that develops quite a bit of a scummy foam, meaning a very robust foam,

959
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:08,120
almost like a whipped cream type consistency that floats on top of the pot that should absolutely be removed.

960
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:12,980
Now, if you're doing a soup that's been or something that's been treated with spices and herbs,

961
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:17,940
you'll notice they will also float to the top and you will lose them when you remove the,

962
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:24,220
not lose all of them, but whatever is in that zone of skimming will be removed.

963
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:30,960
So you might want to have, you know, an extra bit of those spices or seasonings to add back in, if you so think.

964
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:37,360
But by the time, if you're using dry spices and herbs, by the time the initial simmer comes up,

965
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:43,000
most of those things have released or imbued the flavor into the pot anyway, you know, the oils and things.

966
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:48,000
So, yeah, this is something to be considered because very often, well,

967
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:51,540
once I had someone say, well, look, we're skimming off all of the oregano, you know,

968
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:54,680
and the rosemary off the top. It's okay. I'll just add some more.

969
01:23:54,680 --> 01:24:00,280
I would rather lose that little bit of seasoning and not have the foam, you see.

970
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:06,420
So try it and I'm sure maybe I'll get some feedback if there's anyone out there that's going to proceed.

971
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:13,720
But again, the feedback has been thus far, Seth, that gotten several perfect rice responses.

972
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:19,820
Yes, you did make perfect rice and several responses regarding potato dishes being absolutely delicious.

973
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:29,120
Wonderful. I haven't I haven't actually tried either of those yet, but I look forward to it.

974
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:36,440
Yeah. So we would jump from the discussing a little bit of the biblical text and the state of affairs of humanity back to food again.

975
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:41,180
So it seems it's interesting maybe maybe just a strict cooking show is in order.

976
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:43,940
That would be an interesting thing. But I think that's would be.

977
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:49,840
I wouldn't say challenging without the visual, but it can be done by just sonically.

978
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:55,580
But that's another that's another project, perhaps because there's things that could be prepared.

979
01:24:55,740 --> 01:25:02,140
There's almost an infinite amount of combinations or dishes, let's say, within the season or across latitude that can be done in any case.

980
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:07,540
Right. I mean, we do have the ability to do video on the Ustream side as well.

981
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:13,780
Yeah, we'll set up a what do they call a test kitchen or a model kitchen, that would be.

982
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:18,580
And it's not it's not near as bandwidth heavy as one might think.

983
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:26,540
I've actually successfully broadcast some some video programs without any problems.

984
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:33,020
And part of the inspiration, by the way, about doing food is when it did partake in what they call cable subscription.

985
01:25:33,020 --> 01:25:41,180
There is a plethora of food channel, food shows, food, even with the airwave HDTV.

986
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:46,600
Now, I think there I think it's petroleum broadcasting service or it was a PBS or whatever.

987
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:53,960
They have cooking shows. And I've been watching these for years and years, more than a decade or so.

988
01:25:54,040 --> 01:26:00,240
Not not specifically and diligently. But when I do come across them, I always I always shake the head and say,

989
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:05,680
you're not going to learn how to cook watching this stuff. They're missing so many points, you know.

990
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:09,140
And that was always kind of a point of contention.

991
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:13,240
I was like, you know, people just need to know some real basic things that they can add,

992
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:15,900
you know, repertoire of things that could add to what they already know.

993
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:20,380
And when they get good at that or make what they're making the best it can be,

994
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:23,040
even if it's a can of beans being reheated, let's say,

995
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:30,180
then they can view with confidence expanding their horizons, let's say, into more things

996
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:39,220
or perhaps giving people the ability to partake in the kitchen a little bit more with ultra simple things like the flatbread,

997
01:26:39,380 --> 01:26:41,480
which I believe you've taken to very well.

998
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:47,520
And, you know, there's some people that enjoy making rice and making a perfect recipe,

999
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:53,860
cooking the basic starches, because most of the time when cooking is involved, a starch will be involved.

1000
01:26:54,180 --> 01:27:02,320
Right. Typically. Yeah. Very rarely does anyone eat a slab of tofu or a slab of meat by itself, you know.

1001
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:08,900
Absolutely. I'm I'm fond of the things that are inexpensive as well.

1002
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,820
And the starches are inexpensive.

1003
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:16,200
Well, because they're inexpensive, you could actually seek out really a better quality.

1004
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:20,760
Yeah. Contrast. Yeah. Yeah. So you don't. Right. Because they're by nature inexpensive.

1005
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:26,620
You can spend just a little bit more and get something that is more than just marginally better, but much better.

1006
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:34,660
And, you know, same with like if you I like to eat sweet things occasionally as well.

1007
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:46,520
And I've found very, very inexpensive, minimally processed cane sugar for just a few pennies more a pound than the heavily refined, you know.

1008
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:52,440
So-called sugars. Yeah. Very bright beet sugars that are commonly available.

1009
01:27:52,740 --> 01:28:02,280
Like it's and I don't I don't eat enough of it to where, you know, a few cents more a pound is affects affects it that much.

1010
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:10,580
So it's yeah, there's it's just kind of being aware of things like that and not to mention the flavor is just significantly better.

1011
01:28:10,680 --> 01:28:16,100
You don't have to use as much of it. It's got a more of a kind of a richer flavor.

1012
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:23,840
It's not that I've kind of got a distaste for the heavily refined sugar, at least in what I'm cooking at home.

1013
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:29,920
Mm hmm. Yeah, it tends to not have a good finish to it.

1014
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:34,400
And I've explained to people before, you know, there's when you say salt, you know, well, it's salty.

1015
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:42,380
Right. You maybe use I guess how, you know, you shouldn't use the same word to define the word, you know, but let's say if salt tastes salty.

1016
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:46,200
Right. That's really difficult to to go to escape that one.

1017
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:59,780
But when I when I started mentioning that people seek out higher quality salts and like, you know, if you're used to what's called a commercial iodized salt, which is toxic, by the way, no matter what they tell you, your body needs iodine.

1018
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:07,220
It doesn't need that kind of iodine. And but then again, you know, it's part of, you know, if you're on planet Earth, you know, this is about being pranked.

1019
01:29:07,220 --> 01:29:18,100
But anyway, with salt, I mentioned to people when you start seeking out higher quality salts, whether it's the source of the salt or how it was harvested or however, seek out better quality salts.

1020
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:22,580
You will notice that when you initially encounter it on the palate, it's obviously salty.

1021
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:27,200
But and that initial quality may not be like a jolt, you know, like a buzz.

1022
01:29:27,200 --> 01:29:33,180
It might be maybe slightly more mineral like or slightly more metallic and very, very salty.

1023
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:37,220
But typically, high quality salts have a sweet finish to them.

1024
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:46,140
In other words, when you put some on your palate, let's say touch the finger on the salt, touch the palate, the tongue or on a piece of food or something.

1025
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:49,620
You'll notice the saltiness in the beginning of varying degrees.

1026
01:29:50,020 --> 01:29:55,040
And it should always have a almost like a sweetness, not not sweet like sugar.

1027
01:29:55,320 --> 01:30:00,120
But it changes again on the finish of the palate, you know, after you taste it or consume it.

1028
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:03,160
Right. That's one of the marks of a good quality salt.

1029
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:05,900
It has a complex flavor and it changes.

1030
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:17,920
And now most of the granular salts that people get in snack foods like it's typical to have a visual assault of salt on, let's say, what's called a pretzel.

1031
01:30:18,120 --> 01:30:20,020
Right. Have you ever seen salted pretzels?

1032
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:23,180
They have these crystals distributed and stuck on the surface.

1033
01:30:23,220 --> 01:30:24,680
That's like visually there.

1034
01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:27,300
Typically, you won't see salt in a dish.

1035
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:31,520
Right. I know it's not a pun, sea salt, but sea salt is one thing to pursue.

1036
01:30:31,660 --> 01:30:31,840
Right.

1037
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,840
But you won't really visual.

1038
01:30:34,740 --> 01:30:35,380
You won't do it.

1039
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:36,920
You don't know that it's there until.

1040
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:38,160
Oh, that's a very salty dish.

1041
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:38,860
It tastes salty.

1042
01:30:39,020 --> 01:30:45,580
But typically on something like a pretzel where you see the salt crystal is more of a sensation.

1043
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,960
And that's typically not a good quality salt.

1044
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:57,240
That is a good example to show the contrast of not typically not a good quality where if you do taste those salt crystals, they're just like salt from the start.

1045
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:58,260
Salt to the finish.

1046
01:30:58,300 --> 01:30:58,540
Right.

1047
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:08,180
It's kind of like some some are more mellow, some are more metallic, but it doesn't yield that sweet finish that a high quality salt would do.

1048
01:31:08,420 --> 01:31:16,540
And not to promote various salts, but typically the the there are sea salts are promoted very heavily, but it's also how they're harvested.

1049
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:23,480
There's an ionization deionization process that takes place when salts are harvested using metal, especially iron tools.

1050
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:30,940
Some of the most prestigious, let's say, best salts in the world are, let's say,

1051
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:36,960
harvested during a certain time of the year and they don't use any metal, whether it's in storage or harvest.

1052
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:41,000
And that kind of keep retains the energetic value of the salt.

1053
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:44,140
And there's the Himalayan salts, which are more, I guess, land salt.

1054
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:51,520
So if you pursue if you have just a little bit extra gumption to pursue a slightly better salt quality,

1055
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,380
you will notice that salts do taste different.

1056
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:57,860
Also, there are some salts that retain a lot of moisture and clump together.

1057
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:04,160
And it's not something that has people are used to as being convenient in a salt shaker.

1058
01:32:04,660 --> 01:32:13,220
Right. In some traditions, it's typical to put some dry grains of rice in a shaker type thing.

1059
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:16,020
If you have salt in the rice constantly absorbs the moisture.

1060
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:22,040
But if you're getting something like a Celtic sea salt, some of these are 30 to 50 dollars a pound.

1061
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:28,240
Those are very wet consistently and those are best kept in a bowl with a lid.

1062
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:33,120
And when you're going to cook or salt, you would pinch it, you know,

1063
01:32:33,140 --> 01:32:37,400
use your fingers or a wooden implement to remove and add to whatever you're adding it to.

1064
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:40,760
And might usually refer to grinding it further.

1065
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:46,500
If you have a small mortar and pestle type thing, you know, weight a pound or pulverize something finer.

1066
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:54,300
So that's the little bit of the I guess the the contrast to the sugar statement you made, Seth, about the salt.

1067
01:32:55,980 --> 01:33:00,600
I don't have the budget to spend 30 dollars a pound on it, certainly.

1068
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:04,800
But, you know, here's the thing. You might be able to get a small package for like five.

1069
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:07,720
Right. And that will last you about six months.

1070
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:11,360
So it might be worth it again. Yeah, absolutely.

1071
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:17,000
Yeah. And it's the labor that goes into it of maintaining its quality.

1072
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:21,960
You know, the handling of food, by the way, changes its quality to the palate as well.

1073
01:33:22,780 --> 01:33:28,940
So, yeah, very important on that aspect. But, yeah, we were sort of drifted away again.

1074
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:35,680
But the food is, again, very important, not necessarily because we did bring up some other subject there.

1075
01:33:35,680 --> 01:33:40,180
We talked a little bit about the crowd and a little bit of, I guess, a biblical reference,

1076
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,760
understanding or comprehending a lot of these ancient texts.

1077
01:33:43,880 --> 01:33:50,280
But there is going to come a time where things will be comprehended a little bit better and a pursuit of quality also will be there.

1078
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:55,500
You know, just to bounce around a little bit more, Seth, you know, before we started the show,

1079
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:59,100
I kind of went on the Internet and looked at the news, world news.

1080
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:01,800
I just typed in world news and looked at what was being offered.

1081
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:04,900
And if anyone wants to do that right now, it's the end of spring.

1082
01:34:04,900 --> 01:34:07,360
You'll see it's very quiet still.

1083
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:12,520
There's just a ridiculousness, you know, like some boat turned over, an American tourist in Thailand.

1084
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:18,880
And, you know, someone lost a toenail on some highway and, you know, just ridiculous stuff.

1085
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:22,960
There's something about an election, just absurdities.

1086
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:28,280
Yeah. But nonetheless, it's still a quiet period.

1087
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:35,960
And so seasonally, I just wanted to bring that up because we do discuss these culturally based matters.

1088
01:34:36,820 --> 01:34:39,360
I just find that to be very reassuring.

1089
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:44,360
Absolutely.

1090
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:50,920
Yeah. And, you know, upside down the other side of the planet, they're going into the opposite season.

1091
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:56,900
So which would be winter, I guess, which would be harvest for them.

1092
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:01,940
Yeah. Here it has actually been very spring like.

1093
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:13,500
The where I'm, you know, where I'm at, the seasons tend to change rather harshly and dramatically with maybe a couple,

1094
01:35:14,040 --> 01:35:20,640
three or four weeks of what would be what would feel and look like fall between the summer and the winter.

1095
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,800
And, you know, just a few weeks of spring as well.

1096
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:29,380
And over the past couple of months, it's actually been relatively pleasant and in between.

1097
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:34,140
You know, so that's lots and lots of rain as well.

1098
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:38,160
Probably more than is normally useful or normal.

1099
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:42,740
Yeah, certainly. I have certainly more than it's been over the last few years.

1100
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:46,180
But I'm someone who is very fond of rain.

1101
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:49,080
So I've been enjoying it more than some, I suppose.

1102
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:51,420
All the flowers have to grow.

1103
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:52,500
Yeah, absolutely.

1104
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:58,660
One of these days we'll discuss more on the on the concepts of weather.

1105
01:35:59,140 --> 01:36:01,240
One of these days, perhaps, maybe not.

1106
01:36:02,240 --> 01:36:08,860
But, you know, what's interesting is the states, America, let's say, and specifically the states,

1107
01:36:08,940 --> 01:36:11,240
the central part is very unique in the world.

1108
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:19,180
You know, guys, by the way, 75 percent of all tornadoes that occur on the planet occur there or, you know, in other areas.

1109
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:21,520
So it's a very interesting phenomenon.

1110
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:23,800
And this is on a planet. It's unique to the planet.

1111
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:25,720
Very interesting.

1112
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:37,220
Coincidences, physical coincidences and ethereal coincidences that lend to the weather patterns that you that are witnessed in the plains of what's called America.

1113
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:46,900
You know, the tumultuous weather, I guess, of, you know, tornadoes and things like that and bad storms and perhaps even hurricanes and such.

1114
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:52,040
Yeah. So but again, I guess the weather we may not.

1115
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:56,900
But I assure you, folks, what you're being told about it is not accurate, but it's accepted.

1116
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:00,520
You know, weather is not thermodynamic, as as explained.

1117
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:08,000
And, yeah, it's one of these things that I think mankind is not ready to discuss openly,

1118
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:13,080
even though there tend to be a lot of venues, especially in alternative media and mainstream.

1119
01:37:13,080 --> 01:37:19,400
Believe it, believe it or not, where they do speak of what's called weather engineering and such.

1120
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:25,740
And I assure you, most of it is misunderstood, if not completely misunderstood and not applicable to what's going on.

1121
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:35,080
But, yeah, I think the weather bears its own discussion because it's the same type of forces that allow you to stand up from your chair and walk across the room.

1122
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:38,220
If you're able to do that, that is powering the weather.

1123
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:39,380
It is not thermodynamic.

1124
01:37:39,540 --> 01:37:42,100
Thermodynamic is just secondary aspect of it.

1125
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:45,660
So, you know, the weather might be an interesting thing.

1126
01:37:45,960 --> 01:38:01,320
And I did have I did a. On AFR, I guest hosted a few years ago and I had as a as a guest, Trevor James Constable for two hours.

1127
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,880
And I don't have that archive.

1128
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:11,360
But I think that was a very interesting interview who has since passed away about two months now at about 90.

1129
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:16,300
So everyone's I did not realize that that had happened.

1130
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:21,740
Yeah. And what they call by the Pope's work schedule, March 31st, I believe so.

1131
01:38:22,920 --> 01:38:25,980
Right. Yeah. He should have been a household name. But either way.

1132
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:29,700
Yeah. Everyone's talking about the weather. When is someone going to do something about it? Right.

1133
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:33,760
That's I think Mark Twain, Samuel Clemens.

1134
01:38:35,180 --> 01:38:39,340
But yeah, hopefully, you know, again, based on the feedback we've gotten,

1135
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:42,540
I kind of feel good about discussing the food and the cooking aspect.

1136
01:38:43,380 --> 01:38:50,220
Typically, when you come to uncommon sense, we will be discussing things uncommon or maybe an uncommon approach on things.

1137
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:54,940
And the very in you will be a lot of repetition for several reasons.

1138
01:38:54,940 --> 01:39:00,320
One is there might be someone new, there might be a fifth listener or sixth listener.

1139
01:39:00,780 --> 01:39:04,940
The other thing is typically the people that do adhere to listening to the side,

1140
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:08,640
the sonic event, a repetitious of their questions.

1141
01:39:09,220 --> 01:39:12,900
So perhaps maybe we should be repetition on the statements and answers.

1142
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,940
So I don't find the repetition to be, let's say, wrote per se.

1143
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:19,400
But it's almost like an indirect necessity.

1144
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:23,640
It's I think like you mentioned earlier, Seth, when you read a lot of the ancient texts,

1145
01:39:23,640 --> 01:39:26,680
especially the biblical texts, there is a lot of repetition.

1146
01:39:26,940 --> 01:39:29,260
So there's something to be found through it.

1147
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:33,620
Yeah, I'd recommend paying attention to that repetition as well.

1148
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:37,140
Yes, it's because it's not always the same.

1149
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:41,580
Seemingly, seemingly think something is repeating, but it's just slightly different.

1150
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:46,200
That adds a little bit more nuance or a little more information and more clarity.

1151
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:49,400
Yeah, it's kind of important.

1152
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:50,580
Like I wouldn't be surprised.

1153
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:54,800
Like we'd like to keep all projects must come to an end.

1154
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:55,780
Limited here.

1155
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,500
I think when the next few episodes we might start, if not the next episode,

1156
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:09,620
start revisiting some of the topics that were discussed in the previous sonic experience called Ocelli and the Greek.

1157
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:13,220
If it's all right with you, Seth, we could perhaps even since they do exist,

1158
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:24,220
maybe do an outline and you and I can in private refer to it and discuss perhaps offline or off air what can be revisited,

1159
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:27,120
maybe filling in a little bit more because I have gotten a lot of.

1160
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:28,600
Absolutely.

1161
01:40:29,020 --> 01:40:35,360
That's and I would like to go through and review those myself, because even even as I listen,

1162
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:40,740
you know, there are questions and comments that I would like to throw in there.

1163
01:40:40,740 --> 01:40:43,740
So I'm I'm certainly not opposed to that idea.

1164
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:46,820
Doing it like that. Yeah.

1165
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:50,500
Yeah. Because there's things that were brought up like, you know, how the body works.

1166
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:56,720
Not because I say so, but because if you listen to what's being said, you will say so.

1167
01:40:57,220 --> 01:41:01,920
And it's this is not some crowd oversimplified, ridiculous idea.

1168
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:10,000
This is just using the faculties in your own perception and rational thought, whether it's what to eat,

1169
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,420
how to keep time, we've discussed.

1170
01:41:12,540 --> 01:41:20,420
We've discussed various mildly political things known as the foundation of, let's say,

1171
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:28,920
the states known as the Constitution of their laws pretty much discussed the condition of humanity.

1172
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:31,460
I call it the dummy load. They're being dummy loaded.

1173
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:34,260
That's pretty much like the hamster wheel or running on a treadmill.

1174
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:37,980
A lot of energy being expended, but nothing really going anywhere.

1175
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:40,420
Just, you know, events occurring.

1176
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:41,980
So time can pass. Right.

1177
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:51,000
Many of these things in that respect that were brought up on the previous sonic show, let's say,

1178
01:41:51,140 --> 01:41:54,840
was commented on, questioned on.

1179
01:41:55,160 --> 01:41:57,460
Perhaps some of the comments were this is excellent.

1180
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:03,180
Some of the comments were this is you start on a point and then I would like to have heard more on it.

1181
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:08,740
So maybe that will be the aspect that we will rely on.

1182
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:11,260
How about just a little bit more filling in?

1183
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:13,140
We discussed what dreams are.

1184
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:16,100
The education system.

1185
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:25,120
Those are things that could easily be expanded on because even if you spoke on those things for eight hours a day,

1186
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:27,440
you would never run out of things to discuss.

1187
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:28,740
Absolutely.

1188
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:33,040
The nature of the gods also we bring up.

1189
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:34,300
And yes, it's gods, folks.

1190
01:42:34,400 --> 01:42:34,700
Sorry.

1191
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:37,120
It doesn't matter what you believe in.

1192
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:40,400
Your faith means absolutely nothing when it comes to the gods.

1193
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:47,680
And within the realm of that spiritual realm, there is a hierarchy.

1194
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:58,120
And the level of idiocy on the planet right now referring to a god meaning God or not God or whatever is just ridiculous.

1195
01:42:58,700 --> 01:43:08,460
There is an entire realm there and it is far more, I would say, in contrast, complex and evolved than the material realm that we see,

1196
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:13,320
but not unlike it in the way we, meaning humans, have set many things up.

1197
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:21,380
The hierarchy in your military, the hierarchy in society, the forms of exchange, the forms of thought and things are very similar.

1198
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:23,880
And it's not because I say it.

1199
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:33,440
It's because we're adhering to things that have been more memorialized from the past and looking at them and seeing if they're a good report or not.

1200
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:34,500
And that's another thing.

1201
01:43:37,160 --> 01:43:47,400
People on, let's say, this base level of opinion that they have failed to this point to be able to discern what's a good report and what's not.

1202
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:53,260
How many times have you heard, Seth, people bring up, well, that doesn't resonate with me.

1203
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:02,760
So that means the opposite of resonance would be dissonance.

1204
01:44:03,460 --> 01:44:10,900
Something as a psychiatric term or psychological term called, what is it, cognitive dissonance.

1205
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:16,440
When you hear something that is not in accord with what's previously been heard, it's rejected, let's say.

1206
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:19,980
Here's the interesting concept.

1207
01:44:20,220 --> 01:44:28,860
What if people have been bred for a very long time and through their culture and traditions to only resonate with untruths and inaccuracy?

1208
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:35,040
The minute they come across accuracy or truth, it doesn't resonate with them.

1209
01:44:35,140 --> 01:44:37,320
In other words, yeah, it's opposite.

1210
01:44:39,140 --> 01:44:41,520
Yeah, that would certainly explain quite a bit.

1211
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:44,080
Yeah, but it's the most basic thing.

1212
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:52,380
So the thing is also there is something called we are modern, we are advanced, right?

1213
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:54,640
Yeah.

1214
01:44:54,840 --> 01:45:02,880
So everyone that came before, especially if they've gone through efforts to memorialize a good report, see, they're ignorant and primitive.

1215
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:04,720
You see, they didn't have the Internet, right?

1216
01:45:05,180 --> 01:45:07,280
They didn't have automobiles or airplanes.

1217
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:11,400
So we have to discount everything from them.

1218
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:12,920
They're just primitive, stupid people.

1219
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:18,060
The interesting thing, this is the general consensus, by the way, of humanity at this point.

1220
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:24,400
And those that do adhere to some kind of, let's say, quote, unquote, religious faith or whatever, again, very simple.

1221
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:31,200
It's got nothing to do with the text that it's allegedly subscribed to, to that faith or religion.

1222
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:37,200
And if you don't believe that, have a conversation with someone who claims to be faithful in any particular discipline or religion,

1223
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:40,100
and you'll see exactly what we're saying here.

1224
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:45,180
And it just boggles the mind that it is on such a vast level.

1225
01:45:45,700 --> 01:45:51,000
The third word, the third word in the text, the third word.

1226
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:56,720
I'll tell you, the two major religions, Islam and Christianity,

1227
01:45:56,720 --> 01:46:01,180
if you back up a Christian into saying, like, why aren't you doing what's in the text?

1228
01:46:01,260 --> 01:46:03,960
Actually, what you're doing is in the don't do list.

1229
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:09,840
Nine out of ten times, if not always, what they do is they start discrediting the text.

1230
01:46:11,800 --> 01:46:14,580
No matter how faithful they are, they say, well, who wrote that anyway?

1231
01:46:14,780 --> 01:46:17,700
Who cares? I could believe without knowing any of that.

1232
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:19,400
They discredit the text.

1233
01:46:19,940 --> 01:46:24,920
In Islam, what they do is they say, well, that can't be in the text because the Koran was written to be simple.

1234
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:27,900
And what you're saying is not simple, so it can't be there.

1235
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:29,540
And they refuse to look at the text.

1236
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:32,720
So people are so predictable.

1237
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:35,760
Yes, and you can judge a book by its cover, folks.

1238
01:46:35,800 --> 01:46:40,980
If someone dropped a thick book with a yellow cover at your feet, guess what?

1239
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:42,760
That's a telephone book.

1240
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:45,320
Very easy to recognize.

1241
01:46:46,180 --> 01:46:49,820
So the people that are on this planet right now that are adhering to these religions,

1242
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:56,200
also these societies now formed in legal society, scientific society, medical society are also religions.

1243
01:46:56,920 --> 01:47:03,280
They don't know anything about what it's supposed to be based on, just like economists don't know anything about money.

1244
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:05,800
It's the strangest thing.

1245
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:12,780
And this is something that is repeatedly brought up as an issue on uncommon sense because it's prevalent.

1246
01:47:13,180 --> 01:47:14,480
And I mean prevalent.

1247
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,620
It's everywhere.

1248
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:17,840
And it's fascinating at the same time.

1249
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:26,600
It is fascinating and simple.

1250
01:47:27,260 --> 01:47:28,840
It is relatively simple.

1251
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:31,660
There's a lot of it.

1252
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:37,920
A lot of something simple could be viewed as something complex, I suppose, but that's not really the case.

1253
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:42,580
You've got to understand, like we've said, who you are, where you are, and when you are.

1254
01:47:42,580 --> 01:47:51,320
That's like the three-part formula to getting a good roundabout idea so you could relax and look at things objectively.

1255
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:56,880
So with that said, we just did another episode of Uncommon Sense.

1256
01:47:57,700 --> 01:48:00,560
And this is kind of a mixed bag of stuff.

1257
01:48:01,180 --> 01:48:02,340
Hope you folks enjoyed it.

1258
01:48:02,480 --> 01:48:05,900
And we'll see you guys again in about 166 hours.

1259
01:48:07,340 --> 01:48:08,220
So again, thanks, Seth.

1260
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:09,760
Thank you.
