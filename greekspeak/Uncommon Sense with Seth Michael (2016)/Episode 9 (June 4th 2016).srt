00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,050
Welcome to Uncommon Sense here on American Freedom Radio.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,590
I am Seth Michael and I'm joined by the Greek. Welcome, Greek.

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:18,310
Thank you, Seth. Greetings, everyone. And you can find us also at www.uncommonradio.com.

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,550
I think I got it right. And that's an easy way also to go and follow the links for listening

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,550
for archives and such. But yes, we are on American Freedom Radio, which is a

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,810
listener funded allegedly site. It would be good if some listeners did help fund it.

7
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:38,770
And you know how to do that if you can, if you will, if you do go to the homepage,

8
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:45,370
you will be instructed somehow electronically to do that. So yeah, with that out of the way,

9
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:51,770
greetings, everyone again. And yes, I just wanted to bring up, I think we brought up before we

10
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,850
started up perhaps to be talking a little bit about food again, just slightly. It's been

11
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,210
quite a role on that. I think it's been successful on the feedback, especially people

12
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:06,950
having success performing the suggestions. And the reason I wanted to just do a little

13
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:13,450
bit of food talk was recently someone suggested that they were happy to find a part of their

14
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:20,010
percolator, meaning coffee percolator. And one of the replies I made, that's a perfect way to ruin

15
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:27,930
good coffee. So perhaps we'd be discussing a little bit about how to make a simple good coffee.

16
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:34,250
And I know you have a place in your desires to have such a thing, Seth, as well.

17
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:35,870
Oh, yeah, certainly.

18
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:41,970
And there's so many ways, but the easiest thing, folks, is don't kill it with over brewing and

19
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,390
the water temperature being too hot. The hotter the water temperature, the shorter the contact

20
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:53,270
with the coffee. Would you say that's the simplest suggestion for always having a good cup or good pot?

21
00:01:54,110 --> 00:02:01,130
Yeah, absolutely. And you can find, you know, inexpensive or relatively inexpensive machines

22
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:07,229
that will actually do those two things. They don't get too hot. They heat things up to the

23
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:09,210
proper temperature, things like that. Yeah.

24
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:13,970
Yeah. So in other words, folks, the lower the temperature of the water,

25
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,910
the more dwell time over the grounds and the grounds can be coarse or fine. Again, it gets

26
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:26,310
technical. Absolutely. You can make really good coffee without a machine at all, just with a

27
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,210
jar with an airtight lid, you know, without without any heat.

28
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,370
But because it takes more time to get more time.

29
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:39,010
Exactly. So the hotter the water, the less the time. That's why the espressos work so quickly.

30
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,590
Because they're very high in temperature now. Unfortunately, still, what I found is the average

31
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:53,810
coffee maker slash whatever electric plug in the wall, convenient, typical Western world or American,

32
00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:00,850
I should say, doesn't mind the water temperature that much. I find that they run the water

33
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:07,570
through an aluminum coil that brings it to a boiling point, if not beyond, and then dwells

34
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,630
on the filter cone and such. And you end up ruining good coffee that way.

35
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:17,650
Now, mind you, many commercial pre ground coffees are blended with chicory and

36
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,730
other things or whatever, let's just say, and to make it more forgiving. But if you have some good

37
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,250
coffee and you do grind it yourself, and if you want to go to the next level, roast it yourself,

38
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,470
the hotter the water, the less dwell time. And I would say that would also go with tea.

39
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:42,490
Now, teas get very complex, because some teas can be as expensive as silver.

40
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:48,970
Believe it or not, I was in a major city a while back on the East Coast, and there was a tea

41
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:57,170
purveyor. And it was like walking into an armory. They had to buzz you into the door to get into the

42
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:02,730
shop and then buzz you in to look at the teas with security guards. I found out they had teas

43
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:09,430
there that were more than 20 bucks an ounce, if not even higher than that, maybe three, four times

44
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:18,089
that. So that gets into a whole other subject. But making a proper cup of tea depends on what you're

45
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:26,450
brewing as a tea as well, whether it's a leaf, if it's a cured leaf, if it's fermented, if it's a

46
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:34,730
root-based tea. But again, consider the water temperature and what is suggested for the particular

47
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:41,250
thing you're trying to brew. But essentially, again, to making a good cup of coffee, or as we say,

48
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:48,130
the higher the water temperature, the less dwell time. So cowboy coffee still works,

49
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:54,970
but just make it really, really quick. Anything else on that coffee venture stuff? I know we could

50
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,470
spend not just one show, but two shows based on the amount of time you and I have spent in private

51
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:08,870
discussing making coffee. Yeah, coffee is easily relatable. I bet there are 20 people out there

52
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:17,210
listening. Yes. It's one of those things that if you know how to say coffee, you can say it in just

53
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:27,870
about 150 languages, by the way. Yeah. Right. Cafe. Yeah. Cup fee in Korean, right? They throw

54
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:35,810
in Vietnamese, it'll be cup fee. But still, if you say anything that resembles a C, a vowel, an F,

55
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:44,770
and a vowel, you got it anywhere in the world. Absolutely. What would you say? I drink just

56
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:53,290
regular black tea, but I don't know that we've ever... Yeah, that's a dried... You know,

57
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,170
it's interesting that the green tea and the black tea are typically very similar. It's the same leaf,

58
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:04,410
let's say, or similar. And one is air dried through time that makes it black, but when it's

59
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:11,270
dried with heat, it retains its green color. You would think the opposite, right? Intuitively. I

60
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:17,390
was amazed to find that out. Because typically when we apply heat to something, it browns it,

61
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,250
right? You throw some toast in the fire or near heat or anything that you... That golden brown,

62
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:30,570
we refer to heating. But we found out most leaf teas that are heated to be dried retain their

63
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:39,990
green color. So the black teas would be, I guess, yeah, the same. Most of the teas are...

64
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,530
There's black tea, like you say, that's the typical tea. And then there are many varieties,

65
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:51,430
which are blends like an Earl Grey and things like that, right? But most of the teas that people do

66
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:58,750
order or make are of that variety. So again, hotter the water, the less dwell time. I'm not

67
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,010
a big fan of leaving what they call these convenient items called tea bags, you know,

68
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:11,930
and things in pots. Typically in many Asian cultures, the tea leaves are bulk fitted or

69
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:17,790
placed into a kettle and they sink to the bottom, but they use a very small amount.

70
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,090
So I don't want to maybe get into the teas too much because we might have some

71
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:29,450
acquaintances in the UK that are really going to get upset if we start talking about how to make tea.

72
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,350
So kind of a joke there. But speaking of that, there's always comments, you know,

73
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,570
I'm being political, correct, Seth? I'll just kind of bounce around a little bit.

74
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,870
And someone in the chat put something about no feminism or blending or something. I thought that

75
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:52,170
was interesting. And then the Greek side came up, you know, I said, oh, yes, Greece, where the men

76
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:57,850
are men, the women look like men and the sheep are scared. But there's something now that's going

77
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:03,630
on, which is interesting, this tyranny of the political or politico about being politically

78
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:10,130
correct. Of course, it's for the non-discerning, you know, the crowd mentality. You know, they

79
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:15,170
latch on to it has to be something super simple. And whenever something is brought up that is no

80
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:21,510
longer politically correct, they look at it as if it's a law or, you know, religious connotation.

81
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,690
You know, that's not politically correct, you know, but that's the crowd. And we keep bringing

82
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:31,090
up Gustave Le Bon's The Crowd, and I'm not promoting the book. But many people have said

83
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,909
they've gone out and gotten it. And good for you, at least you'll be able to rationalize what's going

84
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:42,030
on around you. But this thing about political correctness now, you know, things like, Seth,

85
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,950
I think we might have brought it up once, maybe we'll do it for the audience. Have you heard of

86
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,110
Winston Churchill's? I believe it's Winston Churchill's version of heaven and hell in

87
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:56,870
Europe. We discussed that ever, I think might have brought up in passing, but perhaps in passing,

88
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:02,850
but yeah, that's that wouldn't be politically correct anymore. But it's so true based on the

89
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:10,450
cultural inclination, you know, each culture is inclined to perform things a certain way,

90
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,830
right? Traditions, things like that, right? Training, education, right? Culture, right?

91
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:20,790
Well, it's just interesting to bring it up, just because this is not things like this will never

92
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:26,910
be discussed anymore, at least in the in the mindset right now. But okay, so heaven in Europe,

93
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,530
all right, would be where the British are the police, the French are the cooks,

94
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,850
the Germans are the mechanics, the Italians are the lovers, and the Swiss are the bankers.

95
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:41,590
Hell in Europe would be if the British were the cooks, the French were the mechanics,

96
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:47,170
the Germans were the police, the Italians were the bankers, and the Swiss were the lovers.

97
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,510
So I thought I'd bring this up, because it also reflects a different mindset, which now would tend

98
00:09:52,510 --> 00:10:01,770
to be radically uncommon, I would say, you know, racial jokes, feminist jokes, things like that,

99
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:08,250
that people that grew up in the 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s or so were pretty much,

100
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:14,710
how would you say, immersed in, have now gone away, not that they're good.

101
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:21,090
I'm not saying that they are good to do those types of dwell on those types of comments. But

102
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:28,270
it's interesting how the instead of addressing what was said as being right or wrong or lawful,

103
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:35,710
now things are addressed as being political or unpolitically correct. So I just find that to be

104
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:44,580
very obtuse and common, so. Absolutely. It seems that,

105
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,500
yeah, everyone is concerned with offending others. Yeah, well, here's the thing, you know,

106
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:56,300
once I've said that if you took the current events and put it in a time capsule, went back in time

107
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:02,300
50 years, everyone would stop at what they're doing. I mean, everyone and well, let's say

108
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:08,700
statistically, and most of everyone would say, we have to stop what we're doing. So these things

109
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:17,040
don't happen. Right. And you want to call it the frog being boiled in the pot, the gradual,

110
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:23,520
yeah, it's possible. But that is another discussion, in a sense, because if you are

111
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:30,220
living lawfully and adhere to a set of laws that the frog being boiled in the pot doesn't work.

112
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,840
Right. So if you live by certain covenants or rules that you consider lawful, which come from

113
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,840
your God, by the way, and by the way, if anyone tells you that any God has done away with rules

114
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:47,100
that they had, they're lying. And you fall in for the crowd mentality. And you shouldn't be

115
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,200
listening to this show because it's just going to make your life well. Well, you may or may not make

116
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,200
your life miserable, but you will be very confused. And you probably won't understand anything that's

117
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:04,420
being said. But anyway, I don't know why I give these little caveats. But the if you are have a

118
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:10,000
set of rules that you live by that that frog in the pot being boiled, that gradual change doesn't

119
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,180
affect you, by the way, because you have what's called discernment. Right. And that's one of the

120
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:24,400
things I said, we wanted to do a recap on the perhaps the previous sonic experience, I kind of

121
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,720
glanced over it, we didn't really prepare anything for this show regarding that. But there's a

122
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,080
handful of items which, you know, can be discussed. And I think going into more depth, which we'll

123
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,180
give more in the future. But to bring up the first episode of the last sonic experience that I did,

124
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,140
was a general overview of many, many, many topics to kind of lay the groundwork and the foundation

125
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:51,820
of what Greek speak is about. And by the way, someone, I want to thank them maybe anonymously,

126
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,380
like she'll just mentioned their name, Robin, she assembled something called,

127
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:05,940
I think it's called just Greek speak, blogspot. So it's not Greek speak, that's something else,

128
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,840
but just Greek speak blogspot.com or something. So we'll find a link and post it, maybe someone

129
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,640
will that's something that's coming together. It's just things put together of interest about

130
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:26,160
Greek speak. But I think the when one especially pursues lawfulness, which you will not find in

131
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,700
the world today, by the way, it almost seems to be a private and personal endeavor. Would you say

132
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,960
that would be fairly accurate, Seth, to pursue lawfulness as a private personal endeavor?

133
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,380
There's no group or any place to subscribe to that is contemporary, I would say?

134
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:49,500
Yeah, absolutely. I can't say that absolutely, I suppose. None that I have seen.

135
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,300
Yeah, that's evident. Yeah, that's evident that we could say, here, here's a place to go.

136
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,820
And also, by the way, folks, and not to brag or be arrogant, but the reason Seth and I get together

137
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,960
and do these conversations is because we're saying things that just kind of need to be said. I mean,

138
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,040
but no one else is talking. I mean, all the stuff you hear out there is, well,

139
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,840
to get into it, you know what it is, you might have heard it. But the reason of coming together

140
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:22,860
and doing Uncommon Sense is shaking your head and two face palm moment kind of thing,

141
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:31,040
where imagine the metaphor would be the question of the day or the week or the year is how many

142
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:38,320
fingers do we have on our hands, let's say? And you're like, dude, all you got to do is

143
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,280
look at it right in front of you and count, right? And they're still asking that question.

144
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,960
So the things we're discussing is just as clear as that, you know, we're not

145
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,780
trying to overlay any personal experiences or some kind of,

146
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,340
well, you know what I'm talking about how people are always introduced as being this or that.

147
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:07,780
We're always wanting to go back to what is very, very, very basic. If you ever hear us discussing

148
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:13,880
things that you have to go more than five feet from where you are to discover it's not us,

149
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:22,740
we've been taken by the pod people. So whatever. The likelihood of us having an expert guest is

150
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:28,040
relatively low. Yes. Now, could it be that the definition of an expert

151
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:35,340
is someone who is always learning more and more about less and less? So anyway,

152
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:40,000
and of course, they're also very academic. And if you would like to know what we mean by that,

153
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,920
it's what the word means etymologically. So you can look that up. We have a lot of fun with that

154
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:53,200
as well, because, you know, we also like to bring up the level of hypocrisy. There's a thing about,

155
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,180
you know, people can choose, right? Their desires and their wills and their

156
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:03,100
personal preferences. And the hypocrisy involved in that is just astounding where, you know,

157
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,060
when they hire a carpenter to have a door installed, they want it to fit, or when they

158
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:12,360
go to buy shoes or something, they want it to fit. But when it comes to what words mean

159
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:20,240
and what things mean and where things come from, they don't want to know because it doesn't matter

160
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:27,910
if it fits. You see, well, okay, but in that

161
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:37,530
light analogy, if you go and look at the information purveyors, whether it's

162
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:42,350
mainstream or alternative, not some of them, but all of them, again, because if there was anyone

163
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:48,370
out there discussing what needed or should be discussed, we wouldn't be here. It is this part

164
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:53,330
of the country. It's mid-afternoon on what they call the pagan weekend, which, by the way, I

165
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:58,570
believe I'm reckoning around the 16th or 17th of the fourth month now lawfully. We could be doing

166
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:04,930
other things, but I don't know if this is a responsibility to mankind in any way or just

167
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:10,609
maybe saying it to clear one's own conscious. Nothing is being said out there that is of

168
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:18,349
relevance to what can be. And using the construction site as a metaphor, you see a carpenter that's

169
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:24,450
kind of bewildered and upset and you ask him, what's going on? And he says, well, I've cut this

170
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:30,830
board three times and it's still too short. Well, you know, maybe you should stop cutting it, right?

171
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:38,390
Now, what's going on is now some people say it's a distraction. It's fear-based stuff or this. I

172
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:43,010
think it's just really ignorance, but they're just accommodating, you know. Anyway,

173
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,690
the whole thing about distraction also, this has come up in several, let's say,

174
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,750
discussions in the past week, Seth. You know, people say, well, these are all distractions.

175
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,290
That's irrelevant. The reason is because if you're on the proper course,

176
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:05,210
distractions can be enabled, but you're still on that course. Like, for example, if you're an

177
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:12,990
airplane or a ship is going across the Atlantic Ocean, a storm might be categorized as a

178
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,330
distraction. So you go kind of around the storm, which, you know, and then you get back on course

179
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:24,350
to your destination. So people have brought up this past week in discussions that it's the

180
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:28,430
distractions that people have. And I had to disagree. And it took them a few minutes to

181
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:33,270
kind of land the thought on it because they're so used to hearing that, right?

182
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:38,730
If you know where you're going and you have a course of lawfulness, for example, or rules

183
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:44,190
and things that you know that you, or good references, the distractions are not relevant

184
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:51,270
because you correct the course, you see. And, you know, I've also discussed the concept, you know,

185
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:54,770
there's a lot of excuses. You know, one is just people are distracted. Well, no,

186
00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:01,270
they don't have any course. They don't have any path. You know, the distractions come. So let

187
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:08,090
that sink in, folks. It's not the distractions. It's the lack of lawfulness. The other thing I

188
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:14,530
wanted to bring up is people I've heard often is, oh, it's fear. It's fear, man, fear. And they

189
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:19,710
want to give some personal fear experience. And that's irrelevant. Now, when you hear someone

190
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,570
saying, oh, it's all fear based, well, you have to define what's going on there. Now, fear is

191
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:32,010
being disabling. Yes, it can be if you lack skill in a matter. And if you are weak minded or weak

192
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:38,350
spirited, you are susceptible to general all types of fears. Like, I don't like to bring up

193
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,690
FDR, or Uncle Franklin, Roosevelt's horrible leader type thing. But nonetheless,

194
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:52,230
he said there is nothing to fear, but fear itself. So whenever you hear someone saying

195
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:57,570
people are distracted, and it's fear based, and that's the cause of their ills, you're speaking

196
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:06,010
to someone who is not thinking properly or clearly themselves. Again, I think I gave the example of

197
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:11,410
the distraction. If you are on a set course, expect the distractions you're on course. That

198
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:16,930
is not an excuse for why things are so off, not the distractions at all. The other thing would be

199
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:22,650
fear based, forget it. You know, for example, with fear, I keep giving the example, if you don't know

200
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:29,690
how to operate a dishrag or a mop, you're indefinitely afraid of a glass of milk spilling

201
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:34,650
over. Now if the milk spills over, you're terrified. But if someone in the room or near the presence of

202
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:41,190
that spilled milk knows how to operate a dishrag or a floor mop, you're going to say, it's okay, man,

203
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:49,590
you got it. Don't be afraid. So all of these things that are being discussed, I find to be

204
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:56,370
well, stupid, can we say that? How would you spell it? S-T-O-O-P-I-D. But anyway,

205
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:01,510
no one is paying attention. When I say no one, I mean statistically, and everyone has somehow

206
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:09,510
fallen statistically for these easy catchphrase, you know, out of the can expressions to make

207
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:15,610
excuses for the unaware. Boy, oh boy, I'll take a pause there for a moment. So if any,

208
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:20,230
any comments, if you're still there, or didn't know we were going to go down this direction,

209
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:34,070
but nonetheless. Yeah. You know, food, water, shelter, food, water, shelter, other people,

210
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:42,670
good food, you'll be more comfortable, you know, good, good drink, good water. You'll be healthier

211
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:48,190
and, you know, good company, you'll feel healthier. So those three things, those are

212
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:56,550
important. The rest of it is details. And yeah, well, well, also the details are important if

213
00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:02,010
there's precision and accuracy and good source. You know, here's an example. You know, we've been

214
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:07,450
asked very often to do a show about water, which we will, but I think bringing it up a little bit

215
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:13,870
to set the stage here. Someone wrote in chat, I asked my buddy's 14 year old brainiac daughter

216
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,450
to explain the clouds and water being heavy to see her reaction. She will research it. I'm sure

217
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:25,170
you're not going to find it. Sorry. What's out in the, well, you, well, it's not going to be that,

218
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:33,110
that easy to discover. You see, no one is paying attention. And they, and what's got,

219
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:40,790
what's been gotten away with regarding that lack of discernment is astounding. And it's

220
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:46,090
socially at the point of no return, obviously. I mean, well, I should say that obviously, but

221
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:53,090
humanity at now is way, way past. In other words, if you made, humanity would have to make 100

222
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:59,410
steps in the opposite direction that they're, that they have been going just to get to zero.

223
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:04,330
Right. So they're not going to do that because they're still pursuing the wrong direction. But

224
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:08,610
the reason I brought this up is because, you know, if there's any water in the clouds, you know,

225
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:14,270
you know, millions of tons of water are dropped as in the form of rain over a city.

226
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:20,950
And is there any water where it wears like a cloud of sponge rings out, you know, is it,

227
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:26,930
is it like, you know, thousands of tanker ships, tanker loads of water up there,

228
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:32,150
you know, sorry, guys. Yeah, yeah. So anyway, I brought this up because yeah, she could research

229
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:36,050
it all she wants. And she'll just be spinning around what she needs to do, by the way,

230
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,730
is stand in the next time there is a storm stand in an area that's covered and observe what's

231
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:46,830
going on. And you will see the water being formed instantly under the clouds. I mean,

232
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:52,090
at a distance, you know, you will see it as it as you see it coming near you, but clear the mind.

233
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:58,750
The internet is subject to human input. That's all I have to say. Have you met

234
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:09,750
your average human lately? Anyway, so I don't know what's average. Yeah, you know,

235
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:14,490
why don't we look that up? Let's, let's give the people a little bit of a proclamation on

236
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:23,670
some etymology today. What do you think? Oh, I like words. Well, communication. Yeah.

237
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:28,990
You know, you know, can you please cut that board at 12 inches? Or I'd like a size 10 shoe,

238
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:36,010
you know, or I'd like, you know, a turkey sandwich. Right? Specifics, right?

239
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,960
Not broadcasting on UStream today, for anyone who is interested. Okay.

240
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:52,460
Could put in a pinch. Or Yeah, okay. It was inoperable this afternoon, for whatever reason.

241
00:24:52,460 --> 00:25:01,270
Yes. Well, what's being said? Regardless, someone I mean, I think if we weren't being

242
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:07,790
heard, stop the signal. That's right. Can't stop the signal. Actually, we Yes, we do. I think we

243
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:11,790
mentioned and threatened to say that this sonic project is also limited. I believe this might

244
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:15,730
be the 11th episode, we might have about seven more to go. I'd like to keep it around the 18

245
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:21,090
number. And then we'll we might continue. Or we might just say this is enough for now. Let's do

246
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:28,130
another sonic project. I think things should be limited. This, this roteness about, you know,

247
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:32,210
going up and picking up the paper because you know, it's going to be there every day or a lot

248
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:37,310
of the shows that you see in mainstream and alternative just constantly being there just

249
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:44,310
finding out stuff to fill the talk about it. You know, folks, listen, you may you may not be like

250
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:52,010
that smart, right? But you know, when you tune in to stuff in media, it's filler. Yeah,

251
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:58,290
it's filler, they have to show up, they have a schedule. And they're just filling in the space.

252
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:08,120
So yeah, this is not what we're here for. So yeah, average, late 15th century,

253
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:18,340
financial loss incurred through damage to goods in transit. From French every which is damage to

254
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:30,460
ship and Italian every word from 12th century Mediterranean maritime trade. Compare Spanish

255
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:39,820
averia. Other Germanic forms also are from Romantic languages, which is of uncertain origin,

256
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:51,100
sometimes traced to Arabic. I don't I don't speak any Arabic. Our our area, our area, damaged

257
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:58,380
merchandise, meaning shifted to equal sharing of such lost by interested parties, transferred sense

258
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:07,220
of statement of a medial estimate is first recorded in 1735. So several hundred years after

259
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,060
it's first recorded, the mathematical extension is from 1755.

260
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,480
Wow, okay, so I don't know how we're gonna save that one. But I'll tell you,

261
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:24,780
I once saw a high school diploma from the 1700s or 1800s. And well, it wasn't called high school,

262
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:29,960
it was some kind of other training, but young person. And it said this, this vessel has been

263
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:38,860
launched, referring to the person. So I don't know. Yeah, so let's, let's, let's put that in

264
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:44,940
perspective. And now let's not cut that board too many times. Yeah, damaged merchandise.

265
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:51,800
That's Yeah, but that's also been used to refer to people. By the way, folks, we speak like regular

266
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:58,240
people do. You wouldn't believe how many times I've spoken to people who are public. And, you

267
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,220
know, in the background, you know, it's like, Oh, yeah, people are dumb, we have to dumb it down,

268
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,000
whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever. I'm like, screw that. You know, if they're dumb,

269
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,660
they have to know they're dumb, because maybe they'll do something about it. You know how people

270
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:17,140
say, for example, you know, yeah, people are dumb down, but it's never them, or never someone they

271
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:25,300
know, or love, right? Sorry, guys, you're on this planet. Bad shape. Nonetheless. But thanks,

272
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:33,320
Seth. Thanks for doing that. I think it was a pretty good expose. You know, it'd be interesting

273
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:42,940
to go through the entire etymological dictionary. I know. And find out the what are the most common

274
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,700
words that people use and see if the common usage or common definition is in stark contrast

275
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:53,720
to what it really means. Like, you know, the word nice, for example, right? Or now it's average,

276
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:58,340
and things like that. Or apology is another one I found people are confused.

277
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:05,680
Yeah, yeah. I once was on a call about someone made a biblical term was clearly erroneous,

278
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,160
like they mostly are. And I stated, I'm going to I'm going to defend and apologize what I just

279
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,420
for what I just said. And they were like, why would you defend and apologize? Well, I said,

280
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:19,580
well, it's just like saying I'm going to defend it. I'm going to defend it. And it went really

281
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:27,980
quiet when I put in the definition of apology. So it's interesting. Yeah. I mean, as people think

282
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:33,500
of saying you're sorry, or whatever. And that's just an expression of that's an abbreviated form

283
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:39,980
another form of the word sorrow. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Versus happy. Yeah. Yeah.

284
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:51,500
I find it to be very interesting, but maybe a quick glossary of rudimentary sifting through

285
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,700
of what maybe 50 words that are commonly used that would be in stark contrast to their common usage to

286
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:02,540
their meant definitions, let's say, I think that would be an interesting little thing, you know,

287
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,620
kind of like what the police, you know, the police are called, by the way, law enforcement, right?

288
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,080
They don't know any laws at all, by the way, that's pretty easy to discern, especially if you're

289
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,660
working law enforcement, you just sit back, take a deep breath, you heard what I just told you about

290
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:22,160
yourself. But anyway, if you meet anyone in law enforcement, they, they basically it's crowd

291
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:27,720
control. It's all the training they do. Policy enforcement. Yeah, yeah. But even officers,

292
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:33,120
police officers, the only extent of law they have, they have this little vest pocket thing,

293
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,780
it's like a couple of inches long by a couple of inches wide. And it's got all the regular

294
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,780
statutes and codes, you know, a couple of them, maybe a couple of dozen. And it's funny, you know,

295
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,380
how they, they go through it, you know, when they write up a ticket, you know, they cite it,

296
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:53,780
and then that's all they know. It's just like, you know, you can actually have a machine replace them,

297
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:58,640
which they did try, by the way, with the cameras, right, the red light speeding cameras,

298
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:03,480
was an attempt to show that how police or enforcement law enforcement can replace by

299
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:09,540
machines. And it would be done more efficiently, by the way, because it doesn't matter. But

300
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:15,700
nonetheless, this is this goes for most people, by the way, and in their quote, unquote jobs,

301
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:22,580
it is not difficult to replace them with machines. And the reason why I'm saying this is

302
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:29,860
when machines do things, well, it's something that's produced by a machine, it's usually

303
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:36,720
a lifeless meaning soulless, right? It doesn't breathe. It doesn't have anything flowing through

304
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:43,280
its veins. And usually the quality of the product that produces doesn't jive as well as something

305
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:48,520
that is made by a machine that has a soul which breathes and has blood flowing, flowing through

306
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:54,820
its veins. And for example, the ancients had machines, and they found out that the products

307
00:31:54,820 --> 00:32:00,380
that were produced, did were not of quality. So they went back to training, or, you know,

308
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,780
maintain the training of people to make things right. But right now, the way people are making

309
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:10,200
things are of so low, such low quality that you might as well just replace them with machines,

310
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:15,040
because the quality would not be discerned. That's why I brought up the law enforcement,

311
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:20,260
they don't know any law, just just pick them out of a hat, for example, because I recently saw one,

312
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,700
had someone on the side of the road, and they pull out this little tiny vest pocket thing.

313
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:29,740
And they're like, paging through the three pages to write down some kind of a code. And I'm like,

314
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:34,880
you really don't know any laws, do you? No, they work for the attorney tickets are multiple choice

315
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:42,700
even. Yes, I have a number of them listed that they can just tick off. I've run the machines that I

316
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:50,440
operate. And when I'm at work, they can be considered to have a soul. A lot of them are

317
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,760
actually have a pneumatic element to them. One for one purpose. Yeah, that's a pseudo soul.

318
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:01,480
In other words, if you turn off the soul for a return off the pneumatics for a given amount of

319
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,500
time, it can be reanimated though, right? It doesn't, it doesn't. The machine will alarm out

320
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:14,300
and stop operating if you turn that, that part of them off. Okay, and then you can turn it on

321
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:20,520
and bring them back up. Interesting. And there's no decomposition when you turn off the pneumatics?

322
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:27,180
No, but there is, there's a change a lot of them have to warm up, like will not,

323
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:32,240
they operate different at the varying temperatures. And once everything becomes regular and

324
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:39,040
regular, relatively static, things will run smoother for longer periods of time and things

325
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:45,440
like that. I do a lot of repetitious steel cutting and just general metal cutting.

326
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,820
So what's interesting, even though you're immersed with the machines, you still are there to create

327
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:56,580
or bring or impart a discernment to the product. Even though machines might do 90% of it, it's

328
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:00,780
you are discerning whether the product, yeah, the quality of the product.

329
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,940
And the machines have to be maintained as well.

330
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,560
So, yeah. Yeah.

331
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:14,620
But yeah, it's just, I figured I would offer that up as an exception to the rule.

332
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,820
The definition of the soul, by the way, is pneumatic, P-N-E-U, whenever you see that

333
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:25,420
prefix is the soul. And, you know, I do, let's just give a little secret. There's,

334
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:30,820
I have people in Skype contacts and such that send contact requests over time. And these are

335
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:36,960
people that discuss things publicly and they're known as spiritual, you know, whatever, air quotes.

336
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:43,159
And I sometimes chide them by telling them to tune into the show and, you know, the uncommon sense.

337
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:49,500
And when we define soul and spirit, you know, these people supposedly that are guiding the

338
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:53,940
rest of the people on these, quote unquote, spiritual journeys are, they kind of freak out,

339
00:34:53,940 --> 00:35:01,300
you know, because what we're doing is making accessible these definitions, which they

340
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:09,780
unwillingly, unwittingly as well, prefer to not be defined, right? Because then no one would

341
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:16,240
listen to what they're saying, which is garbage anyway. But nonetheless, we bring up the concept

342
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,960
of the education system, you know, kindergarten through 12th grade is 12,000 hours of education,

343
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,500
a little bit more than that, actually. And I have some people try to argue with me,

344
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:31,100
and they say, well, it's really around 9,000 or 10 and a half thousand, you know, because they

345
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:37,740
don't want to admit such a vast, astronomically high number of hours. I don't know if it's

346
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:45,660
astronomical, I'll be billions, but it's wasted on the individual, right? Because anyway, out of

347
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:54,160
those 12 years in school, how much time do they spend discussing things that you might find of

348
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,260
interest or in need while you're an adult or leave there, like, for example, instruction on how the

349
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:08,180
law or the legal system works? Zero. Or how about some medical practices, battlefield medicine,

350
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:13,680
you know, someone's going to fall, someone's going to get cut on what you know, on

351
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:22,760
you know, some some kind of unwanted physical condition might arise. Right? By the way,

352
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,760
when I say that the medical society is just what they're good at, is they've accumulated

353
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,640
3000 years of battlefield medicine, anything that's outside of dressing a wound or, you know,

354
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:39,180
some kind of what they call emergency medicine is useless, folks. And this is not a harsh

355
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:46,360
criticism. It's a mild one. How much out of 12,000 hours of education do they spend a day,

356
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:52,780
a week or a month even on how to perform basic battlefield medicine, or emergency medicine? None.

357
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:02,080
Right? So very little, I guess I attended public school for some of the educational process there.

358
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:12,440
And there, I learned some basic emergency first aid training, actually, in junior junior high,

359
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:20,440
a little bit in high school. So, you know, between the ages of, say, 12 and 15, I had some

360
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,280
was it comprehensive? Or was it was it something that you could use or do something you remember?

361
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:33,040
Was it practical? Very basic, like rescue breathing, cardiopulmonary resuscitation,

362
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:41,340
things like that. But, you know, what they what they call the Heimlich, things like that,

363
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:48,360
we were actually shown I don't know if that's, you know, how regular that is better. But that

364
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:53,260
was actually something useful. And I remember those classes very well, even so. Right,

365
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:59,420
practical stuff, right. In other words, they spend even 10 minutes in public school telling

366
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:07,560
you that everything legal is a presumption. No, no. So you're being pranked. In other words,

367
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:13,000
society has set up the pranksters. In other words, with the imbeciles on this planet,

368
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:20,300
have been pranked, and they don't know it. And the pranks go on, and go on and go on. So

369
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,760
part of what we're discussing, perhaps is, let's, let's pay attention a little bit,

370
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:32,860
and see, you know, what's interesting, you know, 12,000 hours of education is not maybe something

371
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:36,260
that's in the room with you right now, but something most people might have experienced.

372
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:44,180
And it's sad to say, you know, that much time was wasted, not wasted, but it was to put you

373
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:50,820
in a certain direction. So you'll never realize what, you know, conditioning, essentially,

374
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:57,240
that's, that's one way of summing it up. That's the end result is, yes. Yes. And the thing is,

375
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,520
you know, I bring up the concept of parents, which is touchy for many people,

376
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:09,880
because, you know, the subculture of what they call kids, right? It's a subculture, right? And

377
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,800
literally, it's it's beyond a subculture, because a kid is not even an offspring of a man or a

378
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:23,180
woman. At least I hope not. If it was, it would be in a freak show. If you know what I mean. But

379
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:30,740
kid is a baby goat. So from from the parental aspect, the parents are still insisting that

380
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:36,160
because I went through it, you have to go through it, meaning to the child. So we're talking about

381
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:42,680
a pretty sick bunch of people. I don't. Yeah. Yeah, you don't. But the majority do.

382
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:49,900
No, there's actually I have quite the opposite approach to that.

383
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,900
Yeah, but I do. But you wouldn't believe how much I hear about that.

384
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,480
Yeah, no, I can I can relate to it. I mean, I'm I know other people.

385
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:04,120
Yeah, they're like, well, because see, so so this is where you have this self perpetuating,

386
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:10,080
self consuming thing. This is where I say, you know, humanity is unrehabilitatible as a whole

387
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:15,680
at this point. So speaking of being unrehabilitatible, anybody even watching the

388
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:21,500
what's going on in the Middle East, it's kind of quiet. It's been quiet. But there's a lot going on.

389
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:30,440
You know, when we just discuss geopolitics, we tend to err towards what's coming because yes,

390
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:36,260
you should know the future. Not only can you know the future, but it's can be mandatory if

391
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:43,760
you're concerned about things. Right. For example, if you're baking a cake or washing a car or

392
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,520
anything that relies on results, you need to know the future or what you're looking for.

393
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,640
So, by the way, we've also mentioned, I think, more than once, Seth, that what people should

394
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:01,160
be looking for geopolitically is a Middle East Union being formed. Well, unlike the EU, but

395
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:07,140
nonetheless, a union or focus on that part of the world starting in the next decade in a big way.

396
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:13,220
And what's interesting about it being quiet, there is a lot of stuff going on there right now

397
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:22,600
regarding the Assyrians, not Syrians, Assyrians. So nonetheless, if anyone wants to do a little

398
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:28,020
bit of research on Assyrians in the past month or so, it's going to be pretty interesting,

399
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:33,640
especially what's going on in Iraq. Now, when I say Assyrians, what you should be looking at

400
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:42,220
are the geographic areas of what's presently known as the country of Iraq, what's presently known as

401
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:49,280
the country of Turkey and what's presently known as the country of Syria. Yes, we've discussed this

402
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,320
years ago and now they've been in the news quite often, but regardless of them being in the news,

403
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:03,200
watch those three geographic areas because amongst the three areas, Iraq, Syria and Turkey,

404
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:10,160
there will be a new emergence in the northern part of Iraq, taking some land from Syria and Turkey

405
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,820
as well to form what could be called the new Assyria or a land for the Assyrian people. It's

406
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:24,140
A-S-S-Y-R-I-A-N, not Syrian. Most people have never even heard of that,

407
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,960
but that is something to look for. What you're also going to be looking for

408
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:38,600
is focused on that part of the world but not limited to is the general mindset of the population

409
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:46,440
returning to things of the gods. Yes, plural. If anyone tells you they believe in God,

410
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:52,440
they don't know what they're talking about because there's no such thing. Yes, there's no such thing

411
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,300
as God. The term God... If asked for clarification, they might know what they're talking about. It's

412
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:02,580
just a poor way of saying it, I suppose. Yeah, it's a plural term. So, yeah.

413
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:10,480
Actually, we use it often. Sometimes we say God, right? But like you said, for clarification,

414
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,460
absolutely, there are gods. There are many, many, many, and there's a hierarchy there.

415
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:23,280
And it's an entire society, albeit, let's say, how would you say, unfamiliar to most?

416
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:28,520
I would say it's resembling ours, but very significantly different.

417
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:36,360
Yes. And as a matter of fact, this is a loose mirror image of that. So, that one came first,

418
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:42,040
right? Which is interesting. Yeah. So, the interesting thing, the reason I say they don't

419
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,380
know what they're talking about is because when you do press people that are, quote, unquote,

420
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,640
faithful, which is what we kind of titled the last broadcast is Beware of the Faithful,

421
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:56,200
is they don't want to even look at it. Right? It gets very scary. And it should be,

422
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:05,140
because this is a society or a reality that is formative. And formative things tend to be

423
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:12,260
scary. Yes, they are formative, meaning they come before and are providing source,

424
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,540
are the source. So, there's going to be an interest in discussion in those things,

425
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,940
albeit, it'll still be inaccurate, but there will be a focus on that.

426
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,260
And it also will show how invalid and ridiculous the current world religions are. And that's

427
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:39,400
another discussion which has been done many, many, many times, if you hear

428
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:46,140
the Greek and Seth discussing things. But yeah, so that is another thing to look at.

429
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:52,680
And another thing to look at is there will be a loss, obviously, what goes part and parcel with

430
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:57,640
these other two things is a loss of confidence in the entitled classes, your professionals or

431
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:04,720
experts, as we so-called defined. And I loosely said an expert might be someone who is learning

432
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,340
more and more about less and less. But if you actually look to see what they're learning less

433
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:17,500
and less about, or more and more about, that is, again, baseless. So, they have a lot of problems.

434
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:23,400
And I mean, entitled classes, people in the medical society, legal society, education society,

435
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:31,000
scientific society, we mentioned something, for example, people that consider themselves

436
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:38,400
scientists or praise the virtues of science, I first tell them that I don't think that current

437
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:44,200
affairs or the current state of science would withstand or can withstand its own scientific

438
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:53,120
methodology. Right? The same with the legal society, legal society will not be able to

439
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:59,260
withstand its own legal precepts if they were applied to them. The same with the education

440
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:05,480
society and the same with the medical society. If you apply the precepts that they allegedly

441
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:13,460
profess, or profane in this case, right? Professing to be a scientist would simply be

442
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:20,200
professing to know. So, it's not something I'd ever call myself. Generally, a musician, I guess.

443
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:28,660
Most of the people I tend to run into are more on the, I guess, what would be considered a creative

444
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:34,040
side of things. I don't find myself running into many people that refer to themselves as scientists.

445
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,300
Every once in a while, I'll run into a professor of some sort or another.

446
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:44,280
Yeah, and to profess is to speak on something. But yeah, when we say these terms, they link

447
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,140
directly to these subcultures or societies within society, right?

448
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:48,920
Absolutely.

449
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:53,620
You know, we won't actually, we're not going to point out, let's say, attorneys or judges or

450
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:58,760
police, when we speak about the legal society, because they are a small part of it. There is a

451
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:05,200
large fraction, I should say, of the regular society that supports them directly. You know,

452
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,740
if you ever walk into where these legal societies set up shops,

453
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:17,080
most of the people there are just common folk going to work doing something. Yeah. Yeah. So,

454
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:23,240
they're a part of that society. The same with the medical society, the same with the education

455
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:31,300
society. There's a lot of non-educationists or education type people that work in those societies

456
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:36,300
as well. I mean, all the way down to the janitor. Actually, you might learn more speaking to the

457
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:44,020
janitor. But nonetheless, there is going to be what you should expect in the future is less of

458
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:52,120
a focus on these so-called specialists and experts, simply because people are going to inquire

459
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:57,060
a little bit more on what they're doing. And they will find that what they're doing is a prank.

460
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:04,940
They're just pranksters. So, in general, not emphatically, absolutely, yes, that's all they do.

461
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:10,180
They give the appearance of what they advertise to be doing, whether it's the legal society,

462
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,520
the medical society, the educational society, what have you, religious society. They give

463
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,620
that appearance. But if you start looking at what they're doing, it's not based on anything.

464
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:27,260
So, well, at least it's a profane version or a profane aspect of what they're supposed to be.

465
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:32,560
Is it a widespread hidden cult of like Loki or Coyote?

466
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,160
It's prankster gods.

467
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,380
Oh, yeah. Oh, absolutely. They're prevalent.

468
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:46,380
They claim justice. That's the one most prevalently claimed in one of its varying forms.

469
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:51,840
That's cruelty. Yeah, that's the revival of the goddess religion, which is a very cruel

470
00:48:53,240 --> 00:49:03,820
religion. And it's anti-gender. It's anti-male and anti-female. It wants to go after the...

471
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:08,380
She's very upset, by the way, the goddess religions. That's what I've gotten out of

472
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:13,720
from studying it for a decade or so. Very upset at the ultimate manifestation of a

473
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,080
spirit through material. And what's one of the emails we've gotten, by the way,

474
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:22,260
is what is the purpose of all this? And it's very simple. It is the highest form of creation

475
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:28,020
is for the gods to have had a spirit animated through material. We call it living things.

476
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:34,240
It's very simple. And again, it's been going on for a while. And one of the emails was...

477
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:40,180
I appreciate the emails, but when the people bring up stuff like

478
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,920
certain societies and pieces of pottery that have been dated 80,000 or 20,000 years ago,

479
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:52,560
get wrapped around the axle. None of that stuff is accurate. And I'm not going to discuss timing

480
00:49:52,560 --> 00:50:03,060
and how old things are. But when you look at the actual manifestation of a spirit or a mind

481
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:08,280
through material with a soul that breathes, living things that are living, that is the highest form

482
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:13,240
of creation from the gods. And just go study what's been written about the gods, and you'll

483
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:20,160
see how they value it. But don't be distracted, let's say, about big numbers, just because it's

484
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:28,060
been going on for a long time and such. But the goddess religion wants to kind of break that up,

485
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:36,140
and it promotes the disengagement of polarity, opposite forces, opposite sexes,

486
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:42,380
to continue this manifestation. She's very upset about something, we don't know exactly what.

487
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:49,140
There's some inclination, maybe some hints here and there that were given, but not much. But the

488
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:58,020
purpose of the goddess religion is to basically put a stop to creation as it is semi-automatically

489
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:04,240
automated through conception, let's say. I guess conception would be a semi-automatic process,

490
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:09,580
like pollination of seeds, animals mating, people mating. I guess I call it kind of a

491
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:17,620
semi-automatic process. The purpose of the goddess religion is to disrupt that.

492
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:23,680
And that's what you see going on in politics right now with a lot of the agendas being put on. It has

493
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,580
nothing to do with people's rights. They don't care about your rights. No one cares about anyone's

494
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:38,580
rights. And there's all this talk about it, and it's just absurd. So they feel good when they say

495
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:42,760
they care about rights, but what the hell are rights anyway? What does that have to do with law?

496
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:53,200
So what I've discovered from looking at older law, let's say conventions, is that

497
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:59,860
when you're working with laws, you're working in harmony with the environment. But when

498
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:05,800
that harmony is transgressed, let's say, or the law is transgressed, or something goes wrong,

499
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:12,240
now you go under rights, right? Because now you have to be removed somehow and sequestered

500
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:17,500
somehow, because you're not functioning properly, and you go under rights now.

501
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:22,680
So people are asking for rights. I'm asking like, what did you do wrong that you have to function

502
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:30,520
under rights? In other words, rights are superseded by law, folks. But I know this is really out of

503
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:35,520
place and out of time almost to discuss this now, but I think it needs to be said.

504
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,020
Yeah, it's not being said anywhere else, so certainly.

505
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:46,940
Yeah, and we've gotten several suggestions. I don't know if you have that. Oh, hey,

506
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,700
Greg, you need to listen to this guy. He's saying stuff like you are, and I listen to it,

507
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:57,660
and it's not even close. And I'm like, oh, man. And it's not the joy of thinking that we don't

508
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:05,740
have to do a public speaking or what they call a show. And now I can go and go fishing or do other

509
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:12,940
things. It's not about that. It's just what's so sorry about that is when people refer other

510
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:19,220
things that are similar, is that how far off it is, it makes me realize that they're not listening

511
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:28,540
at all to what's being said anyway. You see, that's the tough part. But nonetheless, I know

512
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:35,320
that there's from communication through emails and electronic conventions, there's definitely a good

513
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:39,100
four or five people out on the planet right now that appreciate what's being done here.

514
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,640
They've recently learned how to make really good rice.

515
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:48,300
Yes, yes, and we might have about another five or 10 that are listening, and I think that's enough.

516
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:56,300
And we're going to go, this is, I guess, the first hour and we're going to go for a short break,

517
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:03,260
folks. And we will see you back in a few minutes. Greetings and welcome back to Uncommon Sense

518
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:09,200
with the Greek and Seth Michael on American Freedom Radio. And folks, American Freedom Radio

519
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:16,920
is listener supported, or was or should be. And go ahead and do the right thing, folks.

520
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:22,800
And if you will, they could use it. But nonetheless, this is Uncommon Sense with

521
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:29,120
the Greek and Seth Michael. So on the break, we said, I asked Seth what we're going to perhaps

522
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:34,120
title this. And he said, let's call it Coffee and Tea. And I think it's sort of appropriate.

523
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:38,040
Coffee Talk, perhaps, Tea Talk, or things like that.

524
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,620
Yeah, absolutely. We could talk about time a little bit and then call it Coffee Time.

525
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:49,980
Yeah, yeah. Now, the thing is, well, unlike the weather, you know, there was a saying, you know,

526
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:53,220
everyone's talking about the weather. When is someone going to do something about it? You really

527
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:59,340
can't do much about time other than record it. You see, time is just the recordation of events.

528
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:05,100
The funniest thing is when I hear this time travel, you know, what they actually, I believe,

529
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:11,400
are trying to say is traveling to past and future events. But time is just the recordation of events.

530
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:19,820
And I think that good records are proper. And they should be lawful. And the only lawful timekeeping

531
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:26,220
that I've ever been made aware of or have found is that the sun rules the day, the moon rules the

532
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:33,660
month. And the years get a little more complicated. But nonetheless, they still are planetary motions.

533
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:39,320
And because they're very accurate, like I stated earlier, today appears to be roughly the 17th of

534
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:45,900
the fourth month. Here, it might be the 16th and other parts. But most likely it is around that

535
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:53,220
time of the middle of the fourth month. Yes, I know it might sound strange. What are you smoking,

536
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:58,820
Greek? What are you drinking? Well, no, it's about being lawful. Now, I think we brought up and this

537
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:07,120
is one of the mainstays of any discussion of that might be called uncommon is here it comes. You're

538
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:14,200
ready. The calendar, the Gregorian calendar, also known affectionately as the Pope's work schedule

539
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:23,140
is not a timepiece. You can't keep time with it. Sorry. Maybe I'm not, but I should be. I didn't

540
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:33,400
make it up. But it is a work schedule for you guessed it, the papal subjects, period. That's

541
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:39,640
the truth. And yes, there are, there is truth of the matter. And there are still are people out there

542
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:44,680
in Basilica enough to think that they have their own truth, or this is your truth, or whatever

543
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:52,920
truth. That's very imbecilic, but it's very typical. The truth of the matter is the Gregorian calendar,

544
00:56:53,060 --> 00:57:00,340
no matter how much they try to spice it, splice it or dice it into making any sense does not.

545
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:05,080
There's no such thing as a leap year. There's no such thing as what they are

546
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:12,820
purveying on everyone. But as Seth has said in the past, it works, doesn't it? If you're subject to

547
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:18,460
something, and that's the thing that you're subject to works for you, hey, who am I to get

548
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:23,040
in the way of your pursuit of happiness? It works better for some than others.

549
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:33,820
Well, it's not lawful. Like for example, today is what they call June 4 2016. Well, last year,

550
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:41,360
it's what they call a Saturday. Last year, let's just be one to be accurate. A little more of the

551
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:52,340
safe someone's listening. Let's go to June of we said it's June 4. So June of 2015. The fourth

552
00:57:52,340 --> 00:58:03,040
was what they call a Thursday or a Thursday. Okay. You're ready. Let's go to what they call

553
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:14,840
2017. And June 4 is what they call a Sunday. So let me ask you, folks. Is June 4, a Thursday,

554
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:25,060
a Saturday or a Sunday? Or guess what? It's arbitrary. Right? But just like the money

555
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:32,320
being fiat. I don't care if it's fiat or as long as I go to the store and get something for it.

556
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:41,320
Right? This is your average human. I don't care if it's based on anything. Not I got the weekend

557
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:54,140
off. I don't care. Yep. That's why you're unrehabilitated. Anyway, time. I think we

558
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:59,060
just set the precept. But what's going on with that? It's people have no concept of how to

559
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:07,040
record it lawfully. What else can we say about it? It has interesting etymology.

560
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:17,540
Time does. All right. Let's give it to us, man. Old English for a limited space of time.

561
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:31,180
From Proto-Germanic. A source also of Old Norse time or proper time. Swedish an hour

562
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:43,240
from Proto-Indo-European. D-I-M-O-N. A suffix form of root da, which is to cut up or divide.

563
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:53,860
And then commends that you see the etymology of the word tide as well, because it's it relates

564
00:59:53,860 --> 01:00:03,220
Old English. Point or portion of time. Due time. Period. Season. Feast day. Canicle hour.

565
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:15,060
From Proto-Germanic. The division of time. Also of Old Saxon tid. Dutch tid. Old High German zit.

566
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:25,680
German zeit for time. From Proto-Indo-European. D-T. Division or division of time. Suffix form

567
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,940
of the root. Same as time. So hold on for a second. So it's just various ways of saying it.

568
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:33,700
To divide and cut up. Okay. To divide and cut up. Gotcha. Yeah.

569
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:41,620
Okay. So. Yeah. So divide and cut up. But nothing about recordation of events.

570
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:50,480
Hmm. Interesting. Close enough. Yeah. Divide and cut up. The source also of Sanskrit dhati,

571
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,600
which is cuts and divides. So yeah, just.

572
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:01,200
Yeah. And by the way, by the way, when you brought up the Sanskrit or the Hindu culture

573
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:06,720
and all that, the peak of their culture was around 500 BC. So if you, all these morons out there

574
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:11,060
talking about, you know, it's 40,000 BC or it's the oldest writing and all this, it's,

575
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:17,380
yeah, it's just moronic, which is common, by the way. Yeah. I could hear stuff like that. So

576
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:24,820
do your research, folks. But nonetheless, Seth, would you say, I mean, how else would we talk

577
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:30,880
about time other than are you doing it lawfully or not? And, and then at that point, maybe bringing

578
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:40,100
up the contrast, the aspect of the Pope's work schedule is fine. But again, it brings up a lot

579
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:44,940
of questions when people are publicly making comments about the quote unquote, system or

580
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:52,420
systems on the earth, and they're professing malicious intent towards the Vatican and

581
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:59,140
you ask them what day it is and what they very quickly respond with is something on the Pope's

582
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:04,720
work schedule, which indirectly has them admit that they are papal subjects on one end,

583
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:11,540
but on the other end, they're bad mouthing the Pope. Yeah, the work schedule works just,

584
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:19,140
just as, you know, as a schedule for work. That's why we reference it as being such so often. It's,

585
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:27,520
you know, it works for a schedule, I guess, of mundane things, like building.

586
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:34,840
Well, it's interesting, as far as recording the celestial movement and things like that,

587
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:42,520
which is what has been used to, you know, record time, as long as the concept has been with us.

588
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:47,520
Let's go back to work for a second before you go on. Hold on. I'm gonna step on you for a minute.

589
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,800
Most of the ancient world had in lawful timekeeping to take the seventh day off.

590
01:02:54,740 --> 01:03:00,800
So that has to do with work as well. So you're going to end up with having your day off,

591
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:07,900
roughly being on every quarter of the moon, where you would judge that or discern that time

592
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:16,690
as such. So lawful timekeeping is also being used for when to work and when to not work.

593
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:20,290
But and you're actually you're going to be doing it with the natural rhythm.

594
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,900
Think about that for a moment. You and I have discussed what they call the seventh day lawfully.

595
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:35,780
Mm hmm. It doesn't apply to this society. Nothing lawful applies to this society. They want rights.

596
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:43,540
Anyway, what do you say? You know, I mean, there's no you know, it seems like there's no one.

597
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:48,900
Here's the point is just digress for a second. Having a discussion about population of what

598
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:54,340
they call the United States of America or America. And, you know, how we bring up, you know,

599
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:57,500
and other things, but I'll tie it in with something else here in a minute.

600
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:00,480
So no one lives here anymore. They're all residents.

601
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:08,280
What's a resident? You know, temporary. I'm not saying that anyone's permanent.

602
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,820
It's kind of like if the future of mankind depends on his children, there is no future

603
01:04:13,820 --> 01:04:20,540
because all the children have been turned into goats with what they say. But yeah,

604
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:27,840
the work schedule is also can be lawful. The seventh day. Typically, there's something called

605
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:32,140
the circadian rhythm, which is now just discussed on the 24 hour clock, you know, meaning light and

606
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:39,200
dark. But it was also there's studies inclusive on the moon phases, and it clearly showed that

607
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:46,740
metabolisms of living things tend to subside in different rhythms or different levels with each

608
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:52,940
moon phase. So that would be the seventh day of the week, which almost every culture has that

609
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:59,800
in it. So it can be. What's interesting is it can be also used on the lawful side.

610
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:03,880
So I stepped on you there. Do you have any more thoughts on the time aspect?

611
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:08,600
Kind of like on a roll? I wanted to just interject that before we lost the moment.

612
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:14,520
Another, you know, easily it's another easily access point of reference

613
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,580
that, you know, everyone has available to them. Anyone can walk. Well,

614
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:27,900
anyone most can walk out and, you know, see the moon and the stars and the sun and see that

615
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:37,340
the numbers associated with it are they don't it doesn't figure it doesn't work out.

616
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:42,180
They come out accurately. Right. And when it comes around the next time of year, it's the same day.

617
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:46,860
Not like the nonsense we just showed with this June, what they call June 4th,

618
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:55,540
Thursday, Saturday or Sunday. But no one's set up that way. But, you know, like,

619
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:03,240
there's there's old writings. Someone certainly referred to as prophetic that speak towards

620
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:10,620
times, you know, being manipulated and changed if they could be. And we've what we're witnessing

621
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:17,520
is sort of like a parody of of that happening, like a pseudo change of time, things like that,

622
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:22,980
because it's Tuesday because we say it's Tuesday. Right. Right. It's an apathy. It's a removal.

623
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:28,060
You know, it's just like, you know, the concept of a holiday is an appointed time or celebration.

624
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:33,320
And most people don't care. This is there was a I want to pull up, maybe do a brief audio.

625
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:41,240
There's a guy named Mark Dice. OK. And and he and it's very often that he'll show

626
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:45,620
going in public and asking your typical American something and how stupid they sound.

627
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:49,000
And when I show this to people like, well, that's edited out. It's only showing

628
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:52,560
the worst ones. You know, he could have interviewed a thousand people,

629
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:55,300
only two said something stupid. He'll play the stupid stuff. Right.

630
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,520
And I'm telling you, that's a good optimistic view, but it's quite the opposite.

631
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:07,980
There was a celebration on the those that have died in the military recently. Right. I think

632
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:12,960
they call it Memorial Day. And everyone that I spoke to, which was all of like three people

633
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:19,220
on that day outside of the normal, you know, just people chatting in public, they didn't care

634
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:27,840
about anything. I have a day off. That's all I care about. Right. How many times have you heard

635
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:34,720
that? So why is it a national? In other words, you're living in a society. Again, it's the

636
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,960
hypocrisy. If you say something about what it's based on, say, well, that's our system,

637
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:45,140
that's our society, that's how we do things. I don't care. But and if you bring up something

638
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:50,020
that is supposed to be of significance, oh, it doesn't matter. It's just a day off.

639
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:57,440
Okay. The purpose of a holiday or a feast day or an appointed day is something of importance.

640
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:04,120
So on one hand, the inhabitants of a certain area that incorporate traditions and cultures and

641
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:12,860
systems will vehemently defend on one hand, and on the other hand, totally wipe the floor

642
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:19,100
and throw away and trash the things that are supposedly held to be honorable and significant.

643
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:24,979
And I brought up the recent holiday. All of their holidays are like that, by the way.

644
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:32,540
They're, I think the American God wears a red suit. The one that they tell people on their

645
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:37,200
white beard and the children sit on his lap. He's the highest. He's the highest God, I think,

646
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:46,340
in the winter, isn't he? Santa Claus is their patron deity. And it might sound funny, you know,

647
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:51,300
everyone I heard once on a call say, well, as Christians, we're not so bad. We just lie to

648
01:08:51,300 --> 01:09:00,340
our children. Someone said in public, right? Okay. Anyway, yeah. Morons, right? But that's normal.

649
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:05,240
You know, a moron is a compliment, by the way. If you're on this planet, take it as a compliment.

650
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:14,939
But yeah, even then, their highest God, I think, is Santa Claus. And even then,

651
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:20,960
I don't care. It's a day off. Or man, that day really stresses me out.

652
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:29,100
Aren't you honoring your God on that day? Anyway, it's kind of crazy.

653
01:09:32,060 --> 01:09:35,120
Lots of bowing down to trees on that holiday.

654
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:43,899
Hmm. I like the Odin story there where he flew through the sky, was pulled by staghorn creatures,

655
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:52,439
and he knew what everyone did. And the way you worship Odin is by bowing down to a tree. That's

656
01:09:52,439 --> 01:10:01,080
why trees are made of Odin. And Woden's Day, that's why they have their Bible studies on Woden's Day.

657
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:12,940
Every Woden's Day in the Bible Belt and the buckle of the Bible Belt. And it's Woden's Day.

658
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:21,460
Yeah, Odin. Yeah. Talk about... Anyway. Yeah, really, really bad shape.

659
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:29,540
But not as bad as it's going to be. So let's see if we could find Mark Dice Memorial Day.

660
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:37,160
This is... Is it Mark Dice? Let's see. Mark Dice. I'm unfamiliar.

661
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:47,860
He's a fellow that goes out in the public and it's called Memorial Day Morons. Americans

662
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:53,020
clueless about holiday and reason for it. Mark Dice. Here we go. Let's see if we can get something

663
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:57,860
going. What is Memorial Day? What started Memorial Day? What's the purpose of Memorial Day?

664
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:12,970
Do I have to do this? Yep. As an American, you have to do this. See? There you go. I don't think

665
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:20,070
so as an American. Okay. It's Memorial Day weekend. We sort of celebrate the repeal of

666
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:23,930
Don't Ask, Don't Tell that was preventing the gays from serving in the military.

667
01:11:24,510 --> 01:11:30,570
What are you going to be doing to celebrate this weekend? I'm just visiting. So, you know,

668
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:38,050
I'm just going to enjoy this ocean and have a few drinks. That's about it. And appreciate the

669
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:43,070
inclusiveness of the LGBT community. I will. I love the LGBT community. Of course. For sure.

670
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:48,330
For Memorial Day. For sure. Awesome. I'm all about it. I'm all about it. Just getting people's

671
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:55,170
opinions. Yeah, of course. What is the purpose of Memorial Day? No clue. That's my answer. No

672
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:58,730
clue. No clue? Okay. For the soldiers. It's a memorial for the soldiers that fought in the wars.

673
01:11:59,190 --> 01:12:03,930
For the ones who died. Yeah. Slap him upside the head. He got it. What is Memorial Day for?

674
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:14,690
For military. I'm pretty sure. What specifically? I can tell you. If I sat down and kind of...

675
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:20,430
What gets to you next? Is it Conan? No. I know it's military. I know I should know more about

676
01:12:20,430 --> 01:12:25,210
it, but I don't right now. So I need to sit down and think about it. You definitely do. Yeah.

677
01:12:26,430 --> 01:12:32,170
Okay, Zombie. Memorial Day weekend. It doesn't feel like it, but it will. Yeah. And we're just

678
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:38,390
kind of commemorating the freeing of the slaves and the end of the Civil War. Just checking to

679
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:42,290
get people's comments on what you're going to be doing this weekend. Just doing some drinking and

680
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:46,790
having fun. That's about it. That's all that matters, right? Yeah. Just enjoy yourself.

681
01:12:46,930 --> 01:12:53,310
Okay. Thank you, Zombie. Memorial Day weekend, the time when we celebrate the signing of the

682
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:57,550
Declaration of Independence. Yes, yes. What are you going to be doing? Well, we were drinking,

683
01:12:57,710 --> 01:13:05,850
but we just got an open container ticket, so... Well, okay. So water. Party on. All right.

684
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:11,890
Thank you. NASA has a big celebration every Memorial Day to commemorate Neil Armstrong,

685
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:19,050
the first man on the moon. Government's decided to cancel that Memorial Day celebration this year

686
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:26,330
at NASA. Is that the wisest thing to do? Or should we be commemorating Neil Armstrong

687
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:32,110
this Memorial Day? I think we've been commemorating him for long enough, so

688
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:37,650
we should save some money right now. Save some money this Memorial Day? Yeah. Maybe next year.

689
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:42,910
Maybe next year. Bring it back. Bring back the NASA celebration. Yeah. Okay. All right. Just

690
01:13:42,910 --> 01:13:47,990
give people's opinions. All right. Thank you. Take it easy. Comments on... Anyway, get the point.

691
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:58,830
Yes. Yeah. This is common. This is not Memorial Day. This is everything that's going on. I don't

692
01:13:58,830 --> 01:14:03,630
care if the money isn't based on anything, as long as I get something from the store.

693
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:11,230
Right. Now, there are beings that do care, and there is right and wrong, folks. And obviously,

694
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:18,270
it has escaped most people. And this is going to be one of the things that you will be looking for

695
01:14:18,270 --> 01:14:25,770
in the future. It returned to, well, semi-sane approach. I would say that using that word

696
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:32,150
accurately. Semi-sane approach to acknowledging things that are right and wrong, acknowledging

697
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:38,150
the gods, acknowledging law form. And when I say the gods, not just some regular pantheon that you

698
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:43,170
might be familiar with as some form of mythology, but the actual true hierarchy that exists.

699
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:48,990
That's kind of scary to talk about publicly, by the way, as well, Seth.

700
01:14:50,370 --> 01:14:55,770
Greek, how do you know about this hierarchy? Okay. That's an interesting point.

701
01:14:56,550 --> 01:15:01,010
Well, I can imagine someone out there, because it's been brought up a couple of times over the

702
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:09,170
last hour and 15 minutes here. And I can imagine someone who's hearing it brought up for the first

703
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:16,730
time going, well, is this guy prescient? Is he psychic? Is he a seer? Right. Yeah. So...

704
01:15:16,730 --> 01:15:22,870
Where's this idea, this concept, this information coming from?

705
01:15:22,970 --> 01:15:29,470
To be clear upon examining anything, there's always a path that one goes down to examine it.

706
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:35,170
Unless it's like an instant download and you got it, right? There's an imparting of information or

707
01:15:35,170 --> 01:15:41,790
being exposed to information that you might discern. And when you go down that path, there's

708
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:47,510
let's say a road, you get to a point where there's a fork in the road. Let's say the left hand says

709
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:54,890
this information is unvalidatable, not important, or it's irrelevant. And you should put it down.

710
01:15:56,050 --> 01:16:01,150
The right hand or the right path of the road is that it is validatable, it's a good report,

711
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:07,070
and it should be looked into. So we can do this with any piece of information.

712
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:14,390
So when I went down and looked down this road to see what the ancients had written about the

713
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:20,150
spiritual world and the gods, I examined both sides. Is it bunk, left hand, or is it validatable?

714
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:27,230
And is it true? And fortunately, or unfortunately, it was true. In other words, it is a good report.

715
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:32,370
In other words, what I'm trying to say is if you have a discussion like this with a typical

716
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:39,610
modern contemporary person, the first thing that comes up in their mind is, oh, we're so modern.

717
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:47,270
They were primitive. They made stuff up. They were stupid. Right? Okay, so when we look at

718
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:53,530
what's been memorialized, is it a good report or not? And you will find some very good reports.

719
01:16:53,930 --> 01:17:00,070
The only problem is now there is a level of discernment that is difficult to attain because

720
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:04,870
there is a level of awareness, or let's say education, that's required to look at these.

721
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:14,830
Let's say reports is very distant and removed from the current mindset. Right? Here's an example.

722
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:21,650
This, so how do you know? Well, if you, well, go back just to finish one thing up. The example I

723
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:26,690
wanted to give was just the time. You will not find the Gregorian work schedule in any of these

724
01:17:26,690 --> 01:17:34,770
ancient texts. Right? And they still discuss, I've heard arguments, oh, Jesus was crucified on a

725
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:44,610
Thursday, or Sunday. It's like, oh, boy, you guys are, you need some help. You know, there's,

726
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:49,830
you know, what's the next thing? You know, they, Columbus sailed the ocean blue with GPS and an

727
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:58,370
iPhone. You know, out of place, out of time. So the problem here is that there are spiritual or

728
01:17:58,370 --> 01:18:06,750
psychological need, need one say, hurdles or attachments that need to be abandoned or overcome

729
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:14,120
before one looks at this stuff. And when you find it, you will find that the report is good.

730
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:19,840
In other words, how, the question to ask there, Seth, perhaps, is how do you know

731
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:25,120
a good report is a good report? Or is it propaganda, or misinformation or disinformation?

732
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:33,260
That would be the more important question. Because then they would do service to going beyond

733
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:37,020
studying what the ancients wrote about the gods. And what's interesting about what the

734
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:40,460
ancients wrote about the gods, and many of them, it does state there's a cutoff period,

735
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:44,600
that there is no contact. It doesn't mean they're gone and not looking.

736
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:55,910
Kind of like when grandma baked a cake, don't open the oven, right? So the question here is

737
01:18:55,910 --> 01:19:00,890
discernment. But you're not going to get discernment, when people are exposed to the

738
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:07,790
fact that the money is unlawful in fiat. And they're so I don't care, get something from the

739
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:15,930
store or what they believe that they should make their society better. Right? You hear a lot of

740
01:19:15,930 --> 01:19:22,250
people that are patriotic or religious or concerned, we need to make society better.

741
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:27,010
Right? And then you bring up, you know, their society aspects of their society,

742
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:34,550
and how apathetic they are to it. So on one hand, they want to, we got to make the world a better

743
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:42,950
place. And on the in the same breath, I don't care what that means. I just got the day off. I don't

744
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:51,530
care. See, and that's, that's something very important as well. So how are you going to get

745
01:19:51,530 --> 01:20:00,450
discernment? How is an individual that is based in that mindset, going to approach something and know

746
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:05,390
if it's a good report or not? And the answer is very quick, very swift and very sure they're not.

747
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:16,420
So how else can you respond? Judgment is bad.

748
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:23,260
The reason I'm speaking, right, we're not supposed to judge. Well, the reason I'm speaking to you

749
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:28,820
right now, same thing, right? Well, the reason I'm speaking to you right now here is because of a lot

750
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:34,220
of judgment. I was out in what they called an engine driven wagon, and I saw a red octagon that

751
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:40,060
allegedly had written stop on it. A couple of judgment calls, there are quite a few actually

752
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:46,060
I stopped, I looked left, I looked right, I looked again. And I kept making judgment calls.

753
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:51,620
And that's what I attribute to being here alive to do this show with you right now.

754
01:20:52,400 --> 01:21:03,400
Yes, any sense? Yeah, knowing to, you know, halt at one of those red octagons. That's good. That's

755
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:09,000
good practical knowledge. Good judgment call there. Yeah. As in German meaning stop. Yeah.

756
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:15,660
There's a difference between, you know, judgment and condemnation. I don't recommend much

757
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:22,060
condemnation. But, you know, judgment is can come down to, you know, this works, or this doesn't

758
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:27,740
work, or that's correct. And this is incorrect. That's right. This is wrong, etc, etc, etc.

759
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:33,340
That's all judgment. And I believe that I say, I believe that saying that humanity is

760
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:38,140
unrehabilitatible and the things that they set their hope and faith in right now is a judgment

761
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:44,480
call. It is a very good judgment call. It is actually a very wise judgment call to see the

762
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:53,460
things that are put on society by themselves, by the way, right? There's no draconian

763
01:21:53,460 --> 01:22:08,120
dictatorship that is pressing people to not inquire. Let's use that term inquiry. Look a

764
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:16,460
I don't have time. Right? Have you heard that before? Now, the case in that is when you're

765
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:19,920
the reality of it is you're born and you die and all you have is time in between.

766
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:29,340
Now, what they might mean by that is either I'm not managing the time enough to fit that in,

767
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:36,340
I can't see how it could be managed. Or I don't want to put any time into it. But saying that

768
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:44,780
you don't have time is another one of these moronic expressions. Right? So again, no matter

769
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:50,600
how you look at the current state of affairs, and again, the paramount one would be, let's say,

770
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:57,340
on the American society, is there right now in sort of a frenzy about an election,

771
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:02,100
which has nothing to do with them, by the way, unless you're an elector.

772
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:08,260
And maybe we'll recap that really quick voters vote electors elect folks. So if you're being

773
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:14,920
told to vote, you're being told to basically do nothing. Well, what they're doing is collecting

774
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:21,860
your signature. And that is monetized or as money. You don't know that in you probably will

775
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:28,700
never know that most people that no matter how simply you explain the money system, they kind

776
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:35,020
of give you the deer in the headlights look, you know, or the look of a look of a baby seal right

777
01:23:35,020 --> 01:23:39,300
before it gets clubbed. You ever see the look of that face? There's a reason they pick up birth

778
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:45,880
certificates in an armored vehicle. Anything you could sign a bubblegum wrapper and a banker

779
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:50,880
will jump out of his limousine to pick it up and use it where most people would just view it as

780
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:58,780
garbage. So the interesting part here is that going back to the American aspect, there's a lot

781
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:04,280
of Americans in this movement, sort of alternative and mainstream to make the country better.

782
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:09,520
But if you start looking at the pieces that make up their culture, their traditions,

783
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:17,520
their economy, their daily lives, all you hear, I don't care. It doesn't matter.

784
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:27,660
And that's all you hear. Now, if you go to the, the Gustav LeBaron's crowd mentality, where the

785
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:34,440
idea has to be oversimplified for the crowd, the imbeciles of the crowd to accept it. That's what

786
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:43,260
they're following. Oh, we've got to make America great again. Or we need to get rid of Federal

787
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:53,280
Reserve. Yeah. Or we need better health care. Or, yeah, these are all oversimplified, dumb ideas

788
01:24:53,280 --> 01:25:02,040
or dumbed down for the imbeciles. If you start to examine the subject matter, and not even a great

789
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:07,740
deal of minutiae specifics, but the general subject matter that is overtly and plainly

790
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:17,140
given that anyone can access, the typical moron will say, Oh, I don't care. I got a day off.

791
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:24,560
Oh, it doesn't matter. I go to the store and get what I want with it. Oh, everybody's got an

792
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:34,500
opinion. Or Oh, that's your opinion. Right? So if you do good science, and you look at the average

793
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:39,740
American, by the way, we'll just pick on that group. It's not even picking, it's just being

794
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:47,720
objective. They tend to have a general feeling to improve things or make things better, as a general

795
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:56,060
statement. And if you look at what they're discussing, as to be made better, the ideas are

796
01:25:56,060 --> 01:26:01,180
so oversimplified and removed from their true character. And if you start looking and bringing

797
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:05,200
up the true character of these things, whether it's the economic system, the medical system,

798
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:12,340
legal system, their religious system, their patron gods, there's absolute resentment in

799
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:20,900
discussing it, or bewilderment. And it's, it's, it's bewildering to see. I mean, what the interesting

800
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:28,320
thing is, is, there's the only way to write to explain it is a lot of the terms that are brought

801
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:33,640
up is that it seems like they're censored cosmically. Right? Because these things are very

802
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:41,180
easy to explain. So there's a censorship that's not worldly. The other thing is they tend to be in a

803
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:47,400
in a waiting room status. Like they're always waiting for something to happen. Right? Like,

804
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:52,320
they don't understand how money works. They don't understand how this works, or they don't

805
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:59,520
understand how that works, but it doesn't matter. It'll sort itself out. You see, so that's why I

806
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:05,700
bring up the point that there's also the waiting room, it's as if they're in a waiting room, you

807
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:12,460
know, to be followed into the office to be anesthetized, so they could pull that tooth,

808
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:18,200
because if you don't numb that numb them out, you can't do the extraction, they'll be jumping all

809
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:24,940
over the chair, you know, and writhing and screaming. So there's an aspect of something

810
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:31,740
being discussed as the dumbing down. That period ended a long time ago. You're in the numbing down

811
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:38,520
is another way to expect it. Now they do speak, these imbeciles do have mouths that move and make

812
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:45,480
sounds. But it doesn't mean that they're not numb. So it's interesting. And I like to use the word

813
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:52,260
moron and imbecile. It's used very commonly, by the way, in Le Bon's writings and other people's

814
01:27:52,260 --> 01:27:57,080
writings. No one is saying this publicly, because I guess no one's going to subscribe to their

815
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:06,000
website or watch their YouTubes. But that's not what we're here for. So nonetheless, what say you,

816
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:17,100
Jeff? Yeah, it's, you know, there's, I don't know, just commentary on the current state of,

817
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:21,540
I don't know what's being broadcast as being important, you know, with the

818
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:31,020
politics and whatnot. It's just, I kind of see myself as an outsider from all of that.

819
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:40,040
Yeah. And because and kind of taking that view on it, even if you don't consider yourself to be

820
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:46,760
like trying to take and look at all of that from the outside. Really, it's all garbage. I mean,

821
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:56,600
it's some people get very invested in it, you know, and think of it as a way for or a method for

822
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:03,060
bettering their lives or bettering the lives of others. It's a dummy look. Yeah, it's yeah,

823
01:29:03,180 --> 01:29:07,520
it's a treadmill. It's a photograph on the wall you're running towards.

824
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:12,660
They feel better, like people have seen small little apartments in the cities, let's say,

825
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,380
and people feel like they're in good shape. And it's a little tiny place,

826
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:20,920
you could barely walk around and they have a treadmill and they use it to stay in shape.

827
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:26,700
And they put out this energy to, right, so they have they've been told that they have to dedicate

828
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:32,760
a certain amount of energy to it. And it's all put out into a treadmill, you know, a hamster wheel.

829
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:38,660
Yeah. And there's also a lot of people or enough people discussing

830
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:45,580
avarice or acrimony or things that are not positive against those that are in power.

831
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:49,700
And I'll tell you right now, thank the heavens that those that are complaining about those that

832
01:29:49,700 --> 01:29:59,540
are in power are not in power. If that makes any sense. Yeah. Yeah. So, right. It's just Yeah,

833
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:06,020
it's just an interesting observation. So the whole the whole, the true nature of it is to set

834
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:12,260
yourself apart from it, right? If you're not sure, set yourself apart. If you get more surety by

835
01:30:12,260 --> 01:30:18,280
looking at it and seeing that it's just dumb, for the dumb by the dumb. That's another reason to

836
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:23,480
set yourself apart from it. And also, there's a quality aspect, if the quality is so low, like,

837
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:27,080
for example, I think it was Henny Youngman said, I looked high and low for you, couldn't find you,

838
01:30:27,140 --> 01:30:32,360
but I guess I didn't look low enough. When I look at what's being put out there by the mainstream

839
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:42,380
and alternative, both is a such low quality, that it cannot be entertained. If you know what I mean,

840
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:48,780
or considered because the quality of the information and the way it's presented,

841
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:56,240
and all that, as being what it is, as something that can be entertained, meaning to look at, I

842
01:30:56,240 --> 01:31:05,980
guess, is unpalatable completely, at this point. So the only thing to do is set yourself apart. Now

843
01:31:05,980 --> 01:31:11,980
be aware of it. It's not bad to tune in to see what's being discussed. You have to kind of want

844
01:31:11,980 --> 01:31:17,860
to laugh. Otherwise, if you're living near a fire, it's good to keep an eye on it. You know? Yeah,

845
01:31:18,360 --> 01:31:23,980
exactly. Yeah. But fortunately, knowing what's coming down the line,

846
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:27,800
there is no doom and gloom on a global level, as people think, at least next.

847
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:33,240
You can watch how they still spin their wheels in their uncertainty. The thing to

848
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:40,640
to what's interesting to observe, socially, mainstream and alternative, is the level of

849
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:46,260
uncertainty that they profess. And that on one hand, and on the other hand, they profess to be

850
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:55,820
information. Think about that for a moment. We've got good information. And on the other hand,

851
01:31:55,820 --> 01:32:03,240
if you listen to what they're saying, nobody knows. If you listen to most of the broadcasts,

852
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:09,120
mainstream or alternative, oh yeah, we've got the goods. And when you listen to the content,

853
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:14,400
it's all maybe, what if, don't know, no one knows, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

854
01:32:14,940 --> 01:32:21,520
in that context. They're like, wait a second, am I going insane? Because I thought I was getting

855
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:28,720
information. And all I hear is too many maybes. And I don't know. I mean, am I going crazy? Oh,

856
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:38,520
no. These people are crazy. Get it? It's okay. If you kind of sometimes get the feeling,

857
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:45,540
like there's too much insanity. That's not just a feeling. That's a pretty good objectifying of

858
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:56,260
reality right now. Insanity meaning not well. Unhealth. Yeah. Yes. Sanity. Sanitation. Saneness.

859
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:05,580
Good things. Yeah. I have been, by the way, applying a little bit more access to the mainstream.

860
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:09,220
It's actually quite a relief because, you know, I've been trying to,

861
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:13,640
if years ago fell in, oh, the internet's great, you know, alternative, you know,

862
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:21,440
there's no censorship, right? They don't need censorship. Right? But anyway, going back to the,

863
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:28,160
looking at what the mainstream has put out, at least it's better packaged. Right? They got high

864
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:32,520
production value, better polish. I mean, it's obviously dumb as could be, because they have to

865
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:39,780
that's guess what? You know, they have to accommodate their audience, but they are also

866
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:48,180
pretty much, you can go to any mainstream venue and start off with a question regarding the subject

867
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:53,820
that's being presented. And guess what? After the presentation is done, you're still wondering

868
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:59,340
what the hell is that question? Yeah, absolutely. Have you ever seen the movie?

869
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:06,160
Oh, now the title slips my, is a Mike judge movie.

870
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:16,260
Is it evolution? No, Idiocracy. Have you ever seen the movie Idiocracy?

871
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:21,380
Yes, that is a documentary. Yes. Okay. Yep. You've seen it. Certainly. Okay.

872
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:29,640
It's just when I mainstream television, what, you know, little I access or whatever,

873
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:36,340
what little I see is just every day, every day, it's closer and closer to being

874
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:43,180
nearly identical to what was presented in, in Idiocracy. So it's an entertaining movie,

875
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:50,480
frightening if you're watching it with open eyes, I suppose. But yeah, I would, I would suggest that

876
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:59,580
part of society, if not a good fraction of it is already deeply involved as such. Very much so.

877
01:35:01,160 --> 01:35:06,020
And there's another fraction that is kind of neutral that can go either way. And then there's

878
01:35:06,020 --> 01:35:15,520
a small, such a small group that can observe it as being that way. I think that's what I consider to

879
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:21,400
be an accurate explanation of the film Idiocracy. But the majority, I'd say 90% of the people are

880
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:25,320
in it right now. And they don't know it because it's a slight variation of it. It's not exactly

881
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:31,380
the same. And then a small group is kind of neutral, they could easily go either way.

882
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:38,600
Then there's such a small group that it's not even a group, a very small spattering that can

883
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:45,660
see that, you know. And you know where you illustrate that, by the way, the Idiocracy

884
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:53,240
is not by the common guy on the street, go to the legal society. And I mean, like, you know,

885
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:59,460
the universities, the Ivy Leagues, go to the medical society, you know, the universities,

886
01:35:59,660 --> 01:36:05,940
again, and, and where they practice. Right, go to the scientists. And that's where you'll see it

887
01:36:05,940 --> 01:36:11,600
the most, the Idiocracy. And don't be distracted by the terminology and the shop talk that they use.

888
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:20,360
The actual individuals in there are not. Well, you guessed it, right? I don't have to say it.

889
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:28,890
So it's pretty interesting. Someone wrote, you don't have to turn on the telly, just go any big

890
01:36:28,890 --> 01:36:34,630
box store or mall scary. Well, where did those people come from? To go to the stores? Or did

891
01:36:34,630 --> 01:36:41,010
they walk through a wormhole from another dimension? You know, they're living right

892
01:36:41,010 --> 01:36:44,830
around. Where did they learn to behave in the manner in which they're behaving?

893
01:36:46,430 --> 01:36:54,870
It's, it's the, it's the self consuming thing. The parents, I've said parents typically hate

894
01:36:54,870 --> 01:36:59,490
their children. Now, what I mean by that's a strong statement that really rubs a lot of people

895
01:36:59,490 --> 01:37:09,270
the wrong way. You know, the concept of watching a video with audio, right? Watch a family,

896
01:37:09,270 --> 01:37:15,190
a typical American family, a videotape of their day. I'm not saying such a thing is available

897
01:37:15,190 --> 01:37:21,310
without sound. Okay. And don't listen to what they're saying, watch what they're doing,

898
01:37:21,610 --> 01:37:26,250
and how they treat each other, the body language, and all that. And if you tell me those are people

899
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:35,250
that love each other, you're not paying attention. Just watch them. It's interesting. Watch what they

900
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:43,480
do. Don't listen to what they say. If that makes any sense. It shouldn't make sense. Well, it should

901
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:48,240
make sense. But if it makes sense to you, you're going to be in a world of hurt, because you will

902
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:58,360
end up being an observer. I think we mentioned on the last get together, we're looking at spiritual

903
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:06,420
quality or mind quality. Ever notice some people that say my, my, my, I, I, I, my, my, my, my, yeah,

904
01:38:06,420 --> 01:38:12,300
yeah, there's a level of, could it be that people that are more spiritually evolved to

905
01:38:12,300 --> 01:38:17,640
say down the line or more aware of what's going on, speak more in the third person?

906
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:23,880
You know, I recently was possible. Yeah, it certainly is possible to watch. That's, that's

907
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:28,620
when I, when I say, when I brought up the point, watch what they do, not what they say. When you

908
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:34,700
pay attention to that, folks, you ever if you know anyone? Well, actually, I'm only addressing four

909
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:41,040
or five people here, by the way. If you around people that you're like, something like quality

910
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:45,840
issue with this person, you know, maybe like an idiocracy level kind of guy here, listen to what

911
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:59,080
they're saying. My car, my tire, my hand, my kid, my hair, my house, my attorney, my doctor, my

912
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:06,960
country. Yep, listen to that. And you're going to see a lot of my, my, my is Oh, my. Yeah. Yeah.

913
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:12,680
It's very interesting observation. So I'm just putting this out there publicly. And just for the

914
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:16,260
four people, the rest of the people coming across this thing and say, what the hell is this guy

915
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:24,320
talking about? doesn't make no sense. You know, my favorite is listening to discussion. Man,

916
01:39:24,890 --> 01:39:33,460
I got busted. I had to go to my court case. The judge gave me five years. But I only did three

917
01:39:33,460 --> 01:39:42,480
years. I'm so happy. This is the level of mentality going on. Well, it's your court case.

918
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:50,400
Guess what? You just took you got to pay the bill. All these things. You know, whenever you say my,

919
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:57,080
or I, you're taking liability. That's why when you tune in to the new idiot box, which is the

920
01:39:57,080 --> 01:40:03,200
internet, they're always putting it on you. Click here to get my Yahoo, my Yahoo account, click here

921
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:11,180
to get your account. Really? They know that they're dragging you in. That if they get you to

922
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:17,760
say it's my my mine, or because it's yours, yours, yours, guess what? You get the bill.

923
01:40:18,740 --> 01:40:26,500
Even though there's no evidence that any of this yours, legally or lawfully. But yet, that's what

924
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:32,060
comes out of your mouth. And now you're taking liability. So the pranksters keep going on

925
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:37,640
with clean hands. So you're being pranked. And you know, eventually, Seth, you know,

926
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:40,920
what happens is when we have these conversations, especially well, I don't put the

927
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:46,420
onus on you, when the Greek is really pushing these topics. You know, we've lost everyone,

928
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:52,380
pretty much. Most people are like, I don't like what he's saying. I find it offensive.

929
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:58,240
I don't agree. That's my favorite one. Oh, I think you're being generous. I'd say that happens

930
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:05,100
after about, you know, 3045 seconds of broadcasting. Yes. My favorite one, though, is the concordant

931
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:10,400
mentality. I don't agree. That makes it untrue. Two plus two equals four. We're not doing this

932
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:15,220
to be agreed with. Are we? No, never look for approval, folks. You'll always get in trouble

933
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:20,280
doing that. Looking for approval. But there's this other thing that I hear often, because

934
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:27,100
someone doesn't agree with a fact or something being said, it makes it untrue. Interesting.

935
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,580
That's your typical earthling surface dwelling earth inhabitant, folks.

936
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:39,140
You know, I think sometimes that the purpose of getting together and doing this publicly

937
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:45,650
like this is not for the people on this planet. You ever get that feeling? Anyway,

938
01:41:47,130 --> 01:41:52,470
I don't know what you can do for these inhabitants anymore. There are plenty of observers out there.

939
01:41:53,730 --> 01:41:57,010
There are. You're not going to meet too many of them, though. They're very rare. They're

940
01:41:57,010 --> 01:42:02,990
spread out like salt. You know, like when you put salt on a plate, you want to get just one grain

941
01:42:02,990 --> 01:42:07,590
in every bite. If you put a big lump in the middle of the plate and you put that in the mouth,

942
01:42:08,430 --> 01:42:15,580
you spit it out. So they have to be spread out very, very thin. So nonetheless, it's

943
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:22,640
interesting. I think these things being said are beneficial to some. The responses we've been

944
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:30,600
getting are, I would say, atypical, meaning they're all very positive, but typical based on the subject

945
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:37,860
matter that we've discussed or brought up. And again, just to bring come around to a semi home

946
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:43,260
place here. There's a lot of talk about requesting doing a show on water. How do you think we should

947
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:49,400
do that, Seth? Because one part I mean, the shows are typically divided in first hour, second hour.

948
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:59,300
I'd say the first hour, water as it relates directly to, you know, to health,

949
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:07,660
you know, as far as, you know, drinking good water. And then the second half to how

950
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:18,200
much of, you know, much of this world operates. Yeah. Other than just, you know, taking it into

951
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:23,380
oneself. The reason I'm asking this publicly is perhaps to get some more feedback on how the

952
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:29,160
water show should go, because there's actually quite a bit that can be discussed about it. And

953
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:33,000
like you said, how it affects health might be one of the last things, actually. I might want to turn

954
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:38,580
that upside down on you. Okay. And I might want to discuss just what, how do we perceive water,

955
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:44,100
what it is. We don't really know, but we know what it's not. We know it's not H2O, right?

956
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:49,500
And things like that. And most people wonder, what did he just say? Yeah, well, if water is H2O

957
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:53,980
in the periodic table of elements is accurate. Why does a bucket of water weigh more than a

958
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:58,580
bucket of air? It shouldn't. And don't say because one's a liquid and one's a gas. It's irrelevant

959
01:43:58,580 --> 01:44:04,340
we're talking about one molecule. So think about that for a minute. But basically what water is,

960
01:44:04,420 --> 01:44:10,380
how it wants to perform in this environment, what keeps it in its best highest quality state,

961
01:44:10,620 --> 01:44:15,480
and then perhaps applying it to health. In other words, what happens to the health of a being

962
01:44:16,180 --> 01:44:20,780
when low quality materials and things are imparted to it versus high quality

963
01:44:21,380 --> 01:44:26,680
is imparted to that being, right? Would be the simplest way to discern that aspect.

964
01:44:27,860 --> 01:44:33,480
Again, I'm just going to suggest here, one of the emails that we've gotten was basically,

965
01:44:33,620 --> 01:44:40,780
what is the importance of a, well, the comment was, I said sarcastically, water, you know,

966
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:48,240
well, I stated water should be at 39 degrees or four degrees Celsius in the dark in an

967
01:44:48,240 --> 01:44:53,900
ovoid shaped container. That's why when people go to purchase water at the shops, it's always in a

968
01:44:53,900 --> 01:44:59,880
clear container at room temperature with a flat bottom container, right, sarcastically. But what

969
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:06,400
was meant by a flat bottom, flat bottom meaning it is not ovoid. And that is, again, something

970
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:16,460
that mankind has been led into sort of turning material substances into geometric forms that are

971
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:23,860
not conducive for life. If you look at any time there is stagnant water in a natural condition,

972
01:45:24,580 --> 01:45:30,180
it always takes on an ovoid shape in an organic body, whether it's the eye, the testicle,

973
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:36,600
the ovum, the kidney shape, or the organ shape, the egg of a body, many of the plants

974
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:44,540
have all ovoid shape, ovoid meaning circular, global, but one end is slightly more tapered

975
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:51,120
than the other of all kinds of shapes, you know, seeds, that's ovoid. Now the ancients had them for

976
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:56,660
us. And of course, they were primitive and stupid. That's why they couldn't make pots that stood up

977
01:45:56,660 --> 01:46:02,000
on their own, right? They had a point at the bottom. So people would say, look how primitive

978
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:08,280
and stupid they are. They couldn't even make a pot that stands up on its own. They had a point

979
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:12,260
on the bottom and they had laid them in sandboxes because they knew the quality of whatever was put

980
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:21,990
into it was always kept up high and cool. So, and by the way, a lot of the things that we're

981
01:46:21,990 --> 01:46:27,890
going to discuss will catch on to most people's ear, will be sweet in their mouth, but bitter in

982
01:46:27,890 --> 01:46:37,750
their stomach, meaning, okay, Greek said, keeping water cool and in the dark raises its quality.

983
01:46:37,830 --> 01:46:42,590
I've gotten you wouldn't know how many messages that say, that's true, it works every time.

984
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:48,910
But when it comes to seeking out a non-flat bottom or ovoid shape container,

985
01:46:49,630 --> 01:46:53,790
you will know what I mean by the idea is sweet in your mouth and bitter in your stomach,

986
01:46:55,890 --> 01:47:03,470
right? So the simplest way to do it, we've done on travel, long trips, we had to store some water

987
01:47:03,470 --> 01:47:09,050
for a week once in the cool. And the typical top of the bottle was tapered, you know, where the neck

988
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:15,290
and the cap is, right? You know, it's not flat. And the bottom is flat. In other words, where the

989
01:47:15,290 --> 01:47:20,270
cap on the container goes is typically more rounded and less flat than the bottom. What we

990
01:47:20,270 --> 01:47:25,710
did is we made sure that all of the caps and the lids were tight. And we placed them upside down

991
01:47:25,710 --> 01:47:29,930
in the cooler. Yes, they didn't want to stand up, just like the H&M 4s don't want to stand up

992
01:47:29,930 --> 01:47:36,650
on their own. So you have to take some precaution, right? And we kind of neatly stack them on their

993
01:47:36,650 --> 01:47:41,910
sides first and, you know, put some filler and towels and whatever bits in there to hold them

994
01:47:41,910 --> 01:47:46,910
and then held them upside down in storage for a week. And believe it or not, the ones that were

995
01:47:46,910 --> 01:47:53,870
in that shape or laying down or in that condition, the water tasted more vital and more energetic

996
01:47:53,870 --> 01:47:59,730
than the ones were vertical with the normal flat bottom. So that is the easiest way. Now,

997
01:47:59,750 --> 01:48:05,070
let's just sweeten the thing up a little bit. If you're seeking an amphora shaped,

998
01:48:05,650 --> 01:48:10,510
non-flat bottom container, you will have a difficult time in this society because you're

999
01:48:10,510 --> 01:48:16,790
so modern and advanced and knowledgeable. So just turn it upside down if it's got a lid on it,

1000
01:48:16,870 --> 01:48:21,790
folks. And we will probably consider doing the water soon and it will be very good.

1001
01:48:22,910 --> 01:48:25,170
Thanks again, everyone. And here's the music and

1002
01:48:26,370 --> 01:48:29,670
a little coffee and tea time with Seth and the Greeks. See you guys again soon.
