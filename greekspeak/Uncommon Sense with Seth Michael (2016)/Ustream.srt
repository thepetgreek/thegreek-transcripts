1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,990
Start record.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:03,550
Start broadcast.

3
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:25,030
Welcome to Uncommon Sense with the Greek and Seth Michael.

4
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:25,890
How are you doing, Greek?

5
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,670
Hey, doing great.

6
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:28,470
Welcome, everyone.

7
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,450
And here we are again.

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,570
Let's do some more Uncommon Sense.

9
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:34,690
Absolutely.

10
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,870
So jumping, just kind of jumping right into it,

11
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,350
the Greek shared a communiqué with me,

12
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,810
an email that he'd received from a listener that was,

13
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,590
I didn't have the chance to,

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,410
it was actually about a 26-page document,

15
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,990
and I've not had a chance to get through all of it,

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,150
but what I was able to peruse earlier today

17
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:07,990
while I was drinking some coffee was very interesting

18
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,990
and brought up a lot of subjects that we have discussed

19
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,210
in varying depths over the last two or three years.

20
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,330
And so I thought that perhaps we could use that,

21
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,770
if not as specific bullet points,

22
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,950
but as kind of a springboard into what we'd like to talk about today.

23
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,450
And the letter opened with the first few points

24
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:41,550
were having to do with gods, essentially, with the gods

25
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:49,910
and the history behind how they are perceived today

26
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:56,770
and how they are interacted with, I guess, would be a way of stating it.

27
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,630
But if I can pull that,

28
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,190
I don't have the document right here in front of me.

29
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,770
I'm going to pull that up so I can address it specifically.

30
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,490
Seth, just a quick note.

31
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,950
I'm at the UStream site, and it seems pretty blank.

32
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,670
In other words, I can't get it to play,

33
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,950
and I got a couple of messages.

34
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:18,970
Are we broadcasting?

35
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,730
So maybe it's something to consider.

36
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,270
Okay.

37
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,850
It says I've got the broadcast going.

38
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,330
It says we have six viewers.

39
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,750
I just asked in chat to clarify, make sure that it's going out.

40
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,990
So if you can hear us, there will be probably 20 to 30-second delay,

41
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,330
I imagine, for UStream.

42
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:46,410
Maybe not quite that pronounced, but we are going to find out.

43
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,170
Is the audio live?

44
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,290
Yep, we're good.

45
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,010
Just did a check.

46
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:52,450
We're good.

47
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:52,970
All right.

48
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,370
Wonderful.

49
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,350
So, yeah, this is Uncommon Sense with the Greek and Seth.

50
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,990
You can find the webpage, which is essentially just a business card.

51
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,550
Not really a business card, but a calling card.

52
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,450
And that's at uncommonradio.com.

53
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:13,850
And, yeah.

54
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,090
Also, Seth, I shared the document with you because it was partially,

55
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:23,850
if not indirectly, addressed to you as well, or directly, I guess, somewhat.

56
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,910
And I think it's interesting as a bullet point just to go back to the document

57
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,650
that you mentioned.

58
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,870
But there's many things to be discussed every time we get together.

59
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,550
I think this might be the third or fourth time, perhaps,

60
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,890
sans the technical difficulties we do consider this might be maybe number four,

61
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,350
perhaps.

62
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,810
I just want to throw in that what we're trying to do is a sonic project,

63
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,710
and what makes it uncommon is itself being uncommon.

64
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:53,250
All right.

65
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,250
What does that mean?

66
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:00,110
Well, right now when people are going to any, let's say,

67
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:09,430
topically labeled forum, institution, or even man or woman for a particular genre

68
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,970
of information, they're getting the opposite or none of it.

69
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,810
If you go to electrical school, you learn nothing about electricity.

70
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,890
You go to divinity school, you learn nothing about the Bible.

71
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:23,070
You go to medical school, you learn nothing about the body.

72
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:26,530
You go to science school, you learn nothing about science.

73
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,390
So what's going on, right?

74
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,030
That's, I guess, what I always like to preface as the views here

75
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,810
and also the strangeness about it not being recorded, perhaps,

76
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,070
and bring your own recorder.

77
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:40,930
But this one might be.

78
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,870
But I just want to interject this is uncommon,

79
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,590
and it's uncommon in itself as well because we don't really want to tell anyone

80
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,010
anything.

81
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:57,310
We just want to share certain discoveries in a sonic way that maybe might

82
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,670
stimulate some thought or stimulate some perception.

83
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:00,730
Absolutely.

84
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:01,610
Absolutely.

85
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:09,110
I've actually said many times over the last few years that if I have any goal

86
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:14,590
or agenda in this, other than the fact that I just enjoy the conversation,

87
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:22,350
if we can get anyone out there listening to think in a way that is just a little

88
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,410
bit different or a lot bit different than what is common,

89
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:33,410
then that is something I would, I don't know if take pride in is the right word,

90
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,170
but something that would further my enjoyment of the conversation,

91
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,010
at the very least.

92
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,830
Yeah, it's just a way of being set apart.

93
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,190
You brought up some of the points that you might want to bring forward on the

94
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:48,870
document, but before maybe I want to share something.

95
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,850
I had a chat.

96
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,990
I've been going around certain people inviting me to have discussion with,

97
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,410
and this one person was befuddled in the scriptural text of,

98
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,990
I'm going to paraphrase here,

99
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,330
it's not what goes into someone's mouth that defiles them,

100
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,130
but what comes out that defiles them.

101
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,790
You've heard of that cliché sort of phrase.

102
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,890
And I've brought it up in cliché form because just about any time I've ever heard

103
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,990
anything biblical being mentioned, it's not accurate.

104
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:17,970
Sorry, folks.

105
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,190
And I didn't say everything, but just about everything might as well.

106
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,230
What's interesting about that verse, when you look at it,

107
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,330
it doesn't say that at all.

108
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:34,170
The word that's being used to defile is the prefix koiné or kinoiné.

109
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:40,810
Whenever you see that k-o-i-n prefix or part of a word, it means common.

110
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,330
And that's where you have like koiné, Greek, was the lingua franca of the age

111
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:52,090
and things that are, let's say, common is the k-o-i,

112
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,550
either prefix or mid-root part of the word.

113
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,770
And even in Strongstein's Concordance, he says, well, it means common.

114
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:00,850
It means to defile.

115
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,830
But what's interesting, being a concordance, it's not a defining.

116
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,810
Concordance just means what everyone agrees on it meaning.

117
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:15,850
And this agreement actually came from, it's in Matthew, by the way, 1511, I believe.

118
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,870
And this agreement and perception has come from the following verse,

119
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:25,050
which was after this was said, the Pharisees were very insulted or offended.

120
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:32,330
So it makes more sense, even in context, because someone being a high-level priesthood

121
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,670
or an entitled class, if they're told that they're common, indirectly or directly,

122
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,330
feel offended where the common man wouldn't.

123
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:45,510
So it's quite interesting when we look at even something as simple as the clichés

124
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,250
that are thrown out into society.

125
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,390
And what's interesting about this dialogue that I had with this person in chat

126
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,550
was they were pondering, how can that be?

127
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,350
How can something defile you that way?

128
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,790
And I'm saying you missed the point.

129
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,150
It doesn't say defiled.

130
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,750
So now your whole struggle with it is an illusion.

131
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,610
Isn't that interesting?

132
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:14,570
So a parable to that or a comparison would be, you know how they say electricity is like

133
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,190
electrons going down a wire?

134
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,970
You know, and everyone kind of agrees on that concordantly.

135
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,450
But I'm telling you, I've done so many experiments with a live wire,

136
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,090
where I've cut the wire with a dustpan in hand and a microscope,

137
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,310
and I still haven't found any electrons flowing.

138
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:36,230
And just such a simple method to test their crap, right?

139
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,610
Unfortunately, with certain things that have many layers,

140
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:43,890
where you have different conveyance of translation and language,

141
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,890
and even within the same tongue you have shop talk, right?

142
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,370
A technical language that most people are not privy of.

143
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,870
There's a conveyance that creates distortion and changes the meaning so much

144
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,870
that now the people are off track.

145
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,790
So I just want to bring up, these are the things we like to discuss.

146
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,170
Would you think that might be another way to describe what we're trying to do?

147
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,050
Certainly.

148
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,190
Yeah, absolutely.

149
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:19,190
And by the way, I hear a background, maybe a speaker or something on your end,

150
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:26,250
but since we're kind of like brought up one of the first bullet points

151
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,950
was the discussion of the gods,

152
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,530
will we bring up any kind of a topic regarding the gods?

153
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,710
The first thing that maybe should be evoked in one's mind is that

154
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,370
we're talking about formative beings,

155
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,210
things that come before, right?

156
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:48,750
Because even in the cliche form of the gods make things or made everything, right?

157
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,610
So we're looking at things that are being made.

158
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,630
That's what they do.

159
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:57,110
And what's interesting, just as a common thought,

160
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,470
you ever notice when things are being made they're dirty?

161
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,610
Like if you're machining a whole bunch of metal,

162
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,450
even when the product, even though when you've succeeded,

163
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,650
according to specification,

164
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,570
you've got to clean all the cutting fluid and chips off of it?

165
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,410
Right, absolutely.

166
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,990
Or if you're doing pottery, the pot is finished.

167
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,970
I'm not talking about it being completely fired up and all that,

168
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:24,610
but when it's finished there's like clay being slung everywhere and it's kind of messy.

169
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:29,670
Or when you're growing stuff in the garden and you pull it out,

170
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,830
it's kind of full of dirt.

171
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,210
When you paint a room, it gets cut.

172
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:34,910
You see my point?

173
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:35,250
Oh, yes.

174
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,050
Isn't it interesting?

175
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,350
Isn't it interesting how when, quote-unquote,

176
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:45,370
active creation or bringing forth is taking place or has taken place,

177
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,750
there is a certain element that has to be cleaned up?

178
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,490
What's called, let's say, the afterbirth when a woman bears a child?

179
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,490
First thing they do is start cleaning the baby.

180
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,790
Isn't it interesting?

181
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,950
You know, baking a cake.

182
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:03,990
I mean, it's interesting how formative activities in the material world

183
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,710
create a situation that needs to be cleaned up.

184
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,410
Think about that.

185
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:13,330
I think this is kind of the first time we've brought this up.

186
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,710
Boy, we're full of surprises sometimes, but think about that for a moment, folks.

187
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,750
Could it be that this epoch of man, quote-unquote, being created,

188
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:28,910
socially as well, is going to render some form of cleaning in the near future?

189
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,970
So just think about it.

190
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,950
You know, it's just when we think about these formative actions in the material sense.

191
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:38,690
Absolutely.

192
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,910
You see how much discussion?

193
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:42,890
Yeah, go ahead.

194
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,010
I managed to pull it all up.

195
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,710
I'm ready to roll with that.

196
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:55,610
There was one thing immediately that came to mind when I was reading this.

197
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,010
I'm just going to read the first paragraph here.

198
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,550
Also, we want to keep it anonymous as well.

199
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:05,790
Yeah, absolutely.

200
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,150
You can just do it loosely.

201
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,830
Okay, that's fine.

202
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:17,230
Okay, this is basically the question of the gods and the many myriad interdimensional beings

203
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,070
that share our world, if not our dimension,

204
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:25,010
as someone who has had the occasional paranormal experience, et cetera.

205
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:32,930
And what immediately came to mind is the concept and the terms dimension and interdimensional,

206
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:41,570
while being useful perhaps for thinking about things, is really not an accurate way of describing it

207
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:49,370
because dimension is just space.

208
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,270
There's only one dimension.

209
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:52,790
Exactly.

210
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,190
You have the seen and the unseen, the tangible and the intangible.

211
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:05,310
So it's a way of describing what is present but unseen, or what is present but it's intangible.

212
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:14,570
The very purpose of such a condition existing has brought forth the necessity of communication

213
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,890
and memorialization.

214
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:23,430
It's no different than having your great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather's diary.

215
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:29,670
The reason why I said great-great-great-great-great-great is because he's almost physically immaterial at this point.

216
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,770
Because if it's just your great-grandfather, some people might just want to dig him up anyway.

217
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:40,750
But I mean like someone that you had found, you had interest in, that lived so long

218
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,150
that they don't exist in the material sense at all.

219
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,690
The only thing that's left is a good memorialized communication.

220
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:54,090
Even in the pagan sense, or when I say pagan meaning let's say a lower level sense,

221
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,870
they're always trying to do what? Communicate.

222
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,090
Some form of communication.

223
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:05,090
Or even in the non-pagan way, when you get to the more informed way of how the world works,

224
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,850
there's still a communication. It's called prayer.

225
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,410
Or manifesting certain actions that show yourself.

226
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,550
Absolutely.

227
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,830
So it's all about communication.

228
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,310
And that's how it works with electricity as well.

229
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,830
And other things that are not tangible until they become tangible.

230
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:28,330
Electricity for the most part is unseen other than its results, if it's being done correctly.

231
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:30,390
Yeah.

232
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:37,370
You don't see the electrons doing what they say they do.

233
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,870
And as a matter of fact, what do you think people are going to do when they discover there's no such thing as an electron?

234
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:43,670
Not even close.

235
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,310
It's going to be interesting.

236
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,530
I always like to...

237
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,370
If you want to learn about this field, by the way, this is not a diversion.

238
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:57,410
This is to make a point about electricity in your conventional institutions.

239
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,650
It doesn't matter if they're Ivy League or 8th grade.

240
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,190
Well, let's say in universities.

241
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,170
There's two places where you learn about electricity.

242
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,430
One is the physics department.

243
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,190
The other is the electrical engineering department.

244
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,970
They usually cross the street of each other.

245
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:21,270
If you go to the electrical engineering department, they focus on the positive part of the pole, as in electricity being a positive negative phenomenon.

246
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:26,050
And the ground, the negative is sent to ground as common ground.

247
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:29,770
So you could put a plus one on the electrical engineering building.

248
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:36,130
If you go across the street to the physics building, they focus on the negative polar phenomenon of electricity.

249
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,990
And the positive is just marked as positive or source.

250
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:44,730
So you could put a negative one on the physics building.

251
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:53,790
So when you go to university, any university, what you're going to learn about electricity is what you get when you put minus one and plus one together.

252
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,230
Seth, what do we get?

253
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,410
Minus one and plus one together, that's nothing.

254
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,050
You got it.

255
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:04,710
And that's what exactly what you're going to get at university when you go to study electricity.

256
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,030
Plug it into the wall.

257
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,130
Yeah, plug it into the wall.

258
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,030
Don't ask questions.

259
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,910
I had once an academic.

260
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:18,930
I was trying to explain that an electrical generator doesn't generate electricity any more than a water pump generates water.

261
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,850
You know what he actually said?

262
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,710
This is a guy with tenure now.

263
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:27,150
This is a guy that your children, people who are out there are spending tens of thousands, right?

264
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:27,950
You're being mocked.

265
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,010
But anyway, he said there's no such thing as energy.

266
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,610
It's electrons moving down the wire.

267
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,670
You know, it's like it's such a cosmic joke.

268
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:57,330
I think when the gods want to play a joke on humanity, they get the most elevated people in any field and they place a total idiot or complete moron in that field, regardless of what field.

269
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:58,950
The least among you.

270
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,750
Yes, exactly.

271
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,150
And just to prove how blind.

272
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,609
And how undiscerning the people are.

273
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,250
They go along with it.

274
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,050
And there was an interesting story about the emperor has no clothes.

275
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,069
And it was a child that pointed it out, isn't it?

276
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:18,609
Absolutely.

277
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:19,390
They're OK.

278
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,030
So dimensions.

279
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:27,830
Would the encountering of apparitions and the like mean that we've encountered one of these gods?

280
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,870
Not necessarily.

281
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:36,610
What's interesting about the gods is you really don't know unless you're well informed and communicating.

282
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,530
There's something written about testing them.

283
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,070
Are you of such or you of the other or you of this or you of that?

284
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,470
Absolutely.

285
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:52,470
Well, and there's a part the rest of the hierarchy as well.

286
00:17:52,470 --> 00:18:08,610
Even those entities that are nonphysical, at least in the sense that we think of in the commonplace physical that are, you know, in any sort of hierarchical organization that we have reference to on Earth.

287
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,950
It's not just, you know, one tier.

288
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:11,850
There are several tiers.

289
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:18,850
So there's the lower, the lower beings, the imps, spirits that would be called demons.

290
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:26,450
Colloquially, I don't I don't like using that word because the connotation that we have with it in English is just inaccurate.

291
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:33,330
Comes from the Latin, you know, Damon, which is just a word for spirit.

292
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:39,930
It is one that we have through through tradition.

293
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,330
We have demonized the word, as it were.

294
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:48,230
So, you know, by the way, I was on a discussion recently.

295
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:53,250
It was actually a public one that was on air and there were maybe half a dozen people there.

296
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:59,250
And they all admitted with their own volition that knowledge and information has nothing to do with anything.

297
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:00,690
It's your intent.

298
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,830
Could you believe?

299
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:12,910
I just wanted to bring this in here because this discussion gets very touchy because how many people say, I don't believe that I am quite happy with what I believe.

300
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:19,790
And there's one thing to be able to drag out something tangible and material.

301
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,790
Post discussion to confirm or provide as evidence.

302
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:30,250
But you're not going to necessarily pull a God out of your hat to show someone, you know what I mean?

303
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:30,630
Right.

304
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:42,470
So they've taken the high ground regarding really any topic that information and knowledge has nothing to do with anything.

305
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,290
It's strictly what your intent or belief is.

306
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:48,970
This is how people are rolling in public, folks.

307
00:19:50,110 --> 00:20:00,870
Oh, there are people making thousands and tens and thousands and hundreds of thousands of dollars getting up in front of large groups and telling people that very thing.

308
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:07,870
The other comment was when I brought up some things that anyone could access, you know, the soul, the spirit, reincarnation, things like that.

309
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,830
They didn't want to acknowledge what was being said.

310
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,150
They just wanted to acknowledge that.

311
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,690
How can all these people be fooled?

312
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:19,010
The reason why we say it is this way, because all these other people are saying it.

313
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:19,950
Right.

314
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,990
And and again, like in terms of the alternative media, it's the same thing.

315
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,410
Have you ever noticed TV ads?

316
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,130
Millions have been sold and everyone's like, oh, good.

317
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,190
They sold millions of them.

318
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,610
You know, must be good because everybody's buying into it.

319
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,850
It's kind of like another analogy.

320
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,330
I went to this or natural store.

321
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:44,190
I wanted to get some spray on insect repellent for some people complaining about bugs.

322
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,050
And of course, it's the way they eat that bug.

323
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:46,410
Anyway.

324
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,990
So I asked the lady, you know, where the insect repellent is.

325
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,610
And can she please guide me through?

326
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,350
Because I didn't want to sit there and read everything.

327
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,050
And she goes, this is the one that everybody buys.

328
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,970
And I said, oh, I don't want that one then.

329
00:20:59,070 --> 00:20:59,970
And she goes, what do you mean?

330
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,490
I said, have you met everybody yet?

331
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,530
And have you met the general people?

332
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,390
Do you are you paying attention who your customers are?

333
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,290
I don't want what they want.

334
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,290
I want something more set apart.

335
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,970
You see, I want something just because everyone is getting it.

336
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,110
You see the point here?

337
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,110
I immediately reject it.

338
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,910
Based on statistical information.

339
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,330
Not because what everyone wants may not be good.

340
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,550
Because everyone wants to breathe air.

341
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,510
I'm not going to say I'll breathe water instead.

342
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,250
Right.

343
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:32,110
But categorically, it's pretty safe to reject it if the public has accepted it.

344
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,290
And even the private in many cases.

345
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,150
It's pretty safe, but you have to discern it again.

346
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:38,550
You see.

347
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:47,570
What brings them, these apparitions referred to, to our realm?

348
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,490
A magical call, a personal visit of their own accord with an agenda.

349
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,150
And I would, again, that's the whole question.

350
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,250
But I would say the idea of bringing them to our realm.

351
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,590
Is sort of a miscommunication or a misnomer.

352
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,030
There's several problems with that.

353
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:12,690
We're simply because what evidence does anyone have that it's our realm?

354
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,910
But that's the language that man will develop.

355
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,830
This is not a criticism on who wrote it at all.

356
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,050
This is typical.

357
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:22,550
I mean.

358
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:23,790
Yeah, absolutely.

359
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,530
And if the author is listening, please don't take it as that.

360
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,570
This is just the way that we address language.

361
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:36,570
Well, that's why I would suggest maybe just being not adhering to the literal message.

362
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,910
But just the general gist of it.

363
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,430
Because there's so much.

364
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:46,850
Even with a wheel that's like loose and wobbly and semi-flat.

365
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,290
You'll still get to where you're going.

366
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,410
Is the point.

367
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,930
Okay, so let me rephrase this question then.

368
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:59,630
What would cause these non-physical entities to interact with us on a personal level?

369
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,730
Nothing and everything.

370
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,210
It's not up to us.

371
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:09,250
And a lot of these interesting aspects are well worth thinking about.

372
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:15,350
But a lot of the, let's say, what might seem more mechanical or technical aspects with interacting with the gods.

373
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,390
Sorry, folks.

374
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:17,150
I hate to say it.

375
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,530
But you lack the maturity to do so.

376
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:26,630
We're talking about beings that have relatively, you know, using the colloquial term IQ of 2 million plus.

377
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:30,690
Even their most simplest communication.

378
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,450
They don't do anything in futility, by the way.

379
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:39,450
Anything that even man sees as being befuddled by is their baby talk.

380
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,590
We are given enough information about the gods.

381
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,850
And this is a general brush statement which is fairly accurate.

382
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:56,010
We are given information about the gods and evidence of them for simple reasons such as you don't have to wonder.

383
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,110
Right?

384
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:59,290
And also you've been told certain things.

385
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,050
Right?

386
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,950
So you're without excuse.

387
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:13,070
And also given we're made privy of the gods and their ways so we can actually have an advantage over those who don't.

388
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,390
When I say we, it's whoever we is.

389
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,550
And that goes both for doing harm and for doing good.

390
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:34,270
Typically the human element, this might be a little off the question, that wants to manifest a lot of the things that the gods are instructing or capable of giving are doing it from malevolent purposes.

391
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,650
Just about across the board.

392
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:46,110
The benevolent side of it, if you look at the benevolent side of these communications, it basically tells you to set yourself apart and do nothing.

393
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:46,890
Sorry.

394
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,030
You know, in other words, within the group at large.

395
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,210
Right.

396
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:58,050
The benevolent side seems to be ever present.

397
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,850
Not something that has to be coaxed.

398
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,250
Worked.

399
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:03,510
Yeah.

400
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,530
Like doesn't have to.

401
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:06,790
Yeah.

402
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:07,930
It's.

403
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:09,450
Like you do.

404
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:10,710
Yeah.

405
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,410
The actual.

406
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,930
All the religions of the world.

407
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:13,590
All of them.

408
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,350
All of them.

409
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:15,110
Shall we say it again?

410
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,270
All of them.

411
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:16,850
All of them.

412
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:22,250
Every denomination of every religion is 150 percent malevolent.

413
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,970
Why did I say 150 percent?

414
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:34,390
Because 100 percent for the exacting fact and truth about them and 50 percent thrown in for what they're going to do tomorrow or the next day, which we don't know yet.

415
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:38,990
But that's pretty easy to see with a little bit of discernment.

416
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:44,690
And when I say easy, meaning all you got to do is look at what something is based on.

417
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:45,870
Period.

418
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:56,830
Doesn't matter if it's a religion, if it's money, if it's a story that's supposed to be about something that is accessibly physically accessible, about a communication.

419
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:05,830
If it's baseless, unfounded or fiat, well, they're fixing on doing something that ain't very good.

420
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,230
And the only way.

421
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,030
Yeah.

422
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:13,090
The only way you could succeed with fixing on doing something bad.

423
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,470
Let's keep it simple.

424
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:19,350
As always, by presenting it as something as being good.

425
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:21,690
Absolutely.

426
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:26,110
With fail safes, with fail safes built in, like plausible deniability, all this other stuff.

427
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:27,830
Very simple.

428
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:29,350
You know.

429
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,070
Yeah.

430
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:31,150
Question.

431
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:45,190
I'm not going to read it anymore, but the question comes up on the word deities and referring to these entities as the specifically the gods and that deities just comes from Dios or.

432
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:48,630
Or dual.

433
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:49,430
Yeah.

434
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:58,770
And that's just one of the words that English translates into the word God or God's deities.

435
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:00,250
You know, plural would be gods.

436
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:06,450
The phrase adios in Spanish to come to mind.

437
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,310
Yeah.

438
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:28,190
Well, what's interesting about this is we've said publicly years ago, Seth, when I say years more than two or three, perhaps that the society at large, every culture and all people will have this urge to gain.

439
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:35,790
Interest in this realm, the realm of the gods and spiritual things, let's say, of the mind.

440
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:42,510
But you can see an increased discussion as a product of the interest.

441
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:50,830
It'll be, you know, the everyday discussion all the way to Hollywood, to literary art, whatever government.

442
00:27:51,830 --> 00:28:02,130
But one thing we discussed years ago is opposing or within this interest, let's say, is the lack of still the lack of clarity and accuracy.

443
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:04,550
But that's not the important part.

444
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,050
The important part is that there is a focus on that topic or this topic.

445
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:20,150
We brought this up years ago, and we could see now how more people are catching on to whether it's the large institutions or just the man on the street or woman on the street.

446
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:28,350
There's an interest in this subject, but all in all, it'll be very still inaccurate and misplaced.

447
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:38,190
And that's pretty easy to discuss why when you actually look about what's written about this time and what's called prophecies and things like that.

448
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:41,890
So, yeah, I just want to bring that up as well.

449
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,970
So this is sort of concordant with the times what we're discussing right now.

450
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,350
Absolutely.

451
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:59,350
And in these deities and gods have been referred to in many different ways throughout history and where they are referred to, a lot of it is considered myth.

452
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:24,990
And in the Western world, we are taught that it is simply allegory and ways that what we see is primitive man describing a natural process or natural processes that would be otherwise indescribable to these primitive minds,

453
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:31,110
which is not an accurate way of being facetious.

454
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,790
But, well, yeah.

455
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:37,790
And the irony of it is they're calling electrons after Electra anyway, which is mythological.

456
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,570
So it's in line.

457
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,830
So anyway, absolutely.

458
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:49,990
I've through my studies, I've come to look at most mythology as simply just a history that's been relatively obscured through language.

459
00:29:49,990 --> 00:30:10,170
One example that you shared with me probably more than a couple of years ago was the instances in myths where you will hear of people being turned to pigs and the connotation there is actually cannibalism.

460
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:25,350
I mean, where you see read in a myth or a story or history of like a group of people being turned into pigs, it very most likely means that they were slaughtered and consumed.

461
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:34,150
And what's what's interesting about that is that let's say you brought up the myths.

462
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:40,110
And we look at what's being handed to us, served on a plate about the myths.

463
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:45,330
And we start researching, let's say, the literary origins, how these stories have been preserved.

464
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,750
Because if it's just oral, I mean, you can only go back to whoever's alive.

465
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:55,590
But if it's literary and written, you start looking at how many hands it's changed and the studies that have been done through the years.

466
00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:13,010
And you find that there's some research being done where some of these demagogues and especially through what's called the Age of Heroes before the dynastic reigns of Egypt, for example, you will find that these were kings or personalities that were deified as well.

467
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,430
And it's still being done today.

468
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:20,850
That's why you have something called idolization of musicians and film stars.

469
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:27,950
I mean, you know, they even have what a merit show or, you know, Elvis has left the building or something.

470
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,170
You know how this is idolization.

471
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:30,750
This has been going on for a very long time.

472
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:35,150
I mean, could you imagine if there was another four or five hundred or a thousand years?

473
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:48,810
Isn't it possible that the very existence of a man called Elvis Presley walking the earth can be twisted and turned into a demagogue and some mythological figure who rained lightning down from a microphone or something?

474
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:50,710
Yeah.

475
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,130
Yeah.

476
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:55,150
If you believe that there are electrons running down wires, you'll believe any anyway.

477
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:55,930
Would you say that?

478
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,170
OK.

479
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:57,110
Yeah.

480
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:59,230
Yeah.

481
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:08,810
And if you feel the apotheosis of George Washington is a painting inside of one of the Capitol domes that comes to mind.

482
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,370
Yeah.

483
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:10,530
Oh, yeah.

484
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,890
What's next after that?

485
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,950
A hologram of him?

486
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,290
You know, what's that?

487
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,130
And then after the hologram, what are they going to do?

488
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,290
Put some glue and meat and metal together.

489
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,490
You know, this is how humans roll.

490
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:30,410
Speaking of hologram, that is another concept that is brought up in the in the email.

491
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:45,550
The question of whether we exist in a holographic simulation, the holographic, you know, coming from the words hologram or holograph.

492
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:49,890
Holo being the whole link is in holistic.

493
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:50,690
Yeah.

494
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:51,390
Yeah.

495
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:56,790
And, you know, gram or graph being image the whole picture.

496
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,010
So in one way, yes.

497
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,010
And simulation.

498
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:06,550
Well, you know, what we are experiencing, I would say, is is real colloquially.

499
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:19,510
But at the same time, whether or not it's a colloquial holographic simulation would be completely and totally based upon your perspective and where you were seeing it from.

500
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:31,770
Because, you know, to my experience in my, you know, my mind or spirit and the observations that I've I've made, it's very real.

501
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:49,470
But at the same time, looking if I had, you know, I was looking at it from a higher perspective, be that of number of years or literal, you know, just height that that could be considered differently.

502
00:33:49,470 --> 00:34:01,830
You know, the question, you know, the Matrix films always come to mind when people talk about that, because that's the main premise is a simulation within a simulation almost.

503
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:09,969
And so looking at the word hologram or holograph like we did, we look at the word Matrix and that word is just womb.

504
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:11,530
That's that's what that means.

505
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,330
You know, formative, a formative place.

506
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:14,690
Right.

507
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:38,010
So the Hollywood of the mind and how such motion pictures and, you know, all media affects the way that we think and bleeds over into the way that we color in things that we don't comprehend completely is is very interesting.

508
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:44,310
And it's can be difficult to kind of separate thought from the images that have been pumped into our minds.

509
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:58,670
But it's I think that that's an important thing to do, especially with studying these things, because the things that we're talking about, you know, any of the scriptures and stuff like that, what is presented through any form of media, even in discussion about it's inaccurate.

510
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:11,590
So, of course, the the images and the stories that are reproduced from these poor versions are lacking in in any sense of veracity.

511
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:20,450
Yeah, there's there's an objectivity also that you could lay out all the pieces and to say that it's a hologram is lacking.

512
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:28,250
But if from certain respects where, you know, there's an empirical and ephemeral, you know, the part that can't change and the part that can change.

513
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,970
And we're told that anything can change by the formative forces.

514
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,870
So from that aspect, maybe.

515
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:47,010
And from another aspect, what's interesting about a hologram is that if you were to tear a hologram up into smaller pieces, the entire images in each small piece can still part of it is preserved.

516
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:51,250
Right. If you hold it on just the right angle, you still see the whole picture in every fragment.

517
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:56,490
So there's a fractal nature to it. But I believe that using that term can be applicable.

518
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:01,170
But it's it's heavily discounting what can be perceived.

519
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:05,610
And just to throw this out very often, I've said, well, I'm not going to discuss certain things.

520
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:10,470
I'll just throw those things out just to satisfy some curiosity.

521
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:15,390
And you just spin off and people could look at it at themselves.

522
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:23,430
There is a subject of the intangible, not only about the gods, but also like we keep bringing up the nature of electricity.

523
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:29,250
Well, what's interesting about electricity, for example, what we call electricity or this manifestation.

524
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:34,590
Rudolf Steiner wrote something about counter space during the early development of electrical engineering.

525
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:40,770
And which was also this thing called counter space is a space that's counter to space.

526
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:45,170
So in other words, when you're in counter space, space seems to appear solid.

527
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:49,630
But material seems to be space when you're in a material world.

528
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:53,930
The material is solid and the space is just, well, space.

529
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:59,990
The interaction between these two spaces and they're both quite physical, by the way.

530
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:07,830
And it's really difficult to imagine the properties of counter space because you have to be able to turn your mind inside out like a sock.

531
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:11,110
But either way, because we're very materialistic.

532
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:17,430
The concept of counter space has to be understood before you can actually work with electricity and engineer things.

533
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:23,030
Before you find out that you made something so big it tends to you can't shut it off or it explodes. Right.

534
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:30,430
And Charles Proteus Steinmetz is one of the most intelligent engineers that ever lived.

535
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,730
Or I should use that word intelligent, most diligent and fruitful.

536
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,650
It was now hidden in history, by the way.

537
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:40,510
Einstein wouldn't be worth tying his shoelaces.

538
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:49,290
Pretty much came up with the concept of the square root of minus one, which is another concept.

539
00:37:49,290 --> 00:38:00,170
I mean, not with the concept of square root of minus one, but to apply it to discerning how we manage counter space manifestations into space, i.e. electricity.

540
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:06,530
So I just want to throw that in there because the concept of a hologram is very easily received.

541
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:16,090
But what really is going on, as evidenced by electrical fields and magnetic fields and other things like that, is far more different, not complex.

542
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:21,250
Because if you can't use eighth grade math to rationalize anything, it's not worth rationalizing, really.

543
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:28,090
So there are many aspects to this physical world that evidence a non-physical world that predominates in many instances.

544
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:31,790
So I do like the analogy of the hologram.

545
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:43,290
But it's an oversimplification, like Gustave Le Bon wrote in his crowd, that now has gotten it away from the meaning so it could be easily accepted.

546
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:51,730
So I don't know if we cleared anything up or not for anyone, but there's a discussion.

547
00:38:52,050 --> 00:39:05,370
I think that one of these programs in the near or distant future, we may open to call-ins through Skype because that's the easiest way to do it.

548
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:12,450
But I've done that a lot and that's not what I'm trying to do with our conversations here.

549
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:21,850
But I know that there are people out there that would like to join us, perhaps, for a little while in discussion.

550
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,650
And that came to mind, so I thought that I would speak it.

551
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:33,390
Oh, clearly. I do like the input of any kind as well.

552
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:44,250
Absolutely. Ed, the website UncommonRadio.com does have an email address listed there that you can send us any sort of communication that you would like.

553
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:48,710
UncommonSenseRadio1 at Gmail.

554
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:53,290
That's right. UncommonSenseRadio1 at Gmail.com.

555
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:54,630
Numeric one.

556
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:14,610
Another thing that is brought up that is certainly in line with the discussion is the concept of external input as dealing with thought, actually.

557
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:24,870
With the brain as a receiver and a transmitter, not just a closed system, as it were.

558
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:40,530
And we are, you know, humans are kind of built like trees upside down with our roots, you know, the myriad of nerves, as they call them, and whatnot that make up the brain.

559
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:40,890
Root ball.

560
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:41,430
Yeah.

561
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,490
So we're kind of like upside down trees.

562
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:48,410
Our limbs, you know, our legs and our arms.

563
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:55,930
And still this concept of, you know, where do thoughts come from?

564
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:15,670
Some of the obvious things that I think are often missed because they're not really addressed is the super form of those, like communication, listening to people speak, you know, words, television, images.

565
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:24,010
These things cause us to think in ways that we would not perhaps think if we were not subjected to them.

566
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:43,170
But beyond that, I think what is being referenced in the question and bringing it up is the more, certainly our physical but intangible inputs that are received.

567
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,890
So where do thoughts come from?

568
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:53,090
Well, in order to process the thoughts and the input, also you need an operating system.

569
00:41:53,190 --> 00:42:01,490
I like to give that plain example, and that mankind is very different, and we're not animals in that respect.

570
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:10,370
And I always give the analogy of a dog, a very young puppy being raised by a family of gorillas, then adopted as an adult dog, would act just like a regular dog.

571
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:17,550
You would not be able to discern that it was raised by apes, where if a very, very young child was raised to adulthood by apes, guess what?

572
00:42:19,090 --> 00:42:21,350
It would be very easy to discern that they were.

573
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,690
Anyway, I've been in public lately, and I've seen what, but anyway, that's another discussion.

574
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:36,990
So the concept of the operating system and the thought being the program or the file, let's say, being run.

575
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:44,050
But again, going back to the upside-down plant, this is an ethereal, primal, formative energy approach.

576
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:52,490
And maybe discussing the nature of plants might be something that can be used allegorically or metaphorically,

577
00:42:53,030 --> 00:43:03,790
simply because it's a very interesting analogy to say that maybe the human body, ethereally or formatively, archetypally, is an upside-down plant,

578
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:10,430
the brain being the root ball, the limbs are, well, the limbs, and where the seed is and the flower are the sexual organs.

579
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:15,290
So what's interesting about that is what do you know about plants?

580
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:22,050
And just to give a discussion I had with a university dendrochronology department, dendro meaning tree, chronology meaning time,

581
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:28,190
it's actually the number two or number one lab in the world, and they wanted to discuss trees.

582
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:34,930
And I said, well, you guys are really into trees, and it doesn't seem like you do a lot of describing but no explanation.

583
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,350
And I said, well, you know, I'm not going to ask you.

584
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:42,370
In my mind I'm thinking I'm going to ask these dummies what a tree is.

585
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:45,010
These are like high-level university people.

586
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:52,530
So what I figured instead of like berating them like I do on radio in person, what I did was I said, well, listen,

587
00:43:52,530 --> 00:44:03,050
if you could explain to me how one blade of grass grows, I'd be glad to spend the time that you're asking me with you to look at what you want to present.

588
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:08,970
And they all went, mom, they all just looked at me, you know, like, can't do that.

589
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:11,630
Yes, absolutely.

590
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:14,350
They can't even explain how one blade of grass grows.

591
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:20,030
They could describe the how but the why, like why does one blade of grass grow?

592
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:25,410
Now, you can't fault them for their ignorance, but you can, you should, because they're bleeding.

593
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:29,270
They're parasitical on society at this point, but yes, they are parasitical.

594
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:37,140
And if you want to know what I mean by that, look up the word parasite and predatory on the people, which I find disgusting.

595
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,290
I'm not saying that they shouldn't exist.

596
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,430
Places of higher learning should exist by all means.

597
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:46,530
We just actually said that we require that as a species.

598
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:53,330
But the current condition is, to say the least.

599
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:54,310
Now, those are the good words.

600
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:56,330
I'll tell you what I really think of them.

601
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:10,930
But in a sense, the aspect of approaching them with even an archetype or parallel or anything that might be comparative is completely rejected and refused.

602
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:12,530
Of course, you know, they're running a religion.

603
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:16,230
I think we've discussed this before, something that they want people to do.

604
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,790
When I say religion, I mean it loosely.

605
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:28,150
If you approach any of these people that supposedly hold knowledge in society today and you refuse to bow at their altar, you are quickly shown the door.

606
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:37,690
Or, if you're wise enough, if you realize there's an altar that they want you to bow to, why hang around and wait for them to hit you in the knees with a baseball bat so you do bow down?

607
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:41,030
Just go for the door while you can still walk.

608
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:48,030
So, in essence, a lot of the things that we like to say are not because this is how they are so.

609
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:56,650
But it's like, why isn't anyone looking at these simple things, at least for the young ones, the young people that we know are so impressionable?

610
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:06,610
So the concept of looking at the mind, looking at the body, and the plant as being an archetype is quite interesting in itself.

611
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:10,210
Which, by the way, Seth, we could dedicate the next four hours on just that discussion.

612
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,390
We may not want to do that.

613
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:26,090
But the concept of being eluded and being distracted by change, in other words, when we discuss things, we take a slice of things that change, right?

614
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:28,190
Like a photograph, right?

615
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:35,290
Or when you go to learn about something, you know, a machine, or you're looking about how a car works, you look at a piston.

616
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:36,570
That's not the piston in action.

617
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:38,010
It's a slice of it, right?

618
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:42,910
And it does change as it wears out, and it did have material had to go through change to form a piston.

619
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:52,630
But I mean that we have gone away from actually being objective about these slices in time, how things do change.

620
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:57,890
And we figure because they do change, and how they change, we grade them on their significance, right?

621
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:05,470
So if we look at elements of change and take a slice of reality, like in a still photograph of something moving,

622
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:13,010
if you were to study the dendric nature, or the branches of a tree, or the root system of a tree as it spreads through soil,

623
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:20,010
typically not a root ball now, but the actual spreading out, or the capillaries of your eye, or a lightning bolt,

624
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:29,230
which is I guess described as a Lichtenfield or Lichtenberg pattern, or high voltage sparks, photograph of a high voltage emission,

625
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:32,390
you'll notice they all share the same geometric forms.

626
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:36,390
You see? So there's an underlying archetype.

627
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:40,930
Now, if you want to say that it's just random, that's fine.

628
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:48,970
But how can something be judged so random, and ha, ha, ha, oh, isn't it funny how it's similar, and not be observed with scrutiny?

629
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:52,350
You see my point? This is what the academics have failed.

630
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:53,950
And they will not, by the way.

631
00:47:53,950 --> 00:48:03,850
In your society, currently, you will never get the truth or anything tangible, a tangible explanation out of the academia in this society.

632
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:13,270
The next society will, quite clearly, because if you didn't, there would be no reason to end this society and start another one, or a continuance of it.

633
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:17,430
So the interesting part here is just a real simple way to sum it up.

634
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:25,350
If you look at a high discharge of a high voltage emission through gas, or even across a piece of solid, you know, what we call a lightning strike,

635
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:32,850
or high voltage discharge, look at how similar it is to the capillaries in your eye, or the roots or branches of a tree.

636
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:36,770
You see? And that's a good place to start.

637
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:44,990
And we're talking about not the change, because, well, Greek, how can you say a tree that takes 300 years to grow is the same as a lightning bolt,

638
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:47,610
which flashes in a tenth of a second, or a second or so.

639
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,070
I'm not saying that.

640
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:55,450
What I prefaced earlier is that because we've been deluded by the nature of things changing, we don't see the similarity,

641
00:48:55,590 --> 00:49:00,550
but we have the ability to take a slice and freeze frame of all these things and show how they're all the same.

642
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:06,450
So this is partly the study of how formative things work.

643
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,730
And believe it or not, this is a discussion for the gods.

644
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:16,310
This is, if you're discussing this with people who are completely descended, have descended into materialism,

645
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:25,890
they will quickly shift into how things change and show that as the irrelevant point, where, you know, how, again,

646
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:31,150
how can a 300-year-old tree have anything similar with a tenth of a second lightning strike,

647
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:37,610
where if you're to eliminate the delusion of change or what you have emphasis you've put on the rate of change

648
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:42,650
and looked at a freeze frame of it, you would see they're almost identical in archetype form.

649
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:47,110
In other words, there's a pattern, and this pattern is behind everything.

650
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:52,990
And not only is this pattern behind everything, it's behind things you don't see and perceive,

651
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:57,830
and it's being used over and over and over at different rates of change.

652
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,710
It works really, really well.

653
00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:08,430
Yes. And this is the foundation of all discernment, by the way.

654
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:18,450
In other words, if someone's screaming hateful stuff at you for three seconds or 30 hours, what's the difference?

655
00:50:20,850 --> 00:50:25,030
Stop thinking of how long something is being done for, whether it's good or bad or irrelevant.

656
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,250
It's that it's being done.

657
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:39,850
And a practical application that I have, I don't know, adopted with that, you know,

658
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:44,590
just with the considering of where thought comes from,

659
00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:54,590
is that if you are aware of the similarities between, you know, transmission and reception of information

660
00:50:54,590 --> 00:51:02,730
and the interaction of the mind with the physical world, you know, if you're, just as an example,

661
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:12,030
if you're watching something on a television and you don't like it or don't want to watch it for whatever reason,

662
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:13,910
you change the channel.

663
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:20,830
And when you start to have the realization that thoughts are coming in

664
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:24,950
and they're not, you know, they're not always beneficial.

665
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:31,910
Some of them are very detrimental to the health of one's mind or one's body.

666
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:39,430
And you realize that you can metaphorically change the channel.

667
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:49,710
It's not always quite that easy or simple, but just having the awareness that it's not all coming from within,

668
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:54,390
that a lot of this is external input and external input that is not tangible.

669
00:51:55,670 --> 00:52:05,610
You still have, you know, the brain is a pretty neat organ for the mind and for the spirits to interact with the physical world.

670
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:11,790
And in that with, you know, the more that you're aware of how such things work,

671
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:17,370
the mechanics, specifically those that are, you know, not widely discussed,

672
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:24,370
it gives one the ability to think better, I guess, or at least differently.

673
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:28,410
And, you know, almost the ability to change the channel.

674
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:33,570
The whole process seems to be taken for granted as people do many things.

675
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:39,490
Some of it is just absolutely taking for granted and being insensitive, like the concept of walking.

676
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:43,250
Or once you've got it, you never forget.

677
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,630
You know, once you learn to think, you don't forget.

678
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,830
It's kind of like riding a bicycle, right?

679
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:57,290
There's the aspect of the manipulation of the thought, meaning, you know, using your hand or figuratively of your own thoughts,

680
00:52:57,390 --> 00:53:02,550
understanding that they're streaming in and going out is difficult because it's just simply taken for granted.

681
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:06,930
Ask a six-month-old why they can't get up and run around the block.

682
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:11,130
Well, it's because they're still crawling on the rug and they're very happy with learning how to stand and walk.

683
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:14,170
Or someone who can't ride a bicycle, you see.

684
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:17,310
But once you learn those things, you don't think about them anymore.

685
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:27,430
That's the aspect that's being taken for granted and the discernment falls apart because of that, let's call it emotional or spiritual laziness.

686
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:33,530
And on the other hand, the thoughts are simply like Seth was relating on the television.

687
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:38,550
Right away, my mind went to the psychotronic aspect, but I don't think you were discussing the psychotronics of it.

688
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:41,170
You know, subliminal messages and pulse frequencies and things.

689
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:44,730
You're just discussing the simple suggestion of a thought or concept.

690
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:53,150
And like the television changing the channel is very much the thought process, again, bringing it forward to the senses,

691
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:57,810
would be as if you walked into a cafe and you're asked, what would you like to eat?

692
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:02,610
And you're presented with a menu and you see, you know, chicken sandwich, tuna sandwich, veggie sandwich, salad, soup.

693
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:06,850
That's exactly what all of our thoughts are like, but it happens so quickly.

694
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:17,850
And because we take it for the process for granted, we've pretty much fallen into this emotional laziness and in this befuddlement and bewilderment state.

695
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:20,290
Absolutely.

696
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:23,330
And yeah, there's a concept also.

697
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:25,850
The speed of thought, people are instant.

698
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:28,430
We think very quickly.

699
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:34,870
And I would say that it's almost better to think slowly and to consider one's thoughts.

700
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:36,130
Exactly.

701
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:38,750
Think before you speak.

702
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:42,050
Absolutely.

703
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:50,570
So the thought aspect, that will be understood more as we get into other things.

704
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:57,730
And by the way, there's a lot of, do we want to preface, there's a field called psychiatry or psychology around this, right?

705
00:54:57,830 --> 00:54:59,470
And the PSY means the spirit.

706
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:00,570
Yeah, study of the spirit.

707
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:03,410
Yeah, the study of the spirit is what they are.

708
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:07,770
And by the way, folks, anyone who wants to see one of these guys should have their head examined.

709
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:15,470
So anyway, and the only purpose these psychos are there, psychiatrists, psychologists, are there to keep you in check.

710
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:21,270
Because typically when these topics are brought up, it's a threat in modern society.

711
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:32,850
And even back then, if you actually look at it objectively, the field of psychiatry or psychology is generally brought up in common when someone is being threatened by it.

712
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:35,190
So it's actually weaponized spiritualism.

713
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,170
Anyway, I just thought I'd throw that in there.

714
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:39,090
Maybe it sounds creative.

715
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:39,570
I don't know.

716
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:45,470
It's like most anything that we come into.

717
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:48,150
It's a system of government.

718
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:55,510
It's a system of a religious organization with tenets and scripture that they follow.

719
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,770
It's just a lot of it's very recent.

720
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:10,290
And what's interesting, what's been brought forward in these fields and the people that have been accredited with it, like Freud and Jung and others,

721
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:20,290
if you go and actually study what these people that were accredited with these fields were actually studying or trying to bring forth,

722
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:24,130
is not what the field that is using these men's names is doing anyway.

723
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:30,730
Freud started off, for example, with the study of electrical impulses in the body.

724
00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:36,070
You notice that when different emotions gave different electrical fields on the skin.

725
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:43,250
So, I mean, it's just bizarre what's being put forward that what these men were about.

726
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:47,270
I mean, obviously, they descended into something to be socially acceptable.

727
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:51,270
If you look at alternative media, you know, forget about it.

728
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:51,850
Thank you.

729
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:55,670
I've seen that. I'm good.

730
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:57,310
Yeah. It's just bizarre. Yeah.

731
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:00,290
So, again, folks, I mean, where do we...

732
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:12,530
Seth, you know, I don't know what we stepped into with this Uncommon Sense Radio because it's so bizarre, so sublime to discuss reality from an objective point of view.

733
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:16,550
It almost feels like you're... you cannot communicate it effectively.

734
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:25,950
Yeah, well, certainly with difficulty and with complete accuracy, I'd say at this point in time, it's next to impossible.

735
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:31,870
But with more accuracy than what is common, absolutely.

736
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:34,770
And I, you know, I think that's what we've stepped into.

737
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:36,330
Yeah.

738
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:44,630
Meaning I think that one of the things that mankind or current society across the board has succeeded in is their ability to not communicate

739
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:46,810
and still get some things done.

740
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:49,630
If you think about that for a minute.

741
00:57:50,170 --> 00:58:02,930
Yeah, I had no interest in further broadcasting radio or conversations at all until we spoke about doing this together.

742
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:16,970
So, you know, it's on one level, it's certainly self-serving for me because I find the conversations very edifying, very building and uncommon.

743
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:20,850
You know, these are conversations that are very uncommon.

744
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:23,850
It's an aptly titled broadcast.

745
00:58:25,530 --> 00:58:34,110
Something that I did want to jump into just a little bit is health, health.

746
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:42,130
You know, we spoke last time about a little bit, you know, scratching the surface, as it were, is health.

747
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:47,330
And I had one one specific thing I wanted to talk to you about.

748
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:52,230
And I was going to bring it up privately, but it's nothing that needs to remain private.

749
00:58:52,230 --> 00:59:10,050
I was just curious, you know, with the seasons changing as they are where I am, you know, on the rock, at least the weather changing can put stress on the body as well as, you know, the foods that we eat and the things that are not food that we eat.

750
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:13,030
But cheese, some cheeses.

751
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:13,890
Yeah, I found out.

752
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:25,770
So on a specific level, I'm curious what what your input would be on like a swollen or irritated lymph node.

753
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:31,830
Not not for myself, but for a friend, because I like to help people.

754
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:38,670
Well, essentially, there's something people could research, especially if you're hearing about us on the computer.

755
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:40,350
Lymphology.

756
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:43,730
And you'll notice is very little about that.

757
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,170
And there's more lymph fluid in the body than blood.

758
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:48,350
So it is very important.

759
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:55,910
The lymph fluid somehow has a very interesting way in its presence in all living things.

760
00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:02,630
And typically anything that's swollen is a state of expansion, heat, explosiveness.

761
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:05,870
It's not it's not functioning correctly.

762
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:07,470
Right. That would be the simplest thing.

763
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:13,850
So if anyone wants to go and research lymphology, unfortunately, there's only there's very little about it.

764
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:15,730
And it's most of it was sort of parented.

765
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:21,670
The study was parented by a fellow in the 50s or 60s under the name of Wood, perhaps, or something.

766
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:29,630
You know, something called the golden whatever bow or not the golden about golden mean or something about lymph system and golden.

767
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:34,930
And he's the only one that I found online that's published anything or anything prevalent out there.

768
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:41,230
But essentially, the lymph fluid doesn't is very passive compared to the blood.

769
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:47,850
Swelling through general tissue is when the lymph fluid gets in between interstitial spaces.

770
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:53,770
And part of the simple things of understanding lymphology is it likes compression.

771
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:58,950
That's why if anyone gets a cut or a bruise, your initial reaction is to grab it and squeeze it.

772
01:00:58,950 --> 01:01:06,770
Well, what's not really taught is that when there is a cut or an injury to the body, it should be squeezed as much as you can for as long as you can.

773
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:09,230
And then releasing it to let things flow.

774
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:16,710
But if you have a swollen lymph node in an area where you can't do that, typically they're in between joints or under soft parts of the body.

775
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:23,410
That would indicate something is the body is producing that it shouldn't be producing or is being stimulated to produce.

776
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:25,090
It's behind the jaw.

777
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:27,490
Yeah, that's it.

778
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:30,550
That's a typical one for something very local near the head.

779
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:31,830
So it could be a tooth.

780
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:33,430
It could be a sinus.

781
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:34,610
It could be an eye.

782
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:35,890
It could be.

783
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:36,470
Yeah.

784
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:37,290
Yeah.

785
01:01:37,290 --> 01:01:42,510
I've actually seen an experience myself and through others that just the very nature of working.

786
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:47,050
Let's say someone out in the field and gets a splinter in their hand.

787
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:51,170
The lymph node around the elbow or armpit will swell if it's not treated properly.

788
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:58,450
So usually in terms of diagnosis, the best diagnosis is self-diagnosis if one is looking for self-treatment.

789
01:01:58,690 --> 01:02:07,750
But anything lymph like that, typically the most susceptible in the jaw or in that part is the teeth, right?

790
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:11,170
And there's the teeth or a whole other study.

791
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:18,990
But all of these things need to be looked at from a lymphatic point of view and what the lymph system is about.

792
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:21,730
And, for example, I think the pusture.

793
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:22,570
Don't hold me.

794
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:23,350
I'm paraphrasing here.

795
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:25,410
It's been over 25 years since I've looked at it.

796
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:30,710
But you've heard of how blood testing is done in the medical fields very prevalently?

797
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:31,450
Yes.

798
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:43,890
Well, one of the older institutes in Europe that were quite successful in many of the initial studies and discoveries made, let's say, in the 20th century, which are very few, they do lymph testing, lymph fluid.

799
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:57,890
And it's far more accurate and shows more of a – if they know what they're looking at, which is – it's kind of frowned upon discussing the lymph system in the standard medical field.

800
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:00,770
And because it is, I think it should be looked at.

801
01:03:01,370 --> 01:03:06,010
But typically something like that is stagnation, right?

802
01:03:06,110 --> 01:03:07,550
Any kind of swelling or anything.

803
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:14,550
And if it swells to the point where you notice it and it's discomforting, I would go look up lymphology on that.

804
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:21,450
But more of a rudimentary aspect, not like the new agey stuff that's going to send you off into a tangent.

805
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:30,070
But typically, you know, you could judge by the area of where it's at, what's the most sensitive.

806
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:32,730
You know, near the mouth is usually the teeth.

807
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:34,830
Could be a reaction.

808
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:36,930
Or it could be dietary, many things.

809
01:03:39,310 --> 01:03:43,310
The interesting aspect, again, is these fields have been specialized.

810
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:43,830
Why?

811
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:44,850
I mean, we all have teeth.

812
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:45,450
We all have hair.

813
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:48,010
We all have lymph systems and blood and livers.

814
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:52,990
Why aren't we being taught, right, 12,000 hours in school?

815
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:59,850
And you ask anyone who spends 12,000 hours, which in kindergarten and high school, what you learned, and they're like, I don't know, but I'm glad I'm out of there.

816
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:03,490
12,000 hours, folks, come on.

817
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:07,370
If you're not completely disgusted by what's going on, you're not paying attention.

818
01:04:09,530 --> 01:04:13,910
So, yeah, this would be maybe a parallel study.

819
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:16,790
And there's more that can be said on it.

820
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:19,470
But I don't know how to say it.

821
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:22,810
How's that about the lymph system?

822
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:23,890
Right on.

823
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:24,910
Yeah.

824
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:26,030
Well, I appreciate it.

825
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:31,230
Now, what about health and nutrition in the broader sense?

826
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:35,110
Kind of diverting away from the e-mail.

827
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:37,190
But that's, like I said, springboard.

828
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:41,330
Yeah, well, what's wonderful about that is the obvious.

829
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:49,290
You notice how we're standing on the earth and we rely on agriculture.

830
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:57,070
And you notice how as temperature changes, so does the agriculture and the food stuffs, right?

831
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:57,590
Right.

832
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:03,330
Even if it's fit and proper food or not fit and proper food, the food stuffs change.

833
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:07,410
Like in colder places, things grow differently.

834
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:10,730
You have different types of fruits and veg and animals as well.

835
01:05:10,730 --> 01:05:15,310
And wildlife and, you know, if you're into eating meat and fish.

836
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:25,230
Where if you go to a warmer climate, you have different types of fruits and veg and fish and other things that mankind has decided to consume.

837
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:33,470
The most obvious thing here is that there is an effect on the body chemistry and energy on what you eat.

838
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:41,030
And it's not only based on the chemical side that is discussed to us, meaning humans, inhabitants right now.

839
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:43,830
But there's an energetic side and a formative side.

840
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:53,510
Certainly not just the ingredients that something is made of, being that something an orange or an apple or a cow.

841
01:05:54,150 --> 01:06:00,990
But how those ingredients are structured in whatever organism this is.

842
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:08,410
Now what they're doing, the academics and the scientists, in terms of measuring the quality or quantity of things.

843
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:12,710
Is that their measurements are actually changing the thing.

844
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:14,730
And what I mean by that, I'll give a stark metaphor.

845
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:21,110
If you're a carpenter and you're on, let's say, on a site, construction site.

846
01:06:21,350 --> 01:06:29,550
And someone asks you how much does that, you know, one inch thick by 12 inch wide by three foot long oak board weigh.

847
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:31,130
How much does it weigh?

848
01:06:31,610 --> 01:06:36,750
So what he does is he takes it and he mills it down to complete sawdust to put it on a scale.

849
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:41,170
It's no longer a board, it's a pile of sawdust.

850
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:42,910
See my point?

851
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:50,350
So when they tell you there's vitamin C in oranges, the way they determine that is so radical.

852
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:53,850
That no one really knows if there's vitamin C in oranges.

853
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:57,970
Just like you wouldn't know what that pile of sawdust was before it was a pile of sawdust.

854
01:06:57,970 --> 01:06:58,590
You see?

855
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:05,650
Anytime you're dealing with a living thing in their system, not with their system, meaning the academics.

856
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:13,070
Academia in general, which means to be impractical, theoretical, never coming to a conclusion, look it up.

857
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:20,030
Is that they've, not only can they just give you a description and not an explanation.

858
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:27,010
But what happens is that they've lost the ability to observe it when it's alive.

859
01:07:27,830 --> 01:07:35,450
And whenever they separate something that is in a living state into a fragment, it is no longer in a living state.

860
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:37,390
Now it goes through chemical decomposition.

861
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:45,030
That's why there's a lot of criticism on the conventional medical field, which is just based on battlefield practice, by the way.

862
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:52,570
With all their testing and their lack of success in, quote unquote, curing disease, is because the study is based on the study of cadavers.

863
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:54,750
Right?

864
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:56,650
Samples of tissue.

865
01:07:57,030 --> 01:08:04,830
If you take a liver sample and view it under a microscope, that is not a living, it's no longer alive.

866
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:05,730
It's now dead.

867
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:09,430
And you're viewing the chemical decomposition of it.

868
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:13,490
So this is so radical.

869
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:15,390
And no one's noticing.

870
01:08:15,609 --> 01:08:16,750
No one's really, and I say no one.

871
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:25,210
I mean, it's not, that's the reason why they should be viewed in contrast to reality, is what I mean, academia.

872
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:25,789
Right?

873
01:08:27,109 --> 01:08:28,450
There's such a contrast.

874
01:08:28,649 --> 01:08:32,630
But the people have just, everyone wants to pursue things that they like.

875
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:35,069
If they want to know about the body, they go to a medical person.

876
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:40,970
They don't want to, but it only takes a few minutes to acknowledge that the medical people only acknowledge dead things.

877
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:42,510
You see?

878
01:08:42,510 --> 01:08:44,850
So this is, you know, again, the rift.

879
01:08:45,109 --> 01:08:46,550
This is a spiritual problem.

880
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:53,310
So to go back with eating seasonally, this is a long way around the block, let's say up the driveway here.

881
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:55,250
Let's go back to eating seasonally.

882
01:08:55,330 --> 01:09:02,450
Could it be that the seasonality or temperament of the food affects the body chemistry?

883
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:12,529
So another simpler way would be to explain it is if you live in a cold climate and you eat food that was grown or pervaded from a warm climate,

884
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:17,630
it will change your body to adapting to a warm climate.

885
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:18,870
But you're in a cold climate.

886
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:21,830
So you're going to get sick and vice versa.

887
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:29,090
The reason I'm stating this is because anyone I've ever encountered that had a problem of being cold in the winter,

888
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:36,790
I've always asked them or went over to where they lived or saw what they ate, and they typically ate some form of tropical foodstuffs.

889
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:38,689
And I made a suggestion.

890
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:43,670
I said, hey, look, did you ever consider that the food will actually change your body chemistry?

891
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:51,149
We use the term chemistry because people kind of like to go with that to the opposite climate that you're trying to adapt to.

892
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:52,770
And they're like, never thought of it, but I'll try it.

893
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:57,310
And 10 out of 10 people that do that have success and varying successes.

894
01:09:57,310 --> 01:10:00,070
But they all come back and say, yes, I've noticed a big change.

895
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:03,290
And this is not being discussed.

896
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:04,350
It's the simplest thing.

897
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:05,150
I'm one of them.

898
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:13,270
The problem with this is that you could be knee deep in snow in a cold season part of the world.

899
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:20,490
And you go to one of these what they call markets, and they're selling you things that are from the tropics.

900
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:23,550
And people look at it from a dead chemical sense.

901
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:25,490
Oh, it's freezing outside.

902
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:27,530
But I heard potassium is good for you.

903
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:30,350
And I heard that bananas have potassium.

904
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:31,930
I'll just eat them.

905
01:10:33,570 --> 01:10:42,930
I do drink coffee with a little bit of chocolate just about all year long.

906
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:55,030
Yeah, but if you were in 15 degree Fahrenheit, you know, or minus 10 Celsius, and it was 39 degrees indoors,

907
01:10:55,030 --> 01:11:00,770
that was the warmest you can get, or 4 degrees Celsius, you'd give up the coffee.

908
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:09,430
You'd have to go strictly with like roasting roots from local things and making something brown and hot.

909
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:12,570
Yeah, that would be the suggestion there.

910
01:11:12,610 --> 01:11:18,850
But you do have the convenience perhaps to be within the medium temperature so you could get away with certain things like that.

911
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:26,750
And this is why people in the Western cultures get the cold, the flu, and things like that during the quote unquote holiday season.

912
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:32,950
They have their holidays in the middle of winter, which I'm, you know, guilty of it growing up in this society.

913
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:37,290
But then I discovered there are no holidays in the winter really that are fit and proper.

914
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:44,930
And I discovered that the reason why they're getting sick, it's a cosmic joke, is because during their holidays,

915
01:11:44,930 --> 01:11:50,170
not only are they overeating, but they're elaborating on just about anything that tastes good,

916
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:58,530
which goes down the path of, you know, sugars and chocolates and, yeah, all the concoctions and things that, you know, are out of context.

917
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:00,330
So seasonally.

918
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:07,410
Oranges is one thing in particular that I've noticed just in my own physiology,

919
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:16,850
that when I used to I say when I used to several years ago, let's say three, four years back,

920
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:25,110
any time I thought that I was starting to feel under the weather or starting to get sick, you know, irritated throat, coughing abnormally,

921
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:31,610
things like that, I would immediately go and get, you know, a big jug of orange juice.

922
01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:40,350
And every time I don't know why it took me so long to piece it together or just I didn't I didn't piece it together.

923
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:43,450
You know, I was told it's external.

924
01:12:43,730 --> 01:12:49,690
And I I would drink that orange juice and I would just get so much worse.

925
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:59,270
It would cause, you know, a significant noticeable increase in, you know, mucus and phlegm and things like that.

926
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:01,810
It would make my throat worse and the cough worse.

927
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:16,490
And I, you know, I've changed dramatically the foods that I eat and year round, you know, not just when it's cold or just when it's warm.

928
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:26,250
But, you know, I haven't been ill with anything other than I've I've had.

929
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:29,190
I've been sick to my stomach once.

930
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:36,550
I've had an ear infection bad enough to actually seek out medication for it once.

931
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:50,130
But other than that, you know, my health has benefited significantly from just being more aware of not only what I'm eating, but why I'm eating what I'm eating.

932
01:13:50,130 --> 01:14:04,310
So this goes beyond the it is and it goes beyond the what is right in terms of discernment, because there is a very heavy commercial aspect to this.

933
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:08,770
Because on one side of the world, when it's summer, the other side, it's winter.

934
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:17,670
So that the people that are been promoting commercial farming where it's summertime are now transporting their food to where it's winter for convenience purposes.

935
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:23,510
So you can have these particular things that grow in during season now out of season.

936
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:28,150
So there's a very strong commercial element behind it as well.

937
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:32,410
And how many times have you heard, you know, people do things for money?

938
01:14:32,530 --> 01:14:36,530
Well, there are industries that are set up for money and there is no money.

939
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:38,170
That's the other cosmic thing.

940
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:41,230
One day we'll discuss that there is no money and what that really means.

941
01:14:42,070 --> 01:14:49,450
Yeah, well, that will be a that will be an entire couple of hours for a couple of hours.

942
01:14:49,590 --> 01:14:51,130
Yeah. Just to preface it. Exactly.

943
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:53,870
Because there's another thing.

944
01:14:54,230 --> 01:14:57,330
Speaking of a couple of hours, just to preface, there's another thing is I was reading.

945
01:14:59,030 --> 01:15:05,970
I was reading. I was reading aloud and, you know, commenting on it as loud as I was reading it.

946
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:22,550
And I'm going, you know, a lot of these things that are brought up in this, not only would they take several hours to explain with any sort of accuracy or precision, but also, you know, more, more hours than that, just in prefacing what's being spoken about.

947
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:24,390
So, yeah.

948
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:43,550
Yeah, because it's humanity, as we stated earlier, as their greatest success to this point is they've succeeded in almost eliminating all viable forms of communication, but are still able to function somewhat, making things, going places.

949
01:15:44,910 --> 01:15:54,510
What's interesting when I out in the world or digitally or physically, I hear and see people trying to communicate.

950
01:15:55,690 --> 01:16:00,870
And it is one of the most one of the funniest things that I mean, you just got to really hold back.

951
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:02,390
It's like they're saying nothing.

952
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:04,750
Yet they're doing things.

953
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:10,090
I mean, that's kind of harsh, but just want to give that as a perspective.

954
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:11,890
No, it's it's accurate.

955
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:12,170
Yeah.

956
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:15,630
Or they don't know what they're saying, but they still get things done.

957
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:20,370
You know, and I mean, you know, more than just like filler up 20 bucks regular.

958
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:29,910
I'll take a dozen eggs, but anything outside basic food, clothing, you know, basic was a food, clothing, shelter.

959
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:43,930
It seems to be so obscure and almost irrelevant that it's just fascinating to see that their crowning achievement is controlled chaos or controlled confusion and controlled ignorance.

960
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:45,830
I like to add.

961
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:59,410
I like to add the to the food, clothing and shelter list that reminds me of a lot of the discussions I've had with people that would refer to themselves as preppers and things like that.

962
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:11,950
And they they tend to miss the fourth thing that is necessary to not only to comfort, but to just to existing as, you know, surface dwelling earth inhabitants.

963
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:15,790
And that's in a word, I would call it fellowship.

964
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:19,270
You could call it companionship, just other people.

965
01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:27,790
You know, it's not just food, clothing and shelter that is necessary to any sort of accurate idea of survival.

966
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:44,050
But it is also, you know, other people, because if it's just, you know, just one, we are, you know, from the very beginning of what is recorded, that is that's not how how we operate.

967
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:46,470
It's not how it's not how we exist.

968
01:17:47,350 --> 01:18:01,610
And then there's attached to that might be the ethic and moral aspect of people just to tie back into the conversation about money, which we won't have when you bring up even to the most staunch conservative.

969
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:08,970
What what the money system really is or how they're endorsing it by their actions and their words and their pen.

970
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:14,050
Ultimately, if you press them just like a religious person about they're not doing anything in the text.

971
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:21,550
You know what they say is they I don't really care, ultimately, as long as I can go to the store and get something for it.

972
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:32,130
So there's no. So even the most active, pragmatistic type conservative, we got to do the right thing.

973
01:18:32,190 --> 01:18:40,590
Person pressed to see objectively what it is going on, what's going on and how there's two sides, let's say, to it.

974
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:46,130
They really don't care. So there's a moral and ethical problem with humanity across the board right now.

975
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:54,790
And, folks, if you're going to use the Napoleonic Code, which is, you know, you're guilty till proven innocent in society, you're going to be safe.

976
01:18:54,930 --> 01:19:05,930
So when you meet people, if you judge them as being moral and unethical before they even open their mouth and then you have to make sure they have to prove to you that they are, you're going to be very, very safe.

977
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:11,670
Yeah. Yeah. So this is this is a general view.

978
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:19,390
If you just dropped out on this planet, I bet that before anyone comes here, I bet they probably preface them and say, listen, whatever.

979
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:24,470
This is what this society is like. They're really stupid and they're really simple and they're really wrong.

980
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:30,590
And they're quite easily provoked to violence. It only takes 15 minutes to explain humanity.

981
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:40,890
And I'm sure that they finish off by telling whoever's visiting here and whatever you do, don't talk to any of them because anything you say will confuse them.

982
01:19:41,850 --> 01:19:46,450
So anyway. Absolutely. Yeah.

983
01:19:47,870 --> 01:19:52,130
Now, this is a very, you know, but just just to throw something in for things.

984
01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:57,510
This is not for anyone to believe or even think about, but just jot this down as a note to self, folks.

985
01:19:57,510 --> 01:20:02,450
You're not going to go through any kind of survival type situation like that, by the way.

986
01:20:02,550 --> 01:20:07,490
You're not going to have other than maybe some local catastrophes like are always happening.

987
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:13,210
Earthquakes, floods, you know, localized things like that. But but not on a national level anywhere.

988
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:24,110
At this point, unless it's temporary, like, for example, you know, there's some political manifestation that cuts things off for a while, then, you know, might be considered.

989
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:32,870
But generally in the in most parts of the world, you're not going to be forced into that situation because what's coming on the scene is the opposite.

990
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:42,330
Is that mankind will go through these this period for the next, let's say, better part of a quarter of a decade and such, maybe half a decade.

991
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:48,590
And then everything's going to start turning around where you're pretty much going to have a perfect society on the planet for a short time.

992
01:20:50,230 --> 01:20:57,050
So, yeah, perfect society, not like from the top down and bottom up.

993
01:20:57,150 --> 01:21:00,170
Yeah. No war. Yeah. Access to things.

994
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:04,730
Time of peace and prosperity for all surface dwelling earth inhabitants.

995
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:08,790
And the deception of that. Well, what's wrong with that? Greek, where's it?

996
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:14,470
Just, you know, what do you mean by deception of that? Deception is that it's going to be promoted as this is how it's going to be for the next thousand years.

997
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:19,430
That is the great deception. You know, when I say that, it's like, why am I saying this in public?

998
01:21:19,530 --> 01:21:22,950
That's worth like a million bucks. Just that one statement. Just that clue.

999
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:31,830
The great deception really is that you will be told you all of you, meaning that all of humanity at large will fall for it.

1000
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:41,470
So, yeah. So when you read in the ancient text, the great deception, it's that you will fall for this perfection because you have to be given this.

1001
01:21:42,010 --> 01:21:47,210
So later on, no one's without an excuse. I say, well, we didn't have a chance to have world peace.

1002
01:21:47,810 --> 01:21:54,370
We didn't have a chance to end world hunger. You know, that's the last thing the gods want to hear from.

1003
01:21:54,710 --> 01:22:00,530
So you'll be granted that for a very short time, a third of a third of a decade or so.

1004
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,030
And then while the glitches start coming.

1005
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:10,790
The there'll be some very unusual request to put it back on track and it's just going to get worse and downhill from there.

1006
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:16,310
And you're going to suffer a couple of cosmic kill shots. And yeah, that's the end of the story pretty much.

1007
01:22:16,370 --> 01:22:20,630
So, yeah. Anyway, not not very exciting or super exciting if you want to research it.

1008
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:27,590
Yeah. Every would. Every would. Jitrali speaking specifically in alternative venues.

1009
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:34,530
You'll hear a lot of people speaking about cataclysm and about the end of everything.

1010
01:22:35,210 --> 01:22:38,930
And realistically, it was last September. That was supposed to be last September, by the way.

1011
01:22:38,990 --> 01:22:47,130
Oh, I could I could list at least probably 10, 15 solid dates that have come and gone that I've heard just in the last two years.

1012
01:22:48,610 --> 01:22:56,390
But, you know, realistically, even though it is an ending of sorts, it's going to appear to be quite the opposite of that.

1013
01:22:56,390 --> 01:23:02,170
It's going to appear to be the beginning of something very, very good.

1014
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:08,970
Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's the whole thing. Well, yeah, it's the it's the credits.

1015
01:23:10,330 --> 01:23:15,470
Yeah, it's the part it's the part of the film that's thrown in at the credits.

1016
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:21,850
It's an outtake, let's say, you know, it's thrown in there and you're like, oh, wow, that wasn't in the movie.

1017
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:24,350
They talked about that, but we didn't quite see that.

1018
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:30,510
Yeah. You know, I mean, look, if you believe there are electrons going down wires, you'll believe anything.

1019
01:23:30,930 --> 01:23:34,970
So, I mean, come on, folks. So, yeah.

1020
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:40,630
But it's not. Yeah. And this whole thing about no one knows the future.

1021
01:23:41,310 --> 01:23:48,370
You've heard of that. It's like, geez, Louise, you know, it's like, well, you know, I'm baking a cake, you know, we'll eat cake in an hour after it cools down.

1022
01:23:48,450 --> 01:23:50,110
Well, how do you know the future?

1023
01:23:50,830 --> 01:23:59,110
Well, it's simple. You see, you make the rest, you know, you make the batter, you put it in a pan and an oven for an hour and or 40 minutes or so.

1024
01:23:59,190 --> 01:24:02,110
And then you cool it, you serve it. That's why I'm not psychic.

1025
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:05,050
Yeah. The sun's going to appear to go down here in a few hours.

1026
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:08,470
Yeah. Well, how do you know? Right.

1027
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:17,370
Well, it's happened before and you've been told even if even if you get a recipe to make something you've never made before, how do you know?

1028
01:24:17,370 --> 01:24:21,550
There's a certain element of trust and a certain element of skill.

1029
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:31,830
The skill here is can you see clearly? But anyway, the thing is not think not see not thinking deeply, but thinking clearly.

1030
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:37,990
You know, an insane person can think deeply, but it takes a good amount of sanity to think clearly.

1031
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:42,950
Sanity being health, health of mind, body, soul.

1032
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:56,530
And what's and what's coming after all this stuff, which is great, is is a level of existence for all living things that is so beyond what exists now that it almost escapes description.

1033
01:24:56,910 --> 01:25:01,530
You can hint at it. That's the wonderful part about it.

1034
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:04,010
So nonetheless, yeah.

1035
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:16,310
Before we get too far away from the, you know, food idea, there is, you know, something I guess you could call it an addendum to that.

1036
01:25:16,970 --> 01:25:23,950
What about foods that are preserved, such as pickles, you know, or anything that is changes pickled?

1037
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:37,090
It changes, right? If you were to have a well, let's say the typical in the Western world, let's say American or the States, when you say pickle, you, you know, something you slice on a burger or sandwiches and such.

1038
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:40,950
And that is actually a preserved cucumber variety.

1039
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:50,370
Well, if you were to compare that to a non preserved cucumber, it's almost a completely different thing.

1040
01:25:51,090 --> 01:25:56,330
Well, guess what? When you preserve something like that, it is completely different in its property.

1041
01:25:57,230 --> 01:26:00,470
So there are many things that could be considered the canning and pickling.

1042
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:06,930
Even eating those things out of season is proper through experimentation, believe it or not.

1043
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:12,870
You can do it yourself. So there's something like banana chips. Have you heard of those dried banana chips?

1044
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:19,990
Well, should you eat those if you're in a cold climate? Well, you know, here's the thing. It's so extreme and so specific.

1045
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:25,990
No, but if you do, it's not going to have the same effect as if you ate a live banana, let's say.

1046
01:26:26,450 --> 01:26:34,430
So considering the preserving of things, changing them, it's almost the mildest form of alchemy when you think about it.

1047
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:35,950
Absolutely.

1048
01:26:37,570 --> 01:26:41,090
Anything else in that department could be discussed?

1049
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:45,110
Or go ahead, give us any experiences that you might have with preserved foods out of season.

1050
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:52,370
None negative. And it's something that I, you know, as I have attempted to do, eat seasonally.

1051
01:26:52,890 --> 01:27:01,650
And as I said, you know, there are things like coffee and stuff like that, that would be breaking away from that.

1052
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:07,890
But generally speaking, that's something that I do, you know, year round.

1053
01:27:09,050 --> 01:27:24,490
And I've found it to be over the last, you know, two, three years to be of great benefit, not only just to not being sick, but just to the well-being of my physical body.

1054
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:31,600
Even, you know, I've gone through, as we all do over the last few years, some very stressful things.

1055
01:27:32,170 --> 01:27:37,970
I would say non-physical, but that's inaccurate, you know, emotions are a physical phenomenon.

1056
01:27:39,550 --> 01:27:40,570
That's formative.

1057
01:27:40,930 --> 01:27:53,690
Yeah, that could have very well made this meat puppet ill, had it not been for the fact that even through all of that, I was still eating.

1058
01:27:54,710 --> 01:28:04,130
Perhaps not as much, but the quality of intake was still very considered in anything.

1059
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:16,690
So I would, I'd recommend it to anyone who, especially if you have a tendency to, toward, you know, illness of the body, seasonally or, you know, sporadically even.

1060
01:28:17,330 --> 01:28:21,930
Think about what you're eating and maybe, maybe change it.

1061
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:24,570
It was grown where you got it and where you got it from.

1062
01:28:25,950 --> 01:28:30,870
It doesn't mean, it doesn't mean just eat what, you know, within a few miles or locally.

1063
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:36,590
That's for economic purposes as well, what's called self-sustainment and all that economically, locally.

1064
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:39,970
But you can go cross latitude across the world.

1065
01:28:40,110 --> 01:28:48,410
So if you're, you know, somewhere in the States, let's say your type of diet or what you eat can have extreme variety.

1066
01:28:48,410 --> 01:29:00,090
You know, let's say mid part of the States, you go across, you know, the world and you'd see, you know, parts of France, parts of Northern Italy, parts of China, parts of Russia.

1067
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:07,370
And then you could flip the globe or go on the lower half and that similar latitude of seasons.

1068
01:29:07,870 --> 01:29:16,030
You can enjoy those types of food as well, you see, but in different times of the year, it's usually spring or spring or fall is a great equalizer.

1069
01:29:16,030 --> 01:29:26,050
Where both sides of the world, you know, the people down under, let's say Australia, New Zealand, South America, and the people on the northern part, that transition.

1070
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:35,030
It's possible to have similar temperatures on similar days where other parts of the year, summer and winter, it's polar opposite, right?

1071
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:37,810
You have winter in one place, summer in the other.

1072
01:29:38,330 --> 01:29:39,750
So spring and fall is interesting.

1073
01:29:39,890 --> 01:29:43,210
It's an equalizer for the entire planet in that respect.

1074
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:53,970
But the actual seasons manifesting like that and the actual foodstuffs are different because they contrast.

1075
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:56,850
When it's winter, one place they tend to ship to the other.

1076
01:29:56,930 --> 01:30:01,910
So you might want to look across the world just for variety, you know.

1077
01:30:03,950 --> 01:30:09,570
We gave the contrast of if you live in a cold, it's a cold time of year for you.

1078
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:20,590
If you eat food that comes from the tropics, there's a good chance it's going to adjust your body chemistry, let's say, to being in the tropics and you will get ill because you will not be able to adapt to the cold.

1079
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:21,830
And vice versa is true.

1080
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:30,870
If you live in the tropics and you eat, let's say, salmon or things that are grown in very cold places, you will not be able to adjust to the heat.

1081
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:36,530
And actually that I have seen, let's say, in places in summertime in the desert southwest.

1082
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:50,450
I've found someone who liked eating salmon in summertime and went to their house, they had the air conditioner down so low you felt like you're walking into a cooler box, walk in refrigerator and they were still warm.

1083
01:30:51,990 --> 01:30:52,550
So.

1084
01:30:54,210 --> 01:30:55,330
Yeah, absolutely.

1085
01:30:55,490 --> 01:31:10,690
And I, you know, my personal experience just with avoiding tropical fruits during the cold months here has had a, I've noticed, you know, it's something that I've been aware of.

1086
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:16,690
And as they say in the back of my mind constantly, because it's something that I did consciously.

1087
01:31:17,730 --> 01:31:20,530
And I've, you know, it's been, it's been good.

1088
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:26,430
So I recommend it to anyone out there who thinks about such things.

1089
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:30,670
And I'd recommend that you maybe think about such things if you're not in the habit of doing so.

1090
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:38,330
Health of the body is, I mean, that's, you know, that's how we interact with this physical plane that we find ourselves in.

1091
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:47,750
So having it as healthy as possible will make everything else just that much more tolerable and pleasant.

1092
01:31:48,310 --> 01:31:50,950
Because it's a crazy violent place out there, man.

1093
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:52,730
You said you've been out in public recently.

1094
01:31:53,530 --> 01:31:54,710
I know it's pretty scary.

1095
01:31:55,310 --> 01:31:57,090
Yeah, I'm not agoraphobic or anything.

1096
01:31:57,270 --> 01:32:04,150
I just find that the level of quality of individuals from every aspect now it's like as if everyone's lost their mind to some degree.

1097
01:32:04,150 --> 01:32:10,170
But anyway, the, you know, Seth, how we discussed earlier the external input with thoughts.

1098
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:15,510
It's interesting how the external input with food is parallel to that, isn't it?

1099
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:16,170
So.

1100
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:17,750
It is.

1101
01:32:18,190 --> 01:32:18,710
Yeah.

1102
01:32:20,330 --> 01:32:26,550
So what else, what other external input can we discuss other than thought and food?

1103
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:34,750
Well, on this on this time coming around, I think we preface by reading some things that were sent to us.

1104
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:36,750
Actually, a thing is quite a document.

1105
01:32:37,950 --> 01:32:43,450
And just going from the gods to pretty much the external input and the food.

1106
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:44,190
What do you think?

1107
01:32:44,230 --> 01:32:45,430
We just give it a rest.

1108
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:47,410
It's been about an hour and a half an hour.

1109
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:50,750
Better part of almost almost two hours here.

1110
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:51,490
What do you think?

1111
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:52,070
Should we just.

1112
01:32:52,930 --> 01:32:54,470
Yes, it's fine with me.

1113
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:58,190
I'm getting relatively hungry as well.

1114
01:32:58,850 --> 01:32:59,370
Yeah.

1115
01:32:59,870 --> 01:33:09,590
So usually we we have the convention of the two hours from previously coming together on a radio network to do two hours with breaks and such.

1116
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:11,470
But I think I think we've.

1117
01:33:12,310 --> 01:33:16,510
Put out a pretty good presentation for this episode, let's say.

1118
01:33:16,810 --> 01:33:17,010
Yeah.

1119
01:33:17,010 --> 01:33:23,750
And we've touched on some some topics and gone a little bit more in depth than maybe we have in the past.

1120
01:33:24,870 --> 01:33:35,190
And, you know, being that this is only the second or third broadcast that we're doing, we a lot of it can be new to people that are that are new to the concepts that we're sharing anyway.

1121
01:33:35,310 --> 01:33:42,250
So I think that we have done a relatively good job, as they say, such things.

1122
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:44,790
And I also want to go right ahead.

1123
01:33:44,790 --> 01:33:48,010
I just want to present one thing in closing, just to answer this.

1124
01:33:48,210 --> 01:33:59,130
We've been getting some feedback as in terms of text messages on Skype and emails and such about discussing certain specific topics in greater depth.

1125
01:33:59,190 --> 01:33:59,970
And that will come.

1126
01:34:00,690 --> 01:34:10,250
And some of these topics include alternative technologies, Tesla, Victor Schauberger and such various things about ancient texts.

1127
01:34:10,410 --> 01:34:12,690
One might say the biblical text.

1128
01:34:12,690 --> 01:34:21,310
Now, the first part that could be done pretty substantially, basically just discussing the matter of fact aspect.

1129
01:34:21,590 --> 01:34:25,310
I think there's no real right or wrong time for that.

1130
01:34:25,930 --> 01:34:36,990
But discussing something like the holy rites of a particular culture or even something that might be called the biblical text at this time publicly is met with great indifference.

1131
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:41,390
Only because it's not quite time yet to discuss it.

1132
01:34:41,390 --> 01:34:44,850
You see, would you be in agreement with that, Seth?

1133
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:48,170
Or it doesn't mean we should bar the topic and not bring up things.

1134
01:34:48,290 --> 01:34:54,170
But I think it really coming out with what is really trying to be conveyed there is you think it's time yet?

1135
01:34:54,930 --> 01:35:00,470
No, but it does seem the time, as they say, gets closer every day.

1136
01:35:00,870 --> 01:35:03,710
So, yeah, there's a lot of stuff going on.

1137
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:05,670
I just leave with a metaphor.

1138
01:35:06,350 --> 01:35:16,710
Someone, an individual once contacted me a couple of years back about doing a video presentation on Da Vinci's Last Supper and how it explains the stars and the Bible and all this.

1139
01:35:17,130 --> 01:35:19,730
And let them go on for hours and hours, a very long presentation.

1140
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:21,550
And I said, wait a second.

1141
01:35:23,570 --> 01:35:26,030
By the way, there is no Last Supper in the Bible.

1142
01:35:26,610 --> 01:35:27,730
It's the Passover.

1143
01:35:28,350 --> 01:35:35,610
What you just did, all that effort, all that time is wasted if you try to connect it to the biblical text.

1144
01:35:35,770 --> 01:35:39,550
But it's not wasted if you want to make it like maybe an art review.

1145
01:35:40,310 --> 01:35:40,410
Right.

1146
01:35:40,730 --> 01:35:44,330
So you see, there's two aspects to it.

1147
01:35:44,450 --> 01:35:44,590
Right.

1148
01:35:44,830 --> 01:35:51,370
So when we discuss the biblical text right away, they go to church yet any church, Christianity, Islam, Judaism.

1149
01:35:51,730 --> 01:35:55,050
Like that's social stuff.

1150
01:35:55,050 --> 01:35:58,110
That has nothing to do with the biblical text at all.

1151
01:35:58,370 --> 01:35:58,930
See, see that.

1152
01:35:59,050 --> 01:36:00,670
I just wanted to put that in as well.

1153
01:36:00,810 --> 01:36:01,850
That's why it's not time yet.

1154
01:36:04,150 --> 01:36:07,150
So with that said, any let you close it off, Seth.

1155
01:36:07,250 --> 01:36:11,410
Thank you, everyone attending and listening and recording and B.Y.O.R.

1156
01:36:12,170 --> 01:36:18,450
I don't know if Seth's going to successfully achieve a recording on this, but yeah, we have recorded the entire thing.

1157
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:22,470
We'll see if it all goes through once I hit the stop button.

1158
01:36:22,470 --> 01:36:26,770
But don't don't hang up.

1159
01:36:26,970 --> 01:36:29,630
Hang on after we are going to go ahead and in the broadcast.

1160
01:36:29,770 --> 01:36:32,630
So thank you all for being here and participating.

1161
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:34,370
If you would like to contact us.

1162
01:36:34,930 --> 01:36:41,730
The easiest way to do that is going to be to go to uncommon radio dot com, where the email address is listed.

1163
01:36:42,290 --> 01:36:47,430
That email address is uncommon since radio one.

1164
01:36:47,710 --> 01:36:49,850
The number one at Gmail dot com.

1165
01:36:49,870 --> 01:36:51,730
And I'll drop that into the chat here as well.

1166
01:36:51,730 --> 01:36:53,950
Actually, I'm going to do that right now.

1167
01:37:00,580 --> 01:37:10,720
At Gmail dot com and go, so that's in the chat and we will be back, barring unforeseen circumstances,

1168
01:37:11,660 --> 01:37:17,640
broadcasting again on what they call Saturday, right around one one p.m.

1169
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,180
Pacific wartime, four p.m.

1170
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:21,600
Eastern wartime.

1171
01:37:22,200 --> 01:37:27,840
And, yeah, thank you all for being here and, you know, making this worthwhile.

1172
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:29,780
We we I enjoy doing it.

1173
01:37:29,860 --> 01:37:32,360
I can't speak for both of us, but I enjoy the conversation.

1174
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:33,840
So I'm grateful for that as well.

1175
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:39,020
And until next time, be well and think.
