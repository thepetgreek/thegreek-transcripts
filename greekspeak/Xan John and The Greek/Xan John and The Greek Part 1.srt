1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,340
All righty, everyone, we have the Greek on for round two.

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,160
Daniel, if you want to take it away, I know you had some questions to prepare.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:11,700
Yeah, sure.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,240
So we did leave some loose ends last time.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,340
Namely, the Greek gave the recipe for gold.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,140
And if I understood right, that was monatomic gold?

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:25,740
Biological.

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:31,900
It is gold as one would consider gold in appearance and in property, but it's biological.

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:38,640
It would have a much lower melting point because it was just created by some fungus in the mitochondria of fungus.

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,020
It has an evolution of its own.

11
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:47,260
And can you consume this gold like we hear, ormus, or monatomic gold?

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,280
Yes, you could, but it needs to go to another level eventually in order to be –

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,940
it would be better to consume it by feeding it to other biologicals like plants or animals that you're going to eat,

14
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,420
but hopefully just plants, if that makes sense.

15
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,580
Yeah, so they could finish the process.

16
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,740
It's kind of like eating a green tomato or something that is not –

17
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:15,080
you can eat food that is not ready to be eaten, let's say organic food, vegetables and fruits,

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,420
but they would not be as pleasant as effective, right?

19
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,280
Yeah, and is there an optimum dose?

20
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,940
I bet there is such a thing as too much, right?

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,980
Yes, but remember, the optimum dose then again would be to what you would dilute this in water to put in your garden

22
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,660
and then eat the vegetables later.

23
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:41,280
So the optimum dose would be on how good you are on making tinctures and dilutions, if you understand that concept.

24
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,320
If you take the purely mechanistic chemical sense, the more the better.

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,440
But if you understand the energetic side of it, it could be the less the better,

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,720
and the less of it should be of highest quality.

27
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,180
I see.

28
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:59,560
And the other loose thread was you promised a recipe for aqua sargentis.

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,780
Yes, very, very, very, very important.

30
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,540
Can I say very about ten times?

31
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,800
Then that's how important it is.

32
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,020
There is something called colloidal silver.

33
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,500
Should I just give the background or do you want to ask any more about it before you –

34
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,060
No, go ahead.

35
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:13,940
Okay.

36
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,940
Even in old texts they say silver is good for your health,

37
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,340
and it's very well known that silver is a fungicide and bactericide.

38
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,200
And by the way, fungus and bacteria, notice I didn't say the V-I-R-U-S word

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,760
because that is something completely different.

40
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,600
Those things, the only time they bring harm to the body, they do not bring harm to any body.

41
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,040
It's what they produce in their own metabolic rate is what harms another body, right?

42
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,480
For example, you could be loaded –

43
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,280
you could take something that's living and load it with a certain type of fungus

44
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,660
or bacteria and they're fine.

45
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,240
But depending on what that fungus or bacteria takes from the system,

46
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,660
consumes, or gives off, defecates, those end results

47
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,600
and primary initial reactions is what damages the host, you see.

48
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,720
It's not the presence of the bacteria or the fungus itself.

49
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,140
So just to hearken back to the gold recipe earlier, you know,

50
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:16,120
that gold was produced by the intelligence of the Saccharomyces vs. Cervasius fungus,

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:19,780
saying we need to sacrifice a part of our colony to bond itself to the silver

52
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,520
because the silver is dangerous to us.

53
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,860
Metabolize gold in the DNA on the mitochondria and then plate the silver with gold

54
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,520
so now it becomes inert, you see.

55
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,500
Okay, so that's another proof is if the silver was not antifungal or antibacterial,

56
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,960
that process would not be able to take place, right?

57
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,100
So there's this big wave that's been going on for many decades now

58
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,640
about colloidal silver for health.

59
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,060
And if you go online or whatever,

60
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,820
they tout that their method of producing colloidal silver,

61
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,840
which is a very fine metal particle suspended in the water,

62
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,720
is best because it has the highest count of silver.

63
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,280
And I always shook my head on that because that is a chemical mechanical process

64
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,080
that if you have a metal in solution, actually in metal form,

65
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,100
the body can view it as a toxin, okay?

66
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,700
And this goes almost for most metals.

67
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,339
Even though there are things in certain cultures that if you consume gold

68
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,339
in certain ways, you know, that's why the monatomic gold is so important.

69
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,560
It's nonmetallic.

70
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,300
So what we found out is since we know that without a doubt there are benefits

71
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,820
to having silver in the body, how do we do that?

72
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,820
So we found out that the best way to do that is to have a colloidal silver method

73
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,020
where they have the two electrodes, positive and negative.

74
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,520
Actually, sometimes we use a neutral in between.

75
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,040
So three electrodes, the one in the middle is neutral.

76
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,580
But let's just say positive, negative in the water.

77
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,960
And what you – the best thing to do is because this ultimately is going to be

78
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,060
used for consumption by an organic living biological being, right?

79
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,480
We're not making it for an industrial process.

80
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,160
So we notice that in the world whenever we have electricity, it's usually a single cell.

81
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,420
If you take an orange or a potato or a lemon and you put electrodes in it

82
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,920
in a voltmeter, you'll see there's voltage in there, okay?

83
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,180
So we found that a single cell, something like a battery that you would use

84
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,980
for a torch or a flashlight, a AA, AAA, or D battery,

85
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,620
they're all considered single cells.

86
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,340
And whenever you make a chemical reaction to make electricity,

87
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,080
each cell roughly is one-and-a-half volts, right?

88
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,840
Depending on the chemicals, it could be higher,

89
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,720
or if it's a biological acid and other substrates and minerals, it's much lower.

90
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,660
So what I suggest is you have your two silver electrodes.

91
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,520
They must be fine silver, not sterling silver where you have an alloy of copper

92
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,700
and zinc and lead, just fine silver.

93
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,460
The more fine, the better.

94
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,540
And only apply a voltage, even a used battery that's one volt is even better,

95
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,100
just for a few seconds to five or ten minutes maximum.

96
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,840
And the silver with the electricity will, quote-unquote,

97
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,980
let's just use whichever word you like, program, rearrange, structure the water,

98
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,780
the memory of the water.

99
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,780
This sounds like a lot of pseudoscience to people,

100
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,580
but it's been proven that water has memory.

101
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,860
In accord with the silver.

102
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,180
Now, if you take this solution that only took a few seconds or a minute or two

103
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,720
or even five minutes to make, and you took it to a material lab,

104
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,500
they will not find any silver in it, material at all.

105
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,540
But anyone who takes this or consumes it for antibacterial, antifungal,

106
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,420
or certain things that you can say the silver will help,

107
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,040
they'll have immediate results.

108
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,560
I mean, much, much more powerful than any chemical silver that are touting to

109
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,040
have a high silver content.

110
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,960
Some silver purveyors, colloidal silver purveyors,

111
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,600
show you a colloidal silver solution that is cloudy with silver.

112
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,740
I'm like, that is like something you should maybe make a new battery with.

113
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,460
Don't drink that.

114
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,760
So that is, and the thing is, I don't call it colloidal silver,

115
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,140
because whenever you take this to a material scientist,

116
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,740
because they say there's no trace of silver here,

117
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,720
but it acts like the most powerful silver solution.

118
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,760
So calling it colloidal silver is a misnomer,

119
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,260
because colloidal just means very small particle.

120
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,020
You won't find anything in there.

121
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,120
So I call it aqueous argentum, which argentum is silver,

122
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,600
aqueous meaning water, so basically silver solution,

123
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,220
but no silver present.

124
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,120
The interesting thing with this also, there's no electrode wear.

125
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,220
The only caveat to doing this system is,

126
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,440
because it works on a much higher energetic level,

127
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,420
when you're using, let's say, two clean pieces of silver,

128
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,120
one goes to the positive of the one volt battery,

129
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,700
and the other one goes to the negative of the one volt battery,

130
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,800
you must be very careful and sure that you always connect those pieces

131
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,400
appropriately as such.

132
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,540
If you ever reverse them, the next, let's say,

133
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,980
the first time you do it, silver piece A is to positive

134
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,540
and silver piece B goes to negative on the battery.

135
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,680
If you reverse them and B goes the other terminal,

136
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,740
it will make the dirtiest, it would look very, very dirty.

137
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,840
So it seems to also go both ways.

138
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,600
The silver does not only react with the water,

139
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,360
but the water reacts with the silver,

140
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,360
where you should never reverse polarity.

141
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,419
I tell people if you reverse polarity,

142
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,799
you'll notice it gets very, very dirty,

143
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:40,440
and it will not work again, which doesn't make sense scientifically,

144
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,299
because a metal is just a piece of metal.

145
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,020
It doesn't matter which polarity, right?

146
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,860
You see how they say?

147
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,620
So you have to start off with new pieces of silver if accidentally you

148
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,740
reverse the polarity.

149
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:56,660
Or you can hammer the silver and heat it and re-temper it

150
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,920
and reprogram the silver.

151
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,280
So I know this might sound a little kooky to many,

152
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,740
but I just wanted to put it out for those that recognize what I'm saying.

153
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,460
Sure, sure.

154
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,420
And what is the best way to go about imbibing this?

155
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,220
You mean on using it?

156
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:12,960
Yes.

157
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:19,440
I would say that, again, the approach would be very, very simple.

158
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,140
The same way you have this solution, you can either,

159
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,280
let's say you just made a glass of it,

160
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,460
you can drink the glass or you can put the glass in a dark,

161
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,460
cold place and add just a few, a little bit of it to another glass.

162
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,880
In other words, you can dilute it quite a ways,

163
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,020
depending on the condition of the person.

164
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,340
Like someone has a strong candida condition or various other things,

165
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,120
or athlete's foot or things like that,

166
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,460
you might want to just use it immediately,

167
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,820
because I would say it has a shelf life of less than three days, 72 hours.

168
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:59,240
And it should be kept in the fridge and in the dark, away from light.

169
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,320
Because there's like a photophoresis effect that the light actually changes it

170
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,580
and the temperature changes it.

171
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,060
I think we've never gone over that water should always be stored at 39 degrees

172
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,020
Fahrenheit or 4 degrees Celsius, right?

173
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,440
And it should be in the dark if you want to increase the quality of the water.

174
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,800
So we would consider that.

175
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,140
Also, when you're making this material, it should not be a very high mineral water.

176
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,000
Bottled spring water or very good filtered water usually is best.

177
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,840
It doesn't have to be distilled water, but distilled water works just as well.

178
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,020
So it would be for drinking and adding to drinking water.

179
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,260
Not for cooking, by the way, because the heat will destroy it.

180
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,340
I see.

181
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,920
And in addition to drinking cool water,

182
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,740
which I think you said that we should always do that,

183
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,260
or at least put it in the fridge and then drink it,

184
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:56,380
I think you also stressed the importance of using the ovoid shape.

185
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,120
Can you go over that?

186
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,020
Sure.

187
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,740
The ovoid shape is the best shape that's in nature that's available to us to keep

188
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,240
self-sustained movement in the fluid.

189
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:13,120
For example, when fluid is moving, there's no pathogen that can develop, right?

190
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,080
So give us a very simple example.

191
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,060
I won't use rectilinear boxes or rectangles, just round things for now.

192
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,320
When you have a sphere and you put a liquid in it,

193
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:32,180
because the center of the sphere to the inside walls is exactly the same distance,

194
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,460
if there's any heat convection or movement in the liquid,

195
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,080
because the center is the same distance all around,

196
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,720
it will stabilize and become stagnant very quickly.

197
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,440
If we make an ellipse shape where it's the sphere elongated evenly on either side,

198
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,000
well, the elongated portions of that container are not the same distance,

199
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,880
so what will happen is it will take longer to become stagnant,

200
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,740
and eventually the symmetry of the two ends of the ellipse will catch up with each

201
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,740
other, they'll mirror each other, and cancel out any movement in between.

202
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,280
When you have an ovoid shape,

203
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,820
which is basically a sphere with one end of it elongated to a point

204
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,980
and the other end more oblong or round,

205
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,220
the distance, the center of the object, of that ovoid,

206
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,040
is no longer in the geometric center.

207
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,740
The geometric center is much lower.

208
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,680
It offsets almost as if you put a pentagram.

209
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,480
If you put it in a pentagram and find the center of a pentagram,

210
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,920
it would match, by the way.

211
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,480
So the fluid would move in the container,

212
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,420
and when it reaches the pointy part of the egg,

213
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,720
it will move towards the point and then up here,

214
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,900
the opposite end will want to move towards the more oblong,

215
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,840
less curved section.

216
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,120
And when they come back to the middle,

217
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:57,300
the fluid that was from the narrower part of the egg will meet the fluid that

218
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,720
was at the wider part of the egg and pass each other because they're at a

219
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,860
different wave, let's say.

220
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,120
You see a different motion, rate of motion.

221
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,140
And when they pass each other,

222
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,420
now the side that was against the more oblong, flatter part of the egg,

223
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,340
that water meets the point,

224
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,420
and the water that was on the narrower part meets the wider part.

225
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,900
They will reverse their frequency or movement or wave motion and move towards

226
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,740
the center again, and this will just keep repeating indefinitely.

227
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:32,380
And now you have a very mild form of convection or movement inside of the

228
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,840
ovoid-shaped vessel without adding external energy,

229
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,280
like an impeller or something to move it.

230
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,520
So are you saying that we should always drink our liquids from a wine glass?

231
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,880
Well, let's just say before we go to drinking,

232
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,200
liquids, especially high-quality liquids,

233
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,820
should always be stored in something that is like that, high-quality liquids.

234
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,960
Like if you look at the ancient amphoras that the ancient used,

235
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,180
their wines were stored, their oils and water in amphoras where they were very

236
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,540
narrow at one end and very wide on the other, right?

237
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,560
This also goes for seeds, seed storage and things like that.

238
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,280
When you're drinking it, let's say,

239
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,040
the primary concern is the storage of good, high-quality liquids in ovoid.

240
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,680
When you say should we drink it out of a wine glass or something like that,

241
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,780
think about the process.

242
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,380
When you remove it, let's say, from the amphora

243
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,240
or the ovoid-shaped container to drink it, there's not a lot of time there.

244
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,340
You've just removed it, and when you pour something to drink,

245
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,180
how long does it stay stagnant before you drink it?

246
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,240
Whether it's immediate or a few minutes, maybe an hour,

247
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,420
it's not going to have a big effect on it.

248
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,340
It's more how the liquids are stored.

249
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,640
Yeah, I see.

250
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,540
Makes sense.

251
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:55,900
Since we're on the subject of hidden truth related to health,

252
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,680
can you speak about how much role does light play in our bodies?

253
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:02,800
Massive.

254
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,760
We have light approaching us from the outer, and we have light on the inner.

255
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,440
I think we did, on the last time we met, on the last sonic event,

256
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,520
a lot of comparisons for people to look up a car tire, the intestines,

257
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,980
the skin, the lung, and so forth, right?

258
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,660
I would encourage anyone now if you – actually, we could all do it right now.

259
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,380
It's better if we do it in real time.

260
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,840
If you look up a cross-section of a large fiber-optic cable,

261
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,080
and if you just type that in, fiber-optic cable,

262
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,760
if someone's listening to this and they're driving or whatever,

263
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,120
fiber-optic cable cross-section,

264
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,820
which means you're just cutting 90 degrees through the length,

265
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,900
and if you view that, you'll get a sense of what's going on geometrically.

266
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,560
You don't have to know anything about fiber-optic cable.

267
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,480
It's just what do you see.

268
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,860
There's a certain image.

269
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:59,780
And then if you do a search, image search, on nerve cross-section, right,

270
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,400
as in nerves that animals and plants and humans have.

271
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,140
Let's just say animals and humans.

272
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,340
They're the same, geometrically.

273
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,040
Proportion, geometric, right?

274
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,560
You see that?

275
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,600
The filaments, even the filament structure, where if you say fiber-optic cable,

276
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,380
usually when you see the way it's promoted, they won't show you the housing.

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,520
They'll just pull out a little cable.

278
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,100
It looks almost like a fishing line with light going through the end of it, right, typically.

279
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,460
That would be called a filament.

280
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,860
So if you look at the cross-section of the nerves, you'll see similar filaments.

281
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,760
And you made a passing reference about growing skin back with light,

282
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,560
and was that on a need-to-know, or could you go into that?

283
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,520
Both, yeah.

284
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:48,220
So I would recommend people go and study a guy, Chromotherapy,

285
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:54,520
C-H-R, just like Chroma, Chromotherapy, I believe it's called.

286
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,480
There are several books on it.

287
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,040
Are you ready for this?

288
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,860
The author's name is Dinshaw Ghadialdi.

289
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,780
And Dinshaw Ghadialdi believed

290
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:10,960
and demonstrated in the early 20th century the effects of light.

291
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,599
Is he Punjabi or something?

292
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,480
Yeah, he's from India, yeah, Persia, that whole area, Persia.

293
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,380
I think he was Persian.

294
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,000
His interesting story was back in the – he had a lab in the 1930s,

295
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,520
you might like this, or late 20s,

296
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,480
and he was encroaching already on the medical industry because he was healing people

297
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,580
with very intense colored light.

298
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,600
And they sent the Army, and they dropped a 50-pound bomb on his house,

299
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,160
and all the neighbors saw it because back then it was the Army Air Corps.

300
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,840
And if you look at the history of that, it says his lab was in his house

301
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,140
and it was destroyed by a fire.

302
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:50,960
Yeah, after the Army drops a 50-pound bomb on your roof, yes, it will be.

303
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,100
By the way, that's still being done today.

304
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,640
It's less common than it was, let's say, during the Obama years.

305
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,180
But if they didn't like you, they dropped an F-16, dropped the bomb on your house.

306
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,840
It happened on the West Coast several times.

307
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:09,100
And then they would call the gas company to come and dump some old gas lines

308
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,740
and say it was a gas line explosion.

309
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,480
Now they use drones, by the way, small ones.

310
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,660
He's a man, huh?

311
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:17,840
What's that?

312
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,700
Big Mike was born a man, right?

313
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,460
Yeah.

314
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:27,000
Well, we'll get into the cloning aspect one day, maybe further down the road.

315
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,520
And I would just say from a cloning aspect, that's his mom.

316
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,820
But that's another story.

317
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,380
Who became a man and then became a woman.

318
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,180
Yeah.

319
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,000
A Greek has lost his mind, right?

320
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:40,420
Okay.

321
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:46,080
So let's go back to the light healing.

322
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:51,140
He found out early on there was a few people that were very ill,

323
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,920
probably even the late 1800s, and they couldn't do anything for him.

324
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,640
So they brought him in.

325
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,480
He was always looking for holistic techniques.

326
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,440
This is Dinsha Gadialdi, chromotherapy.

327
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,860
He put some milk and water in blue glass, just standard blue glass bottles,

328
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,540
in the sun.

329
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,040
And when the person drank this after a few days, they were recovered.

330
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:21,040
He found out various the main one was blue, the color blue.

331
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,080
So basically putting water in blue glass, putting it out in the sun for a few

332
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,620
minutes or in light and drink that water, it will imbue the water with that

333
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,500
energy, the blue.

334
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,140
By the way, I just want to say from a personal experiment,

335
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,600
if anyone has ever gotten too much sun, like you can experiment with this,

336
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,440
especially people who live near the coast in the summer.

337
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,040
If you're ever getting too much sun, you get a sunburn, a mild sunburn,

338
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:48,700
or even a pretty sunburn where it hurts to the touch, right?

339
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,340
Most people have had that.

340
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,300
It might last a few days, actually by the end of the day or so,

341
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,260
or the next day still.

342
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,220
But if you ever notice you're in a condition like that,

343
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,860
what you could do is get a very intense blue light.

344
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,400
LEDs don't work as well as incandescent, but you can do it with LEDs.

345
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:11,000
Go in a room, put up blankets so there's no light from the outside coming in,

346
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,300
and put yourself under some very intense blue light for about an hour.

347
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,800
You walk out later, and guess what happened to your sunburn?

348
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,360
Gone.

349
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,160
And if we get more intense with this, what if you had a burn with a blister?

350
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,900
You do maybe two hours, more intense blue light,

351
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,340
guess what happens to that burn?

352
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,220
Gone.

353
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:33,940
On and on.

354
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,200
He was able to recover people in burn victims in hospitals that they were just

355
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,540
giving them morphine because they had half of the skin burned off of their

356
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,920
body, second and third degree burns.

357
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,320
And he just didn't use a blue light.

358
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,260
But he also used yellow lights and green lights to regrow the skin,

359
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,080
and it was a therapy that took over two or three days.

360
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,400
And the lights that he used were basically very strong theatrical lights,

361
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,220
you would call them today,

362
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,520
or thousand-watt lights with colored glass in front of them.

363
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,620
In other words,

364
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:07,020
the lights were so intense that you should wear eye protection, right?

365
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,540
So the technicians would wear a blindfold,

366
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,640
the patient would wear a blindfold.

367
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,000
There's still some photos online about this.

368
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,740
There are people that have a lot of success,

369
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,660
but most of them do not have a lot of success,

370
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,840
just like with the colloidal silver and things like that,

371
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,880
is because they're not doing what is being prescribed initially.

372
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,500
Just like Tesla, you know,

373
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,400
a lot of times when industry puts up patents in the patent office,

374
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,020
you could look it up.

375
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,660
They leave out some key components, so you cannot reproduce it.

376
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:40,520
Or they might put something in that if you do put that thing in,

377
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,940
it will not work.

378
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:45,440
But if you go look at Tesla's patents, I assure you,

379
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,140
if you follow the patent strictly, it will work.

380
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,980
And I don't mean when he has wire and certain things,

381
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,380
you don't go to a modern electronic supply,

382
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,960
because when Tesla built these things,

383
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,660
there was no electrical supply, electronic supply.

384
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,420
He got pieces of wood, brass, copper, cloth, leather, rubber,

385
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,660
and he made it himself.

386
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:14,680
So the reason why, let's see, so, again, back to the chromotherapy,

387
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,380
most people that try this now are not being successful because they're not

388
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,760
using the intensity, the light intensity that's necessary.

389
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,380
And I could add that there is another scientist who deals,

390
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,660
focuses on this bioluminescence,

391
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,640
and he dropped out of Silicon Valley and invested all his money into

392
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,160
studying this and actually delivered, after many years,

393
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,360
a product that is called Analema Wand.

394
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:52,020
And all it contains is very, very structured water inside of quartz.

395
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:59,020
And all you do is put it in a cup of water and the structure is, yeah.

396
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,740
Yeah, I've heard of this, yeah.

397
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,540
And the results are spectacular in terms of the plants live much longer

398
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,740
and overall in humans as well.

399
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,900
He's all about statistics.

400
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,180
And the point is it never diminishes its effectiveness.

401
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,700
It only ever goes up, actually.

402
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,080
And what you do to recharge it is expose it to the sun every few months,

403
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,240
and that's all it needs to maintain its coherence.

404
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,980
Yes, the sun is, let's just divert real quick because we brought up light

405
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,160
and we brought up the silver and the light and the water.

406
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,040
I hope, well, this might take some people aback.

407
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,980
Some people know this.

408
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:44,440
They say the sun is hot, but as you start going up higher and higher,

409
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,040
the closer you go to the sun, it gets colder and colder, right?

410
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,580
And they say that if you go out of the atmosphere, it's even colder.

411
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:55,040
What you see as the sun is you cannot see it in space.

412
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,360
If you went into outer space, if you believe in such a thing,

413
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,400
and you looked in the direction of the sun, you will not see it.

414
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,140
But if you look at your body, the spacesuit or your spaceship will have light on it, right?

415
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,000
And the purpose of this is, for example, it's easy to prove,

416
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,360
because you see when the sun is rising and it's kind of like a yellowish orange,

417
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,780
but when it sets, it's more red.

418
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,720
How can it change colors?

419
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,180
It has nothing to do with the sun.

420
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,100
It's because the sun only appears the way it does because of our atmosphere.

421
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:29,900
That's why, for example, planets like Mercury that are really closest to the sun,

422
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,200
they have polar ice caps on Mercury, right?

423
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,980
You can look this up.

424
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,160
Are you familiar with this then?

425
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,400
No.

426
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,600
Is it hot?

427
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,920
We just need to go over this again.

428
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,280
I know it's the atmosphere.

429
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,200
Well, it only gets as hot as the atmosphere will allow it to, right?

430
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,100
Okay.

431
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,780
Mars, it supposedly gets purple at night, and it's a 28-hour day.

432
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,580
Sure, because of the Mars atmosphere, not the dust in the air.

433
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,520
Like, for example, you could look this up.

434
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,100
Do you know that the Earth is closest to the sun during winter

435
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,200
in the northern hemisphere?

436
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:04,340
What?

437
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:05,900
What did you say?

438
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,000
What?

439
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,000
I thought the closer we got to the sun, the hotter it got.

440
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,740
Mercury, that's so close to the sun, man.

441
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,260
There's molten.

442
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,060
They tell you there's molten lead on the surface, right?

443
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,180
But it has polar ice caps.

444
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,300
I'm not saying it.

445
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,700
It's in their own mainstream stuff.

446
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,560
Now it is.

447
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:21,700
Okay.

448
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,740
All right.

449
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,800
By the way, everybody cover your ears.

450
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,520
I'm going to say something.

451
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,700
A lot of people have gotten in trouble, these observatories.

452
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,120
You know when there's maximum solar events, that means a lot of sunspots,

453
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,120
you know, the black spots?

454
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,940
Make sure everybody's covering their ears for this.

455
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,520
When they looked inside of those sunspots very closely,

456
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,240
they saw structures and machinery.

457
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:45,740
Okay.

458
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,180
Oh, yeah.

459
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,760
You could take your cover.

460
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,380
Let's go back to the conversation.

461
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,020
That's really out there, right, for some.

462
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,260
Okay.

463
00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:00,080
So the sun is basically what you would call, it's like a portal.

464
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,660
It's a center.

465
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:05,520
It's an area that's giving power to the solar system through,

466
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,600
and we call it light in our visible spectrum.

467
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,340
But 99% of the energy from the sun is not light.

468
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,980
In other words, if you really know what you're doing

469
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,880
and you really understand what Tesla was saying, which is difficult,

470
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,140
because Tesla did not use engineering terms or scientific terms,

471
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,080
you will get more energy from the sun at night

472
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,240
or without getting it from the light itself, you see.

473
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,580
All right, if that makes any sense.

474
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,280
I think it's the difference between transversal and longitudinal light,

475
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,740
the fact that you don't see the sun normally.

476
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,180
Right, the transverse.

477
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,000
Like, for example, if you went up into the atmosphere right now

478
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,320
and removed the atmosphere in a certain area

479
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,200
and it would look black where the sun, you wouldn't see blue,

480
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,040
you wouldn't see the sun at all.

481
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,020
You would see the sun on other parts, right.

482
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,180
You need the filter of the transformation of the transverse light.

483
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,620
Just like, for example, during the day,

484
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,900
if you go into a very deep mineshaft and you look up,

485
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,540
the mineshaft should be more than 200 or 300 feet down.

486
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,240
If you look up at the blue sky, you will see the stars in the blue sky,

487
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,300
just like at night.

488
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,300
But as you come up the mineshaft,

489
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,820
the transverse light that starts bouncing around everywhere

490
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,180
and agitating and perturbating the atmosphere

491
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,900
and itself through the atmosphere,

492
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,320
like micromirrors and other things like that with the gases,

493
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,300
it blurs out all of the stars.

494
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,540
Yeah, light is a – so also, you know, you don't see with your eye,

495
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,060
you see with your brain, right, if that makes any sense.

496
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,260
The eye is just a sensor.

497
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,180
It just processes what comes in.

498
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,020
It's upside down.

499
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,860
The brain then makes use of it.

500
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:49,080
So you don't – in order – when it comes to optics, by the way,

501
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,840
you don't have to fool the eye like they say.

502
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,680
That's a misnomer.

503
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,320
You have to fool the brain.

504
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,720
So if you can convince someone that they're not seeing what they see,

505
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,920
that's good enough, even though it came through the eye, right?

506
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,920
You see how simple this is?

507
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,100
You said outer space if you believe in that.

508
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,220
What were you alluding to?

509
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,460
There's many ways to say that.

510
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,360
Like, for example, when you say outer space,

511
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:18,580
most people will say what they're being shown by mainstream, right,

512
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,740
NASA and all that, right?

513
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,200
And we know that very easy 90%, if not more, is fake.

514
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:29,300
So how can we use something fake that's being shown to us that is CGI

515
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,460
or false information as a notion, right?

516
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,380
And I think you also hinted last episode to the fact that flat Earth

517
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,320
also got it partially correct.

518
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,120
Can you go into a little detail there?

519
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:42,220
Sure.

520
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,000
Yeah, I made a big deal about the flat Earth and the round Earth

521
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,240
and the concave Earth back in the late 80s.

522
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,080
But that was not the time to make a big deal about it, right?

523
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,860
So there was actually a flat Earth club and all that.

524
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,440
I wasn't a part of it, but I attended just to see what the arguments were,

525
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,080
of course, right?

526
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,420
So you know how I said that you don't see with your eye,

527
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,040
you see with your mind, right?

528
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,100
Okay, that's why, for example, in some of the SSP stuff,

529
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,480
your eyes can be replaced with a cyborg eye, right?

530
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:20,060
It works just as well as long as you can interface with the brain.

531
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,400
And you see it in sci-fi also.

532
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,640
And actually it exists.

533
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,300
But when you talk about flat Earth and round Earth,

534
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,840
it depends on what part of the cruise ship you're on

535
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,540
and also what you're trying to master.

536
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,520
To the common people, it's irrelevant.

537
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,620
But to the commoner or someone who wants to be a master at what they do,

538
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,140
and this is a term that's no longer being used except for in college,

539
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:56,940
which is irrelevant, by the way, if you want to be a master farmer,

540
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,460
the best farmer, aggie, agriculturalist,

541
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,400
you know that the Earth is stationary.

542
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,280
Not you believe.

543
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,780
You know the Earth is stationary and the sun moves around the Earth

544
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,400
because you see it.

545
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,300
It rises in the eastern part.

546
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,680
It goes overhead and it sets in the west,

547
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,800
and it takes a different path in the winter than it does in the summer.

548
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,780
And in the fall and the spring, it takes the same path for a few days

549
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,260
or a week.

550
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,000
The reason why this is very important to you,

551
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,380
that the Earth is flat and the sun moves around the Earth,

552
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,860
is to orientate your crops.

553
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,820
Certain crops need to be in certain forms of light, right?

554
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,340
Also, you know if you're a farmer, the Earth is flat,

555
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,740
because if you're digging a ditch to bring water for a long distance,

556
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,560
water keeps its level.

557
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,260
So it has to start at a higher point.

558
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,940
And the destination, as the water moves along the Earth to its destination,

559
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,540
that point must be lowering and lowering in order to deliver it to your crops.

560
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,220
You see?

561
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,780
So in order to be agriculture, it must be flat.

562
00:30:56,780 --> 00:31:00,320
If you're going to do architecture, it must be flat.

563
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:06,120
They have things called levels and plumbobs, which is vertical or A-frame.

564
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,400
When you're building, putting up a building,

565
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,160
the outer wall on the north side, you're not going to say,

566
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:18,380
it's okay if it bends this way out towards the south,

567
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,540
and the wall that's towards the north bends out towards the north,

568
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,720
because the Earth is round.

569
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,000
We should compensate, right?

570
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:23,980
No, no, no.

571
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,680
Any building that you go to,

572
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,480
the walls are purely vertical based on devices as if the Earth is flat,

573
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,440
you see, for architecture also.

574
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,700
Here's the other thing.

575
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,680
If you are a surveyor, though, you're surveying,

576
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,820
you're measuring the Earth to make maps and things like that,

577
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:49,180
you better know, not believe, you know the Earth is round, right?

578
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,720
Now it became round, right?

579
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,580
Why?

580
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,700
Because I've done this.

581
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,980
I did an internship with surveying 40 years ago,

582
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,520
and we went out with theodolites and rods to measure heights and things,

583
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,060
and some people started five miles away, and we met in the middle,

584
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,220
but we didn't meet in the middle.

585
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,660
We were about 100 meters off, right?

586
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,780
And we did it again over and over.

587
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,680
That's why when you look at maps, you'll see that certain lines,

588
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:20,020
they have to jag it off, especially in the U.S.

589
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,480
when they try to do a grid method.

590
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,560
But some meet like the four corners area,

591
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,360
but you can't do a four corners with all the states like that.

592
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,360
So if you're doing surveying, and also some navigation,

593
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,320
if not most navigation, you know the Earth is round.

594
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,320
There's some people that try to use that the Earth is flat,

595
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,020
and the navigators and airplane pilots say they fly in a straight line.

596
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,640
I believe that's disinformation.

597
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,320
So the navigators and the surveyors, I know firsthand,

598
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,280
you know the Earth is round and curved,

599
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,280
but if you're doing agriculture or architecture, you know –

600
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,420
notice I didn't say believe – you know the Earth is flat.

601
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,480
So now what is reality?

602
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,300
It depends on where you are.

603
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,700
If you're just – to cover yours again,

604
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,220
a poor schmuck running around this Earth trying to figure out why you're here,

605
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,880
and you're born and you die and you want a retirement

606
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,460
and you drive a bus or whatever, nothing against bus drivers,

607
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,320
but you know what I mean, and you watch football and drink beer,

608
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,380
it has nothing to do with you.

609
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,760
The only concern is for people who want to be a master at something.

610
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,420
So that's another way of saying that it doesn't even matter what label we put on it,

611
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,480
whether it's flat or not.

612
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,260
It does because if I'm a master agriculturist, it's flat.

613
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:45,440
If I'm a master surveyor or a master navigator –

614
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:45,880
Objectively.

615
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,120
Objectively, then even when you're giving information,

616
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,560
you have to see who you're giving the information to

617
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,720
to be in the appropriate vessel.

618
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,540
You have to be a master, but if you're –

619
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,120
let me just throw a lascivious joke.

620
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,960
If you're a master baiter, it doesn't matter either.

621
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,380
So, yeah, again, even – let's say, Daniel,

622
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,460
that's a good point you bring up because I always say in the older sonic events

623
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,020
from years and years ago, be objective as possible, be objective.

624
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,820
Let's objectify, right?

625
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:19,219
That eliminates the duality and separation.

626
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:24,020
The reason why I always stress objectivity is for unification.

627
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,500
Subjectivity is division.

628
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,000
Objectivity is unification.

629
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,699
Do you see that simply?

630
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:31,799
Yeah.

631
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:37,500
And some people are taught – okay, here's the ultimate for humanity.

632
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:37,920
You ready?

633
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,199
We pick a leader, either human or nonhuman,

634
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,860
and we all start taking – we merge our emotions with our minds,

635
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:52,900
and we develop a hive mind, and then we go to the next level.

636
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,840
Do you notice that some of the things in there that I said

637
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,360
were going to irk people the wrong way?

638
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,860
You know, even in a hive, they're all individual, by the way.

639
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,580
You merge your emotion with your reason, so now you have full control.

640
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,600
You see, this kind of stuff pisses people off.

641
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,520
Let me give you an example.

642
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,560
The best way for people to live is through anarchy.

643
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,040
Oh, that's a terrible word, Greek.

644
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,140
Well, anarchy is the Greek word which means – ana means without.

645
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,140
Archos means leader.

646
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,440
What – in order to have – by the way, when you have an anarchy in real life,

647
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,660
not what you've been told, but the propaganda, in anarchy,

648
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,800
there is no chaos and there is no crime.

649
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,760
Anarchy means that each man – anarchy means castle doctrine.

650
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,580
Each man, each family where they live is their castle.

651
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:47,040
You cannot have anarchy unless everyone is very highly educated

652
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,540
and they're on the same page with each other.

653
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,760
If you lived in an anarchistic society where everybody was highly educated

654
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,140
and you didn't have any armies either, by the way.

655
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:04,340
Everyone had enough ordinance and knowledge to protect their country

656
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,540
without a separate army.

657
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,000
You see where I'm going with this?

658
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,340
This is called castle doctrine in some American states.

659
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,500
You have the right to protect to the death your own property and your family.

660
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,880
So you've been told that anarchy is a bad word.

661
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,860
It just means no leader.

662
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,880
It's a leaderless society.

663
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,900
Everyone is a leader.

664
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:26,740
So whether you're talking – so an anarchistic society – oh, the Greeks are anarchists.

665
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,180
That's bad.

666
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,060
Okay, that's what most people will be thinking to this point.

667
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,380
So they purge the bullshit.

668
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,760
I used a medical term there, by the way.

669
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:42,840
So when you – let's say you were to go to a true anarchistic society.

670
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,020
It doesn't matter if it was 100 people or a billion people.

671
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,360
It doesn't matter who you talk to.

672
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,980
You're going to get the same story from everyone.

673
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,960
Everybody knows the laws.

674
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,680
Everybody knows science.

675
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,260
Everybody knows what your quote-unquote rights are.

676
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,140
I don't think there's – rights mean you've broken the law,

677
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,240
and now you have rights, you see.

678
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,740
So everybody knows what the right – the difference between right and wrong

679
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,040
and is willing to fight and protect it, you see.

680
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,320
Free people do not ask for rights.

681
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,700
That's – right for what?

682
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:15,080
What did I do wrong that now I'm under rights that I've given up my freedom?

683
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,980
This has nothing to do with sovereignty, by the way, because you're not sovereign either, you see.

684
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,420
Do you see where I'm going with this?

685
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,640
The flat earth and the curved earth is exactly the same.

686
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,640
It's the same category with objectivity.

687
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,780
And the biggest factor is where you are, right?

688
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,160
Like the planet decides the laws.

689
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,620
The – well, the planet is actually like a bird's nest.

690
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,000
I've never said this before.

691
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,120
When you have birds in a nest, it's a place of protection.

692
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,360
And when you say the planet also, when you build a roof – build a house,

693
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,560
do you live on the roof or do you build inside of it?

694
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,560
So if you see a planet like ours, you fly by because these are primitive people here.

695
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,960
We want to communicate with the ones that are smart enough to live inside of it, right?

696
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,160
If you saw a neighbor that built a new house and lived on his roof for 10 years,

697
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,680
don't you feel like after a week you want to go to him and say,

698
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:17,380
hey, dummy, why don't you come down and go inside, you see?

699
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,180
Okay, so this stuff that I talk about is not for this society.

700
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,380
It's for the next society.

701
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,600
But let me go back to the hive mind.

702
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,660
Even when Zan was – oh, that's a bad thing, the hive mind.

703
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,780
Well, when – hive mind meaning you're a very high form of telepathy.

704
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,580
Can there be any corruption or lying if everybody knows what everybody else is thinking?

705
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,380
No, not at all.

706
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,920
Does it mean you're going to lose your individuality?

707
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,260
No, not at all.

708
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,940
No, but I'll take what you say, yes.

709
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:45,940
But there would be no off-ticking down the timeline of deceit and stuff like that

710
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:49,800
where politicians stand up on podiums and lie to everyone.

711
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,680
There's no politicians in anarchy.

712
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,280
I know.

713
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,180
I'm just saying there would just be none of that leading the herd off a cliff.

714
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:55,960
Right.

715
00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:00,160
In other words, you never want to pick – in an anarchistic society,

716
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,980
you could still have leaders as representatives,

717
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,320
but you would never want to pick someone who wanted to be a leader.

718
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,220
You want to go and find someone who is wise, good at decision-making,

719
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:15,020
very psychic telepathic tendencies also, can read people well,

720
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,620
and if you approach them and say, we want you to be our leader,

721
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,680
he will tell you, no, hell no.

722
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,920
That's the one you want to make your leader,

723
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:25,660
and you find some way to incentivize him, the one who doesn't want to be your leader.

724
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,460
Let me give you an example.

725
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:32,100
They still propagandize that George Washington was the first president of the United States, right?

726
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:32,880
Total hogwash.

727
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,340
There was like six presidents before him under the Articles of Confederation.

728
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:42,760
The Articles of Confederation, which were done, had presidents,

729
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,840
and they only lasted six months or so.

730
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:50,520
And then they did the Constitution 17 or 15 years later,

731
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,680
and they never expunged or got rid of the Articles of Confederation.

732
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,540
They just trampled it, just like now you hear a constitutionalist say,

733
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,400
oh, the NDAA and the Patriot Act is trampling the Constitution.

734
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,140
Well, the Constitution trampled the original government, right?

735
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:09,880
And if you listen to an academic, one that is knowledgeable,

736
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,360
which you're not going to find anymore,

737
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:15,900
they will tell you that George Washington was the first president under the Constitution.

738
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,040
But there were six presidents.

739
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,160
Like John Hansen is a popular one.

740
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,620
He was a Moor, by the way.

741
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,820
If you know what a Moor is, I'm not going to get into that.

742
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,400
So forget about Obama.

743
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:28,880
You know what I mean?

744
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,320
Go look this up.

745
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,660
Actually, on the $2 bill,

746
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,900
there's a scene where there's a Moorish man running with a piece of paper on the scene.

747
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,460
If you look at it very closely, it's like saying, hey,

748
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,020
what are you guys abandoning our law form here?

749
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:46,120
So basically the U.S. went rogue.

750
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,020
Let's say, Zan, you would probably be more familiar with this.

751
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,520
Let's say they shut down the U.S. Constitution

752
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,540
and everything is running in the U.S. now under NDAA and Patriot Act only.

753
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,940
They have quick courts.

754
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,780
Have you read the Patriot Act?

755
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,140
You know what a quick court is?

756
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,720
Quick court?

757
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,120
Yeah, quick court is like you do something bad.

758
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,760
If you've got two police officers there, they could execute you.

759
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,360
As long as the two police officers decide that what you did was bad,

760
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,440
they could shoot you on the spot and sign off on it.

761
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,040
Actually, they have police courts.

762
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,420
They do have police courts now.

763
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,900
But anyway, let's say the Patriot Act completely took over

764
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,720
and all the Bill of Rights and all that was shredded and everybody agreed.

765
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:33,000
That's what the Constitution did to the Articles of Confederation.

766
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,840
There's only one or two academics that are actually saying what I'm saying.

767
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,160
They did the public scene.

768
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,600
They wrote a few books and said, what about the Articles of Confederation, guys?

769
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,400
And they're kind of saying it below their voice.

770
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,620
They don't want to say it too loud, right?

771
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,700
We're still under that.

772
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,200
You have to repeal.

773
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,120
In other words, they were never repealed, right?

774
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:59,120
And since you segued into history, would you mind –

775
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,140
Go back to the sun, by the way.

776
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:00,600
But go ahead.

777
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,620
Segue into history, yes.

778
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:02,520
Oh, okay.

779
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:03,000
Sure.

780
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,840
Yeah, if you have anything on the sun.

781
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:10,200
Also, if you know what the difference between a planet and a star formation is

782
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,680
and how do planets form, if you think that's relevant.

783
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,200
I've never experienced it.

784
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,260
I could – okay.

785
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:20,460
In science, you have a postulate, hypothesis, theory,

786
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,760
and then experiment and conclusion, right?

787
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:24,980
That's the method.

788
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:30,480
So at this point, this has to be done backwards because we're already on a planet

789
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,460
that came before.

790
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,400
That experiment, we can't do because it's already made

791
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,200
or anybody else you're going to try to make a planet.

792
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,060
So we can theorize and hypothesize.

793
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,120
It's very simple.

794
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,060
Do you know the concept of fractals, right?

795
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:45,680
Yes.

796
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,980
The big and the small.

797
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,500
Like for people that may not know real quick, if you get a head of broccoli,

798
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,100
if you look at one of the flowers, it looks like the whole head of broccoli.

799
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,880
And if you look at the flower very carefully, there's a little bud.

800
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:01,100
If you take it off with a tweezer and look at it with a magnifying glass,

801
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,940
it looks like the whole head of broccoli again, right?

802
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,200
Unlike the Mandelbrot fractal, you'll find many of them in nature

803
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,480
that are more impressive like that, cauliflower, broccoli, and things like that.

804
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:17,860
So if we look at something like a planet, you know,

805
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,840
it looks a lot like a cell, doesn't it, right, in a human body?

806
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,680
And by the way, you have an atmosphere also.

807
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,500
The human body has an atmosphere.

808
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,060
If you ever smell anyone when they're walking by,

809
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,800
you're smelling their atmosphere, by the way.

810
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,880
You can change your atmosphere by putting cologne or aftershave on.

811
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,920
Are you with me, how simple this is?

812
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,500
So, for example, you know the concept of galvanic reaction?

813
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,580
If you put a – do you ever chew on aluminum foil and you're like,

814
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,400
oh, what's that?

815
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,000
It's a very strong reaction, right?

816
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,420
And you spit it out or put a penny in your mouth.

817
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,720
Do you know that you can taste that penny or aluminum foil

818
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,360
just by putting it very close to the tongue?

819
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,180
You don't even have to touch it?

820
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,740
That's why you don't eat caviar off of metal.

821
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,280
You use mother of pearl, right?

822
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,360
Say again.

823
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,220
That's why you don't eat caviar like beluga caviar.

824
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:10,400
You use oyster shell or mother of pearl to eat your fish.

825
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,100
Oh, sure.

826
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:11,940
That's one thing.

827
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,860
I don't eat that – I'll eat carp rather because the –

828
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,620
I don't eat fish unless they have fins and scales.

829
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,980
And catfish and beluga, they have fins, but they don't have scales.

830
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,120
I can get into what humans should eat according to the Elohim,

831
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,100
which is another thing.

832
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,320
And also no pork on my fork ever, right?

833
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,600
So I have a hard time if I go down to New Orleans

834
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,280
because everything is unclean.

835
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:41,320
But I have had crocodile gumbo, and I've had snake.

836
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,500
I've had – back before I knew what I should be doing.

837
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,080
And when I asked him how long do you cook the roux,

838
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,240
he says two beers' worth.

839
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:57,560
But anyway, to go back to the atmosphere, metals have an atmosphere and all that.

840
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:59,140
Everything has an atmosphere to it.

841
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:02,600
So you have to pick which fractal you want to look at on a planet.

842
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,820
I would suggest that water is not H2O.

843
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,120
We did not get into this.

844
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,860
And without understanding water,

845
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:14,040
you will never understand suns or planets or yourself or anything.

846
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,360
So that's another sonic event maybe.

847
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,080
But the planets are fractal.

848
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,260
So you take your pick on anything that might resemble a planet,

849
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:28,420
and your idea would probably be closer to what is being taught.

850
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:34,700
The molten iron core is total BS because molten iron, by the way,

851
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,840
is above the Curie point.

852
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,820
It cannot be magnetic.

853
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,480
You can use their own science to disprove their own science.

854
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,640
By the way, science died in the 1920s.

855
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,900
You haven't had any with Einstein when Einstein was brought forward.

856
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,280
Einstein is like Osama bin Laden or Oswald Schott Kennedy.

857
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,840
He's a patsy.

858
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,900
So they killed science in the 1920s.

859
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,140
So if anybody says this is science, well, he's rolling in his grave,

860
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,320
this science guy right now rolling in his grave,

861
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:06,920
clawing to get out and start beating people up because there's no more science,

862
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,400
by the way.

863
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:09,620
Why?

864
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,980
It's because we're not allowed, right?

865
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,400
Someone had enough power to shut down any sort of real antidote.

866
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,540
Yes, because it was decided a while back that you're going to be put in a

867
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:18,960
waiting room.

868
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,620
I even did a lot of sonics called the waiting room,

869
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:25,360
or you're in a holding pattern for the past 100 years.

870
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:29,660
They stalled the 20th century with all the wars,

871
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,760
and they killed science in the 1920s, and also they killed politics.

872
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,880
Everybody is under some neo-fascist communistic system.

873
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:37,800
If you don't know that,

874
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:42,160
you don't know why did they put Hitler, Stalin,

875
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,560
and FDR in office exactly within two months of each other.

876
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,480
It's a new system.

877
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,860
Also, you're in an even more stalled situation now with this one.

878
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:55,560
Look at how all the movies and all the arts are going down.

879
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,180
Morality is going down.

880
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,020
They're stalling it.

881
00:46:58,080 --> 00:46:58,920
You're in a holding pattern.

882
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,440
Waiting room is what I used to call it a decade ago.

883
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,260
Who's holding this for how long?

884
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:07,980
You've got about less than a decade left before the holding pattern is broken.

885
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,520
It'll actually be broken before that, but who it is, it's very elaborate.

886
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,100
It's kind of like the flat earth question, and is it round or flat?

887
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,260
It depends on which god you have allegiance to.

888
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,220
That's where you'll get that information.

889
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,880
I'm not religious, by the way.

890
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:27,740
I found every religion on the planet and every sect of every religion repugnant.

891
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,560
With the time you have, can we please go over this?

892
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,620
I mean this is encapsulating all three of us,

893
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,840
and Daniel and I don't have all the pieces or more pieces like you do.

894
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:40,840
I just noticed this is societal decay.

895
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,960
It just keeps getting worse and worse, and I try to be a shining beacon.

896
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,220
I'm trying my best.

897
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,460
I mean can you tell me who's stopping us and why and all this stuff?

898
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,360
No, the who doesn't matter.

899
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,440
In other words, your dog got run over by the car.

900
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,800
Does it matter what make, model, or car it was?

901
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:56,300
Okay.

902
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,860
The thing that matters – well, here's the thing.

903
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:03,380
It's happening on a high spiritual level, and even the most repugnant –

904
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,320
like I said, there's no elite.

905
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:08,680
Yes, there is an elite class, but if you know who they are, they're disgusting, right?

906
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:12,040
I mean disgusting with a capital S, okay?

907
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,480
So are they – okay, they're extremely spiritual,

908
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,840
meaning they rely on the stuff that people would poo-poo as being airy-fairy.

909
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,120
It's not what you believe.

910
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,960
It's what they believe that you need to know, right?

911
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:30,180
So I'm going to pause right here because we went – Daniel, we went into –

912
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:33,600
we just broke off like tree roots, and we went into different directions.

913
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,560
You see how it works?

914
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:39,040
Did you have anything in store in terms of the questions that we presented?

915
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:45,280
Yeah, well, if you want to finish, because I also had this prepared that you glossed over quickly,

916
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:51,020
that if you are to eat animals, you must make sure that they –

917
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:54,820
so supposing they have four legs that they chew their cud –

918
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,540
Oh, what should we eat humans?

919
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,880
Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, that must –

920
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,120
Meaning they ruminate.

921
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:00,780
Suggested.

922
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:06,060
Okay, when you buy a car or dishwasher or whatever, there's a manual in there.

923
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,320
So if you're not familiar, well, that's okay.

924
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:09,520
We're benevolent.

925
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,540
We're not expecting that everyone that buys a car or dishwasher or toaster or whatever

926
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:20,140
or a certain animal knows, so we include a manual, something to help, because we're benevolent, right?

927
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,000
We don't want to prank people and see them fail.

928
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,040
We want to see them succeed.

929
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:29,140
So this particular Elohim said for humans, in order to be in a better state or a proper state,

930
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:33,480
more proper state, there are rules for food, for example.

931
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,160
So very simple.

932
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:39,020
If you're going to eat animal – which, by the way, this comes from the biblical text.

933
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,900
I'm not religious, and by the way, I don't recommend anyone read the Bible

934
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,140
because after you read the word the, you'll be completely lost,

935
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,720
so you're not going to understand anything in it.

936
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,360
I'm not saying this to put anyone down.

937
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,820
It just happens to be what I see.

938
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,540
You won't comprehend it, especially the way it's presented.

939
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,280
But it can be distilled very simply.

940
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:04,240
An animal with four legs should chew the cud and have a clove and hoof.

941
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:10,280
It states, for example, like a pig has a clove and hoof, but he doesn't chew the cud.

942
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,200
A rabbit chews the cud, but he has a paw.

943
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,040
He doesn't have a hoof, right?

944
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,080
And the Koran, for example, doesn't give that distinction.

945
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,860
It says don't eat swine and don't eat animals that have died on their own.

946
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,560
So there's no discernment.

947
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,300
If you go to this text, it has a lot of discernment, and it gives examples.

948
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:30,340
So, for example, let's say we're out in the Himalayas.

949
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,040
We're trying to find some place in Tibet, and we're really hungry.

950
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,660
We've run out of supplies, and we're starving,

951
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:38,640
and we see an animal we've never seen before,

952
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,880
and we might want to eat its flesh for our protein.

953
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:45,080
And we've never seen it before, but we see that it chews the cud,

954
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,580
and it has a clove and hoof.

955
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,860
Well, even though we've never seen it before, we don't know what to call it,

956
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,040
but we could start by calling it dinner, right?

957
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:58,920
You see, because it meets those criteria.

958
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,780
Okay, so let's go to the next one.

959
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:06,080
If it comes out of the water, it should have fins and scales, fins and scales.

960
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:11,940
So most fish do, but catfish has fins, but it doesn't have scales.

961
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:12,560
It has skin.

962
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,700
Eel has fins.

963
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:15,260
It doesn't have scales.

964
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:18,680
It has bone, just like shark has fins, but it doesn't have scales.

965
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,640
Beluga does not have.

966
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:21,880
Sturgeon does not have.

967
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,840
Okay, does a clam?

968
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,020
Does a clam have fins and scales?

969
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:27,260
Heck no.

970
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,540
How about crabs?

971
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:29,840
Do they have fins and scales?

972
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:30,680
How about shrimp?

973
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,220
No, no, no, no, no.

974
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:32,540
Okay.

975
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,260
All right.

976
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,080
Let me see.

977
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,000
Now, this is not inclusive directly, but indirectly.

978
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,980
If it's a plant, it should be green and bear seed.

979
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,060
Okay, so that's most of them.

980
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:51,640
Let me ask you, does algae do that?

981
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:52,340
No.

982
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:52,600
No.

983
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,920
So I got the super food.

984
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,260
It measures in the laboratory.

985
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:57,020
Oh, man, great.

986
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,960
This is a super food, super green.

987
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,200
I don't want it.

988
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:04,400
If I want algae, I could go out to neighboring swimming pools, right?

989
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,540
All right, so those are the simple.

990
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:12,100
Let me ask you, are mushrooms, do mushrooms have, are they green and bear seed?

991
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:12,500
No.

992
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:13,660
They have mitosis, right?

993
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,680
So I got the super mushroom food.

994
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,380
Yeah, you can keep it.

995
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:26,320
But if you give me that expensive mushroom powder, I might rub it on my chest maybe, but I won't eat it, you see?

996
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:27,860
So that's how I am.

997
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,020
I'm an Old Testament fool or whatever you want to call it.

998
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:33,100
Most people think you are, but it works really well once you comprehend it.

999
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:38,260
Also, biblical timekeeping is lawful.

1000
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,240
All the timekeeping, even scientific, is lawful.

1001
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:42,880
They don't use the Pope's work schedule.

1002
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:43,900
So, yeah, go ahead.

1003
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:51,100
Well, regarding if you're not sure that something is safe to eat, I think you had a certain protocol for this, right?

1004
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:52,580
Yes, very simple.

1005
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:56,940
Usually that survivalist or protocol is with plants usually.

1006
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:01,580
And what you would do there is you have a very simple approach.

1007
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:06,240
First you touch it with your fingers, and you wait a few minutes,

1008
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:13,940
and then you rub it on the most exposed areas where your energy and sensitivity readings are,

1009
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:22,760
is like the inside of your wrist, your armpit, inside your elbow, your groin, in between your butt cheeks, in between your toes.

1010
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,540
Those are still all external, very highly sensitive areas.

1011
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:32,760
You take the plant and put it, let's say, on the inside of your wrist or on your armpit or in between your toes,

1012
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,780
and you wait about an hour or so or two.

1013
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:44,240
If there's no reaction, negative reaction, then you put it in your mouth and just take it out and wait about an hour or so.

1014
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,480
Remember, you've got nothing to do.

1015
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,020
You're starving.

1016
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,500
You've got plenty of time, right?

1017
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:55,080
And if no reaction but just touching it in your lips, let's say, and tongue at the same time for about an hour or so,

1018
00:53:55,220 --> 00:54:00,520
you can put it in your mouth and just bite, break into it with your teeth, take it out, wait another hour or two.

1019
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:03,980
If there's no negative reaction, you see where I'm going with this?

1020
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:04,520
Yep.

1021
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:05,420
On and on and on.

1022
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,540
You don't do it right away.

1023
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,700
Oh, I touched it between my toes.

1024
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:10,460
It's five minutes.

1025
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,020
How long have you been doing this?

1026
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:11,280
Five minutes.

1027
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,060
No, you have to wait because some things are very slow.

1028
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,920
So you can take a bite, chew it, spit it out, wait another hour.

1029
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:22,460
No negative reaction, take a small bite, chew it, swallow it, wait an hour.

1030
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:27,180
If this fool didn't die doing that, let's try another fool, right?

1031
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,740
You might want to try another person, right?

1032
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:29,660
Yeah.

1033
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,060
The kings used to have testers for this, right?

1034
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:40,060
And would you say that this ability to live off the grid is going to be vital in the near future?

1035
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:45,400
Yes and no because when you switch from this society to the next one,

1036
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,260
there's going to be not a very long time for dust to settle, about 40 years.

1037
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,340
It depends.

1038
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,880
Well, 40 years, Greek, I'm not 40 years old right now.

1039
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,720
What do you mean it's not a long time?

1040
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,040
You're not going to have this type of centralized community.

1041
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:04,060
You're going to have small communities where you'll have that castle doctrine.

1042
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,140
Wait a second.

1043
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,380
If we go back in history, didn't they have, like, these walled cities?

1044
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,900
And when you went into a walled city, it was like its own country, right?

1045
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,500
You're going to go back.

1046
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,540
So it's not going to be like each household.

1047
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,040
You know, even if you look at very rural communities,

1048
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,060
you'll see a lot of land and then a house and then a long distance.

1049
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,480
They still have a community.

1050
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,840
You're still going to have community.

1051
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,820
You're just not going to have centralized power

1052
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,500
and centralized military and all that.

1053
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,800
Each small enclave will be able to protect itself and all that.

1054
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,280
And since we're on the topic of the future,

1055
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,640
do you know if sea level rise is foreseen in these prophecies?

1056
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,680
Yes, of course, of course.

1057
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,400
Well, we are in a sea level rise right now.

1058
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:55,100
Just to explore this briefly, if you go off the coast of the Caribbean, Cuba,

1059
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:58,320
off the coast of Japan, any coastal area,

1060
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:03,240
and you just do some searching on the reefs and go out even 100 miles,

1061
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,180
there are cities, there are temples underwater.

1062
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,860
So aren't we in a coastal rise situation right now compared to 7,000 years ago?

1063
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,420
Heck yeah, right?

1064
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,080
And it's going to get worse, yeah.

1065
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:18,120
In other words, if you're living anywhere that's, you know,

1066
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:22,220
well, some people like Holland and Louisiana are below sea level slightly

1067
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:27,320
or at sea level, yeah, there's no future there, yeah.

1068
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:29,040
No.

1069
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:33,540
And climate change, would you say it's a valid concern?

1070
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:40,080
Because I mainly ask because ETs also are often reproachful of –

1071
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,740
reprimand humans for their treatment of Earth

1072
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:44,640
and say that much of it is their fault.

1073
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,780
Those ETs I wouldn't trust.

1074
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,680
If they see climate change as a big deal,

1075
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,760
those are, like, the ones that are pranking you.

1076
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,220
It is – climate change is a fraud.

1077
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,080
You hear very easy to destroy it.

1078
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:00,480
Yeah, to destroy carbon-based beings.

1079
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:03,220
But we're not – yeah, just the carbon-based being great

1080
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:06,360
because carbon has nothing to do with the greenhouse effect.

1081
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,980
The greenhouse – what they're talking about, global warming,

1082
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,120
is the greenhouse effect.

1083
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,640
Don't go for the global warming.

1084
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:15,240
Greenhouse effect is only caused by water vapor,

1085
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,500
so we have to get rid of all water vapor, which isn't going to happen.

1086
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:23,120
The carbon is just like Osama bin Laden vaporized the towers

1087
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,400
with 19 hijackers and box cutters.

1088
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:29,840
That's how ridiculous – but people – Gustav Le Bon, the crowd.

1089
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:36,880
The dumber it is and the more false it is, the more people will believe it, right?

1090
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,800
So let me ask you, just don't answer.

1091
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:42,200
What kind of a future does a society like this have,

1092
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,260
and do they deserve to have a future?

1093
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,560
And the answer to that is obvious.

1094
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:50,080
In other words, the people that you see here now, the majority, 7 billion,

1095
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,420
with a very, very small exception, and so small that you could fit them in a stadium,

1096
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,200
do not deserve to – not because I say this.

1097
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,020
Cosmically are not deserving to go to the next level.

1098
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,340
But this time it's going to be a little bit different.

1099
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:09,120
They're going to let more of the non-deserving ones stay to prove

1100
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,900
that they didn't have to be this way.

1101
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:17,280
So anyway, but there is no – here's the bullshit also about the hole in the ozone layer.

1102
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:22,760
Anybody that knows – they say that it's letting the UV in.

1103
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:26,940
That's an oxymoron because even a high school experiment will show that

1104
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:31,080
if you have an ozone generator with UV light, it generates oxygen, ozone.

1105
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:36,040
So the actual ozone layer is created by the UV.

1106
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:40,940
So they're saying the ozone layer is gone and it's letting the dangerous UV in.

1107
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:43,540
No, no, it's the dangerous UV that creates the ozone layer.

1108
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,120
How dumb can you be?

1109
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,380
Someone read me a post.

1110
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,360
This was from a high school teacher.

1111
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,340
I don't know if you guys saw it.

1112
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,640
It went around and then it was eliminated.

1113
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,160
High school teacher says we need to stop animal cruelty.

1114
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:02,980
We need to stop killing animals for food

1115
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:05,860
and just get animals from the store where they make it.

1116
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:11,720
Just like they ask little children where does milk come from, and milk comes from the store.

1117
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:19,240
But we are hurting the soul, spirit or whatever, but if it's anything, it's through our mind, right?

1118
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:24,100
Yes, you're doing it because your mindset is be in darkness versus light.

1119
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:25,680
But you need to know the dark.

1120
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:30,780
People say avoid darkness, which we try to define good, bad, and evil.

1121
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:32,680
Those are three things.

1122
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:33,840
It's not good and evil.

1123
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,700
It's good, bad, and when you do bad, you get evil, right?

1124
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,960
So the evil is not in the picture.

1125
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,860
But you have to know the dark side to know the light.

1126
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,220
In other words, how do you become tempered?

1127
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:47,540
How do you become strong?

1128
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:58,420
Years ago, society was a society of light, meaning from a physical sense,

1129
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:01,180
whatever products they used were developed in the light.

1130
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:06,240
So when they built things with their houses, they used trees and materials that grew in the light.

1131
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:11,200
When they used minerals and animal products, animals grew in the light.

1132
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:15,260
When they used minerals and metals, they were surface metals that were in the light.

1133
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:18,400
They didn't do very deep mining unless a cave afforded it to.

1134
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:22,800
They used surface materials and things that were made in the light,

1135
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,520
their products and everything that they came in touch with.

1136
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:33,140
Now society is in the dark because we are sitting in three different places right now.

1137
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:37,920
Can you touch anything that is not made or with petroleum as an ingredient?

1138
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,020
Almost impossible.

1139
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,400
Where does petroleum come from?

1140
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:49,620
You said it's rock oil, and part of it has to do with this black goo, which you said is more layers.

1141
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,620
Yeah, the black goo is like the water that has memory.

1142
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,660
No, it's not that I said.

1143
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:59,880
You say it also, and anybody who discovers this can say it.

1144
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,300
I'm not being an ass here.

1145
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:02,900
I'm just making it very closely.

1146
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:04,740
Oil is a hydrocarbon.

1147
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:08,080
You take hydrogen from water.

1148
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,700
Water is not H2O, by the way.

1149
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:11,540
You can get H2O from water.

1150
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:16,600
And carbon dioxide, what happens if you break off enough hydrogen?

1151
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:20,700
Let's just use the mechanistic method.

1152
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:27,620
You can synthesize oil from water and carbon dioxide if you know how to do it.

1153
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:32,740
You need a catalyst like nickel and a few other things, osmium and things like that,

1154
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,100
and certain pressures and temperatures.

1155
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:38,180
And those pressures actually have to go into a vacuum condition, ha-ha,

1156
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,080
which we spent a lot of time talking about.

1157
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:47,860
So is it so difficult to know that there is carbon dioxide and carbon gas,

1158
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,840
carbon liquid compounds?

1159
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,500
You know, there is a gel state of carbon dioxide.

1160
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,580
It doesn't have to be a gas.

1161
01:01:54,680 --> 01:02:00,880
You can have carbon dioxide in a room temperature state underground that form this from rocks,

1162
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,480
rocks being a catalyst as well.

1163
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,800
It's basically rock oil.

1164
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,120
Petrol means rock, and oleum means oil.

1165
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:08,920
So if you say corn oil, where does that come from, right?

1166
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:10,940
If you say olive oil, where does that come from?

1167
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:12,780
If you say rock oil, where does that come from?

1168
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:13,200
Rocks.

1169
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:19,640
The Germans were synthesizing petroleum before World War I, by the way,

1170
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:22,260
Germans meaning the Prussians, right?

1171
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:28,620
They were synthesizing India ink, which cut into, you know, we – someone asked about,

1172
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:33,700
I think you did, why did the Americans ally with the British when they were allied with the Germans?

1173
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,560
Well, it's not that they had a choice.

1174
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:41,040
They liked – Americans, Zen will know this too in his heart of being here,

1175
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:43,140
they love ingenuity.

1176
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:44,300
They love being inventive.

1177
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:45,300
They love being productive.

1178
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,460
They like helping people.

1179
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:47,200
Not the government.

1180
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:48,120
I'm talking about the people.

1181
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:49,680
That's why they're here.

1182
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:55,680
Like a lot of the people that immigrated here was because they reached a brick wall in whatever village

1183
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,820
or country they were in.

1184
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:57,700
They were like, screw this.

1185
01:02:57,740 --> 01:02:59,320
I'm going to go where we can expand, right?

1186
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,720
Well, they were working with the Germans on synthesizing everything,

1187
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:07,420
but the British already had control of all these things from natural products,

1188
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:14,140
and the British did not really – the Americans did not really ally with the British

1189
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,180
and abandon the Germans.

1190
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,840
What happened there was it was time to take the Americans out,

1191
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,680
down from what had happened for the revolution,

1192
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,600
and they went under the wing and the tutelage of the British.

1193
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:28,720
By that alliance being abandoned between Germany and America,

1194
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,980
that signified the beginning of the end of America,

1195
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,880
which led to the Federal Reserve Act, Woodrow Wilson,

1196
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,180
and then all the way to the bankruptcy and dissolution of the American government

1197
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:43,740
became the American administration under the new state under Roosevelt,

1198
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:50,580
which was 100 times worse than anything that's ever happened to this country that people talk about.

1199
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:54,480
And the reason why people don't talk about the bankruptcy of March of 1933

1200
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:59,240
and how Roosevelt destroyed the government is because it's in the Federal Register.

1201
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,580
It's in the Congressional Record.

1202
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,080
That's why nobody knows about it.

1203
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:08,060
Just like nobody knows anything about anything spiritual

1204
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:09,920
because it's already written in their books, right?

1205
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,860
So it was the beginning of the end of America.

1206
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,820
I don't think it was the Americans said one day,

1207
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,360
hey, let's forget about the Germans and go to the British.

1208
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:23,240
It was the infiltration and the effect that took them away to destroy them.

1209
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,700
If they would have stuck with the Germans,

1210
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:27,360
it would have been impossible to have bankrupted them.

1211
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,120
We wouldn't have a state.

1212
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,760
We would have a government.

1213
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:34,040
I know it sounds kind of crazy, right?

1214
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:35,860
The Greeks is insane, right?

1215
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,840
It's just that at the same time,

1216
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:45,600
nations have kind of started fraternizing soon afterwards.

1217
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:47,820
They made deals, and ever since,

1218
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:51,940
you can't really say that any war was really justified.

1219
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:56,240
I mean, it was all planned, and there were no more enemies.

1220
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,970
No, the wars are there to prevent revolutions and internal distractions.

1221
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:02,130
For example, let's just take the wars.

1222
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:06,050
World War I, the soldiers were promised to fight.

1223
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:09,270
Most Americans don't know it was less than a year, right?

1224
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:13,550
They created the American army flu,

1225
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,950
which they sent to Spain because no one else would take them,

1226
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:17,410
and everyone died.

1227
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:20,070
It killed one quarter of the American population,

1228
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:24,270
like 10 or 15 million people, not 500,000 like they say.

1229
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:29,410
It was engineered here the way that all plagues are engineered,

1230
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:33,170
not in the lab, but that was World War I.

1231
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:36,210
The soldiers did not get paid for going to World War I,

1232
01:05:36,290 --> 01:05:39,310
and they protested in Washington, D.C., and people like MacArthur

1233
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,830
and so went and gassed and killed the soldier.

1234
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:43,690
You can look this up, the riots.

1235
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:47,150
World War II, when they were going to go into World War II,

1236
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:48,970
there were massive protests here.

1237
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:52,250
People were jailed, and how come you don't hear about that, the propaganda?

1238
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,970
Whenever there's a lot of social unrest,

1239
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:58,810
they create an international war,

1240
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:01,330
just like what's going on right now with Russia and Ukraine.

1241
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:04,270
That's a made-for-TV war like the Iraq War was, right?

1242
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:10,410
There are people being killed, yes, but it's nothing like you're being told.

1243
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:11,990
There are more people with cameras

1244
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:14,150
than there are people with guns in Ukraine right now.

1245
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:19,010
Another much-talked-about thing that you mentioned

1246
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:22,730
was that Germany won World War II in an alternate timeline?

1247
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:27,070
James Rake mentioned that too, yeah.

1248
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:30,070
It's not only that they won World War II.

1249
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:34,530
World War II, the ones that did this in an alternate timeline

1250
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:37,810
or in this timeline, really, it's all one big thing.

1251
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:43,790
Like, okay, look at a map of various, let's say a country or city

1252
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:46,110
that has several highways that go through it.

1253
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:48,770
Which one is the alternate highway?

1254
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:51,970
Sometimes they call it an alternate, but they're all there at the same time.

1255
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:52,710
You see what I mean?

1256
01:06:53,450 --> 01:06:55,250
They're all present on the geography.

1257
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:58,910
These alternate timelines are all on the same geographic map

1258
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:01,710
known as our reality, which we just don't see.

1259
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:03,230
I don't know enough about them,

1260
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:09,390
but I had gotten from a pretty good source a few years ago,

1261
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:10,610
someone that's out in Texas.

1262
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:14,790
Good source because of other things.

1263
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:16,750
I'm not going to, just to say,

1264
01:07:18,210 --> 01:07:21,010
the Nazis approached the Pentagon in 1946

1265
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:23,310
and said that we destroyed your reality.

1266
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:25,910
You're living in a synthetic reality that we are creating

1267
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:29,810
with anti-grav ships and also underground.

1268
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:34,770
We destroyed you, and you're in a synthetic reality.

1269
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:35,550
We're in control.

1270
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:36,230
We won the war.

1271
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:36,950
We won everything.

1272
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:38,090
We control your reality.

1273
01:07:38,850 --> 01:07:41,810
There was like 10 guys there, and the Pentagon arrested them right away

1274
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:43,330
because they came to the Pentagon's door.

1275
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:45,450
They were plainclothes.

1276
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,830
They said, you guys are crazy.

1277
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:48,590
What are you doing here?

1278
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:51,090
He says, okay, we'll prove it to you.

1279
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:54,330
Let three of us go, and we'll prove it to you.

1280
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:56,630
So they let three of them go, and they kept the seven apprehended.

1281
01:07:56,690 --> 01:08:00,010
The three came back with a box and gave it to the Pentagon officials.

1282
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:01,850
The Pentagon officials opened the box,

1283
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:05,030
and what was inside the box were the most highly secret objects

1284
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:06,590
that the Pentagon had in their vaults.

1285
01:08:07,770 --> 01:08:10,730
So with the technology they had, they could see through everything

1286
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:12,390
because they were creating this reality.

1287
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:14,210
It sounds pretty crazy, right?

1288
01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:17,450
So basically nothing we do matters.

1289
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:18,830
All this is just for fun.

1290
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:20,490
No, it does.

1291
01:08:20,569 --> 01:08:24,510
Let's just say, for example, okay, everything that you know turned into a sewer

1292
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:26,910
or you went down to the sewer.

1293
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:29,930
Are you going to say how do we stop this and how do we change it,

1294
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:33,550
or do we say that sewers are necessary to take the shit away?

1295
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:36,850
It just so happens you don't want to fall into it, do you?

1296
01:08:38,029 --> 01:08:42,270
I'm just trying to think how I can contribute, man, in this timeline, in this life.

1297
01:08:42,569 --> 01:08:46,090
By setting yourself apart, what you do is you set yourself apart from it,

1298
01:08:46,090 --> 01:08:47,770
and you show others how you did it.

1299
01:08:48,189 --> 01:08:48,870
Just like this.

1300
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:52,529
Let's say you're in a crisis situation, survival situation.

1301
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:53,870
How do you help others?

1302
01:08:54,450 --> 01:08:58,310
Well, you show them how to get water, how to make food, how to make clothes

1303
01:08:58,310 --> 01:08:59,890
by doing it yourself.

1304
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:02,529
So you don't do it in secret.

1305
01:09:02,689 --> 01:09:05,090
You do it in a way that other people can see it,

1306
01:09:05,149 --> 01:09:07,050
and those that are willing to do it will do it,

1307
01:09:07,069 --> 01:09:09,569
and those that aren't, well, you're not going to make them do it, right?

1308
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:12,649
Like the old adage, when the airplane is going down,

1309
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:17,350
they say put on your oxygen mask first, and then the person next to you, right?

1310
01:09:18,229 --> 01:09:19,069
So be an example.

1311
01:09:20,050 --> 01:09:21,430
Set yourself apart.

1312
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:24,710
Like this morning I said I'll be here on the meeting

1313
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:27,450
because I've got to water the veg and feed the animals, right?

1314
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:30,910
Do I go around talking about people, about organic gardening

1315
01:09:30,910 --> 01:09:32,550
and husbandry and stuff like that?

1316
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:36,450
I was on a Skype call recently, someone I'd spoken to in a while,

1317
01:09:37,109 --> 01:09:40,090
and he said, hey, Greek, why don't you tell them about that motorcycle

1318
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:41,130
you sold me back then?

1319
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:42,170
I said, oh, what about it?

1320
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:44,310
Well, why don't you tell them how you got it to run on water?

1321
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:49,870
I'm like, oh, man, people that – you don't hear me talking about that stuff, right?

1322
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:51,210
You know it all, man.

1323
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:51,950
You got it all.

1324
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:53,149
You're not –

1325
01:09:53,149 --> 01:09:56,770
Why is it that when you go online and you try to make devices

1326
01:09:56,770 --> 01:09:58,810
that run engines on water and none of them work,

1327
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:00,370
but there are engines that are running on water?

1328
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:03,770
Why is it the people that make them work running on water aren't doing YouTubes

1329
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:05,630
and going online making pages?

1330
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:05,970
Why?

1331
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:06,650
Why is that?

1332
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:09,770
Because it's not about – it's about setting yourself apart,

1333
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:13,990
pulling out, but not doing it completely in secret.

1334
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:20,350
From what I heard, if what you're inventing overlaps with the black projects by over 85%,

1335
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:24,330
then they get it and they punish you somehow.

1336
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:30,510
If you do – well, they punish you if you're going to bring it to the great unwashed,

1337
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:31,570
the masses, right?

1338
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:35,990
Because they always give an example to the masses.

1339
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:41,490
They give this artificial – okay, especially people that live in America,

1340
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:45,050
they know that there was the booming era of the 1950s, 60s,

1341
01:10:45,130 --> 01:10:48,950
and the energy crisis in the 70s, and the financial boom in the 80s,

1342
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:51,770
and the tech boom in the 90s, and everything's great in America.

1343
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:52,790
All that is synthetic.

1344
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:56,970
All that was fake, completely fake.

1345
01:10:57,490 --> 01:11:00,230
All those booms that I mentioned that you guys are familiar with

1346
01:11:00,230 --> 01:11:02,230
and most listeners are completely synthesized.

1347
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:07,190
To see what spiritual level, consciousness level are you able to control,

1348
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:10,910
merge your emotions and your rationales so you have control of physical reality,

1349
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:16,750
your level of psychic ability, your spiritual ability would be developed

1350
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:19,530
when you have all this other physical prosperity.

1351
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:24,550
But what did they do when they had all this physical prosperity in the 50s, 60s,

1352
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:28,110
the energy crisis in the 70s, but then prosperity in the 80s, 90s until now?

1353
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:33,410
Did they focus the society – did they focus on spiritual development,

1354
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:36,110
psychic development, mental, emotional development?

1355
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:37,850
You guys can answer that.

1356
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:38,590
I don't have to say.

1357
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:40,150
People were greedy.

1358
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:41,730
They got worse and worse.

1359
01:11:42,370 --> 01:11:46,430
So you have about 60 or 70 years where they basically said,

1360
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:49,110
here's prosperity, physical prosperity.

1361
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:51,070
You turn on the tap.

1362
01:11:51,250 --> 01:11:52,150
Water comes out.

1363
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:53,170
You don't have to dig a well.

1364
01:11:53,650 --> 01:11:54,870
You hit the switch on the wall.

1365
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:57,250
Lights come on any time of day.

1366
01:11:57,250 --> 01:12:01,390
Are you developing yourself spiritually, mentally, psychically?

1367
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:03,130
And the answer is no.

1368
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:04,490
They actually went the other way.

1369
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:08,670
They became more greedy, more criminal, more corrupt, you see.

1370
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:10,430
Now it's over.

1371
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:18,370
So now the average human is a quote-unquote scumbag, right, category.

1372
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:24,330
The average human, 7 billion because of the last 70 years or more.

1373
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:27,430
And this has happened before and before and before.

1374
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:31,050
But there has to be an aim.

1375
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:32,590
Yes.

1376
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:36,030
The aim right now is to clean up.

1377
01:12:37,450 --> 01:12:38,490
Oh, here's another analogy.

1378
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:41,030
I'm tired of these analogies.

1379
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:42,770
You guys ever have a big party?

1380
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:45,390
What does it look like when everyone goes home at 4 in the morning?

1381
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:46,870
What does it look like at 10 a.m.?

1382
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:48,030
What does the place look like?

1383
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:48,950
It's a wreck.

1384
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:50,630
So what do you do?

1385
01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:51,430
You leave it like that?

1386
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:52,990
Five years later people say, why is the place a wreck?

1387
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:54,430
Was that a party here five years ago?

1388
01:12:54,930 --> 01:12:55,170
Yeah.

1389
01:12:55,690 --> 01:12:56,050
Yes.

1390
01:12:56,590 --> 01:12:56,870
Clean it.

1391
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:57,550
You clean it.

1392
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:00,070
But when you're cleaning it up, you've got to take a day off maybe, right?

1393
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:06,210
So if you ever listen to the old sonic events I've done, I call it the mop-up crew is coming.

1394
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:09,730
Not the gods, not the Anunnaki, not the saviors, the mop-up crew.

1395
01:13:10,030 --> 01:13:12,330
Well, who is this mop-up crew for this timeline?

1396
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:14,690
Is the earth flat or is it round?

1397
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:16,070
I gave the analogies before.

1398
01:13:16,210 --> 01:13:18,550
Pick a god and then come back and we'll discuss it.

1399
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:20,290
Pick a god.
