1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:05,250
And see what that God that you pick, what information he has about that timeline.

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:08,830
That's a starting, this is the basic start of it.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:13,470
This is like we said, if you don't give a real red fire truck or

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,350
a Ford F-150 to a four year old, you give him a toy.

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:21,150
And then as he gets older, there's a big gap where he doesn't.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,730
Here's the other thing, you give a child a toy of a truck, but

7
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,270
he doesn't wanna play with the toys anymore at seven or eight.

8
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,710
But he's still too young to get the real one.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,050
So there's a gap there where you can't give him anything

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,630
between the toy and the real truck, you feel me?

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,270
When you're 12 years old, you're still too young,

12
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:43,350
unless you're in the country, I was driving a car when I was nine.

13
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:50,450
But what I'm saying is, go to a child and give a 10 or 12 year old who's still too

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,190
young, let's say legally or whatever, to drive a truck, give him a toy truck.

15
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:53,650
What's he gonna do?

16
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,570
Get out of here with that.

17
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:55,910
He's in limbo.

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,430
So do you see my reference?

19
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,350
So you're gonna pick a God, see what laws and morality they have, and

20
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,930
then you're gonna go in a limbo for a while.

21
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:06,490
And then you're gonna find out really what's going on a little later.

22
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,330
Takes about a decade unless you work with people.

23
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,090
That's why people go to gurus and spiritual masters, so

24
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,510
they could take a shortcut.

25
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:18,110
But there is no shortcut, because you're just condensing it, right?

26
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,250
The shortcut is this, it's like, right now if I come to your place where you are,

27
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,970
Zen, or where I am here, you say, how's the room look?

28
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:26,770
Looks pretty clean.

29
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,890
But if I get down with a really good broom and I start sweeping and sweeping and

30
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,730
sweeping and sweeping, I got a nice little pile right here.

31
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,050
You say, I didn't see that before.

32
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,530
If you refine the scope to that level, yes.

33
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,650
I brought it all to one spot.

34
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:40,210
That's what the master of the guru does.

35
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,750
He takes all these things that nobody sees at the moment and

36
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,910
he brings it all to one spot.

37
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,930
It's too intense, right?

38
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,590
Yes, but- Yeah, go ahead.

39
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:54,330
Cosmically speaking, there has to be a bigger purpose for all this tyranny,

40
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:58,450
like we see in the SSP, for example, all the torture and enslavement.

41
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,130
And could it be tied to what you were hinting to prior,

42
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,970
that it is all meant to compartmentalize our minds and

43
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,070
make us, breed us better as warriors?

44
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:15,630
I would suggest that when you look at the further down the line,

45
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,550
way down the line, we're not given any information.

46
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,290
The only information that we're given is this tyranny and corruption,

47
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,050
the lying, cheating, stealing will go away.

48
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,030
And there'll be peace during that time.

49
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:35,570
But if you are disarmed and you do not have skill in fighting or

50
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,590
protecting or all that, you're in fear if you're confronted with the idea.

51
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,550
But if you are very strong and you have very strong abilities and

52
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,870
ordinance and you cannot be killed very easily,

53
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,730
you're not afraid with the idea of going to war, you see?

54
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:53,350
Not any more than I said, get up from where you are right now, walk outside.

55
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,150
You don't know who's out when you open the door and come back inside.

56
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,590
There are some people with psychological, let's say, whatever, agoraphobic,

57
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:03,130
they're terrified of opening the door and stepping outside.

58
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,990
But you're not, cuz you're much stronger than they are mentally.

59
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,430
So we're gonna be made much more mentally and physically stronger.

60
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,410
And it doesn't say why, but I can take a hint.

61
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:19,290
Yes, we are in a, I believe it's going to be joining them to protect

62
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,390
the existential, it's an existential question, the existence of this very

63
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,690
universe, guardians of the galaxy type thing.

64
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,870
We're gonna basically be, just like I said, the anarchists before.

65
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,110
When you go to an anarchist society, there's no, if there's a crime,

66
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,810
it's a big deal.

67
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,230
It's like if there's a rape or a murder,

68
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,430
the last time that happened was like 200 years ago.

69
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,670
And everybody is intelligent, everybody's very powerful.

70
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,910
There's no army because you attack the society.

71
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,630
You got 1,000 people living there.

72
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,550
They're all 1,000 warriors coming after you, right?

73
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,750
So, yeah, this is the society that's coming.

74
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,630
So, then it's gonna protect the universe.

75
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:01,690
Sorry, go ahead.

76
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:07,630
It kind of meshes with their idea that we are going to be a nexus

77
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:13,010
of the universe in about 1,000 years, a process that is going to start in about

78
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:17,230
10 years, maybe that's why we're being primed right now.

79
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,490
And do you know anything more about what makes us such a hotspot?

80
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,550
A hotspot?

81
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,590
No, because it's interesting from the relativistic perspective of where we are

82
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,850
in this galaxy, we're on the outer arm, right?

83
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,550
So, it's more than just the physical position.

84
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,630
I think all I can do is by what I've studied,

85
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:42,650
what makes us a hotspot is what we are in terms of beings to be focused on,

86
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,830
because we're being told so.

87
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,310
We're not giving any more depth in that.

88
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,890
I've heard from, let's just segue slightly, the idea of a chimera,

89
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:56,430
a chimera where you can merge a human with an animal, right?

90
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,530
If you know how to do it, and there's a technique or whatever,

91
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,990
you can have half horse, half human, half whatever, lion, half man, half bird.

92
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,930
We're the easiest to do that, to hybridize humans.

93
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,830
We were made to be hybridized.

94
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,510
We're like the Swiss army knife of the cosmos, right?

95
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,470
He has all the various tools.

96
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,190
Don't they do that stuff underground like at Dulce or down in-

97
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:19,930
Sure, sure, sure.

98
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,050
It's being done almost every,

99
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,610
there's 1,000 bases underground where these beings are.

100
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,470
Some of these, they're so self-sufficient, these underground bases, and

101
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,330
when they set them up, they just pour concrete over them,

102
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,550
because you're never going to come out.

103
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,490
They're autonomous, you know?

104
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,870
Yeah, we hear this, that we have the most ductile DNA of all species.

105
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,170
And I guess this is why we're sought after and

106
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:50,030
why we have this extreme of fear and emotion.

107
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:51,590
Yes.

108
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,490
Can you tell us more about how we could use our emotions in a more

109
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,150
constructive way?

110
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,950
Sure, like I think we maybe in private or

111
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:03,630
slightly brought it up the last time, the emotions are never discussed,

112
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,890
unless you mentioned someone who's emotionally activated.

113
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,010
You ever hear of people that it was not like him to be that way,

114
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,590
well he was very emotional, and it's accepted when you hear that, or

115
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,250
emotionally disturbed, or this or that.

116
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:21,050
It's not popular in public to talk about what the purpose of the emotions are.

117
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,730
This is something that comes from the very, I'm not gonna say, but

118
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:29,490
maybe the Tai Chi hidden schools and things like this,

119
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,910
that you guard this very carefully.

120
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,770
That the purpose of the emotion, it's the carrier, let's say, or

121
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,930
the tool to manifest your reason, and your logic, and your being, and

122
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,430
the material, and psychic, and non-physical world, let's say.

123
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,370
So the overcoming feeling that people get when they are emotional,

124
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,130
when they're overcome by their emotions, is an energy.

125
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,590
Now once you understand it's there for a reason, you can grab it like you grab

126
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:02,010
a wild horse and you put reins on it, and you can control it for

127
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,430
whatever you want to manifest.

128
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,230
That's a wonderful analogy.

129
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:06,770
Yeah. Yeah.

130
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,210
And this is one of the big taboos also in the secret societies.

131
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:17,510
If you ever walk into a very high level martial arts teaching or discussion,

132
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,770
and you walk in and they all stop talking and

133
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,130
they don't start talking until you leave,

134
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,370
they're discussing what we're discussing right now.

135
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:30,670
And is everyone born with this ability to

136
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,670
affect the surroundings just through the energy?

137
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,910
Yes. And you can heal or injure.

138
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,150
That's, well, yeah, let's do a quick example.

139
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,470
Do you ever hear people, I wanna give him good energy, let's give.

140
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,610
You have the giving energy, you have the guarding energy,

141
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,050
you have the taking energy, right?

142
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,210
Those are some basic ones.

143
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,290
So let's say the giving energy.

144
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,090
There is an emotion that's component base platform to the giving energy.

145
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,770
All of these energies, by the way, view them very simply.

146
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:07,030
Like for example, you go to your kitchen cupboard, you have a dinner plate,

147
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,770
you have a soup bowl, a salad bowl, a coffee mug, each one.

148
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,990
They're all made of the same materials, but

149
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,830
they're different shapes to hold different things.

150
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,350
So the giving energy, for example, how do we evoke, how do we put ourselves,

151
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,410
how do we bring that up?

152
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,830
Just like you bring up a program or a page on your computer.

153
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,210
Okay, simple, you don't have to use this as a very common example.

154
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,169
Hug, when you give someone a hug, even right now if you're alone or

155
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:36,370
driving, gesture a hug, just by yourself, don't look too crazy though.

156
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:39,950
Put your arms in front of you as if you're going to hug someone,

157
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,070
especially when you're standing.

158
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,470
You cannot help it, but feel a light sensation from your legs.

159
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,830
It rises through your thorax, through your solar plexus, and

160
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,770
it's tingling and it's slightly warming.

161
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,470
Just gesturing a hug, that is the giving energy.

162
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,250
So if you could evoke your body to feel that, and I said feeling,

163
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,390
now it is ready to give, to emanate.

164
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,090
So an example, someone says, for example, let's pray,

165
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,310
let's give energy to my friends, sisters, brothers, cousin, whatever who's sick.

166
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,930
You don't know them, you don't have to know them.

167
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,650
So how do we identify them?

168
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,710
You identify them by some personal marker.

169
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,450
You know my sister's brother, sister, whatever, cousin,

170
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,830
has some unique features to them.

171
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,690
So we're thinking of someone that we were asked to give this

172
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,310
healing energy to as unique features.

173
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:28,870
What's unique?

174
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,470
They have their own fingerprints, their own height,

175
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:33,370
their own social security number.

176
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,950
It doesn't matter how trivial or important it is.

177
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,830
Just think of something that's to them to identify them.

178
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,570
They have something unique about them, yes.

179
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,830
It might help if they're 70 years old and they have cancer.

180
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,030
Well, you say, well, did they have cancer when they were 18?

181
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,490
No, so you imagine what that person was like when they were 18,

182
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,590
and you send the image of that body, whatever the image is,

183
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,730
it's the feeling, over that feeling of that hug,

184
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,070
that giving energy that you just created over.

185
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,350
What if it was a birth defect?

186
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,750
Then you go before conception.

187
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,150
If it was genetic, then you have to go back to the genetic line,

188
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,750
even if it's 100 generations or 10 generations.

189
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,330
And now you're giving that energy, very powerful.

190
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,030
This takes practice, by the way.

191
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,430
You could also give a negative energy, right, to hurt someone.

192
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,370
But why would you do that, right?

193
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,830
You see, another one simply is guarding.

194
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,810
You know, people always say guard yourself, right,

195
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,150
the spiritual, guard yourself.

196
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,470
Well, how am I supposed to do that?

197
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,650
When you have to guard yourself, there's an emotion attached.

198
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,190
Now, if you could bring that emotion up, evoke it,

199
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,870
you are now in a guarding state.

200
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,410
Example of that is, remember, maybe you didn't do your homework,

201
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,730
you were very young in class,

202
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,970
and you get a feeling the teacher's gonna call on you,

203
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,150
and they do, and you get the shock in your body, right?

204
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,050
That's the guarding energy.

205
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:02,090
Another form of the guarding energy is denial.

206
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,450
That's why they tell you, don't fear, don't deny.

207
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,790
No, no, denial, this is where denial is helpful.

208
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,130
Let's say you put your hand in the cookie jar

209
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,970
and took a cookie when you weren't supposed to.

210
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,470
You weren't caught, but you were blamed for it later.

211
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,850
Do you say, yes, or do you say, I deny I did that?

212
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,610
When you deny something,

213
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,810
there's a certain feeling that comes up.

214
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,550
You can almost feel it.

215
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,050
It's kind of like a dull feeling,

216
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,390
like you wrapped a piece of plastic around your chest.

217
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:29,110
All right, everybody describes it slightly different.

218
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,450
And when you have that feeling, like, no,

219
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,050
it's even stronger.

220
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,670
You can also deny something that you didn't do,

221
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:36,350
but it's much stronger when you deny something

222
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,270
that you did do.

223
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,190
And this is not lying.

224
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:38,970
This is denying.

225
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:39,590
It's different.

226
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:40,910
So you evoke an emotion.

227
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,770
Now you have the guarding emotion in place.

228
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,550
And when you feel that, right,

229
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,210
now you're able to guard from what?

230
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:52,670
Whatever your input, your reason and logic tells you

231
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,590
you should guard yourself, whether it's a spirit or an ET,

232
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,890
a discarnate body, non-physical body, same thing,

233
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,150
or another human's thoughts,

234
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,930
or even disease, by the way, quote-unquote,

235
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,110
because disease is not material, it's inductive.

236
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:12,290
So I'm giving a very basic outline right here

237
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,010
where if you practice this every day for a few minutes,

238
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,750
you will be literally in a few years,

239
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,010
you could be like a superhero.

240
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,050
Superhero, like the X-Men.

241
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,130
Okay, here's an example.

242
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,950
You ever see the X-Men movies?

243
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,190
Like the guy who makes ice or snow

244
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,570
or the guy who makes things magnetic.

245
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,450
You ever notice before they put their superpower,

246
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,970
they change their emotional state slightly?

247
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,830
They're summoning something.

248
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,910
Well, also they're changing their own emotional state.

249
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,910
Like one, the lady who makes storms,

250
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,010
she's all happy and smiling,

251
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:45,750
then she gets an angry face to make the storm, you see?

252
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,810
Then there's another guy who does the magnets or whatever.

253
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,030
He gets all happy and smiley and laughy

254
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,870
when he's doing the magnet or whatever.

255
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,170
I think he says, ha, ha, ha, ha.

256
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,670
Like, right, you see?

257
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,950
So each one is different.

258
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,990
So once higher beings, like for example,

259
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,230
I don't know, like the Imperial Draco, for example,

260
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,050
they do not have a separate emotional rational body.

261
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,830
They've merged the two.

262
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,870
So when they wanna protect themselves,

263
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,770
if they wanna kill someone, they just think it

264
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,630
and you're dead physically, you're cut in half

265
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:19,070
because they know how to manipulate the atomic level,

266
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,410
you see, and vice versa.

267
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,590
They can heal also, by the way, you see?

268
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:29,370
So a being like that, that has merged its emotional,

269
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,570
not like Spock and the Vulcans

270
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,570
where they deny the emotion, you see?

271
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,030
That's the other, that's the left hand,

272
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:35,890
that's the dark side.

273
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:40,350
But an advanced being that merges the two, right?

274
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,130
And also they're not alien if they approach themselves

275
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,030
to you and have sympathy and compassion to you,

276
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,030
they're not alien.

277
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,010
They're like, you know what I mean?

278
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,070
Any being that has sympathy and compassion to you,

279
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,230
truthful, not like the fake galactic federations

280
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,530
that you hear about or whatever.

281
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,290
There's a whole bunch of fake people saying

282
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,810
that the colonies have been freed

283
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:02,970
and you're gonna be fine.

284
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,370
That's all fake, by the way, right?

285
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,190
The galactic federations of light, you know,

286
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,770
what about the galactic federation of evil

287
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,610
or the galactic federation of darkness?

288
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,190
How many people are you gonna get if you say that?

289
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,010
But if you say the galactic federation of light

290
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,730
or the aster, are these people gonna come and help you?

291
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:22,750
How many people are you gonna get?

292
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,410
Oh, let me see.

293
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,230
I got 500,000 followers already.

294
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,730
You start telling people that it's good and bad

295
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,270
and then evil if you do bad.

296
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,790
Oh, I've been running this channel for 10 years.

297
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,930
I got six followers.

298
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,770
Good, because that's all you're gonna get.

299
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,250
That's only six people that will understand this, right?

300
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,830
Yeah, I always thought, you know,

301
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:47,090
a level of followers on anything is not,

302
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,490
it doesn't hit towards altruism, you know?

303
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,370
If half the people knew what was going on,

304
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,950
on the Earth, half the people,

305
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,130
each one only needs to help one person

306
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,570
and we're all taken care of, right?

307
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,750
Yes, at the same time.

308
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,150
Yeah, but I think that these conglomerates

309
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:10,370
like the Astar Command, they put it in your face

310
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,250
because there are actually real versions of that,

311
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,550
but what they are speaking about

312
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,690
is something completely different,

313
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,130
so they're just taunting us.

314
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,070
But scenarios, the people that are talking

315
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,910
about all this stuff have been run through scenarios.

316
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,470
They've never gone anywhere,

317
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,910
but if you put a gun to their head and say,

318
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,970
tell me the truth now, that is,

319
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:30,970
they are telling the truth

320
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,650
according to what they've experienced.

321
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,850
That's why I'm so happy

322
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,690
that they call themselves experiencers

323
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,430
because if someone saws a woman in half on stage

324
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,590
and puts her back together,

325
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,010
the 500 people in the audience are experienced,

326
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,970
they will sign an affidavit under the penalty of perjury,

327
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,990
under the penalty of whatever,

328
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,250
that they saw a woman being sawed in half

329
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,610
and put back together, yes.

330
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,230
But somebody lied and they swear to it.

331
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,790
So they're victims.

332
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:00,810
They're not, they're super victims or whatever,

333
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:01,370
you know what I mean?

334
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,030
They're victims.

335
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,290
So you don't wanna criticize a victim

336
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:06,110
because they're a victim.

337
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:06,770
They need help.

338
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,830
They don't need negative criticism.

339
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:09,510
Do you see what I mean?

340
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:10,950
As a matter of fact,

341
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,490
most of them call themselves victims,

342
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,210
but they're still doing all the full picture.

343
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,870
Well, I still think that some of them are like that

344
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,870
and others are genuine,

345
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,050
but it's impossible to prove, I guess.

346
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,670
Look, all 500 people that saw the woman

347
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,350
being cut in half and put back together,

348
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:28,490
which one is not genuine?

349
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,170
Which one is?

350
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:29,750
They're all genuine.

351
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,490
Yeah, but some are not just in their mind,

352
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,710
but also physically there.

353
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,330
Yeah, the woman cut in half on stage

354
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,790
and put back together was physical.

355
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,090
By the way, do you know how that's done real quick?

356
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:41,850
Do you know how that's done?

357
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:42,250
No.

358
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:47,410
You get two physically fit contortional women.

359
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,030
The woman that showed on stage

360
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,890
is gonna be cut in half,

361
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,350
preferably taller than the one,

362
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,510
so the other one.

363
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,350
Now, where's the other one?

364
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,410
The other one's already in the box or in the table.

365
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,250
So when the woman that is presented

366
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,570
starts putting her legs into the box,

367
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,190
the woman that's already in the box

368
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,550
is pushing her legs out

369
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,510
while the woman who's going in,

370
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:08,089
you think her legs are being stretched out,

371
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,650
you're being fooled,

372
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,310
but she's actually curling them back.

373
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:14,050
So when he puts the saw blade through the middle,

374
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,609
it's passing the knees of the woman

375
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:17,790
used to go into the box

376
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,410
and the head of the woman who stuck her legs out.

377
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,670
And then they separate the box.

378
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,349
There's two women.

379
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,150
Then they put the box together.

380
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:28,990
And as the tall woman's coming out,

381
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,490
the first woman that you saw on stage,

382
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,170
the woman that you'll never see,

383
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,070
she's pulling her legs in at the same time

384
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,690
to give the illusion that her legs are being pulled out.

385
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:38,710
I see.

386
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,590
And-

387
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,310
See, this is similar to a scenario.

388
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,730
See how simple this is to do?

389
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,250
Well, yes.

390
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,590
But you also said something along the lines of

391
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,770
that matter is frozen light and that we can materialize.

392
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,290
And does that have connection with the emotion?

393
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,590
Materialize.

394
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,390
Yes, let's go back.

395
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,890
Maybe we mentioned the, I hate saying it, med bed.

396
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,870
It sounds so funny.

397
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,710
Notice how it's so trivial when you say med bed.

398
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,550
Sounds like something like happy meal, right?

399
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,170
Okay.

400
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,750
Okay, this is for the really smart people, right?

401
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,930
Let's say, you know, being sarcastic here.

402
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,990
Let's put one together, really.

403
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,550
Because everybody's saying the med beds are coming,

404
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,870
the British are coming, the med beds are coming,

405
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:22,790
the med beds are coming.

406
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:23,850
You know, they're all full of it, right?

407
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,430
All these people talking about med beds,

408
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,190
they couldn't pour piss out of a boot

409
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,630
with instructions on the heel, okay?

410
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,450
Just that's a pretty good visual if you could imagine that.

411
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,710
I'm not putting them down.

412
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,890
I'm just saying the whole thing is dumb.

413
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:42,830
If you wanna do something, let's talk about how to do it.

414
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,250
Why are you asking, look at the, by the way,

415
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,470
look at the greed behind the med bed talk.

416
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,290
How greedy these people are.

417
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,570
I'm not greedy.

418
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,130
You got Mrs. P, look how greedy.

419
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,530
Oh, are they gonna give it to us?

420
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,890
Are they gonna give it to us?

421
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,530
Yeah, you're gonna get it, all right.

422
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:01,870
Not a med bed.

423
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,150
So let's get some reasonably

424
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,770
half intelligent people together.

425
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:09,150
Maybe, I don't, you know, when I say half intelligent,

426
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,370
it means half wit, which is a term that's not very good.

427
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,450
But let's put one together.

428
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,090
Let's lay it out real quick in the next three minutes.

429
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,430
You ready?

430
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,310
We know that the water is not water.

431
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,710
We know that there is induction.

432
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,730
We have examples of induction constantly.

433
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,910
We know the human body doesn't work on absorption

434
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,010
or anything, it works on induction, it works on water.

435
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,870
Certain electrical principles.

436
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,610
We know that there's the emotion component.

437
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:38,610
We know that the light regenerates skin.

438
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,650
So let's start putting this together.

439
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,990
Do you know that EKGs, you know,

440
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,730
they could measure nerve functions and brain functions

441
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,270
and read it out on a graph, right?

442
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,910
You can read it on a plant also.

443
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,070
You could put that in from those devices

444
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,570
currently available on plants

445
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:56,030
and read the stimulations and differences

446
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,570
in anything alive, even bacteria, petri dish.

447
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,630
Do you know the, let's go back to the human part

448
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,270
and all the things you mentioned before.

449
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,970
Do you know, have you ever heard of an amputee?

450
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,190
He has a phantom itch.

451
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,750
Someone had a leg removed

452
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,850
and they feel like their left leg removed

453
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,070
and they feel a phantom itch.

454
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,850
They go to scratch it, but there's nothing there.

455
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,350
You've heard of it, Zen?

456
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,970
You're going, maybe you didn't, yeah.

457
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,450
It's called a phantom, what is there another,

458
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,310
there's a medical term for it, there's a Greek term, but.

459
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,510
Okay, that means that the energy body

460
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,870
of the human is still there.

461
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,610
The pentagram shape, the five, you know,

462
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,030
like you see Michelangelo draw.

463
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,870
And how could you be so present

464
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,930
that it actually fooled the individual

465
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:39,310
who knows his leg was cut off to go scratch it?

466
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,110
That's how strong it is.

467
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,590
It's not just that the leg is still there energetically,

468
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,870
but there's actually impulses still running through there.

469
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,370
Now we can measure that impulse

470
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,470
by attaching things to the person's body.

471
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,090
Actually right now,

472
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,670
you don't even have to attach anything.

473
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,870
You don't need it to do a physical DNA sample anymore.

474
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,710
It could be scanned.

475
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:57,630
Are you aware of this

476
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,810
or this information hasn't come out yet?

477
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,130
Okay, just like a barcode.

478
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,490
So this phantom itch, by the way,

479
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,150
for the person to feel an itch on a leg

480
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,550
that doesn't even exist,

481
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,730
could you imagine what's going on

482
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,750
on that missing leg that he doesn't feel?

483
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,070
Tremendous amount that could be read

484
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,090
with sensitive equipment.

485
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,090
So now that we know that,

486
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:21,430
we know that water can be produced through induction,

487
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:24,230
just like a water is produced underneath a rain cloud.

488
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,150
There's no water in a rain cloud at all.

489
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,830
If there was any water in a rain cloud, it would be fog.

490
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:33,090
Water is produced under the rain cloud instantly.

491
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:34,990
We know how to produce water.

492
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,930
We know it's induction.

493
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,910
We know that light rebuilds tissue.

494
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,630
Do you see where I'm going with this now?

495
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,950
Do you see how I just did?

496
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,090
Okay, when you work with IT,

497
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,990
you do a lot of bubble diagrams

498
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,230
and Venn diagrams, don't you?

499
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,050
Right?

500
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:51,410
Then you have the engineers.

501
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:52,610
This is what we wanna do,

502
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,670
but how do we do it, right?

503
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,510
With anything, even a plan, a battle plan, right?

504
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,250
We draw a bubble diagram, schematic.

505
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,650
I just gave you the whole outline.

506
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,870
Well, there are still some missing steps.

507
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:04,210
Further and further.

508
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:05,930
What's that?

509
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,990
There are still some steps technically speaking, right?

510
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:09,970
I mean, the hardware.

511
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,230
Yeah, well, the hardware you have, okay.

512
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:13,950
Remember how I said,

513
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,690
if you wanna build Tesla stuff,

514
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,250
a lot of people don't have success

515
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,990
because they go to the electronics store

516
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:19,930
and buy modern stuff.

517
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,510
And also they don't follow everything to a T.

518
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,650
They make adjustments because if you do that,

519
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,550
if you tell your electronics friend you wanna do this,

520
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,510
he says, oh, why use that?

521
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,790
Because we have this now.

522
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,530
Ah, ah, ah, screwed up.

523
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,710
If you wanna do Tesla stuff,

524
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,990
you need to find bottles, empty wine bottles,

525
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,270
pieces of brass, pieces of leather,

526
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,690
pieces of wood, right?

527
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:46,330
Junk, right?

528
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,930
So the way you build this is you go and find,

529
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,290
you go to an electronics surplus place

530
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,370
and you build it that way.

531
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,210
The reason I say this is because

532
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,810
if you know what a capacitor does,

533
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,770
a resistor, an inductor, a diode,

534
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,650
you're not gonna find that.

535
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,190
The modern capacitors and diodes are so small.

536
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,910
I can't even, I need a tweezer.

537
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,370
I can't even solder one.

538
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,130
It has to be wave soldered.

539
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,050
Where if I go, let's say,

540
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,210
get an old germanium diode from Mauser,

541
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,430
it's something I hold in my hand.

542
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,970
It's about the size of a piece of bubble gum.

543
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:15,970
I could work with that.

544
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,670
So you're gonna find the stuff that works

545
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,650
in old electronics salvage.

546
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:22,870
If you can find them anymore,

547
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,930
they're starting to really get rid of those now

548
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,070
because, look, I'm not that smart, okay?

549
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,970
And I just gave you the outline of this.

550
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,850
There are people that are way smarter than the Greek.

551
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,670
Way smarter, okay?

552
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,730
That are doing things.

553
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:37,950
I'm the only one that's speaking

554
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,570
because I'm the dummy of the group, let's say.

555
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:41,130
And there's, I don't know, there's no group.

556
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,310
But you see what I mean?

557
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,370
I'm dumb enough to talk.

558
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,230
There are people way smarter than me

559
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,970
that know what's going on,

560
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,710
that that's all I'm gonna say, you see?

561
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:55,390
Okay, and by how much does this type of med-bed

562
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,950
prolong your life?

563
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,150
How much can you abuse it?

564
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,630
The body is made or designed to go thousands of years,

565
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,950
at least a thousand, right?

566
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,670
Give you an example.

567
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,310
Let's, you ask me all these things that are finalities,

568
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,650
but it's, okay.

569
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:16,210
Let's just take something prolonging life.

570
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,730
You see an old person, right?

571
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,810
What is the characteristic of an old person?

572
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,050
They have wrinkly skin, right?

573
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,310
And they don't look as vital

574
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,650
as they were when they were young.

575
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,590
That's another way of saying,

576
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,730
they look like a five-pound potato in a 10-pound bag.

577
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:34,690
Where a young, pretty person is a five-pound potato

578
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:35,870
in a five-pound bag.

579
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,290
It's all firm and neat, right?

580
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:41,230
The reason the old person looks all wrinkly and droopy

581
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,350
is because their skin keeps growing,

582
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,210
but the rest of the body doesn't.

583
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,330
So as someone is getting older and older,

584
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,470
if you know how to slow down the growth of their skin,

585
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,950
well, they'll be 90 years old and look 35, won't they?

586
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,310
In terms of wrinkles and all that, right?

587
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,030
So, by the way, go look at all the cameras in China.

588
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,770
They have one camera for every two people.

589
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,270
So it's, right, 500 million cameras.

590
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:13,850
Give you $100 for each person that you see that is fat

591
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,790
in the public in China.

592
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:21,050
Do you see any fat people in China?

593
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:22,350
No.

594
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,890
Now I want you to do the same thing in America.

595
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,910
You're gonna give me a penny for each person that's fat.

596
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,170
I'm gonna be wealthy by the end of the day.

597
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,730
What's the difference between the two?

598
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:38,610
You see how simple it is to start going on this position?

599
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,390
How do you, if you wanna know how do we live longer,

600
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,810
how do you posture yourself?

601
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,070
What position do you take?

602
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,770
Do you see what's going on in your mind?

603
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:46,610
What's really going on?

604
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,870
How many times do you hear about we're gonna,

605
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,570
we want anti-aging?

606
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,810
Most of it is for vanity, so we don't look old,

607
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:53,770
not really live old.

608
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,030
How many times have you heard what I just said anywhere?

609
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,170
The reason you look old is because your skin

610
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,210
is growing faster than the rest of your body.

611
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:01,630
Nowhere.

612
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:02,510
Why, you know why?

613
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,690
Because it's simple and it's true.

614
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,950
So, do you know that as you keep growing,

615
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,190
certain parts of your body keep growing,

616
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,630
like your earlobes and your head?

617
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:14,830
Like if you had a, let's say you're in your 60s and 70s

618
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,210
and you have military uniform when you were 20,

619
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:20,190
go dig it out, put the hat you were wearing

620
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,990
so that fit perfectly on your head now.

621
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,150
It won't even, it'll sit on top of your head

622
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,130
like a child's hat.

623
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:29,250
Okay, when they show you Neanderthal man

624
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,170
and Cro-Magnon man and all that, that's baloney.

625
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,950
When they started digging these skulls,

626
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:40,470
they found a big cache of skulls and skeletons in France,

627
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:42,210
in the caves of France a long time ago.

628
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,470
They invited dentists and scientists from all over the world

629
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,470
and they stayed in separate hotel rooms.

630
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,630
They couldn't talk to each other.

631
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,950
And one dentist, I forgot his name.

632
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:54,270
He said, these people are exactly like us.

633
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,350
The only difference is they went through puberty

634
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,270
when they were 35.

635
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,510
When do we go through puberty?

636
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,590
9, 10, 11, 12, 13?

637
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,190
11, 12, 13.

638
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,970
Right, and these skulls and these skeletons

639
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,610
are 400 to 600 years old.

640
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:12,790
So when all of the various different medical people

641
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,390
and forensic people said the same thing,

642
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,170
they gave all the skeletons and skulls

643
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:20,070
down to the university in various parts of the world

644
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,630
to break the jaws off,

645
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,810
reset the jaws more forward to look more ape-like,

646
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,650
break the skull and reset it with a brow bone

647
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,910
that was more forward to make it look more ape-like.

648
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,530
There's your Cro-Magnon.

649
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,590
Okay, do you know there's no such thing as a Stone Age

650
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,030
and Iron Age or a Bronze Age?

651
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:41,570
It's a Stone Society, Bronze Society, Iron Society.

652
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,470
For example, there is a Stone Society right now.

653
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,690
You can go on certain islands and they use stones.

654
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,650
They don't even use metal.

655
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,350
What they tell you was the Stone Age.

656
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:56,830
If you go back or whatever, 30, 40,000 years,

657
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,250
whatever they tell you, they show you cavemen,

658
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,030
all that fake stuff.

659
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,870
I'll show you, let's go over a few thousand miles

660
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,770
and they have anti-gravity platforms

661
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,770
and they could, you see, Atlantis.

662
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,270
For example, during Atlantis,

663
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,010
there were other societies on the peripheral

664
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:15,370
that were living like they show you in the cavemen.

665
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,370
There's no such thing as a Stone Age or an Iron Age.

666
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:23,850
Is the society stone-based, iron-based, bronze-based?

667
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,130
Are you guys with me on this?

668
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:26,150
Yeah.

669
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,390
Yes, but there are some isolated cases

670
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,430
like the hobbits, which are only half our height

671
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:35,970
and they lived on a separate island.

672
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,270
And wasn't that like some sort of environmental thing

673
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:41,630
and they're a one-off?

674
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,390
Yes, I just suggested that to Zan John.

675
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,910
Zan was saying, well, what can I do to help?

676
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,090
I said, set yourself apart.

677
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,370
Well, you could take that any way you want.

678
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,110
If he has the wherewithal and could afford to,

679
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,050
go to his own island.

680
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,010
Yeah, of course, but don't do it in secret.

681
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,710
Let people know that you're around you,

682
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,610
that you're gonna do that.

683
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,470
And how are you gonna do it?

684
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,790
And how are you gonna do it when you're there

685
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,550
so that you'll become an example?

686
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,030
Do you see the difference?

687
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,310
I think so.

688
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,350
But just to finish with the emo thing.

689
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:14,030
Yes.

690
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,390
Say that you are attacked.

691
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,110
Someone wants to stop your heart.

692
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,330
Is there any type of defense against such an attack?

693
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,470
Yes.

694
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:27,230
Every time you train and practice the emo,

695
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:30,030
your own body, your DNA gets stronger and changes.

696
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,310
You can change your DNA with this, which I don't even,

697
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,330
now we're getting into the deeper part.

698
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,770
We're skipping forward.

699
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,950
I think when we started, when we were doing,

700
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,870
I call this Greek speak or the Greek talking.

701
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,810
Many people haven't heard it.

702
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,790
They're just seeing the book covers.

703
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,370
And some people that have heard it,

704
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:49,470
they're on the first chapter.

705
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:54,010
I'm down at 300 chapters already, you see?

706
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,610
So when we discuss these things,

707
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,970
now I gotta jump to chapter 30 or 40

708
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,410
when most people are still trying to catch up

709
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,490
on chapter two, you see?

710
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,890
Yeah, please don't skip ahead.

711
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,570
We need to understand it.

712
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:09,790
Yeah, I'm not gonna, in other words, the emo,

713
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:14,350
when you, let's just go back to the conspiratorial side,

714
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:14,950
which is true.

715
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,370
What's the difference between conspiracy and reality?

716
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:23,250
About a year and a half, right?

717
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:26,010
Conspiracy theory and reality, right?

718
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,850
Okay, so when you are starting

719
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,270
with any kind of physical development,

720
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,710
let's say any sport,

721
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,110
it takes you years to get really good, right?

722
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,970
And if you stop doing it and you get out of shape,

723
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,310
if you wanna get back into it,

724
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,170
it only takes about 30 to 90 days.

725
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,450
You don't have to do two years.

726
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,870
You have muscle memory, you see?

727
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,230
So every time you practice the emo on the giving,

728
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,390
especially the guarding,

729
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:56,010
it imprints your body and your DNA changes.

730
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,090
So it's doing that anyway.

731
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,950
It's gonna be resonating with that anyway.

732
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,870
Just like, for example, people that are always sad

733
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:04,030
or if you're angry, that will hurt you

734
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,410
and you could get cancer from it.

735
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,710
This was in the old traditions as well.

736
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,630
Don't be angry or sad all the time,

737
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,710
or grudges, because you could get cancer

738
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,630
or get sick from that.

739
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,390
It's called, it's beyond being psychosomatic, right?

740
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,870
That's because you're, that's being angry, sad,

741
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,670
or holding grudges is emotional, is it not?

742
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,610
And how can you get cancer tumors from that?

743
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:24,770
Do you see?

744
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,110
It's the same thing.

745
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,310
So why not take that feature that we have

746
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,750
and how come it's not being discussed at all,

747
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:35,150
at all, anywhere, not by the New Age,

748
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,350
not by the space cowboys and cowgirls

749
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,290
and not by the holistic people?

750
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:41,730
They do discuss it.

751
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,610
Some of the space cowboys do mention

752
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,910
that they are trained specifically in psionics

753
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,610
and they kind of-

754
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,010
But how do you do it?

755
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,670
Oh, yeah, they call it energy manipulation

756
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:57,150
and the how is not very clear yet.

757
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,630
Yes, in other words, how can everybody,

758
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,490
I listen to the stuff on the internet,

759
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,750
all the stuff, doctors, space cowboys,

760
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:06,190
all the holistic New Age, and I walk away saying,

761
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:09,010
all right, how does this improve my life right now?

762
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,150
What can I start doing?

763
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:14,390
How can I, nothing, zero, nothing, very little.

764
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,230
There are a lot of DIY videos, right?

765
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:18,570
If you wanna fix something,

766
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:24,130
a water pump in a 2003 whatever, Chevy whatever, yeah.

767
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,470
Watch the video of these, experience it.

768
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,770
What about when you pray for someone,

769
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,530
does that infringe on,

770
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:36,150
does that violate their consent or something?

771
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,230
That's something I heard kind of makes sense.

772
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:44,250
No, no, there's, okay, the accidental is also pre-planned,

773
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,570
like I have to go, a neighbor of mine's dog

774
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,110
got run over by a car yesterday

775
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,210
and they're heartbroken, right?

776
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,530
And it's just like for some people,

777
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,810
it's like a human family member dying, right?

778
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,850
Was that by consent?

779
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,290
The dog or somebody getting killed?

780
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:03,590
No.

781
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,150
You know, it's even worse by that.

782
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,010
Most people say they're sad my dog died.

783
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,430
You know, some of these parrots and those birds,

784
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,450
those tropical birds live 70 years.

785
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:14,850
I knew a woman,

786
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,530
they got, the parents got the bird before she was born

787
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,310
and she was in her 40s or 50s when the bird died, right?

788
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,030
That's like having, you know,

789
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:24,430
the bird is older than she was.

790
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,030
So these are, it's the same thing.

791
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:28,250
It's the emo is the same,

792
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,550
but it's not by consent, no.

793
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:34,730
We're in a free will, free fluid zone

794
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,470
depending on which zone you're talking about,

795
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,550
your own personal one, your familial one,

796
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:42,070
your neighborhood, your county or parish,

797
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,290
your state, your country, and then the planet.

798
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,030
You see?

799
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,910
Just like when you're going into the past,

800
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,650
you're actually going into the future

801
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:54,150
because everything was already started in the future

802
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:57,650
and it's replayed starting at the beginning, right?

803
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:00,530
So when you go back into the past,

804
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,890
it's closer to the future that is in our future.

805
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,310
And as we progress into our future,

806
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,230
we're going more into the past of the plan.

807
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:07,910
So.

808
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:11,190
But also altering it as we go along,

809
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,830
otherwise there would be no purpose to it.

810
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,030
Insignificant alters,

811
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,870
just like if you have a cruise ship

812
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,210
with 2000 people on it,

813
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,909
that's going from point A to point B,

814
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:23,330
because you're sitting on the toilet for three days

815
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,409
or playing or in the theater

816
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:26,850
or the restaurant for three days,

817
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,730
the cruise ship is still going from point A to point B.

818
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,710
It's not gonna change that.

819
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,550
What will change is maybe you won't meet certain people

820
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,989
if you're on the toilet for three days.

821
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:38,370
I'm saying this because I've heard someone

822
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,750
on a cruise I got off

823
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,909
and they were on the toilet for three days.

824
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,350
So what good is that?

825
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,690
They missed all these other opportunities.

826
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,230
So it's really opportunity loss.

827
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:49,070
You see.

828
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,750
But if you add all of these small changes together,

829
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:53,969
then maybe you can affect

830
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,670
what the captain of the ship does as well.

831
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,330
Yes, you can,

832
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,550
but the captain of the ship is the captain of the ship

833
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,390
because he's chosen based not only

834
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:03,910
would he make a good captain,

835
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,770
but also his strength of character.

836
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,330
And just one last thing about,

837
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,050
you mentioned about how vertically

838
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:16,790
and horizontally oriented creatures are different

839
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,590
because of their spinal cord alignment

840
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:21,450
and it functions as an antenna.

841
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:22,870
Can you go into that a little bit?

842
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,690
A little bit, that's chapter 250.

843
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,370
And that gets more,

844
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:32,670
that will branch out into the holography, let's say.

845
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,590
The med bed, I don't like call it,

846
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,470
I call it med bed, like hot McDonald's, happy meal.

847
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,610
But that's where you give little children,

848
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:39,910
happy meal, med bed, whatever.

849
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,390
Yeah, that branches into that.

850
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:45,150
Your spinal cord is an antenna

851
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,290
and it's also a stacking mechanism.

852
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,570
Every time energy goes through it,

853
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,210
it gets processed like a circuit board.

854
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,870
Each component processes the circuit.

855
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,670
So the final function is desirable.

856
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,650
When it's horizontal,

857
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:59,090
it's aligned to one plane, cosmic plane.

858
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,530
When it's vertical, it's aligned to another cosmic plane.

859
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,130
And about these planes,

860
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,610
does being on a higher one necessarily mean

861
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,830
a higher intelligence?

862
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:12,590
Because for example, you mentioned now,

863
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:15,290
plants only have a thought every thousand years or so.

864
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,650
And then I was just wondering-

865
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:17,990
Rocks.

866
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,790
Oh yeah, sorry.

867
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,110
Yeah, a plant is always in a dream state.

868
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,990
But the rock having a thousand year,

869
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:24,090
a thought every thousand years

870
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,090
is a hell of a lot more than most people I've met,

871
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:26,990
by the way, but anyway.

872
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,730
And does being on a higher rung

873
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,390
translate to higher intelligence and ability and such?

874
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,710
Let's just say this.

875
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,310
And this is not the be all end all.

876
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,330
What good is a highly intelligent person

877
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:45,010
that gets into an emotional road rage and kills someone

878
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,990
for no reason other than they were an emotional,

879
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,150
they couldn't control their emotions?

880
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,350
So my answer to that is

881
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,230
a highly intelligent person would be

882
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,550
cognizant and aware,

883
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,190
have consciousness and awareness

884
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,310
of all their faculties and control of them.

885
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:05,630
So again, they would be someone that was able to merge

886
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,550
their emotional capabilities and knowledge

887
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:11,870
and how to use it with their reasoning and logic together,

888
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,890
like an imperial Draco, for example.

889
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,530
And about out-of-body experiencers,

890
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:20,890
they often report visiting something

891
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:23,030
along the lines of heaven or hell.

892
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:26,230
And would you, have you any experience with this?

893
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:27,830
Yeah.

894
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,190
Yes.

895
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,830
And so there is truth to that.

896
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:35,610
And what's our relationship to that?

897
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,530
Minimal at this point.

898
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:42,310
If you're quote unquote stuck in this density, it's minimal.

899
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:43,530
Right.

900
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:47,590
And is the etheric or the next plane up

901
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,830
equivalent to the land of the dead?

902
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:54,390
Okay, the ether is the substance of this universe,

903
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:56,330
the core substance, right?

904
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,450
It's below the atom, you know, and all that.

905
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:04,770
So the next plane, the different densities,

906
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,390
like for example, when you go up to the next density

907
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,250
above this one, let's say the realm of the,

908
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:10,970
when the spirit leaves the body,

909
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:16,350
if you are able to stay there, distance doesn't matter.

910
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,930
You can go anywhere at any time instantly, right?

911
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:22,690
So everything you know about navigation is irrelevant.

912
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,430
And if you spend too much time there

913
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,510
in the realm of the dead,

914
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,330
you kind of get dumbed down.

915
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,750
If you come to this density and try to communicate,

916
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:30,750
you sound real dumb

917
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:35,990
because you detach yourself from the XYZ axis completely.

918
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,390
The next density higher than that

919
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:41,870
is where you start to get into the Akashic,

920
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:44,150
but not the Akashic of the past,

921
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,950
but the informational flow.

922
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:48,270
And then the next density higher than that

923
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,410
is the knowledge base.

924
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:54,150
The knowledge base starts to merge all of them down together

925
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,290
and can manipulate all the densities down.

926
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,110
But there's also second and first density

927
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,050
that is much lower,

928
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,670
which would be more like the hellish realms, right?

929
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,430
That we call, but the hellish realm is a real thing,

930
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,850
by the way, it's the underworld

931
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,590
where the negative beings live.

932
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:14,070
And they find us as food, they use us as food.

933
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,050
They're a very small percentage

934
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:18,430
of the quote unquote alien or ET races

935
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:22,010
or reptilian races, very small percentage, less than 5%.

936
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,650
So as you go up the density,

937
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:29,430
it's more encompassing and more merging.

938
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,710
In other words, they have more control,

939
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,410
but the next one up and the next one up,

940
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,570
you're pretty much in limbo.

941
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,290
You're in a, like you said, astral state or spiritual.

942
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,210
It's in your mindset, right?

943
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,930
The brain is an antenna.

944
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,230
You know, there's nothing in your brain.

945
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,490
It's a receiver and transmitter.

946
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:46,730
It's a transceiver, so.

947
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:52,170
And I love one of my friends to pose a question

948
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,390
and I am also very curious about this is,

949
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,430
do you know about what changes this,

950
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,930
you mentioned about the distinction

951
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,410
between soul and spirit and what are the changes

952
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:03,990
that these two undergo past physical death?

953
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:08,410
Oh, the physical death, the body and the soul are dead.

954
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,990
The soul is the metabolism.

955
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,150
Well, how do you know the soul is dead?

956
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,730
When someone dies, you go up to them.

957
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,550
There's no breath, there's no pulse

958
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,890
and they're starting to decompose.

959
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,230
That's when the absorption takes place.

960
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,030
All of those membranes that we showed

961
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,250
that are like the car tire,

962
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:26,490
they start to become porous and leak when you die.

963
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,270
So what the medical community is trying to tell you

964
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,090
is that you're dead.

965
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,070
And the legal community is telling you that you're dead.

966
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,490
Actually, if you look at older legal documents for,

967
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:40,130
they call the defendant a decedent.

968
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,810
You see, so everything's focused on death

969
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,890
in this particular stage.

970
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:48,990
So the spirit then is the mind,

971
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:52,590
but the mind, as we know it, the mind that we have,

972
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:55,790
it relies on a body or an apparatus to animate it.

973
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,490
It goes into disanimation.

974
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:02,190
It would be, for humans that are on this planet right now,

975
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:06,690
most humans, say what happens to the spirit after you die

976
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:09,330
is like going to the ocean with a cup of water

977
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,130
and dumping it into the ocean

978
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:12,430
and then trying to get it back.

979
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,850
Yes, you can get a cup of water back,

980
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,830
but is it the same cup of water you poured in?

981
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:18,950
No.

982
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:24,570
So it requires a much higher technological level of being

983
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,970
to sort those water molecules out

984
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:29,250
that have the memory of you and reanimate them,

985
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:32,610
whether in this time or in a future time.

986
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,630
That is your quote-unquote reincarnation myth,

987
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,870
which is not a myth, it's true,

988
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,610
but it's not the way people think it is.

989
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,950
So what you're saying is it's far above

990
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:46,070
our pre-grade right now.

991
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,530
That's chapters 300 or something.

992
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,390
It can be discussed,

993
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,150
but you have to learn to take control of the emotion.

994
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:54,690
Here, I'll give you another example.

995
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:57,570
If you take an average person of high intelligence,

996
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,050
which I don't know if that's an oxymoron,

997
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:04,810
and you show them how to go directly into the astral realm

998
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:06,350
and they survive it,

999
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,790
in other words, they don't have a heart attack

1000
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,250
while they're sleeping and not wake up

1001
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,170
because they died, too much trauma.

1002
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,690
They won't benefit.

1003
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,310
You have to have the emotional, right?

1004
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:18,990
People talk about, when you hear people talking

1005
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:21,070
about going into the astral realm or the other realms

1006
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:23,150
and it's all pleasant, they're full of you know what?

1007
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:24,830
Bovine excrement.

1008
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:28,970
The initial thing that you see is terrifying to you.

1009
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:29,930
Terrifying.

1010
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:31,910
But it's interesting when you see

1011
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:33,590
the most terrifying creature in the world

1012
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:36,010
and he gets up and stretches their arm out

1013
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:37,110
and says, how can I help you?

1014
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,530
You look scared.

1015
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,030
Can you get over that, right?

1016
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:44,330
And it's true that most of them report

1017
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:47,110
only magical experiences.

1018
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:50,270
And even if they acknowledge hellish realms,

1019
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:53,070
they still mention going out of body

1020
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,210
as the best thing you can tap into.

1021
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:58,330
So I guess that's already a red flag.

1022
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:00,150
Yeah, if they're in a hellish realm

1023
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,230
and they slap themselves

1024
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:02,370
and they know they're not dreaming

1025
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,570
and they're physically there,

1026
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:06,730
they've been consciousness transferred

1027
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:07,830
into a cloning center.

1028
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:08,370
It's real.

1029
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,110
They're still asleep in their bed,

1030
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,530
but their conscience has been transferred

1031
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:12,550
into a clone body.

1032
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:16,890
And they're in some underground base here.

1033
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:19,450
And a lot of people that have said that

1034
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,890
have said that they saw celebrities and politicians

1035
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,730
and people from the past there.

1036
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:24,910
Donald Marshall.

1037
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:27,210
Yeah, Donald Marshall stuff.

1038
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:28,010
Yeah, so that's true.

1039
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,590
And while we're on the topic,

1040
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:36,170
do you actually know what Joshua's resurrection technique was

1041
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:37,510
and where he learned it from?

1042
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:40,270
That was a device, okay,

1043
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:43,490
if we go back to the biblical text and look at it,

1044
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:44,410
I don't suggest you,

1045
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:45,850
anybody read the Bible, by the way.

1046
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,750
Again, I'm not pushing it.

1047
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,590
It's very interesting.

1048
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:53,190
When he was raised from the dead

1049
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:55,790
and put back together and perfected,

1050
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:59,350
there were bodies that became animated

1051
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:00,570
in the peripheral area

1052
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:05,570
from the residual field that came in to do that, right?

1053
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:07,030
What I mean by that is,

1054
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:09,850
let's say you preheat your oven to 400 degrees

1055
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:10,630
to bake something.

1056
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,150
You know, the countertop next to it

1057
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,450
is also going to get warm,

1058
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:16,670
but it won't be 400 degrees, right?

1059
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:21,430
So basically what happened when they activated what they did,

1060
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:25,470
basically it's a very advanced version of the med bed

1061
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:28,130
where you actually can project the device.

1062
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,030
You don't need to be in the device.

1063
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:31,910
You can project the field to do that,

1064
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:36,150
was so powerful that the residual energy

1065
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,610
animated dead bodies.

1066
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:38,270
You could read it.

1067
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:39,690
It's in the book of Luke.

1068
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:44,150
The bodies that were recently placed in their graves

1069
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:45,530
jumped out, walked around,

1070
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,190
but they didn't resurrect.

1071
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:48,930
They just fell down and died after a while,

1072
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:51,610
after the residual field wore off, right?

1073
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:54,750
Do I need to get more specific or?

1074
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:57,250
No, that's enough of a mindset.

1075
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,630
It goes against, okay.

1076
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,790
Also, if you read in the text, by the way,

1077
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:05,570
after the religious authorities knew who he was

1078
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:06,470
and they killed him, they said,

1079
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:09,130
now we have to go and silence anyone who knew him,

1080
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:11,630
anyone he knew, he touched, healed,

1081
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,510
or anything like that had to be eliminated.

1082
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:17,190
And we need to create a new story, basically.

1083
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:18,930
You see what I'm saying?

1084
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,910
And about black goo,

1085
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:27,170
I found it interesting that Sinamar didn't mention by name,

1086
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:30,070
but said that cosmic water is black

1087
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:32,070
and very energetic and dense.

1088
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,730
And I made the correlation with black goo

1089
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:37,670
and also there are accounts that describe

1090
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,930
that it's the blood of the planets

1091
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:42,490
and that drinking it strengthens you.

1092
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:43,690
Do you know anything about this?

1093
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:48,110
It would be more like the lymphatic fluid of the body.

1094
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:50,270
You know, you have more lymphatic fluid in your body

1095
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:51,590
than you do blood, right?

1096
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:54,210
But they never discussed that

1097
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:58,450
because things show up instantly in it.

1098
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:01,950
Lymphatic, the lymphosis that also enables

1099
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:03,870
all the other tissue to function correctly.

1100
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:07,850
The reason why something would appear black

1101
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:09,170
is not because it's black,

1102
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,370
it's because the light cannot penetrate it, right?

1103
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:15,450
We gave the example, did it appear black how?

1104
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:16,990
To our human senses?

1105
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,070
Because like I said the last time,

1106
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:22,090
us three can walk into a very dark forest

1107
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:23,930
where it's on a moonless, starless night,

1108
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:27,030
let's say, or a dark warehouse and we don't see anything.

1109
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,750
But if we put on night vision goggles,

1110
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:31,330
we see everything just fine, don't we?

1111
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:38,310
So, yeah, black would be to the human visualizing it

1112
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:40,910
because the light, the visible light

1113
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:42,850
does not react with it, right?

1114
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:46,530
You can produce that with polarization, by the way, right?

1115
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:47,670
Like polar, right?

1116
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:48,210
You familiar?

1117
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:51,810
Not very much, actually.

1118
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,870
Polarizing light, you can create a,

1119
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:57,290
you can have a beam of light

1120
00:46:57,290 --> 00:46:58,890
and run it through a polarizing film

1121
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:00,890
and you'll get a black spot in the middle

1122
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:03,110
or different diffraction patterns.

1123
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:06,770
Yeah, so when water, water is an element, by the way,

1124
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:07,910
it's not H2O.

1125
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:12,410
So once you understand water and how it comes into,

1126
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:17,010
create into this 3D reality from the ether,

1127
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:18,970
it's a condensate.

1128
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,630
The ether condenses into various materials,

1129
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:23,290
but mostly water, yeah.

1130
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:24,410
What other materials?

1131
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,230
There is a material light,

1132
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:29,510
there is a material heat

1133
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:31,510
and there's a material life also.

1134
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:32,830
It's a very subtle form.

1135
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:36,010
What I mean by that is, for example,

1136
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:38,250
have you ever heard of the term 21 grams?

1137
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:40,250
Yeah, the weight of the soul.

1138
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:42,150
Yeah, when someone dies,

1139
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,690
when someone dies, you automatically,

1140
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:46,750
you lose everyone, you lose at least 21 grams.

1141
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:50,090
So the weight of the spirit, yeah, it's a very fine,

1142
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:50,870
it's imponderable.

1143
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:51,650
Like, for example,

1144
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,650
if you look at the periodic table of elements,

1145
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:56,950
you see hydrogen is number one, the first one.

1146
00:47:57,490 --> 00:47:59,450
Well, Walter Russell and others have shown

1147
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:01,050
that there are at least seven other gases

1148
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:03,290
lighter than hydrogen, but they're not discussed

1149
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:05,630
because they become imponderable.

1150
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,350
You can't put them in a container.

1151
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:10,550
Can you contain someone's spirit?

1152
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:11,390
Think about that.

1153
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:14,710
You even, that sounds, I'm airing poetic now, right?

1154
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:18,830
We just showed it's 21 grams, but it can't be contained.

1155
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,010
It's like the eight, seven or eight elements

1156
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:22,190
that are higher than hydrogen.

1157
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:25,650
Could you imagine how our education system

1158
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:28,050
would be different if we were able to demonstrate

1159
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:29,130
imponderable materials?

1160
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,330
Like the reason why they just show you hydrogen

1161
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:32,650
is number one, as you guys know,

1162
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:35,290
we can go down to a welding shop or a chemical house

1163
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:38,550
and buy a bottle with compressed hydrogen gas in it.

1164
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:40,750
And if we don't do anything with it

1165
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:43,690
and put it in a closet for 10 years and open it up later,

1166
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:45,370
it'll still have hydrogen gas in it, right?

1167
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:49,090
But if I told you we can put a gas in there

1168
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:51,770
that is measurable and we could see its properties,

1169
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:55,150
but in 24 hours, it'll go right through the container,

1170
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,390
even though it's three inches thick stainless steel.

1171
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:00,530
What does that do to the human mind?

1172
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:05,590
Well, it makes you think that the only reason

1173
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:06,410
they were able to do it,

1174
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:09,550
because they were not aware it was impossible, right?

1175
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:12,130
You become unlimited, you see?

1176
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:15,830
Could you imagine starting to work with imponderable gases

1177
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,270
that you cannot, or imponderable fluids

1178
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:19,550
that you cannot keep in a container?

1179
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:21,050
How do you manage them?

1180
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:23,650
And if you learn to manage them,

1181
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:27,550
what kind of a different world it would be, you see?

1182
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:34,290
Right, and this conversion of ether to water

1183
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:36,830
is actually the founding principle

1184
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:39,590
on the formation of the planets and all the bodies, right?

1185
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:41,870
Yes, yes, and the ether is,

1186
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:43,610
let's just say from the category,

1187
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,470
let's take ether as one of its properties

1188
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:47,110
as it has energetic properties.

1189
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,310
We are taught that all energies go

1190
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:51,550
from a high potential to a low potential, right?

1191
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:57,150
Or in other words, when energy is manifested,

1192
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:59,430
it always starts off high and then decays.

1193
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:03,050
The ether is the opposite, it goes from low to high.

1194
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,290
So if you have a high energetic ethereal system,

1195
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:11,510
the way you feed it is by presenting it

1196
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:13,770
with a low ethereal energetic system.

1197
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:16,150
Let's give the analogy with two car batteries.

1198
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:20,290
If you take a car battery that is brand new

1199
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:23,230
and fully charged and attach it to one

1200
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:26,110
that is empty, you wait a little bit

1201
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:29,130
and you come back later and the fully charged battery

1202
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,830
discharges into the empty battery

1203
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:33,010
until they level out 50-50 each.

1204
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:34,190
You're with me, right?

1205
00:50:35,870 --> 00:50:39,950
Okay, but let's say that empty battery

1206
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:43,350
just has about 5% because anything below 70%

1207
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:45,210
in a car battery is considered dead anyway.

1208
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:49,510
Let's say it has 5%, it's not completely dead.

1209
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:53,010
So let's say these are ether batteries.

1210
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:55,750
We take the fully charged battery

1211
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:57,410
and we connect the dead battery to it.

1212
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,950
The fully charged battery does not go into the dead one.

1213
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:03,110
What happens is whatever is left in the dead one

1214
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:05,550
wants to leave and go to the fully charged one

1215
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:06,490
and overcharge it.

1216
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:09,830
It's the opposite movement of what we've been taught.

1217
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:13,310
So that overcharging, when you have a system

1218
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:14,750
that is in ethereal equilibrium

1219
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:18,570
and it's presented with a system that is very low ether,

1220
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:22,270
the ability for the ether to go from low to high,

1221
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:23,330
in other words, is the opposite

1222
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,210
of what energy systems we're aware of.

1223
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,870
The moment it overcharges that other system,

1224
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:29,430
we have water production.

1225
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:32,410
Oops, I'm not supposed to talk about this

1226
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:37,250
because now we're going to the next level of stuff.

1227
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:43,170
Even Walter Russell, 100 years ago, took a vacuum chamber

1228
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:46,190
and he had a spark igniter in there

1229
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,790
and put in nitrogen gas and formed water vapor.

1230
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,150
It was pure nitrogen gas with a spark

1231
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:58,190
and also a vacuum and some ultraviolet

1232
00:51:58,700 --> 00:51:59,970
and he formed water vapor.

1233
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:01,250
And he kept doing it.

1234
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:02,090
He says, oh, that's a mistake.

1235
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:03,130
The water vapor came from,

1236
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:05,130
maybe there was contamination in the vacuum chamber.

1237
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:06,850
No, it was a two-stage vacuum chamber

1238
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,710
that was prepared for four days.

1239
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:09,930
There's absolutely nothing in there.

1240
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:12,010
It was certified, you see.

1241
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:15,530
So the nitrogen gas, which is a pulsing gas,

1242
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,970
which is, we're not oxygen breathers,

1243
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:18,030
we're nitrogen breathers

1244
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:20,610
and we convert the nitrogen to oxygen, right?

1245
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:25,670
Shouldn't say right, but that's how it works, sorry.

1246
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:28,890
Nitrogen is a pulsing gas.

1247
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:31,350
And when you subject it to certain things,

1248
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:32,490
yes, you create.

1249
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:35,710
And that water would be very similar to the water,

1250
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:37,550
not susceptible by light,

1251
00:52:37,630 --> 00:52:39,570
that if you presented it in the light system,

1252
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:40,790
it would appear to be black.

1253
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:45,290
Yeah, but oxygen still must come for something

1254
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:47,810
because you'd have to regenerate and stuff.

1255
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:51,230
Oxygen to a lot of the ETs, by the way,

1256
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:52,770
they're warned away from us

1257
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:56,470
because oxygen is very oxidizing and toxic to some of them.

1258
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:58,690
That's why if you touch some of them,

1259
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,870
your hand oils burn them very badly, right?

1260
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:03,250
Urea, if you look at nitrates and urea.

1261
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:09,930
Nitrates are toxic nitrogen oxygen compounds.

1262
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:12,390
Oxygen is overrated.

1263
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:14,570
It doesn't mean you shouldn't have it, right?

1264
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:17,910
Look, for example, the halide group elements,

1265
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:21,850
bromine, iodine, chlorine, fluoride, fluorine,

1266
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:22,650
those are halides.

1267
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:27,930
If you take those elementally or in sodium based compounds,

1268
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:31,670
it hardens your pineal gland and you get hard tissue,

1269
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:34,910
hardening of the arteries, it could kill you, right?

1270
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:40,470
But sodium chloride, for example, in that order is a salt.

1271
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,150
And if you don't have sodium chloride in your body,

1272
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:42,890
you die again.

1273
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:47,230
You need it for cell reproduction and ATP production, right?

1274
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:52,770
So it's the combination of which one comes first, right?

1275
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:54,910
The nitrogen always comes first, then the oxygen.

1276
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:57,990
You see in this particular planet.

1277
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:02,510
Now, once you start getting into seeing

1278
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:04,210
how the induction process works

1279
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:06,270
with the molecular level, atomic level,

1280
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:07,990
because you're really never working with atomic,

1281
00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:10,050
you're always dealing with compounds and molecules.

1282
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:12,310
As you, when you work in the field,

1283
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:13,470
they call it moles, right?

1284
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:19,630
You have to look at it in the order of what is your goal

1285
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:22,670
and what is, when you start to have a certain reaction

1286
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:24,870
or a goal that you're looking for to create

1287
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:26,930
because you're synthesizing matter now,

1288
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:31,630
do you have an alternative way to manage it?

1289
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:34,790
What I mean by that is if you're navigating

1290
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:36,870
and you're traveling with a magnetic compass

1291
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:38,290
and you get to the North Pole,

1292
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:39,870
you can't use that compass anymore

1293
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:41,950
because as you get closer and closer,

1294
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:43,570
it starts to point in a different direction

1295
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:45,390
and what'll happen when you get to the North Pole,

1296
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:46,830
you'll be just flying around in circles

1297
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:48,810
and you'll never go anywhere, you see?

1298
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:51,510
So you need an alternative method,

1299
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,110
another reference point outside,

1300
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:55,390
like maybe a geostationary satellite

1301
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:57,510
beaming you locational information.

1302
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:59,610
The same thing as when you start dealing

1303
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,790
with the, what I call the happy meal,

1304
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:02,910
you know, the med bed,

1305
00:55:04,590 --> 00:55:07,510
how the human body works, water production,

1306
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:11,070
manipulation of matter, the spirit, the emotion,

1307
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:11,790
all that stuff.

1308
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:13,950
You can lose yourself in these things.

1309
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:16,410
That's why very often they portray alchemists

1310
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:19,050
and wizards as being a little crazy, right?

1311
00:55:19,810 --> 00:55:22,170
So you always need an outside reference system

1312
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:25,310
before you start working with these things

1313
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:27,290
or if you're gonna go to an advanced level.

1314
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,310
That outside reference system usually comes

1315
00:55:30,310 --> 00:55:32,030
in the form of quote unquote in common terms,

1316
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:36,430
a god or an ET or a higher being that manages you.

1317
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:39,310
Doesn't necessarily guide you or teach you,

1318
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,530
but if you're gonna blow something up,

1319
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:44,170
they just come over and they stop you from doing it,

1320
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,190
if that makes any sense.

1321
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:48,490
Or if they see that you've been trying,

1322
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:49,750
you're almost there,

1323
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,610
but you're not gonna make any more progress,

1324
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:54,410
they give you a tiny little push, right?

1325
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:55,290
Give you an example.

1326
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:57,930
If you have someone who likes to ride their bike a lot

1327
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:01,190
and you compare them to a professional bike racer

1328
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,390
do you know the professional bike racer

1329
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:05,310
will just take off and leave them in the dust, right?

1330
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:06,050
Like nothing.

1331
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,130
But the difference between that average bicycle rider

1332
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:11,690
and the professional bike racer is the amount of weight

1333
00:56:11,690 --> 00:56:14,190
that you would push on the average bike rider

1334
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:15,750
with your pinky on his seat,

1335
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:17,310
just a little bit with the tip of your pinky.

1336
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:18,310
That's the only difference.

1337
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:20,270
You see?

1338
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:21,090
Yeah.

1339
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:23,470
It's like the straw that broke the camel's back

1340
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:24,770
is another analogy, right?

1341
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,370
So these other beings, they help you like,

1342
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:32,390
it's not grotesque or big,

1343
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:35,490
it's very tiny, tiny, tiny little subtle movements.

1344
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:38,410
So that's one reference point.

1345
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:43,050
The other reference point is your own precognition.

1346
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:44,410
In other words, Tesla,

1347
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:46,990
in other words, you run the experiment in your mind

1348
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:48,270
spiritually before you do it.

1349
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:52,310
Tesla was able to design a motor with a bearing in his mind

1350
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:55,530
and a month later, check the bearing for wear

1351
00:56:56,010 --> 00:56:57,350
and how well it's doing,

1352
00:56:57,410 --> 00:56:59,230
all in his mind before he even built it.

1353
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:01,610
He was aided.

1354
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:06,970
Oh no, he had that internal discipline through practice.

1355
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:10,630
Some say that he got the inference from it.

1356
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:10,930
Yes.

1357
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:14,130
But once you develop a practice like that internally,

1358
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:15,190
you're going to get somebody,

1359
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:16,850
you're going to get attention of others

1360
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,790
and they're going to have a little counsel

1361
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:20,750
and say, should we help him or leave him alone?

1362
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:22,090
Right.

1363
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:23,950
Yeah, go ahead.

1364
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:28,150
Kind of ties into my last question

1365
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,050
about the Chinamar series,

1366
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:34,610
because I'm assuming that you believe

1367
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:37,030
that the devices and portals and everything under

1368
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:38,710
which are real.

1369
00:57:39,570 --> 00:57:42,890
And would you say that their ultimate goal

1370
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:47,090
was to facilitate this transition period that we were in,

1371
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:51,190
considering that it was hidden from the surface,

1372
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:53,550
first of all, technologically by,

1373
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,550
they had to scan through the satellites

1374
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:58,190
to see that there was that hemisphere there.

1375
00:57:58,630 --> 00:57:59,870
And then secondly,

1376
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:02,730
they had to pass the ethical test of the frequency shield.

1377
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:04,570
So would you say that that was put there

1378
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:05,990
to mitigate this period?

1379
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:08,710
Yes, but it was others because the beings

1380
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:10,230
that put whatever they put there

1381
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:12,050
did not want themselves to be public

1382
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:14,890
and did not have like a billboard,

1383
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,610
you know, when you pass by a store

1384
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:18,650
and it says IBM or Coca-Cola,

1385
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,090
they didn't publicize,

1386
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:24,490
even though it's there and it is known to a certain degree,

1387
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:27,790
I believe it was that influence came from others

1388
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:29,810
based on previous agreements

1389
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:31,650
that others had made with the human race,

1390
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:32,750
certain of the human race

1391
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,610
that all things will be exposed in the end.

1392
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,450
Let me just put it this way.

1393
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:39,450
The beings that may put all that stuff together

1394
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:41,870
that they discovered are not happy that this is happening,

1395
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:45,370
but because of previous agreements, it's being allowed.

1396
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:49,370
Like, for example, I know a military colonel,

1397
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:52,030
he told me even a year before 9-11,

1398
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:55,630
he was told that around September of 2001,

1399
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:57,190
they got to get ready for war

1400
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:00,010
because some buildings are going to blow up in New York.

1401
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:01,950
He was not happy when he got that news,

1402
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:03,930
but he's in the military

1403
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:06,170
and this came from people higher than him.

1404
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:08,630
So what is he going to do, protest?

1405
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:11,050
He can do that,

1406
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:13,810
but does that do anything when you're in the military

1407
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:17,670
or do they tell you, you know, be careful,

1408
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:19,370
don't protest, right?

1409
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:20,310
Right.

1410
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:21,890
That's one possibility.

1411
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,070
The other thing I said,

1412
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:25,070
so when the Vatican got involved,

1413
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:28,170
they will not leave you alone, right?

1414
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:31,270
They will influence the output.

1415
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:34,730
So, by the way, whenever you hear crucifixion,

1416
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:36,030
that is propaganda, right?

1417
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:39,770
Well, yes, but that's the only real thing

1418
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:40,990
that you can use against it.

1419
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:43,010
Everything else seems to check out.

1420
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:45,630
Yes, mostly, mostly, yeah.

1421
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:49,510
I don't want to get into the Vatican

1422
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:52,650
because the Vatican, maybe I will real short.

1423
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:56,250
You know how the censorship and how we watch TV

1424
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:59,170
and nothing real gets to there, right?

1425
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:01,470
That's been going on for hundreds of years, by the way.

1426
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:02,750
Well, that's been the most, yeah.

1427
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:04,910
We just can't do anything, you know?

1428
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:06,190
Yeah, now the Vatican,

1429
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:09,170
you used to be able to look this up a long time ago,

1430
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,770
but now it's almost impossible.

1431
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:13,170
The Vatican is actually, they had a website

1432
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:14,770
and it says we're actually,

1433
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:17,190
most people think of St. Peter's Basilica.

1434
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:18,070
That's not the Vatican.

1435
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:20,350
The Vatican is a small red brick building nearby

1436
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:22,550
and all the state departments,

1437
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:23,690
all the governments in the world

1438
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:25,030
get their policies from us.

1439
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:26,910
And once you join us, you cannot rebut it.

1440
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:28,730
You cannot appeal it.

1441
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,390
So basically they're saying

1442
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:31,790
that we tell all the governments what to do

1443
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:34,610
and once they agree, they cannot appeal.

1444
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,210
You know, they cannot change it once we give them the order.

1445
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:39,810
Okay, so they control the media.

1446
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:41,330
Not that there is also other groups.

1447
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:43,250
To just lean it on them is not fair.

1448
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:45,350
There's different groups geographically,

1449
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,270
different groups spiritually, above ground,

1450
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:48,690
surface level, and below ground.

1451
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:49,530
This is surface level.

1452
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:52,370
So anything on the news that you see,

1453
01:00:52,510 --> 01:00:55,490
YouTube, for the past whatever, 200 years or whatever,

1454
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:58,070
has been also influenced by them.

1455
01:00:58,210 --> 01:00:59,490
So let me just give you an idea.

1456
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:03,270
They are spiritual people,

1457
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,970
but they don't know anything

1458
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:07,350
or care about the Bible at all.

1459
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:09,410
They're just using that because of the Pharisees

1460
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:11,610
told them, suggest they should.

1461
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:13,590
It'd be a good thing to hijack.

1462
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:17,350
When they came out in the 90s and so saying

1463
01:01:17,350 --> 01:01:22,010
that priests were molesting young boys and all this,

1464
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:24,090
and there's over and over and over,

1465
01:01:24,210 --> 01:01:25,610
you know, not one of those stories

1466
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:26,990
should have ever made it to the news

1467
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:29,150
if they didn't want that to get out.

1468
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:32,270
They want that to get out to their followers,

1469
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:36,110
to tell the followers what their religion is really about.

1470
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:37,350
Right?

1471
01:01:37,810 --> 01:01:39,390
Part of it is there's a certain demon,

1472
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:41,230
it's the same demon in Scientology,

1473
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,450
and the way you evoke this demonic crew

1474
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:49,130
is by afflicting pain to a child through anal sex.

1475
01:01:49,610 --> 01:01:53,030
It's the same demon that the Scientologists have,

1476
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:53,550
by the way.

1477
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:55,810
So they're trying to tell the people,

1478
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:00,170
look, it's not because the priests are horny

1479
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:00,850
and they're not married.

1480
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:01,310
No, no, no.

1481
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:02,790
They know what they're doing.

1482
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:06,730
They're trying to tell their followers,

1483
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,030
are you guys ready?

1484
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:10,390
And the followers, what they're doing,

1485
01:02:10,390 --> 01:02:11,130
the billion Catholics,

1486
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:14,710
they're turning away a blind eye, you see?

1487
01:02:14,970 --> 01:02:16,750
So now they're at the point where the Vatican

1488
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:19,790
is viewing their own believers as scumbags

1489
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:22,050
because they can't even take a hint.

1490
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:25,130
So what's going to happen is that system

1491
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:26,230
is going to implode.

1492
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,110
Do you see what I mean?

1493
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:31,230
Because the leadership is trying to tell their believers,

1494
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:34,910
if you're a quote-unquote Catholic

1495
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:36,270
and you're a believer in this JES,

1496
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:40,050
all you have to do is read the King James Version,

1497
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:41,770
which is like the worst thing you could possibly read,

1498
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:44,210
and you will see everything we're telling you is a lie.

1499
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:45,870
And none of them do it.

1500
01:02:47,470 --> 01:02:49,270
So right away, you've got a billion people

1501
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:52,070
that are A, going to be,

1502
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:54,810
what are they, stupid people in big numbers

1503
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:55,690
are dangerous, right?

1504
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:57,730
Very, very, very dangerous group.

1505
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:58,730
A billion Catholics.

1506
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:00,410
I'm not blaming this on them

1507
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:02,130
because the same thing goes for all the religious groups,

1508
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:03,750
the Muslims, on and on and on.

1509
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:06,330
So you're going to have an implosion

1510
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:08,870
of quote-unquote faithful people.

1511
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:12,150
And it's going to happen in the next five years.

1512
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:13,430
It's going to be pretty ugly.

1513
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,910
And yeah, just like right now,

1514
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:18,650
the people that are all masked up, right?

1515
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:19,750
The still masked up.

1516
01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:22,090
Yeah, those are the ones that are going to be

1517
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,930
trying to cut your head off with a plastic knife

1518
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:24,710
in the next decade.

1519
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:27,530
So there's so much.

1520
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:30,150
This is like chapter 17, what I'm talking about.

1521
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:31,750
Okay.

1522
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:35,150
Hey, Greg, I think this would be a good stopping point.

1523
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:36,970
Is it okay if maybe we pick up next week

1524
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:37,970
or something like that?

1525
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:38,230
Sure.

1526
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:40,810
Okay, let me hit one, two, and.
