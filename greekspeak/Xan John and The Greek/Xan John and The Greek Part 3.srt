1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
All righty, so Greek you are on the record. But yeah, so like I was saying, Greek, I listened

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,100
to 25 episodes that were on that Consolidated Concise Ocelli playlist, which really opened my

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,720
eyes. And so what I did was, I'm sorry the notes I sent you are so half-assed. It's just as I was

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,040
listening and multitasking or driving or on the stairs, I'm like, ooh, okay, I want to ask about

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:25,000
this. Ooh, okay. So I know I gave you like just quick random bullet points, but you covered so

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,659
much of the things that I've always wondered in life. And I know now better how to, I think,

7
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:37,740
ask points towards you and have a better understanding of your knowledge. So.

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,560
Okay. Well, let me just put it this way. No matter who you're speaking to, whether you're

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:49,060
speaking to young people, hopefully the younger the better, the whole world is wide open. Let me

10
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,340
just give a quick maybe thing. Everything, every subject that you heard on there, which is maybe a

11
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:01,020
dozen or so subjects, you'll notice that the perspective that I gave is, you guys, you guys

12
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,440
need to hear this. I don't want anybody to believe it. Just, you need to hear it and what you do with

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:12,200
it is up to you. But all those subjects that were covered, you know, whatever this is, if you really

14
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,860
meditate on what was said, every subject under the sun and beyond the sun is completely wide open.

15
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:25,320
What I mean by that is, well, let's just, well, let's not be conspiratorial, but pretty much

16
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,600
everything we're told about any subject is what? Right? It's taboo. Anytime you're taught it's a

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,560
lie that actually will lead to something anecdotal, you're going to get, you're going to get shut down

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,260
or people just can't wrap their minds around it. Or you would say, you know, it's cosmic censorship.

19
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:48,460
Right. It's a, it's a big story. Uh, it's, it's, um, here's the thing. You could drop,

20
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:54,580
uh, certain details on what the big picture things are going on, but people lack the

21
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,160
language and the thought process to, to use it. So it's wasted.

22
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,480
Loathing. I think people do, but you said there's such a loathing for knowledge,

23
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,280
which makes you made it perfectly understandable. I really think there are people out there that

24
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,960
way smarter than me, uh, my father, my brother, who's still in law school right now. But I mean,

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,700
I'll never forget when I brought up just the subject of the MRNA being bad at last Christmas,

26
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,440
my brother shrieked like, no, and made a scene and like stomped upstairs. I'm like,

27
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,520
he just can't even get in them. He, they just. Okay. That's different. That's the impulsive.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,220
I think we do spoke a little bit about, um, especially with Daniel yesterday,

29
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,840
we had a private call and, uh, we, we talked about the, the, the, what the spirit, the soul

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,880
and the body is in short, you know, the carne as the body, the material, and the soul is the

31
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:55,640
metabolism, the breath. Okay. And the spirit is the mind. Well, amongst that we have an emotional

32
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:01,800
body as well. Right. And it's the heart, you know, like they say, uh, how do you, how does your heart

33
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,700
feel? You know, go with your heart, whatever. Right. And then you have the mind, which is the

34
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:11,400
more logical, reasonable, uh, and the great goes dead. If you have sure. If you, if you, well,

35
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,280
yeah, that's a good way to the Drake. That's right. Um, which ones, uh, they, they have like

36
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:25,340
12 major races, but, but here's the thing. Um, the, the essence of human evolution is to combine

37
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,400
and make it holistic, not separate or fractional. Like how many times you hear, oh, that's left

38
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,000
brain. That's right. Brain. Uh, that's too emotional. He's too clinical, too logical,

39
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,520
right? Emotional is good. Logical is bad. Right? So we're in a fractional state,

40
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,580
just like when you read ancient texts, the kingdom is here. It's just divided.

41
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,660
You know what I mean? And so if you apply it to yourself, uh, you're, you have everything you

42
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,940
need. It's just divided. You just can't access it. Right. It's kind of like, uh, you know,

43
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,140
your wardrobe, most people know their wardrobe pretty well. When you look at it, you get a

44
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:00,580
better, uh, sense of what's there, but imagine I took your wardrobe apart. Let's say you have

45
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,480
a hundred items in your wardrobe and I put it in a hundred different places all over the earth,

46
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,700
still your wardrobe, but go get your socks. They're in China, right? Go get your shirt,

47
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,459
you know? So everything. So that's, that's what's going on amongst people. So they need to, uh,

48
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,600
evolve, uh, through the process of unifying themselves, no more fractional thinking,

49
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,560
no more fractional talk, like no left brain, right brain, no female, no male, uh, in a sense,

50
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,500
like, you know, that's a particular attitude or, you know, no matriarchal or patriarchal,

51
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,600
no emotional, no rational, combine it all and start working with it. It's the same thing.

52
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,380
It's just like, think about, okay, a toolbox. You have a comprehensive auto mechanic toolbox

53
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,900
and, uh, 500 pieces and put them in 500 envelopes and send it to 500 cities all over the world.

54
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,760
It's useless. It's still your toolbox though. Until you consolidate it all. Right.

55
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,320
With this fractal thinking, you made a point that I almost ran off the road because it made so much

56
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,680
sense to me. Okay. I was headed to, uh, uh, pay a bill in North Louisiana and you started talking

57
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:08,280
about how babies instinctively put things on their tongue and how the tongue means, uh,

58
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,740
super or subliminal. Uh, I'm sorry to explain. I can't explain it as well as you can. And then

59
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,980
you started talking about, uh, ferro and diamagnetic or die electrical charges in the

60
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,400
body and how there's an aura and just tons of things that made perfect sense when it comes to

61
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,240
biology. And that just, yeah. Yeah. That's everyone needs to discover that on their own. But when it's,

62
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,360
uh, most information that's shoved down your throat or requires this elitist academic paradigm,

63
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,900
you're not going to get, uh, it's going to be to benefit one, not the other, uh, one group,

64
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,920
not the other, not the, not the whole. See advanced races look at the earth and they say,

65
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:54,260
answer me this human. Why do your leaders keep you dumb and poison your food and make wars to

66
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,160
decrease your population? Aren't your leaders supposed to enlighten you, spread knowledge,

67
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:06,260
and make you stronger? Why do you allow that on your planet? And that's why I'm so, you're not,

68
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,980
no, you're not going to do it. It's going to happen. And I'm not going to do it. Neither is

69
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,200
Daniel or anybody else. There are those that will do it, but they're on a different realm,

70
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,620
much higher than this one. And they're going to do it. Like here's a smaller example. I also,

71
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,220
by the way, before I get into that, most people don't know, maybe what we're referencing

72
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,600
the Ocelli and the Greek archives, if they're still up or can be found. I think that everything,

73
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,780
right. That's what we're very much referenced. The Ocelli affects YouTube channels. We're always

74
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:37,340
getting my information. Right. And that's from, uh, maybe, uh, I don't know, five, six,

75
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,940
seven years ago. It's 2015 through 2021. Okay. There we go. Okay.

76
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:50,060
Yeah. And actually before that, there's, uh, stuff I started speaking online around 2008,

77
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:57,220
2010. I think someone, one of the things I was trying to find, but yeah, it's, it's,

78
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:03,520
someone had 400 hours of Greek speak on a, on a server and it got somehow absconded with,

79
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,360
but, but here's the point. Uh, the first thing is let's go down a laundry list. First of all,

80
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,540
you should shed and eliminate any fear you have of anything. Okay. You're basically told this when

81
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,840
you go to the beach as a young child and everyone's going in the water and you don't want to go in

82
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,160
because it's too cold. Right. That's like a very shallow example of fear. And you could take that

83
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,100
all the way to someone in the trenches in a war. That's just shaking in their britches and can't

84
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:35,060
pull, you know, can't aim the rifle at the enemy supposedly. So there's different levels of fear,

85
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,400
but if you eliminate all fear in your life, uh, not one fear is supposed to be there as a defensive

86
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,880
mechanism or as a protection mechanism, but just in the background, because one thing I said on

87
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:52,100
those recordings is that, uh, people are motivated by basically two things. One is fear, um, which is

88
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:58,780
an anti motivator, a paralyzer. And the other one, uh, they're motivated by the threat of penalties.

89
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,780
So they do things because if they don't do them, they'll be penalized versus doing things because

90
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:09,320
it's the right thing to do. Ask anyone, well, why do you file taxes? Well, because if I don't,

91
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,380
I'll go to jail. Uh, why do you get a driver's license? Because if I don't, I'll go to jail.

92
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,120
You're right. Uh, why do you vote? Well, you know, they don't know, uh, right. So again,

93
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:24,760
all topics are wide open. And here's the sad thing. I don't want this to be, uh, an arrogant

94
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,120
statement or anything, but the internet is a wasteland. There's really nothing on the internet,

95
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,140
unless you're really good at sifting stuff. Now it's a needle in a haystack scenario,

96
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,020
which sounds discouraging, but how quick can you find a needle in a haystack with a magnet?

97
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:46,120
Real fast. So that's what, what I was trying to do, uh, with, with all these talks and maybe

98
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,360
the last talk we did here as well, uh, just get a magnet, make things easier. You know,

99
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,420
is the glass half full or half empty? It's not a question of pessimism or optimism. It's a

100
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,680
question of engineering. If someone's asking you, is the glass half full or half empty? It's an

101
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:07,020
engineering question. Meaning the glass is obviously too big. You see? And I think it might

102
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:12,420
go back to when you said that everything is wide open. It might go back to the fact that, uh,

103
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,520
science has, we know it is only something like 150 years old, or you can say it's scientism,

104
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:24,660
which is a new religion. And, uh, this religion has, is basically, um, uh, has its foundation on

105
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,640
death, uh, which you can see, for example, in medicine, uh, with the electron microscopy.

106
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,420
Right. And also they study cadavers, not live people. If you, when you're taking anatomy and,

107
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,460
and, uh, in medical school, 90% of your time would be what? Dissecting what?

108
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,700
Dead things. Yes. When you take cells and put them under a microscope, are they alive or dead?

109
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,600
Dead. So it's all based on death. Um, it's a death cult. Now, the reason why they worship

110
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,320
the death cult is because everything's subject to death. So if everything's subject to death,

111
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:02,840
that death is the most powerful attribute or God on this planet. Then the other thing is law. You

112
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:09,020
shouldn't have law. Well, because you have this one particular God that supposedly his stuff has

113
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,720
been hijacked and applied to the whole world. And, uh, they say that, well, he only gave man

114
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,620
these laws, but he didn't give the elephant, the bird or the cockroach, these laws. So if you

115
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,680
decide to observe his laws, you're less free than the elephant, the bird, or the cockroach.

116
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,120
Not only are you less free, you're actually lower than a cockroach. If you follow these laws,

117
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,080
that's like a high order Freemasonic credo, not the Freemasons, the guys going down the street

118
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,920
and joining a lodge so they could have pork in April and wear a stupid apron and take photographs

119
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:45,680
with. But I'm talking about the 300 secret societies. They're basically into free will

120
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,600
and, uh, domination and exploration of life itself and everything they can. And people that are

121
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,740
limit themselves to laws or rules are frowned upon. Just like, um, if you look at the subtle

122
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:02,360
hints in Hollywood, they play a game, you know, Hollywood in the media, they're playing games

123
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,180
with the people. Whenever you have someone who's quote unquote intellectual or smart,

124
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:12,640
how do they portray him in the media and in Hollywood as a nerd, as a geek, an egghead?

125
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:20,080
Yeah. Right. That's a big, uh, that's a big contrast also to how, but you have that. And

126
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,300
the contrast is when you go to academia, who do they hold up as their, as their pillars of

127
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:32,480
or heroes are the Greek philosophers and others. So on one side they have, they hold them up very

128
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,120
high and they show them really noble with marble busts and all this. And on the other side,

129
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:42,920
they show you that they're not desirable. So which one is it? Right.

130
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,820
And is, is CERN related to this? Um, and what do you think its goal is?

131
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,420
Talked about CERN. Oh yeah. Okay. I can't wait.

132
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:57,280
Unknown directly until we, here's the thing. You can speculate and also you can closely examine

133
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,840
what's being shown to you. And I believe everything is being shown to us always.

134
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,640
It's just what level of, let's say vision you have, just like people have different

135
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,880
levels of vision to get your eye, like an eye test. So it depends on what kind of an eye test

136
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,240
result you have when you look at CERN and also what people are saying about it. Um, you know,

137
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,780
that's another subject altogether. Basically the subject is, it's not a concern again,

138
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:28,720
because if you, the more you find out about it, if it'll click on that fear, um, uh, thing,

139
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,220
right? Because you're being left out. But, uh, what happens when you spin, when you spin things

140
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,380
at very high velocities with high energies, right? That's a universal concept. Well,

141
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:46,640
you have tornadoes, hurricanes, CERN, uh, anti-grav, uh, electromagnetic phenomenon,

142
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:54,480
dimensional phenomenon. You see where I'm going? Yeah. And, uh, is it true that, uh,

143
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,040
they're kind of wasting their resources and you could replicate it with a cheaper material?

144
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,520
We could replicate it with a benchtop model that fits on the desk next to your laptop. Yeah.

145
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:17,400
And, uh, is it, uh, also the, as it related this whole scientism to the, uh, goddess religion and

146
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:25,740
its, uh, agenda? Big time. The goddess religion copies, it's a, it's a corruption. See, like,

147
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:31,000
like, let's look at the food industry. Throughout years, people are like, well, we're agricultural.

148
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,840
If someone doesn't farm or if we don't farm and grow food or husband animals and get milk and

149
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,860
all that, we're going to starve, right? Because we're not breatharians. So they just keep that

150
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,220
meme going. So the big corporations are like, oh yeah, GMO is good. We'll end food. We'll end

151
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:51,320
hunger, right? Uh, take your shots, take our medicine because it's good for you. Supplements,

152
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:57,220
you know, like, uh, take these supplements, your body will absorb them, right? All this ridiculous

153
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:03,520
stuff. So they transition you from, um, something in Greek called anangi or necessity, right? Because,

154
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:09,440
uh, it's a necessity and they transition you into this new thing, which is not a necessity,

155
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,600
meaning the toxic, uh, science. And, and then people do, you do that long enough,

156
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,140
uh, especially after you throw a big war at them, you hint, you know, World War II in the 50s,

157
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:25,520
60s and 70s is when all this really came in big time. It existed in the 19, in the 1800s,

158
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:31,960
by the way, but it didn't come in until after the war. Now people find, um, all these chemicals and

159
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:37,680
toxic things in their food and necessity, which is actually sick. Have you heard me on the comment

160
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,180
I made on there shouldn't be any organic food? And that really kicks up some people that are

161
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,900
into, you know, healthy eating. What do you mean Greek shouldn't be organic food? Well,

162
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:51,900
what kind of a society would go to a market and the food market would be divided organic and

163
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:59,500
non-organic. And so the, you give the people a choice of toxified, deranged, corrupt, grotesque

164
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:05,920
food or food that is not, why would you offer a, you know, if you lived in a halfway decent,

165
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,100
halfway moral society, the moment the organic food popped up, it should have woken up people

166
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,640
and said, wait a second, why is the organic food costs more and better for you? You mean

167
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,520
this other food is deliberately toxified? Who's doing it? Where do they live? Let's go get them.

168
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,760
Let's stop them. Right? But people didn't do that, did they?

169
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,780
No, they're not big above the law corporations that have all consolidated.

170
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:38,260
Well, they're not above the lawless. Like for example, every country in their so-called

171
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,020
constitution has in their code, not in their constitution, but in their code, which is

172
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,540
actually an extension of the constitutions, tells you that they're unlawful, that they don't go by

173
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:53,180
any laws. The one, if you're in the United States or of America, you look up title 12, that's their

174
00:15:53,180 --> 00:16:01,300
Bible, it goes from title one to title 50, title 12, 411, title 12, 411 and read it and they tell

175
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:07,380
you they're not lawful right there. So you never go to them asking for, show me the law, because

176
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,100
they're just going to beat you over the head and throw you in, you know, whatever, in a cage.

177
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,060
Every country I've found it has somewhere in their code, it's hidden or it's there,

178
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,760
that they tell you they don't go by law. So I think you've witnessed that,

179
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,560
Zan, right? The title 12, 411, it tells you the money is not lawful.

180
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,280
Yeah, I took a screenshot of that and then you did title 28, 622 or something. You dropped a

181
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,200
couple of things throughout the episodes that I took screenshots of.

182
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,420
The good thing about the US is they, in many places, they tell you they don't go by law.

183
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,420
Well, how come we're going up to those standards and not some corporation?

184
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,720
Well, here's the thing about a corporation. When I hear people harping about corporations,

185
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:57,060
I say the same thing about a tyrannical dictatorship, people harping about a tyrannical

186
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:02,880
dictatorship or harping about fascism, harping about communism. I have no problem with any of

187
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,819
that. If you have a tyrannical, let's say a corporation, any corporation, big or small,

188
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:15,339
international or domestic, or a tyrant, a dictator, a communist or fascist society,

189
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,720
I have no problem with that. If what they do in action, not just in words,

190
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:28,160
is to spread knowledge for the advancement of the people, provide good food, good water,

191
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,280
provide protection and all that, what's wrong with that? Let's say you had a fascist communist

192
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,940
dictator and he said, okay, all the 5,000 patents that were sequestered for national

193
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:45,420
security are now released. In six months, you can go to a government or a state depot

194
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:52,500
and pick up your free energy box, right? All the food, all food chemicals are now banned.

195
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,280
No hindrance, prosperity, so that we can move in a linear fashion.

196
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,080
Yeah, yeah. Everything that was in the Library of Alexandria is going to be published and put

197
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,500
in print and textbooks. Okay, so what's wrong with this fascist, tyrannical dictator? Is

198
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,600
anything wrong with him so far? No. No, not with what you mentioned.

199
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,600
Yeah, but if you, let's say you have more of a network democracy and freedom and that,

200
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,260
and all they do is lie, cheat, steal, poison and steal your children and rape your children,

201
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,960
all that. Well, what's wrong with that? You see? A lot. And they're all the same.

202
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,840
Here's the thing I was saying. When you look at the planets, and this Hollywood shows this,

203
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,980
there are many movies that talk about this. For example, there are no more governments.

204
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,780
Remember that movie with Will Smith, the other guy, it was called Enemy of the what?

205
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,000
Enemy of the State, yes. Right, it wasn't Enemy of the Government,

206
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,680
it was Enemy of the State. Right, so there was another movie where they're driving on a bus,

207
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,680
a public bus right by the UN, and she goes, look at all those flags. Those are not countries,

208
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,240
those are corporations. I could give you 100 examples and Hollywood's trying to tell you

209
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,140
what's going on. So what's going on right now on the Earth is, the Earth is like,

210
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:03,020
imagine a huge amusement park, Great Adventure, Disney or whatever. And in that amusement park,

211
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,380
you have all these different rides and each ride has a different theme. So when you look at the

212
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,480
186 member countries of the UN, look at the UN as being a big amusement park and each country

213
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,180
is a different theme ride. So when you go to Romania, it's the teacups. When you go to the

214
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:22,360
US, it's the haunted mansion. When you go to Canada, it's this water slide. You see?

215
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,240
They're all the same. You buy your ticket, your ticket is your birth certificate,

216
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,180
they monetize that, otherwise you're going to be captured, beaten up, and put one on you anyway.

217
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:37,020
So basically, the Earth is already under globalism. It started 150 years ago.

218
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,980
The IPU. What's that?

219
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,640
The IPU. International Postal Union, yeah.

220
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,100
Here's the thing, this is real interesting. You know how you start a country? When you settle

221
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:54,500
a territory and are able to defend it? Anybody could settle anywhere. Right now, you could create

222
00:19:54,500 --> 00:20:00,600
a new country around your house, right? You could declare a new country of Zanjonia, if you want,

223
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:06,000
around your house and have your neighbors agree, make a new country and send a letter to the Hague

224
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,640
and the UN. That's fine. You could do that. But the question is, can you defend it?

225
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,360
Right? You can't. Because the police, first they'll send the police. If you knock the police

226
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,480
out, they'll send the National Guard. If you knock them out, they'll send the military. And then

227
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,660
knock them out, they'll send all the country's other military after you. So this is what's

228
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:29,740
going on on Earth. You've already been, it's basically Earth is run by the rules of piracy.

229
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,420
You know how they talk about maritime law and admiralty, which is basically abandonment and

230
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:40,100
all that. So, you know, you could still function within it. But I wouldn't be optimistic of anything.

231
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,480
I wouldn't be altruistic at all. Things are going to go the way they're going to go.

232
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Because it's, that's just the way, that's just the way it was meant. I know it sounds.

233
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,620
Parliamentary union or something?

234
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,900
Well, I was saying the way you start a country.

235
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,860
The first thing, what's the first thing you set up in order to start a country? Okay,

236
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,820
let's say, let's go back to the territory. You start, you start putting some meters out there

237
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:13,360
and landmarks and you create Zanjania or Daniel Salia somewhere, or the Greek Alia somewhere.

238
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:18,340
And we can defend it. We have a shield and weaponry that no one can penetrate us, right?

239
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:23,240
What's the next thing you do to keep your, to start your country other than defending it?

240
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,640
You start a post office. Yeah.

241
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:30,360
So you can receive and send out messages, official, official. So in other words,

242
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,820
they know if they send it through that post office, it'll get there.

243
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,900
The next thing you do is you do what's called the governing body,

244
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,880
which is either councils or, you know, how you, you know, house it, whatever you want to call it,

245
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,060
right? Governing bodies, branches and all that. And that's how you start a country

246
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:54,680
is first thing that goes in is the post office. So let me ask you in terms of first in line and

247
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:00,380
first in time and priority, if you want to know the state of a country, shouldn't you look at

248
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:05,160
the state of their postal division or post office? If it starts to fall apart, doesn't that mean that

249
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:10,120
some of the priorities are coming apart? People start looking at what CNN is saying about

250
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:14,800
Congress did or whatever. Every time Congress goes in session, all of our lives are threatened,

251
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,720
of course, right? The question is, what's going on with the post office? Well,

252
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,180
in the US, we don't have the post office is still there, but it's not functioning.

253
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,160
It's the Postal Service, which is a corporate entity built underneath it. You see.

254
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:36,300
And the corporate CEO of the Postal Service also can act as the postmaster general.

255
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:42,260
So here's the thing. There was something in the news recently that was one little area in Santa

256
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,340
Monica, California, the post office, Postal Service went around putting up notices that

257
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,620
they are stopping mail delivery because the neighborhood's too tough for them, you know.

258
00:22:52,580 --> 00:23:01,580
So what does that mean? Country's falling apart. And I believe you said something along the lines

259
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:09,980
of the Constitution itself. The reason for it was written is to to establish a business plan.

260
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,340
Yeah, that's right. Well, whenever you see a constitution in a country

261
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:20,820
with three branches of government, that is a corporate setup for shareholders to acquire.

262
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:27,460
Who has acquired all of the United States? Shareholders. There's a they just like if

263
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,200
you know anything about foundations or trusts, you have the prime head planning,

264
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:38,200
then you have trustees and shareholders. You can sell off shares. Yeah, it's unknown. It's

265
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,080
not necessary. It's just like people say, well, Greek, if if I don't know who it is,

266
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,660
it doesn't exist. And I say, well, what city do you live in? You live in a major city. Yes,

267
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,100
I do. OK, you know, if you look in the Yellow Pages downtown, there's an FBI office. Can you

268
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:55,060
name all the agents in the FBI office? No, I can't. Well, don't you think this would be even

269
00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:00,940
a higher secret than that? Because they're not even in the Yellow Pages, but it's not hard to

270
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:06,040
find out who it is if you just look at who comes and goes, right, how they come and go,

271
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,540
meaning people in public. And I mean, celebrity is also a lot is dished out by the celebrities.

272
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:17,120
And it's also the typical statement that's been said a million times every day on the Internet

273
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,720
is follow the money, all the money. But we don't have real money. We have no real health

274
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:30,420
care. Just like we're already on a dollar collapse. Just like, yeah, you said in the 30s,

275
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,940
the government or people in the government spend it all like some crackheads or something.

276
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,680
Oh, no, no. Yeah. What happened was, OK, the government was created as the ruling body.

277
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,960
It's this beautiful Southern belle. OK, you with me? Get the image. And she's courted and courted

278
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:52,940
and courted. And she after she's courted, she decides to go to a soiree with someone and they

279
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:59,300
end up injecting her with heroin, beating the crap out of her and gang raping her. And they do this

280
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,320
every day for about three months. And the next time you see her, she doesn't look like a Southern

281
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:08,440
belle anymore. Now she belongs to them. That's what happened to the government, every government,

282
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:14,140
the state came in, it's called the sovereign states, which are neither sovereign. Ask any

283
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:19,120
academic to define a sovereign state. They can't. They don't have the language for it because the

284
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,280
sovereign state is neither sovereign nor is it a state just like the Federal Reserve is neither

285
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,520
federal or have any reserves. Right. Just like Federal Express is not part of the government.

286
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:36,100
OK, so sovereign state is a constitutional republic or constitutional body, democratic usually.

287
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:41,960
And for example, if you look at how does the North Korea define themselves,

288
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:50,160
they are the North Korean Democratic Republic, aren't they? So, OK, they're a corporation and

289
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:57,040
and they view everything they interact with as property and they only interact with their

290
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,100
property. So if you're interacting with the state, that means you're being held as property.

291
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,100
I'm not saying it's good or bad. I have no problem with it.

292
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,020
Imagine a tyrannical again, the analogy I gave about the tyrannical communist, fascist

293
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:19,740
dictatorship. It's not what you label them, it's what they do. Right. Again, if we have a tyrannical

294
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,280
dictatorship, fascist, communistic, whatever, put every negative, anarchistic, whatever word that

295
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,260
you've been associated with. But they say, OK, everyone gets a free energy box.

296
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:36,080
Library of Alexandria is all in the textbooks. We have medical beds, let's say. Opened. Yeah,

297
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:41,460
public. Healthy food. Yeah, healthy food. Everybody's encouraged. Yes, we have a space

298
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,400
program. We have we have ships that are three kilometers long circling Jupiter.

299
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,360
We'll do it. We can't put all of you all on there. So we'll pull a lottery. How's that?

300
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,920
Right. Well, can you see the significance of this inter-parliamentary council, please,

301
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:02,680
or union or whatever that you mentioned? And we were never inter-parliamentary.

302
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,820
Oh, inter-parliamentary. Oh, yeah, there's several. I'm going to this is another thing

303
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:11,840
without because we don't let's keep this limited. Keep it short. OK, sorry. I'm going to be going

304
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,460
off a memory. You know, that's fine. Start researching. Let your fingers do the walking

305
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,960
on international governing bodies like the U.N. that are older than the U.N. There's a few of

306
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:28,160
them. This one was in the eighteen hundreds and it's still around. There's also a website for the

307
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:33,180
Vatican Nazi Peter's Basilica where the guy with the funny fish hat is there. You know, I'm talking

308
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:38,600
to the Pope. The Vatican is a red brick building behind St. Peter's Basilica that all state

309
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:46,040
departments of all member nations get their policy from and no appeal is allowed. Except

310
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:53,520
guy, right? Yeah, there's always an exception. There's that one guy, he's the Queen Beatrix

311
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,600
husband. Well, those are just formalities. Whenever you everybody, if you've ever seen

312
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,660
them or heard them from George Washington, Julius Caesar, Napoleon, it doesn't matter,

313
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,040
Trump, whatever, whatever, whatever. They have no their middle their mid-level management actors.

314
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:14,220
They're not even real mid-level management. Their mid-level management placeholders.

315
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:22,130
So like before this last election happened, people were all hyped up, you know, and all that in the

316
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:25,890
U.S. And I said, it doesn't matter whoever is put in next, you're just going to be the placeholder

317
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:34,130
for the next phase of the downfall of this country and North America. Right. It doesn't

318
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:39,510
matter who it is because it's the plan is bigger than them. Right. Trust the plan. Remember?

319
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:46,910
Yeah, you should trust the plan. If you know, if you know the plan, not the one that they're

320
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:54,110
telling you. Right. Who's they? But here's the thing. Grab a grab a hold of something that

321
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:58,370
you're good at doing. For example. Yeah, I really cringe when you hear on the news. Oh,

322
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:03,570
we're creating new jobs. That's what? Why don't you find out what people are naturally

323
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:07,310
inclined and good at doing and encourage them to do that for the rest of their lives?

324
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:14,170
Why do they need a job? That would be supposed that we live in a lawful world.

325
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:21,250
Not lawful, but that's if we had the right kind of tyrannical dictatorship under a fascist

326
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:29,010
communist, if we had the right one. Yes. You see what I mean? But do you think that this

327
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:34,650
new wave of currency, cryptocurrency and the like is the next is the next phase that they

328
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:38,550
envisioned that part of a continuation of this Babylonian system?

329
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:43,490
It's not a Babylon. It's more of an Egyptian system. The Babylonian system is still secret.

330
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:50,850
And I can explain very simply the model of and I'll go back to the crypto. The Egyptian system

331
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:54,750
works this way. When you need something from the state, you give them all your land

332
00:29:55,390 --> 00:30:02,750
and they give you a little bit of what it's worth. Less than 10 percent. And then you obviously you

333
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:07,650
don't have any more land. So now you need food. So then you have to give them your body. You have

334
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:13,270
to sign over, which is slavery, your body and actually all your possessions and your animals

335
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:21,090
and then your physical body to them. And that's the Egyptian system. Right. If we're working with

336
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:28,410
the whole planet, the Babylonian system is a more mystical one, meaning more occult, occulted and

337
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:33,510
more metaphysical. It's more metaphysical, I should say. That has to do with when you hear

338
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:42,170
we have to capture the hearts and minds. Right. That goes more into allegiances with other

339
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:46,710
beings. I don't like to call them gods. And if you heard on the Achille of the Greek, well,

340
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:50,630
we call them gods because that's the common parlance we use. But they're just a race. Like

341
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:55,750
if you read, for example, the Bible, it says God. There is no God in the Bible. If you look in the

342
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:01,090
text, there is the Elohim. And the Elohim is a race of beings, just like you would say any other

343
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:06,710
race of beings. Right. Well, they're all around, right? You're saying some are just non-corporeal,

344
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:11,810
but they're all subject to death except for this Yahweh character. Right. Because he's managing

345
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:17,570
that aspect of it like like a video game at this point. Imagine you have the cheat codes of a

346
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:22,510
video game and you start playing with other people. Oh, you dirty boy. How come you're

347
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:26,090
winning every time? Right. Because I have the cheat. You know what I mean about cheat codes in

348
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:31,710
a video game. Right. You're not going to be taken out. So so here's the thing. Go back to the

349
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:38,210
crypto crypto currencies. I could give you this as an opinion, which I rarely say, but it's an

350
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:45,710
opinion. It's an intelligence agency artifact, meaning a subject. What? Why? Very simple. When

351
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:51,470
the intelligence agencies get into a business model, their model is a thousand percent to five

352
00:31:51,470 --> 00:32:00,610
thousand percent profit. Crack cocaine, cocaine. Right. It costs about eighty dollars a ton,

353
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:06,070
but it produces a billion dollars a ton. Right. To make action. Sorry. Eight eight thousand dollars

354
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:10,530
or something to make that and you get a billion freight that every every ten thousand dollars,

355
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,810
let's say you invest, you get a billion. That's whenever you see stuff like that,

356
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:18,790
like cryptocurrency go from like two hundred dollars to fifty thousand. That's when you see

357
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:25,230
that huge percentage profit. That's all intelligence agency stuff. You kidnap a child.

358
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:30,650
It doesn't cost. What? I don't know what that costs. And you sell the child for thirty, fifty,

359
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:35,610
hundred, fifty thousand hundred, ten thousand percent. Whenever you see these thousand,

360
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:41,070
five thousand, ten thousand percent profit models, that's intelligent agencies. It doesn't

361
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:45,650
matter if it's human trafficking, drugs, cryptocurrency, whatever, piracy doesn't

362
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:51,870
matter. Are you with me on this? Yes. Religion, by the way, is like that also.

363
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:58,470
So and that's that's where it comes from, by the way. Intelligence agencies is the secret

364
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:02,450
religious orders, by the way. There's nothing. Don't mystify. There's nothing governmental.

365
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:10,160
They're state agencies. I call them panty sniffers. So anyway.

366
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:20,320
Well, then brought up the gods from the Bible. And I was wondering, who do you think wrote the Bible?

367
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:27,360
Well, it's very simple. Why don't we just look at it and see who it says wrote it first?

368
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,900
And then let's just see what other information we could get to back that up. That's that goes

369
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:38,700
with anything. You said there's a bunch of Jesus's, but the biblical Jesus, that's

370
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:44,780
biblical. Christ is a secret. Yes. Why? The biblical God is still a secret. Everything in

371
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:50,280
the Bible. Pick any character in the Bible, major or minor, and I will show you how the identity of

372
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:56,760
that is still a secret. Very simple. The biblical Christ is, sir. Of course. Anybody who reads the

373
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:04,940
book with comprehension will get it. OK. The problem is that the translations,

374
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:12,199
because they have sneaky ones where they interject words that are like holy and like giants, right?

375
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:18,620
Yes. Well, yeah, the Giants was never in that was put in a subdued. But but here's the thing,

376
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,679
even with the real crappy King James Version, by the way, don't if you're stuck on the King

377
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,120
James Version of the Bible, they're all the same. They start getting them to fight. You know how

378
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:31,320
divide and conquer like the people say, oh, this King James is better than the new international

379
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,620
version or this or that is so stupid. But anyway, if you are stuck on the King James

380
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:43,540
Version, it's a disease. I call it KJV syndrome. It's very hard to recover from that. But if you

381
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:49,980
do recover from that and you you do read it, even what's in the bad, that's not a translation.

382
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:55,199
It's a version. It never says it's a version. A version is hearsay. But even if you read the

383
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:02,900
really bad version, you will still get what really happened very, you know, very clearly,

384
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:08,180
actually. But what happens is we have something called image training from young children.

385
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,440
They show you Disney cartoons and Bible movies in your mind. So let's say you're reading the

386
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,420
Exodus when they leave Egypt and you see that piece of crap movie Cecil B. DeMille did with

387
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,080
Charlton Heston and the water opens up. They use Jell-O for special effect and they walk on the

388
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,680
bottom. So when you start reading that in Exodus, your brain says, when I was four years old,

389
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,940
I saw that movie. This is the part I saw in the movie. And you just read over it,

390
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:37,320
even though it says something completely different happened. Right. 9-11 is a perfect example.

391
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,940
Let's talk about that. Well, let's do it. Go on it for eight hours. I could give you extreme

392
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:47,980
details, but not necessary. Look, it's all in the language. Look up the definition of ground zero.

393
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,920
That was a technical term. A lot of people say, well, that just means the center of something

394
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,320
bad. No, it was a technical term. And let's just fast forward to the end. All those 10,000,

395
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:02,700
50,000, 30,000 people that got sick, every single one of them had a radiological disease,

396
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:09,820
some form of melanoma or carcinoma or leukemia. And here's the other thing I'm going to say,

397
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:20,600
look up Wikipedia shows the ultra HD photos of the World Trade Center after it collapsed. Right.

398
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:26,180
You know, the burned out areas, right. Aerial view. If you go to Wikipedia or just put in

399
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:32,260
high definition World Trade Center aftermath and find the ones that are HD, like the high

400
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,680
res, the ones you could blow up and, you know, really high resolution megapixel thing.

401
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,960
OK. And you look at the bottom, it credits. It says G.O.V. and then question mark. And then you

402
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,120
go. All right. Click on that or next to it. It says a photo taken by the N.N.S.A.

403
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:53,100
All those high definition photos and ground photos were taken by an agency called the N.N.S.A.

404
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,540
Now, who is the N.N.S.A.? It is the National Nuclear Safety Administration.

405
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,920
Oh, the reason why the National Nuclear Safety Administration spent invested so much time

406
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:11,940
on surveying and offering cleanup direction at World Trade Center is because obviously

407
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:18,040
the National Nuclear Safety Administration was set up to handle jet fuel fires.

408
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:26,800
That's obvious, isn't it? I'm being sarcastic. I know. Yeah, of course. Of course. Yeah. Yeah.

409
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,820
Obviously, you know, if you have a jet fuel fire, who do you call? You call the National

410
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:36,280
Nuclear Safety Administration, right? Duh. Isn't it said that certain federal

411
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:41,640
buildings can be built without nukes already in them? That's right. Certain jurisdictions

412
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,600
New York, Chicago, if you go over 56 stories, you have to submit what's called an emergency

413
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,520
demolition scheme. If you put this building up, how are you going to take it down, jerk off?

414
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:57,380
Well, the problem is that the heaviest armament that's used in the military

415
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,220
infantry is not even a third the thickness of the steel columns that were used in

416
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:06,960
buildings like the Willis Tower in Chicago or the U.N. Building, Dag Hammarskjöld Tower,

417
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,100
the World Trade Center's Building 7. You can't take those buildings down. So you can't

418
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:16,320
use dynamite or anything to take down a four-inch-thick steel member. Actually,

419
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,020
the blast furnaces in Pittsburgh and places where they make the steel,

420
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:24,480
the blast furnace structure itself is not four inches thick, where they melt the steel.

421
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,980
So they pulled it off really well, though. I'm not going to get into all the details.

422
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:35,100
Dmitry Kalazov, he was part of the Directory 12. You could look him up. He has old stuff.

423
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:41,140
Most of it's been scrubbed. But the main thing that gave it away is, other than knowing,

424
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:47,800
since the 80s, that that function was there, but I didn't know really how to associate. I was always

425
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,500
told, stay away from those buildings. There are nukes in there. I said, what are these crazy

426
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:55,240
old engineers telling me that? But later on, it made more sense when I started looking at other

427
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:01,200
things. But here's the thing. If it walks like a duck and looks like a duck and smells like a duck,

428
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:08,000
it's a duck, right? Okay. So for weeks and months after the 9-11 thing happened, downwind,

429
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,320
people on the New Jersey side, hundreds, if not thousands of people in New Jersey and lower

430
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:17,760
Manhattan kept calling the EPA environmental offices saying, I can't stand the smell.

431
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,960
What's wrong with the smell? Well, it smells like burned electrical wires and rubber and gasoline.

432
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,980
Well, they're like, well, that's just because there are a lot of electrical wires in the

433
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:35,660
buildings. No, that smell, if you go back, there's plenty of letters and a book compiled.

434
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,780
There was one called Seven Hours to Zero, an author wrote, which was the dropping of the

435
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:45,260
bombs on Japan. After the war, the cessation of hostilities in the field ended. They sent

436
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:50,380
Marines to go clean up Hiroshima and Nagasaki. And those Marines wrote letters back and took

437
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:54,580
notes. And those were compiled in various short books. And if you read those books,

438
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:59,820
you can look them up. The Marines who went to do the cleanup after nuclear events in Japan,

439
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,640
atomic events, they were called. What did they all say? Are you guys familiar with it?

440
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:12,880
They couldn't stand the smell. It smelled like burnt electrical wires, gasoline, and

441
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,320
it's exactly the same. OK, what that is, it's called strong ionization. Have you ever been

442
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:25,720
near, have you ever dumped a bottle of bleach? OK, hydrogen, not hydrogen, sorry, sodium

443
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:31,020
hypochlorite. Or have you ever used an ozone machine, that really strong ozone, that's ionization.

444
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:36,680
Well, multiply that, if you have an ozone machine, get one that's a thousand watts,

445
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,660
that's strong enough that if you hold a piece of paper six inches away, a paper catches fire,

446
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:47,800
you'll get leukemia if you hang around that thing. But that strong ionization smell smells like

447
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:54,080
burnt electrical wires, gasoline, right? So that smell was very much coming out of the ground.

448
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,720
And they were underground, not in the buildings, obviously.

449
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:07,240
There were like 3,600 nuclear tests and 2,900 or 3,200, sorry, most of them underground because

450
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:13,580
the effects of what, when you say nuclear, most people say, think of flash, boom, bang,

451
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:18,740
like that moron, what's her name, Judy Wood, the shill, you know, gets you to folk, can't be

452
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:22,180
nuclear because you would say, well, nobody's talking about what happens, you put it underground.

453
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:28,740
It's a completely different phenomenon, surface reactions. There's videos where the Russians

454
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:33,460
were using them in the Soviet Union to stop gas leaks underground and to make gas chambers and,

455
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,220
you know, to store things because it makes a perfect glass sphere underground.

456
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,740
Anyway, we shouldn't even be getting into details on that.

457
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:47,220
But you did drop something that really piqued my interest about 9-11 before you move on,

458
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,780
which is the fact that it has been known about since the 80s and which kind of made me think

459
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:56,820
that the towers themselves must have been sort of prefabricated with this in mind or something.

460
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:02,560
Yes. Well, no, the blueprints for buildings like those towers and other buildings were

461
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,180
sitting on the books or on the desks of architects for almost a decade.

462
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,260
They would not issue building permits for them because you have to show how you're

463
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:17,360
going to take it down and nobody knew how. And then Project Plowshare showed in the SALT

464
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,500
Treaty, there's something called the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Devices Addendums.

465
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,280
You can only use three or four hundred and fifty kiloton maximum yield per day.

466
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:33,180
And the world was shocked. That's why I say the U.S. has no, there are no enemies.

467
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:39,080
Right. There are no enemies because if there was an enemy, obviously you'd say, look, they

468
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:44,020
nuked themselves. But here's the thing here. You want to talk about big balls, like big hairy balls

469
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:51,240
is Iran. In 2016 or 17, they detonated the Plasco Building, which was the tallest building in Tehran,

470
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:56,980
17 stories or something. They used a small nuke to bring that down also. That was when Obama was

471
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:01,720
going back and forth with the Iran and stuff. He says, look, we can do the same thing you did.

472
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,580
And nobody noticed, obviously, because, you know, but what they did notice, the building

473
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:13,280
dustified. And a month later, as they dug down to clear out the building, they would put the

474
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,580
front loader, the bulldozer, you know, the front loader bucket to pull out dirt and it would melt

475
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,720
because the rock underneath the building was at 3000 degrees still. Right.

476
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:27,560
So the Iranians showed the world that they have the same technology. Everyone does. They've

477
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:33,480
actually been, you know, using these nukes since the 80s like candy throwing. When you hear about

478
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:41,660
a car bomb that, you know, a little four door Nissan Sentra had dynamite or explosives and it

479
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:46,500
leaves a 30 foot by 40 foot deep crater. And anybody that's in the military and ballistics

480
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,180
will do the math and tell you, well, that's about two and a half tons of TNT to do that

481
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:56,200
because everybody knows you could put two and a half tons in the back of a Nissan Sentra, right?

482
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:06,580
Sure. But I still I'm dying to know if you think that the airplanes were holograms and.

483
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:11,180
No, there were no airplanes. Here's the thing. I have not firsthand knowledge because I wasn't

484
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:15,260
there, but I knew someone who was walking across the Brooklyn Bridge and he says the side of the

485
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:20,400
building just exploded. And all the videos that they show you, the people don't look up until

486
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,620
the building explodes when they show the plane. Now, I don't know about you, but you go near

487
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:29,160
airport and a plane even flies twice as high as it did there. You're going to look up because it's

488
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,480
freaking loud, especially when. Right. Nobody looked up in the sky until the building exploded.

489
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:41,280
So that's obviously put in later. The buildings, the planes went up and they were landed at West

490
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,280
Over Air Force Base in Massachusetts, which is 20 minutes away. There were hundreds of people

491
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,640
that called in on the way between New York and Massachusetts. I think there's going to be a

492
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:58,640
plane crash because an American Airlines plane just flew a treetop level over my house. Right.

493
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,400
And it's also impossible to make calls from the height that we're supposed

494
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:08,100
to go. They made the call. Yeah. And the hijackers were obviously the pilots and the crew, obviously.

495
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:15,300
But whatever happened to those planes? Well, they landed at Westover because they have a

496
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:21,100
10,000 foot runway. And coincidentally, the day before on nine, nine, ten, everyone on Westover

497
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:27,360
Base was all the people that report and live on the base. Guess what? They were told to stay in hotels.

498
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:34,220
That's that should make that should really be a signal, shouldn't it?

499
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:39,480
But how did that happen? It's very easy. Well, it's very easy. What you do is when you have a

500
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,040
base like that sequestered the next day, you just fly them off to wherever you're going to fly them

501
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,520
off to some scrapyard or something. There was a guy they killed. They killed him, his dog and

502
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:53,560
his children, who said that they're in Nevada and some great what do you call it? Airplane graveyard

503
00:45:53,560 --> 00:46:00,080
or whatever. The planes are not the issue. Yeah, they're not the issues. The issue is,

504
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:05,500
for example, you had that event, which was an American event. But anything that happens to

505
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:09,540
America, remember, they say anything what's good for GM is good for the country. Remember, they

506
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:13,660
used to say that what's good for General Motors is good for America. Now what's good for America

507
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:18,200
is good for the world. So they so they did that there to get an international response because

508
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,200
the whole world was watching. Remember all those artists in England or whatever were recording and

509
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,680
they said it happened, they recorded a special song or whatever. Okay. Then if you listen to

510
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,060
Ocelli, what I said was the next thing is going to be like that with no planes and no towers,

511
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,020
but it's going to be something that's going to be repeated and repeated and repeated in the news,

512
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,260
and it's going to be international. It's going to be much bigger than that

513
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:45,320
because they're testing society. So between the 9-11 and the events we had the past two years,

514
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:51,580
the next step is the people are so cowardly and so ignorant, they're ready for forced slavery.

515
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:55,500
They don't need to do any more events like this. They keep softening us up.

516
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,620
They don't need to anymore. Those were just tests. They didn't even have to soften you up.

517
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:07,000
People were already living with their head up their butt for over 150 years. Actually, sorry,

518
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:12,520
what happened 150 years ago in America is far more shocking than those other these past two events,

519
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,680
you know, the Civil War. Now just let me just throw this in. We were going to talk about the

520
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:22,080
Civil War, which we probably didn't. We didn't produce anything on it. But here, if you study

521
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:27,160
the history, especially periodicals and local papers, five years before the Civil War started,

522
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,880
people in farms and small, really small communities around the Ohio area, western

523
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,120
Pennsylvania, southern New York, were reporting these marauding bands of people with black

524
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:43,760
uniforms or black, killing their property, kidnapping their children, setting fires,

525
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:48,040
on and on and on, you know, like imagine like some terrorist group. So what they were softening,

526
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:54,080
they were basically assaulting the people, right, for four or five years before the Civil War broke

527
00:47:54,080 --> 00:48:01,220
out, you see, to get the people on edge. Because it's much easier, you don't think about reacting

528
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:04,820
when you're on edge, when you're stressed out, right? You don't think about things before you

529
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:09,180
do them. Now here's the other thing I want to give you. If you know anyone in Switzerland who's into

530
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:15,780
like Knights Templar history and likes to go hiking in the woods, they'll find all these

531
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:20,740
little enclaves, like little castles or manors in the woods in Switzerland, and when you approach

532
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:25,600
one of them, you know it's Knights Templar stuff because they have this regalia, and they're very

533
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,240
wealthy because you could see the iron gates and the way the buildings are made, and the wine

534
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:34,520
cellars and all that, right? When you start looking at these manors and these castles that the Knights

535
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:39,920
Templars have in Switzerland, and they have their regalia that, you know, the typical symbols of the

536
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,760
Knights Templars, what other symbols do you find amongst the Knights Templar symbols on these

537
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:50,180
buildings on the outside and inside? So if you don't know, I'll tell you. Do you know what the

538
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:56,940
confederate flag looks like? That's what you'll find in Switzerland. So, oh, those dirty confederates,

539
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:04,380
they were so original. Not. So basically, the Civil War was the Knights Templars versus the Freemasons.

540
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:11,920
Did the Civil War have anything to do with two kind of hypotheses I've heard? The Vatican,

541
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,300
and you mentioned like how it was the federal versus the states and all that stuff,

542
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:22,080
pulled the Yankees in because there's no one there, but did the Vatican have anything to do

543
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:26,800
with the federal government and owning these northern states? And also, too, did the world

544
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,960
fairs have anything to do with any of this stuff? Were the world's fairs used to reset,

545
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,200
or what was the problem? Did they tie into the Civil War? Were they kind of ways to fuck up

546
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:41,180
people's heads? Yes and no. Yes and no. The world's fairs are like fantasyland. When you

547
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:46,260
don't know anything about the world's fairs, if you show the world's fairs to someone who doesn't

548
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,380
know anything about the world's fairs, like a child or someone who's ignorant of them,

549
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,140
what's the first thing they're going to say when they see the imagery? Oh, it looks like what?

550
00:49:54,460 --> 00:50:00,180
Disneyland, right? Doesn't it? Like a fantasyland. So that's all it is. Just like I said, for

551
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:06,760
example, in the U.S. and the Western world, the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, dot com boom and all that

552
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:13,680
was all fake, completely fake. It was a big move after the World Wars. Because you know,

553
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:21,580
who's the guy who wrote the three World Wars, the Freemasonic guy? Anyway, it's not just him.

554
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:26,860
I'm not blaming him. This is just part of it, because reality is fake anyway. But they wrote

555
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:32,940
there were going to be three World Wars, right, in the 1800s. And the Third World War didn't really

556
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:39,540
come. It sort of did with the fake Cold War. But in the meantime, they put, they stalled the

557
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:46,100
century with the World Wars, and then they stalled it with the fake prosperity of the 50s, industry,

558
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,700
60s, 70s, you know, skewing who won World War Two, which was the Japanese. And they're still

559
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:55,100
fighting the quote unquote Nazis, by the way, which is the National Socialist Party.

560
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:01,000
That never ended. That's still going on today. That's why they still make movies that Nazis are

561
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,700
the bad guys, right? So they're hiding all that. So the 50s, 60s, and 70s. So any quote unquote

562
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:12,760
in America, Westworld says, oh, go back to normal. You moron. That prosperity and that normalcy was

563
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:19,220
not normal in the first place. It was fake, obviously, right? So now you're going to go,

564
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,460
what they did was they stalled the century, they gave you fake prosperity of 70 years,

565
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:28,860
and now they're going to the next move, which is you pass or you fail. So if you pass,

566
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:33,240
you move on to the next level. If you fail, well, you got to do it again. But there's nothing,

567
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:38,700
you can't really do anything again in time. So what they're going to do is just break it down,

568
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:45,840
right? Imagine, what do you do with a failed restaurant? You sell off all the fixtures,

569
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:52,600
anything that's worth anything. And that kitchen hood that cost you $80,000 to install because

570
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:56,740
the fire department has to be approved of it, well, now you sell it for scrap metal for $300,

571
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:02,600
you see? So that's where you're going to now because the past 70 years were completely fake.

572
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:09,100
I know this is, I think I'm the only one saying this, by the way, it makes me sound like a nut

573
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:13,740
job. But if anyone who has at least two brain cells they could rub together, three would be

574
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:21,060
better, by the way, you'll see this is true, so. Greg, why weren't people in this generation,

575
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:29,820
like you and Daniel and I, allowed an actual shot at true prosperity and true freedom and trying to,

576
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:35,660
you know, how come we don't get this? It's just because- Oh, you do. Well, it depends on how you

577
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:41,540
define it. Okay, I knew a guy years ago, he managed private funds, like for wealthy people,

578
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,500
he had three, a private guy that managed private funds in the $3 billion range, right?

579
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:51,640
And his personal wealth was in the $50 to $60 million. And remember when the 2008 economic

580
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:57,780
thing went down? He went from 50, you know, the recession or the bank bailouts, well, he went

581
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,480
from personal wealth of like $50 to $60 million down to eight. And he's on the phone with me and

582
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:07,560
he says, I don't know how I'm going to survive. And I'm like, survive? If I see a blade of grass

583
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:11,980
growing in the street in the median, I know I could survive because there's a blade of grass I

584
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:17,780
can eat. As long as we got a decent place to sleep, decent food and water, we don't have it

585
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:23,400
too bad. Yeah. I was watching something yesterday. I'll plug this YouTube, but it's a bunch of young

586
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,860
German lads and they're really good at what they do. It's called Broken Window Theory,

587
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:31,580
YouTube channel. And they go around, they secretly enter castles and things and they're

588
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:36,500
very much into good photography. So they found this place in Germany where this artist, he spent

589
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:42,220
$1 million on getting cars, a car collection that he put out in the forest. And so they would

590
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:48,800
naturally decay. Rolls Royces, Porsches, things like that from the 1950s all the way to now.

591
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,220
And people go and photograph them because it was like a tree growing through a Rolls Royce. Yeah,

592
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,440
probably. Yeah. That's it. Broken Window Theory. Thank you. Yeah.

593
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:59,040
Watch those guys and support them if you would, because I enjoy them. They do really quality

594
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:05,680
work. Any other YouTubes you want to plug that I could subscribe to, sir, for supplemental education?

595
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:18,560
Zanjon. And also Daniel Sala's St. Olga's 69. Yeah. So let's just say this.

596
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:24,640
What they're showing there, the moral of the last, the million dollar car graveyard is showing that

597
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,400
no matter how wealthy you are, no matter what possessions you have, you die and all those

598
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,820
things return back to nature. Right. I'm picking up what you're laying down for sure, sir.

599
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:39,460
Yeah. I would say just don't stress, don't fret. Look, if we set out to make the home we live in

600
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:44,400
or the place we live in the best possible and the food we consume, our intake and drink,

601
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:49,680
water, wine, whatever we have the best. Great. All I do is maintain my truck,

602
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,480
which I don't have any knowledge to make it burn on water or anything like that,

603
00:54:53,580 --> 00:55:02,540
yet I keep my house pristine and I eat the best food. Hell, you know what? I'll show you. I'll

604
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:12,760
show you what I got going on. So we got some bone marrow. This was a tomahawk, but they frenched it

605
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:18,060
some jumbo asparagus with lemon zest. And then what I'm cooking for my guests tonight is a

606
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:23,340
whole bunch of oysters Rockefeller. I don't know if y'all can see that. Yeah, it's a three dozen

607
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:28,080
right there. And then I put it on my big green egg out here. And I mentioned you said you like

608
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:34,000
wine, so I don't know. Yeah, you got a lot of reds there. I got some. I got some au brion. I

609
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,600
got it. But what's really cool is my dad, he sells wine for Sotheby's and stuff. He had this the other

610
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:45,140
day and didn't call me. A 64 calosegura three liter. He said it still tasted jammy and sweet.

611
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:50,020
He said the insides were just impeccable. I was like, well, so they'd never hit it with sulfites

612
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:56,420
or battery acid. Yeah, they probably let it naturally ferment. Sorry to take it off the whole

613
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:00,240
knowledge aspect. I just couldn't help. No, that's knowledge, too. Thank you for sharing.

614
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,180
I'm so passionate about that stuff, too. If you or Daniel ever can make it here.

615
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,560
Anyway, yes. So back to the thing at hand. Yeah, I understand. So it's about perspective.

616
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,520
OK, well, that's perspective. And it's also you are not what you think you are, what you

617
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:19,420
experience. What I mean, but you could think whatever thought high level, low level in the

618
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:22,660
middle of the night, you're walking over to get a glass of water and you bump your big toe on the

619
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:29,960
kitchen table. That experience will change your thoughts real fast. Right. So you are really what

620
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:34,600
you experience. So no matter what, you know, so here's the thing is knowledge power in the knower

621
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:42,500
or is knowledge power in the doer. In the doer, of course, so it's what you're doing that that

622
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:49,400
does it, but you have to have good knowledge to do good stuff, right? Yes. And that's why I seek you

623
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:53,180
and one more thing for I'll let Daniel, I'm sorry, I keep on railroading. I just

624
00:56:53,700 --> 00:57:00,520
drink. I can't help. But. I mean, you'll get over it, you'll get it take you about two or three or

625
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:04,900
six months to calm down about it. That's fine. Well, you owe us nothing, man. I just and you

626
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:08,800
still give us the time of day and this is knowledge I can't get anywhere else or I don't

627
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:13,660
know how to get anywhere else. Well, you do know you do know how to do it. I just I think on some

628
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:19,040
of the early episodes, I always stated how to how to seek how to get it. You know, if there's

629
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:24,780
reference material on something, that means there was a benevolent force behind it. So if you're a

630
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:28,720
benevolent force and you create something, you just don't throw it to the next guy doesn't know

631
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:35,020
what it is. You include a manual, right? Yeah. So you talked about like the viruses at the CDC,

632
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:43,660
which is they call it the CDC, not the CDM or CDR or something. It's a Center for Disease Control,

633
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:48,820
not treatment protection. But you were saying how with the whole virus theory, you'll say that

634
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:54,840
they'll issue something that's like 903 pages. But in the abstract, say we've never been able

635
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:59,420
to isolate this and it probably doesn't exist in so many words. But and then why read the whole

636
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:03,360
why read the whole 900 pages? You read the introduction and the conclusion. If the

637
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:09,240
conclusion is non non conclusive, the rest of it is just look at the pictures and the graphs, right?

638
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:15,960
So if I if I have a nine, it was the National Institute of Health, NIH. Yeah, they have a 989

639
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:22,060
PDF on the study of transmittable diseases through viruses. And the introduction states,

640
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:28,340
this is all the studies we've had for the past 35 years on this. And now you've got 985 pages to go.

641
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,220
But you skip to the conclusion. And it says even after all these studies, it's still inconclusive.

642
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:36,220
We don't know. You can say you read the damn thing and the thing says you don't know.

643
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:42,200
Right. Even without reading it. But just look when you this is how you read a technical manual,

644
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:46,320
you look at the table of context with the subject, the title table of context shows you

645
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,960
each title on the table of context is there because it's it changes the subject and it's

646
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:56,240
a significant subject change, right? The basic list category of categories to be covered.

647
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,740
And the next thing you do is you page through it and see look if their graphs are pictures,

648
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:05,480
because if there's a graph or a picture means it's real important to illustrate it right to

649
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:10,820
break out of text. And then you go back and you go to each chapter and you read the first paragraph

650
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:15,320
and you read the last paragraph, because in basic writing, you have to write the conclusion

651
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:20,860
introduction. So now you've invested about, let's say you have a 700 page technical manual,

652
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,720
you've invested less than an hour, you can have a conversation with the author.

653
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:30,660
Most people you give them a 700 page technical manual comma week later, I'm only up to chapter

654
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:36,160
three, man. Why didn't you do a quick preview over the whole thing? See if it's even worth going to

655
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:42,300
chapter two or three? You see? Do you see my the approach on this? Yes, no, it's completely

656
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:46,620
pragmatic. And that's actually how I do whenever we're assigned all the stupid book reading as a

657
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:50,900
child to read all these damn books, I would read like the first paragraph and the last.

658
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:56,180
Well, let's let's go back to the analogy of the 989 NIH document says that viruses have nothing to

659
00:59:56,180 --> 01:00:02,680
do with disease. If I just spent half an hour reading the the way I just said and say that I

660
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:07,820
read it and they don't conclude that viruses have anything to do with communicable diseases,

661
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:11,860
if someone did spend the time, even the person who wrote it, would they agree or disagree with me?

662
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:17,300
They would have to agree. Right. And I only spent a half an hour on it.

663
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:23,820
I do this all the time. On their level of cosmic censorship.

664
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:31,800
Yeah, but you can here's the thing, what's the first? OK, avoidance of a trap as knowledge of

665
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:39,200
its existence. It becomes a trap into a tragedy, like you'd say, right? If I tell you, in other

666
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:43,500
words, let's explain it for others. If you know there's a trap there and you still step in it,

667
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:51,880
it's your own damn fault. Can't blame anybody. Right? Yeah, no, you don't. Yeah, I completely

668
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:56,160
understand. And so. So, OK, the other thing is you have to be very confident, you know,

669
01:00:56,180 --> 01:01:02,080
like the concept of when, you know, landmines, that's a nasty, nasty demonic thing to do when

670
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:06,520
you have a war. You put landmines, so unsuspected people, children, farmers walk on and get their

671
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:14,100
legs blown off. Right. It condemns it condemns large swaths of land to being abandoned because

672
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:18,720
people don't want to have their legs blown off. Right. So there's two ways to go after it. One is

673
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:24,160
a very light technical ginger way. Hope, you know, well, don't the hope and faith. Hopefully

674
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:28,980
I won't step on one. And the other one is let's develop something technically to sense the way

675
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:32,880
they are. But then there's the other one where you're so confident you build this

676
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:39,820
armored vehicle that is so damn heavy that it just rolls right over him and it doesn't do anything

677
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:44,140
because, you know, the yield of the mine is not that big. It's not more than five or six

678
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:49,160
pounds of explosive. So you build something that is as thick as the World Trade Center tower

679
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:55,320
beams were and you roll the damn thing over the land back and forth. And if one blows off

680
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:58,480
underneath it, we're inside. We say, hey, do you hear something? Sound like someone

681
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:05,320
dropped a rock on here. Right. It doesn't matter. So I'm saying when you develop confidence and

682
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:11,200
you know how to do something, be like that. So when you step on the mine. Right. It's like

683
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:16,380
someone wanted to debate me once. I'm saying this humbly, debate me on a couple of topics.

684
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:20,700
One of them was a medical and he was an older guy who's a professor. Right. Because they can't

685
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:26,160
exist. They can't allow their their false paradigm to shatter. And this is in no way kiss ass. But I

686
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:30,680
mean, no, no. And this is what I said. I said, well, if the purpose is I said I asked him,

687
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:34,960
what is the purpose of the debate is to win, of course. Oh, I'm going to grant you the win right

688
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:41,180
now. And he says, no, you can't do that. You can't do that. You have to do the debate. I said,

689
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:45,720
OK, give me a half an hour. I said, why? You need to prepare, huh? I said, no, I'm going to coach

690
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:50,220
this 12 year old girl right here. She's going to debate you and then beat you. She knows nothing

691
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:56,760
about the subject. And then he left. It becomes actually he said to me, how dare you talk to an

692
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:01,420
academic like he's an asshole? Yeah, well, fuck you is what I was doing. I feel like I'm in

693
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:06,860
railroad and just hijacking this interview. Please, please. No, we're just having a talk

694
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:12,960
here. It happens to be recorded. That's all. Go ahead. Exactly. But but you did gloss over

695
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:20,520
the fact that 9-11 and Corona were prototypes for something. And because to keep with the theme of

696
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:26,380
the Greek speaking, being like a trailer of sorts, could you give us some insight about

697
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:33,420
what the what it was, what they were a prototype for? Oh, what's called is the

698
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:39,660
disclosure. They keep saying disclosure. They allow that. All right. Of of how we're how the

699
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:45,620
new order society is going to be built, be built up. Let's go back. You had the stalled century.

700
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:49,540
In other words, the 20th century was stalled with World War One, World War Two, Cold War,

701
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:54,080
the renaming of all the countries in Europe and Africa, you know, not all. But, you know,

702
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:58,200
the fall of the Soviet Union, the dot com, everybody's connected. Like, for example,

703
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:02,220
do you know you could look this up maybe while I'm saying this, Suzanne Thomas Jefferson,

704
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:06,320
Thomas Jefferson had a quote that one day the government will be able to put something in the

705
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:11,200
body of its citizens to track every movement. Let me say that again. Thomas Jefferson,

706
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:15,900
Thomas Jefferson, you know, that guy lives down the street right now or the guy that maybe they

707
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:19,840
lived down the street 300 years ago. Which one am I talking about? Right. The one that lived 300

708
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:26,140
years ago or 200. He said one day the government will be able to put something in the bodies of

709
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:30,420
their citizens to track their every movement. I'm paraphrasing there. You could find that quote,

710
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:34,560
by the way. So does that sound like something that's happening now?

711
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:42,640
Yeah, they had a forethought and understood. Right. So Thomas Jefferson said this. So here's

712
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:48,360
the thing. So we put it all together. Right, Daniel. And this is more of a disclosure of that.

713
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:56,500
Right. Basically, you were given 70 years of prosperity, which was all fake,

714
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:00,520
was contrived by hiding history. When they hide the true history from you and tell you,

715
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:03,740
you can you can buy things, more things are available. That's all fake. Right.

716
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:09,060
They're hiding something from you. So you failed that test as a society. In other words,

717
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:13,940
they did this. He said these people, they should learn on their own. You should never rely on

718
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:17,180
somebody else to educate you. And if they do tell you something, you should check up on it.

719
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:21,920
And they don't. So is there was there any spirit? I'm going to we've went over this before the past

720
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:28,240
70 years, 50, 60, 70s, dot com till now or society as a whole. Did they spiritually evolve

721
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:33,780
with that open trade and ease of living, easier living or so? Did they spiritually evolve? Did

722
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:40,460
they get more gluttonous, more greedy? Look at you see. So they failed spiritually because the

723
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:44,600
people that are running, they're very spiritual. Spiritual can be good or bad, by the way. Right.

724
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:49,780
Like the devil is spiritual. And so is God. Let's say. Yeah, because I was spiritual. Yeah.

725
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:55,080
So they failed spiritually. So now what's the next step is those that have the spiritual

726
01:05:55,640 --> 01:06:00,520
attainment, both good and bad, say, OK, what are these people good for? Well, they're good for

727
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:05,580
labor. They're good for sex slaves, good for general slaves or some of some people like to

728
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:13,180
eat other people. And then that's it. That's where you're going. I think I talked about the

729
01:06:13,180 --> 01:06:18,880
cannibalism agenda. Do you remember that in the Charlie said the next thing is going to be the

730
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:25,080
cannibalism agenda versus the transgender and all that stuff. So really. OK, that makes sense.

731
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:31,200
I remember you telling me about our hearing you talk about all the baby remains found with bleach

732
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:35,980
white bones that were scraped and had scraping marks on them that are just either covered up

733
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:41,140
or destroyed or ignored. Yeah. Every every archaeological dig, there's like 2000 archaeological

734
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:45,480
digs all over the world going on every day. But how come we're not getting anything information

735
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,720
because once they start seeing on how the people are living, they write their report and they say

736
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:55,500
we find baby bones in pots, even pots with the shape of a baby. You ever see like those

737
01:06:55,500 --> 01:07:05,200
fish baking trays that they make in the shape of a fish? Yes. OK. But can you explain how

738
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:11,080
birthday cakes and dolls are related to birthday cakes, cannibals and dolls, what they have in

739
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:16,880
birth? OK, birthday. What do birthdays, cannibals and dolls have in common? That's how you explain

740
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:22,780
the society. OK. Early on in the Mesopotamian region, they worship the balls, which means

741
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:28,540
the Lord. Like today, they worship the Lord. A lord is a ball. And the priest class was called

742
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:33,240
not a pastor, a priest was called a kahan. So the priest of ball was the kahan ball,

743
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:39,540
right? Priest of the Lord. Just like you have priests of the Lord today. And the way you

744
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:45,440
worshiped and gave offerings to the Lord is by sacrificing a child. And when you sacrifice the

745
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:50,300
child, the child, parts of the child were eaten. Some of the blood was taken. Like satanic

746
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:55,220
ceremonies are today, just a small portion. Everyone partakes in it. That's why eating of

747
01:07:55,220 --> 01:08:01,900
human flesh is still referred to as kahan ballism. Right. Now, when the family returned and made this

748
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:06,280
offering, the other brothers and sisters asked, where's our brother? Where's our sister? So the

749
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:11,980
kahan balls, the altar boys, made a little effigy of a child, a doll, and said, give this

750
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:16,340
one. If any of the children ask, where's the missing child? Give them this to play with in

751
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:23,220
the meantime. So if you ask anyone where to play, giving specific female dolls or boy dolls to

752
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:30,240
children came from. They don't know. Right now, after a while, they didn't want to do this anymore

753
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:33,620
for many reasons. Sometimes they stopped it. Sometimes they didn't. They said, OK,

754
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:39,200
let's do the ceremony anyway, a parody of the ceremony. So you bake a loaf of sweet bread,

755
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:43,800
which represents the body of the child, and you put lights in it. And everyone attending,

756
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:48,960
the child that was representative there would blow out the lights, meaning blow out the life,

757
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:53,720
and everybody eats a piece of the sweet bread, which represents the body. And to show that this

758
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:58,979
brings prosperity, the child makes a wish of prosperity, and everyone attending the ceremony

759
01:08:58,979 --> 01:09:02,920
brings a gift for the child. And I was reading this in a little book written in the 1800s,

760
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:06,640
and I didn't know what the hell they were talking about. I said, one day I woke up, I was like,

761
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:11,840
loaf of sweet bread, blowing out the lights, a wish of prosperity, bring a gift. That's the

762
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:18,100
birthday ceremony. God damn it. So that's why when I tell people, people say I'm going to a

763
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:23,300
birthday party. So you're going to have a real one or the fake one with the cake and the candles?

764
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:27,600
Because a real one would be, you know. I'm thinking of what you're laying down.

765
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:32,700
So you have a pretty sick society, pretty sick people doing this. You know what I mean?

766
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:37,859
How can people want to kill other people innocently? Okay, like let me just say there's

767
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:43,560
this random child. I'm a Satanist. You know, I'm looking at that child. How can they quantify it?

768
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:47,020
Let me just go kill someone innocent. How come they never have the thought, or they do,

769
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:51,880
but they can override the thought? Like, what if I was that child? Would I like that done to me?

770
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:57,480
Yeah, let me just interject one thing. They've captured the word Satanist also,

771
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:02,520
because the biblical Satan is not like that also. They've revived actually ancient gods,

772
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:06,120
but when they say Satanist, it's easier for the Christian mythos, because we live in the

773
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:11,000
Christian era, to associate with something bad. But because if Satan knocked on your door right

774
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:17,080
now and came in and you told him this, he would blush. And if you told him, let's go to the

775
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:22,820
Vatican, he'd say, why the hell do you want to go to that godforsaken place, right? So it's all

776
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:26,700
misplaced, but I'm not faulting you. That's okay, because whoever's listening to this will get the

777
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:35,020
I gave a couple of talks on this very simply. It has to do with the structure of the human body

778
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:41,000
being a fractal representation of life in the universe, life in the planet. So in other words,

779
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:46,280
it has to do with how the human body works, why children are being offered as sacrifice,

780
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:50,720
I guess. Would that satisfy your question? Why are children being sacrificed?

781
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:55,280
They're always seeing their omnipresence, so the only way to get their attention is through blood

782
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:57,160
offering, like you were saying, but the thing is...

783
01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:01,340
Well, no, that's different. There are other entities that require you do other things with

784
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:06,340
children, like put them through extreme pain through anal sex. Let's take the one, the Vatican,

785
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:09,840
the demon that the Vatican in Scientology, it's the same demon.

786
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,940
But why does one have to get hurt? Like, why can't...

787
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:17,760
Because that's an external... It's like an ET comes to you and says, I need a cup full of

788
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,380
razor blades for breakfast. I mean, that's weird to you, but that's what they require, right?

789
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:27,220
From you, once you go into business with them, right? It's a strange business contract.

790
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:33,600
But the reason why children are sacrificed is something else. For example, what is the most

791
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:38,720
important organ in the human body? The genitals, yes, because they give you life

792
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:43,180
prosperity, so that things are phallic or... No, no, no, hold on, hold on, because if you

793
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:47,460
say the heart or whatever, you see, you can eliminate that and people will still be able

794
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:51,180
to procreate those that still have their heart. But if you eliminate everyone's genitalia,

795
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:56,440
everyone will be missing, gone in 40 years. Let's say sans cloning and in vitro and all that

796
01:11:56,440 --> 01:12:03,440
stuff. Okay, so what is the fruit of the genitalia? It's the child. So in the ancient

797
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:10,320
mythos, you bring your God, the best of your fruit. So the best of your fruit would be the

798
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,720
best of fruit of your body, and you offer it, and they usually want an offering, and they like

799
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:18,720
the smell of burned flesh because when you go to outer space, and if you went into outer space

800
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:23,080
right now, very high altitude, you're near the moon, and you pulled off your, opened your visor

801
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:27,140
and took a breath, you would choke because it smells like burning flesh. When I say burning

802
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:30,660
flesh, I'm not talking about that tomahawk steak on the grill. I'm talking about burning hair,

803
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:35,840
nails, skin, and everything at the same time. Okay, that's what outer space smells like,

804
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:39,240
and I've been saying this for a long time, and then recently NASA even put up a video. Yeah,

805
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:43,980
when you open the door to the space shuttle and close it, it smells like a burning steak.

806
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,340
You know, I'm like, finally, they're starting to tell people, you know.

807
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:51,340
This is all in the ancient texts, by the way, everything I'm telling you, so.

808
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:58,100
But you see, you're robbing something that has the potential to have been someone. That could

809
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:02,420
have been the next. Yes, but hold on a second. You were not considered alive until you were

810
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:08,400
five years old back then because you were on mother's milk till five years old. Yes, you were

811
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:13,120
on your mom's teat till you were five, and the moment you got off your mom's teat at five years

812
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:19,980
old around that time, then you were considered alive. So, if you bring a child, let's say you

813
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:24,640
have a baby and you raise four years old or five, even at five, it's not considered a human yet

814
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:30,980
or an entity, a living entity. It is alive, yes, because if it wasn't alive, how would it be on

815
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:36,160
the mother? But this is the tradition, and this is the way things are done back then, and they're

816
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:44,030
still carried through now. You just don't know it. It's just not talked about. And I guess what

817
01:13:44,030 --> 01:13:50,810
patron deity you have depends on your location, right? Yep, you were saying. It's cosmic geography.

818
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:58,410
Yeah, cosmic censorship, cosmic geography, cosmic law, right? All that stuff. Yes, it's all cosmic.

819
01:13:58,990 --> 01:14:07,790
Yeah. I'm sure that there are also well-aligned elites out there that don't take part in human

820
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:18,560
sacrifice, right? Yes, there are, but they can only go so far. Just like people in Hollywood

821
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,180
and politicians, you're not going to be prominent unless you do those things, right?

822
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:30,040
Even the best politicians before the election, they're told that they're chosen to be the head

823
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:34,600
of the corporation, and if they agree, then they have to go into this room where there's

824
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:38,380
some children and some people with cameras, and if they agree to that, then they're in. All of

825
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:44,420
them, right, do that. Wow, okay. I thought it was different there. No, no, no. All of them.

826
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:52,000
Even the ones that have mango-colored hair, Zan. Well, look, how can one usurp that?

827
01:14:52,740 --> 01:14:58,980
What happens if you were armed and you just... Oh, very easy. The answer, for example, is...

828
01:14:59,660 --> 01:15:04,040
Remember how we said the governments or the state and the codes tell you that they're not lawful?

829
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:07,960
They give you the remedy right there. If you read Title 12.4.11, it says,

830
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:12,360
you're not authorized to use the money, and it's not lawful, but if you want lawful money,

831
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:17,380
you have to demand it, right? You have to demand... So this is a real simple way you

832
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:24,300
can fix the U.S., very simple. Instead of unconditionally endorsing stuff, put conditions

833
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:29,040
on it, and go to the state officials, because you have to go to the officials because they're put

834
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:32,920
in front. Just like when you go to the restaurant, you deal with the waiter. You don't go, who's the

835
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:37,540
owner? You ask the waiter who the owner is, right? Then the waiter doesn't bring you to the

836
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:42,100
owner. The waiter brings you to the manager, and the manager uses discernment. You might want to

837
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:47,280
keep the owner private, but even if he keeps the owner private of the restaurant, the message will

838
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:52,700
get to them, right? So what you do is you go to your state officials, doesn't matter who they

839
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:56,500
are, and you demand that the government is restored, and you know that it cannot be restored.

840
01:15:56,660 --> 01:16:00,000
First of all, they don't even know what you're talking about because they've been so dumbed

841
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:05,460
down now also. Many of them now, they don't even know because they could have Freudian slips.

842
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:12,420
Like if you look, the last time you had people, politicians, that knew what was going on was with

843
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:18,500
the later Bush administrations, like Rumsfeld and Cheney and all those people around the

844
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:23,420
Condoleezza Rice, they knew. You know why I'm saying this? Because how many Freudian slips did

845
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:30,180
they have on camera? Many, right? Anyway, they were talking more than 20 years ago,

846
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:33,720
a lot of Freudian slips. Now they have them, so they don't know anything at all, so they can't

847
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:39,140
slip up. So you go to them and you say, we know that this is the worst thing to say to them,

848
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:43,420
by the way. We know that the state is administrating the bankruptcy of the government.

849
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:47,820
So for example, all the attorneys, all the banks, the banks are not banks, they're national

850
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:54,020
associations. National associations like the Sierra Club, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, right?

851
01:16:54,620 --> 01:17:00,320
Anyway, so we know that the government is bankrupt. We have all the paperwork, all the states went in

852
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:04,600
on it, all the locals went in on it. What is it going to take to bring it back and make it lawful?

853
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:09,400
We want to do this illegally first, and then we want to switch over to a lawful system.

854
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:15,240
And how do we resolve the bankruptcy? Oh my goodness. But not just one person, because

855
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:21,360
they're going to brand you crazy, right? You need about 9 million people doing this,

856
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:32,540
which is 3%. What are the chances of getting 900? Zero. You could do this in any country,

857
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:38,500
by the way. They're all the same. Like if you're in Disneyland and you're riding the teacups or in

858
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:42,600
the Haunted House or in the Fun House or the Ferris Wheel, what's the difference? You're in

859
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:53,920
the same. To you, they're slightly different. And at this point, I think you also said something

860
01:17:53,920 --> 01:18:04,040
like even the well-aligned of the higher echelon are all accepting of the fact that the remaking

861
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:10,700
or starting new is inevitable and that we are beyond saving at this point.

862
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:16,980
Yeah, there's nothing this. Yeah. What they're going to do is reorganize. OK. You have a car

863
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:21,180
and it gets in a crash and it's so bad you can't fix it. You got a guy outside that showed up

864
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:25,120
that's just started working on my fucking house, some welders that I didn't even pay yet. So I

865
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:30,660
don't. I don't just deal with it. We got it. OK. All right. Cool. Sorry. Just come back soon,

866
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:34,300
though. Well, no, no, I don't know what I don't know what the hell is going on.

867
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:39,260
That's what those loud noises were. These guys. Oh, OK. All right. You want to end this and start

868
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:43,500
one private without me, you know, saying or it's fine, whatever you guys want to do. But I'm just

869
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:47,560
going to I'm sorry, all these people, you're not here now because you got to deal with that. So

870
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:51,780
deal with it. Yeah. Whatever you got to do. I'm going to end this. I got to go. OK. All right.
