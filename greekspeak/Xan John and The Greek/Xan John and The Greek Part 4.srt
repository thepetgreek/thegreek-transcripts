1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,420
Great, I really appreciate you reaching out man. How's everything been? What's going on?

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:10,320
You told me you gave me some updates on China and Taiwan. Oh, yeah the date. Well, you want to go political?

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:16,120
You're running for Senate Senate, you know, it's just a here before we go political

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,000
You got to realize that you know, what mid-level management is, right?

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,400
That's that's the highest you're gonna go

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,480
It's kind of like when you go shopping for stuff. You're getting all the mid-level stuff, right?

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,680
That's the best you're gonna get

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,580
There's a lot of reasons for it. But here when you read about all the ancient kings and all that too, you know

9
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:40,960
In ancient history, they were mid-level management. Also, I know things like that

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,640
Say again, maybe you can answer things like that. Yeah, they were all mid-level management. Actually you brought up Nebuchadnezzar

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,380
and you read in Scripture he was

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,520
Basically, let his hair grow. Let his nail nails grow kind of like Sam Hughes or whatever

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,900
Yeah, you see that and Babylonian things with the curly hair know what the well

14
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,560
I'll know to show that he was mid-level management. If you read in the book of Daniel and other places

15
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:13,380
He went nuts. He lived he went out in the forest and ate what the animals ate

16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:20,340
He let his hair grow. He didn't bathe his nails grew out. He acted like a wild animal for about seven years living under a tree

17
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,700
Wow, are you familiar with that? Yeah, you could read that find this down

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,940
Yeah, yeah, it's in it's in the right smack in the middle of what's called the book of Daniel

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,080
Danielle and what's interesting about that is after he went through that period of seven years. I would what would you call that?

20
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,120
Right. I mean pretty much insane, right?

21
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,420
He declared that the Elohim were running the planet the Elohim by the way when you look at that

22
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:52,120
King James Bible they call them God and they're not God and the top the head honcho in

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,860
There is Yahweh and they call him Lord

24
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,280
Which is appropriate because the head honcho is the Lord, right?

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,800
So, I mean, yeah, yes long ship. They live forever and all the other jobs are jealous

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,660
I'm just trying to recall what you teach. Yeah

27
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,860
Also, he had well in the machine the water that does like the clouds and it comes and flows out the Garden of Eden was

28
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:21,020
Never here. Anyway, I mean interrupting. Oh, yeah, you've seen Independence Day, right the big spaceships. Welcome to

29
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,980
Yeah, right. Exactly. That's what's going on at the Elohim

30
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
The word God by the way is to

31
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:35,280
Teutonic old German old English. It means the Sun or it means those that are up in heaven, you know, like Anunnaki or whatever

32
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,380
Well, since we got on to the politics

33
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,640
there is

34
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:48,080
Geo, there's geopolitical politics, which I think we just disqualified as any of having any significance and we jumped right to cosmic

35
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,700
Politics now one thing that when you look at all the religions of the world all of them bar none

36
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,680
They are giving you cosmic politics inner not the inner cosmic politics

37
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,540
But what you think you should know after you've been declared an idiot

38
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,440
That that's how they view the people by the way. So if you if you look at

39
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,180
All of it from that perspective, which is the correct and true perspective

40
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,920
They're mostly lies, but in order for a lie to be believable you have to have some truth, right?

41
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,820
So if you find what the some truths are in the religions

42
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:33,260
They all lead back to the the volumes of texts that they subscribe to, you know

43
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,700
the in the Hindu tradition

44
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,800
they have the Rig Vedas the Puranas the biblical is the Christian and the Judaean the

45
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,780
The biblical is also the Muslim by the way

46
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,120
Because you know in the Koran Syria 26 and Syria 28 basically says that

47
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:54,560
There's no God's law is not in the Koran. You have to go get it from Moses

48
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:02,220
Well, where do you get that you have to go to the Old Testament? So the actual Koran directs the reader to go

49
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,480
To the biblical text how many Muslims you think do that?

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,520
Big fat zero, right?

51
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,399
Okay, so and also the biblical law by the way is commanded all throughout the Bible. It's never done away with

52
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,460
So all of these religions and the way they're behaving is basically once you've been declared an idiot then you have a choice

53
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,720
That's why when you go to a government building or a hospital, they ask you what religion you are

54
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,360
You know, so so what you know, what idiot what what idiotic membership? Are you part of?

55
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,320
Okay, just to go back to the cosmic politics

56
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,060
The Elohim are the human collective

57
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,300
Meaning they have the the five-pointed star, you know, the two arms two legs and head, right?

58
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,900
Most most beings have that they're the human collective

59
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,540
and what you will see in the ancient texts and it's very sparse and very

60
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:06,660
Minimal but very significant is you have this concept of the serpent a sky serpent the dragon the Draco

61
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:13,500
The reptile on and on. Okay when you see that look

62
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,680
Examine the context and now we're going to get into the inner cosmic political world

63
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,160
And when you get into the inner cosmic political world

64
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:30,520
You will find however old you think the universe is or however big it is that this universe is run by an imperial force

65
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,540
Okay, I'm actually using their terms now

66
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:40,760
Who who are they and that imperial force is comprised of these dragons?

67
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:47,540
reptiles Draco types in other words, they are the original species the first

68
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,940
progenitor type

69
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,320
Group to enter into this universe

70
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,460
Okay

71
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,740
Who where and who they came from? I don't know

72
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,880
I don't want to act like um, I know everything about everything or everything about some things

73
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,560
I know a lot about many things, but I can't continue on that path

74
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,960
But what I can tell you know before us the dinosaurs were a pet project of these reptiles

75
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,720
Just like we would have a zoo or a public park

76
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:27,440
Put together to be a recreational place to go and admire animals and natural settings if you've ever been to

77
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,580
old money black nobility

78
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,080
Property they how they'd love their gardens

79
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:40,220
You know like, you know, if you go to some real old old money people, they invest a lot in their gardens

80
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,360
They have greenhouses and beautiful grounds and all that

81
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,440
That's what the earth was what they did

82
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,660
The dinosaurs, okay, they say a meteor destroyed them

83
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:56,300
Okay. Now it looked like a meteorite like here for example since you brought up the dinosaurs, that's good

84
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,620
We're taking a narrow swath. Okay of something that's huge

85
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,760
You know you how do you eat an elephant one bite at a time? So here's one bite. Okay

86
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:13,700
Now we all hopefully you myself and whoever is listening it's fairly reasonable and logical, okay, so

87
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,760
You have a magnet in your hand and I have a magnet in my hand and we throw them at each other

88
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,120
let's say your magnets the size of a beach ball and mine is the size of a grain of sand and

89
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,980
I throw my magnet at your magnet, you know, they're gonna

90
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,100
Connect and where are they going to connect on the poles?

91
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:36,000
Not at the equatorial part. So if if meteorites are magnetic, which they all state they are

92
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,100
And the earth is magnetic

93
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,960
It is nearly impossible for a natural meteorite to hit anywhere else than the North Pole or the South Pole

94
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:51,800
So we have this large hole in the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico huge two mile wide

95
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:59,720
Hole in Arizona. They're all over the world in Russia Africa were quote-unquote meteorites hit those were not natural meteorites

96
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:04,940
Those were actually put together by the human collective the Elohim and others

97
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,660
Their hybrid derivations of

98
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,940
And when I mean a hybrid derivation of like for example, I have a friend and he's Okinawan and

99
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:22,080
His wife is Portuguese now Okinawan looks so, you know, people mistake them for Japanese, but they're not Okinawans or Okinawans, okay, and

100
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:28,680
They have a daughter. So he's Asian and she's European. So their daughter is Eurasian and I call her a hybrid

101
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,220
Because from a racial perspective she is a hybrid. She's not Asian and she's not European

102
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,380
You see what I mean by hybrid? It's very easy to hybrid eyes, by the way

103
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:42,100
Just like I have a friend and she's

104
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,300
from

105
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,700
the continent

106
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:54,280
And her husband's Italian white, right? So their child is neither. It's a hybrid you see so you have hybrid humans

107
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,060
Okay, so some of these hybrid humans

108
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,420
Decided to gather together space junk and

109
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:08,080
Throw it down on the planet around the area of Mexico and create that big swath a big Gulf of Mexico area

110
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:15,960
But whenever you see by for example meteorite strikes on the earth, you could look up in the internet internet craters meter meteorite craters

111
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,660
Anything that's not exactly at the North Pole or exactly hit the South Pole is not a natural meteorite

112
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,920
Either then you're gonna say holy shit Greek. What are you talking about?

113
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,220
Well, first of all, I want to just say that you've been lied to

114
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:33,360
Second of all, they don't they know this fact. I just showed you using third grade science

115
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,680
What do you wonder you think children are given magnets to play with around the third grade fourth grade, baby?

116
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,460
It was pre-k for me. Okay, there you go

117
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:48,560
So that that meteorites natural meteorites will never hit the surface of the earth other than above 80 latitude or below, right?

118
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,840
So North Pole or South Pole so all of these meteorite air

119
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,420
craters that you see on the planet are

120
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,640
weapons

121
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,160
Okay, and then if you want to discuss, you know further on how how you know

122
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,880
You can even tell what kind of like for example a ballistics expert can tell you

123
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,820
What kind of a you know explosive it was by because of his training, okay?

124
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,320
Just like

125
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,560
Forensics people that do murder cases can tell you what kind of an animal this person was mauled by right

126
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,360
Like if it's a lion

127
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,360
It's always the bet the face a bear will be the groin and the intestinal area, right?

128
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,480
A dog will be the limbs and the fingers right if you so if you see a body having those characteristics right away

129
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,540
With one second you can you'll know what animal did that to a human but the common person will be walking on says

130
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,160
I don't know man. He just had parts of his body bitten off

131
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,760
He couldn't tell right and I just gave you the small little outline that if you just remember those little rules

132
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,700
It's like you've just you know elevated yourself to the top 0.1% of the society

133
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,800
So once you see how the magnets attract and you see what's going on on the earth

134
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,200
You know that they were they were not meteorites per se

135
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:10,160
So that's what the dinosaurs were now by the way. I'll go out on a limb the human collective that did this

136
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:15,300
Was severely punished and their planet was wiped out here. I'm gonna go out on another limb

137
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,540
When you when you look at the pull what they call the Pleiades which has over

138
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,380
20,000 Suns and several million planets with civilizations

139
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,080
That is a general grouping

140
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,440
constellation grouping

141
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:36,540
When you look at it now with a telescope or what's been documented by science that only represents 10% of what was there a million?

142
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,020
years ago a

143
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:45,040
Million years ago there were 90% more planets and Suns and they were all lost in an incredible battle or war that lasted for a very

144
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,020
long time between the

145
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,980
dragons, let's say I don't like using the term Draco because

146
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:57,480
That's a very you know when people say reptilians and Draco you hear all this stuff, right?

147
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,940
Which ones it's it's like when you say humans

148
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,240
The humans aren't doing anything if you look for example at

149
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,620
Earth you you can't just say humans because you have so many nations that have so many different cultures in the way that they live

150
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:20,360
You have to say well Americans or Russians or Egyptians or Iraqis, right or Chinese because they're so very different the way

151
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:27,220
They're acting right? Yeah, so the same with the reptiles. I mean when I mean, who are they is like for example the

152
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,220
The Imperial Draco they they're in the area of Thuban

153
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:37,120
Right, which used to be the North Star now. No, it's no longer the North Star

154
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,540
It was the North Star about 36,000 years ago

155
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,880
You have

156
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,000
Kolasque the group called Kolasque

157
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,520
That runs the Milky Way

158
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:53,640
They have pretty much integrated themselves out of they're still part of the Empire

159
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:59,680
But they've integrated themselves more into a more broad-reaching way of thinking because the purpose the

160
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,060
thinking that the Imperial has

161
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,700
Imperial

162
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:09,520
Draco is their thought is to explore and dominate the entire universe by force

163
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:18,080
Or by collect by by a willing collective so when they show up if you're a willing collective there's no force involved, right?

164
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,220
You have others in the ancient a lot of them that

165
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,600
Interacted that are known as the demons like the demon Ga or more cool

166
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,680
Or Vortac, right? You have the theta Tauri

167
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,560
I mean I could go down with a 50 a list of maybe another 20 or 30. No, that's not even do it

168
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,400
I can send you the list and you could type it in so when you hear about

169
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:50,000
The reptilians, I just mouthed out about eight or nine different races that are very distinct

170
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:57,640
There's about 50 to 75. So when you hear about people talking about reptilians, or it would be just like someone said

171
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,940
Hey, I visited earth and met humans and you're like, oh humans

172
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:06,720
Okay, but they're not telling you that there's different groups here with different cultures and different, right?

173
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,620
So then you have to question if they just stick to humans, what do you know about them?

174
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,560
And who are they? Oh, well, you know, they like to eat ice cream

175
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,900
That's what I hear when I listen to

176
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,700
Yeah, yeah, that's like that's like so narrow it's almost down to stupid

177
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,640
So when you listen to what's being put out there in this quote-unquote community called the SSP

178
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,500
Whatever when I hear that it's like I told Daniel I can't listen

179
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:36,280
I have not listened to any SSP videos for more than five minutes anyone. I have to turn it off because it's just

180
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:43,340
I'm not saying that they're full of crap. But if you put it on a scale, it wouldn't weigh anything

181
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,500
So and it's not helping anyone

182
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,820
So one one thing that you know, we took a narrow swath of the dinosaurs and we led to this. So

183
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:53,840
essentially

184
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,620
For the past I would say half a million years when you got the moon

185
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,440
The moon that we have now the satellite known as the moon

186
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:09,320
Which is a dead it's a dead planet, by the way, all all planets and moons are living they have living they're living entity

187
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:16,460
But the moon is a dead one. It would be like for example, you know when you go out in the forest and you see animals

188
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:25,040
They're alive, but if someone shoots one in taxidermy and hangs it on his wall, it's it looks alive, you know

189
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,460
I don't know if you ever been into a place that had that they turn on the light and you see a bear growling like whoa

190
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,400
For a second, you're startled because it's so lifelike, but it's dead

191
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,720
That's our moon. It still has maintains. It's look like a planetary body, by the way

192
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,140
Once you start getting to more advanced cosmology, everything is a planet

193
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,360
What do I mean by that Suns are planets?

194
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:52,780
I know they're not fusion balls or whatever black holes are planets quasars are planets, right?

195
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,500
All these things are planets

196
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,240
Sorry, which are just larger black holes quasars, it's simply pulling it

197
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,480
Oh, yeah, all of the things that pulse are as quasars all of the bodies that they tell you are gas giants

198
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,880
For example, there are no such thing as a gas giant

199
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,960
Planet, for example, you could look at the Schumacher Levy comets. It's a string of pearl

200
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,460
meteorites that hit Jupiter in the mid 90s

201
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,500
If it was a gas planet, it would have gone through no matter how strong the magnetic field

202
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:29,100
It would not have captured them and you could see the surface impact that goes through the the clouds of Jupiter

203
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,400
There's still video they'd like they scrubbed it all but you could still find it

204
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,720
You could see the meteorites and let's go string of pearls

205
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,480
There's about seven or eight or nine meteorites going into large meteors

206
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,060
I should say not meteorites into Jupiter and crack and when they would crash on the surface

207
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:50,960
There would be a blob a very bright flash. All of the planets have surfaces. The Sun has a surface. It's off

208
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,240
It's a planet also

209
00:16:53,500 --> 00:17:01,140
So, I know it's this sounds bizarre, but just know all this is welcome. I can't get this anywhere else. Please like you're not

210
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,520
Sorry, you're not and well, there are people that know it, but they're not speaking like for example

211
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,980
9-eleven was a textbook

212
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:15,359
101 nuclear demolition nuclear meaning on they're placed underground and anything on on the surface the surface reaction, you know

213
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,099
Justifies the object and brings it down. That's 101

214
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:23,819
That is like is if you were taking classes in electricity, you would learn

215
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:28,760
There's a positive and negative on a battery, you know real basic stuff the most basic

216
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:37,080
Nuclear demo demolition works was 9-eleven at 101. Okay, there were thousands of people involved Americans and others foreigners

217
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:44,580
Department of Energy the OST, which is the Office of Special Transportation. It's a branch of the Secret Service

218
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,320
EG&G, which is a they've been

219
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,920
Tasked since the 1940s to develop all the instrumentation

220
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,380
I could go on and on and on and on all these people were involved FEMA, you know everything

221
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,800
They were all involved in there and you know what? There's not one person

222
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,820
That's come public to give even a slightest breakdown of such a basic event

223
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:10,420
You know that isn't that ridiculous? Yeah. Yeah, those who speak don't know those who know don't speak

224
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,300
Is that there's what I've been told what you know when it comes sure

225
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,860
So yeah, so if that holds true, then I'll say I don't know. I'm just speaking. How about how's that?

226
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,520
I didn't mean it that I wasn't applying anything. No, no, of course

227
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,220
So from a from a cut let's go back to the cosmic inner politics

228
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,960
So there's a sort of a truce around the time when the moon was put in place

229
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,880
The the Elohim

230
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,780
Which you call God or gods or Yahweh and the whole collective the Elion?

231
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,460
They have a group of hybrids with them. Also, they're known as the Nakash and

232
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,660
There are the reptilian hybrids very similar to if you watch the later Star Trek's

233
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:54,280
Where in the early Star Trek's they're fighting the Klingons, but in the later Star Trek they have wharf who's like on the bridge

234
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,660
He's a officer right like they had a peace treaty. So now he's an officer kind of like yeah

235
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,160
Yeah, yeah, just kind of look at the American military

236
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,220
You would have never had a black man or an Asian man in the military 150 years ago. There was so prejudice, right?

237
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:17,400
So, you know would have never happened but now you do so you have a hybrid it's called they're called the Nakash

238
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,460
And they're in the Bible

239
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,860
So everything I've told you most of it is pretty well

240
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,900
It's not easy to access but I'm maybe that's why I'm saying it

241
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,420
But some of the stuff that's easy to access like I'll point out if I say some things in the Bible or give you a

242
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,440
Direct reference you can get it. You can look it up yourself

243
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,580
These Elohim through treaty and other things like that

244
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,780
Will dominate the earth and have been dominating the earth. They're very hands-off

245
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,800
Just like if you lived in somewhere in the middle of Montana

246
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,660
You wouldn't know what was going on in Washington DC unless you watched it on TV

247
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,380
You got a letter

248
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:58,480
But if you didn't watch them on TV because these Elohim are not on TV and you don't get letters

249
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,340
It seems like they're not around you see what I mean?

250
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:08,820
Yes, so they're going to what I've been saying they're going to sneak in because remember this solar system is under imperial rule

251
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:15,020
But they do have like for example Saturn and Jupiter are major major

252
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,420
Things in occult literature like, you know, Saturn is the black cube you see it in the Kabbalah right father time Kronos

253
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:29,020
Jupiter is known as Jove you always swore by Jove or Jupiter or Zeus

254
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,940
They're the moons of these planets

255
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,700
have

256
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,220
ambassadorship

257
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,480
Outposts of both the Elohim the human collective they go by several names

258
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:48,220
The Elohim is the old Judaic term. I'll use that because it's the easiest to acquire

259
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:54,360
terms like Anunnaki and other terms have been so bastardized and

260
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,460
Misused that I prefer not to trample a walk on something that's been so heavily trampled. It doesn't hold anything anymore

261
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:02,920
so

262
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:09,580
The truce that's in the solar system will not necessarily be broken, but you're going to have this human collective

263
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:17,060
Sneak in and take over the earth and remanage the human collective that's on this planet for the next thousand years

264
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:23,380
You will know that this is beginning when you see a Middle East Union form with a new country called a Syria

265
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:29,000
Basically a civil war in Iraq. You're going to see a monarchy installed in Israel

266
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,600
You're going to see a woman ruling Egypt these things when you start seeing these things happen

267
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,500
You'll know that you're getting to the time that I'm discussing where this particular

268
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:46,380
Society as you've known it will will go away and the new one will come under the Elohim

269
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,020
But the Elohim will not be doing it directly. They will be doing it

270
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,800
through a group of humans that they empower

271
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,380
If that makes any sense as a matter of fact some of these empowered humans will be ancient humans

272
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,120
They'll be brought back from the dead known as the resurrection

273
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,820
So it'll be people like Adam

274
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,360
What's that

275
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:13,580
No, he's too. He's a part of a different collective. He will probably be punked and

276
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:19,340
He will be given a reflective orange vest and a plastic broom

277
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,940
If you know what I mean

278
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:23,740
Okay

279
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,060
If there's that colorful is that descriptive enough?

280
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:33,900
What you laying down real quick if we get before you continue with these points you say at a time a truce at the time

281
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,180
The moon was put in place

282
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,630
By who and when roughly the mixed human collective a

283
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,900
Mixed group of human meaning and some reptilian well Draco based

284
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,780
More of the diminutive type the the Imperial Draco do not mix

285
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,580
Only what they're all you hear about people being hybrids of them. That's no sorry

286
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:04,540
You'll you'll be a hybrid of someone that is part of the descended from them, but never the Imperial

287
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,500
They're they're the most high snooty highfalutin

288
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,420
How else would you say?

289
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:17,360
Beings in the universe right even the Elohim will invite you in well these guys will not

290
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,740
So most likely the the least

291
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:28,560
The least the most distant or the closest relative you could be to an Imperial Draco will be a

292
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,480
Hybrid that was probably done between the Kalasch and the feline races

293
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,500
where the feline races see the the

294
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,640
Kalasch

295
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:43,220
invaded the feline in part of one of the Pleiadian and Ceres constellations and

296
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,020
They got such a fight back

297
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,120
Just like the Elohim have been fighting the Draco back

298
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,800
so you see this is how the Draco are when I say Draco Imperial Draco when they come to invade you and

299
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,760
You fight back and you bloody their nose and even threatened to destroy their strike team

300
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:06,320
They don't call in more to kill it to to to beef up their lines to defeat you they stop and they say

301
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:14,720
Wow, what a bunch of noble brave fighters. Hey instead of destroying them. We'd be better if they were on our side

302
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,940
They respect it. They respect the people that

303
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:17,960
Yeah

304
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,700
Exactly. You see that so because of that they kind of work with the

305
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,320
the feline races

306
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:31,940
So from that program you might have some humans that might say that they came from some kind of reptilian hybrid from that point of

307
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,840
You notice I'm being very specific on this

308
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,160
Every time there's

309
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:42,760
You know the concept of sine wave it goes up and down and you know

310
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:48,720
You have a peak and a and a lull this is how the people to talk about the fantasies

311
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,840
Yeah that have been going on in space you you have someone that pops up every couple of years that gives everyone all this hope

312
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,100
that the

313
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,900
dragons will be

314
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,280
The Draco are defeated and humans are liberated. There's no war. That's

315
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:09,200
That's that's like the Jesus nailed to a cross wearing a diaper thing. It doesn't exist, right?

316
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,980
It's fake, but it gets everywhere right everyone worships it

317
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,440
The the that will never happen

318
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:24,880
it in this universe now if you think you can escape the universe and go to another universe completely that

319
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,000
What might be the case where the Draco are defeated? What will happen in the future is

320
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,080
Just like I mentioned the feline races

321
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:39,860
Confronting the dragon races and they found the dragon the red Draco. Let's say found them to be noble and

322
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,180
Respected them. They did the same with the humans and to the point right now

323
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:52,300
We're the human the Elohim are some of the most technologically advanced in the universe at parity if not slightly more than the Draco

324
00:25:53,260 --> 00:26:00,800
What will happen in the future is all of these races the Draco will always remain dominant because they were first here

325
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:06,820
But they were letting more of the instead of being so dark they're letting more of a lighter side

326
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,860
Like for example if you were in the reptilian collective

327
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:17,260
Which is over a million different races and you showed sympathy and empathy for one of your kind or another you were sent to a mental

328
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:17,780
hospital

329
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,640
Because sympathy and empathy is considered as a disease

330
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,670
They are letting more of that into their collective and have been for thousands of years and

331
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:34,510
And word has it that recently in recent in the past few thousand years the Imperial High

332
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:41,050
Command in the Draco also is allowing it because before when it was brought into some of the other races

333
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:45,770
they would destroy those races for having sympathy and empathy and the big milestone here is

334
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:52,970
Few-thousand years ago that the even the highest groups of those who dominate this universe are allowing more of a lighter side

335
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:57,150
To understand what love is what sympathy is what empathy is what peace is?

336
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:00,910
right, but peace is also a bizarre thing because

337
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,710
from a logic perspective

338
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:11,090
When you want peace only peace that means you have to be in a constant state of war with war

339
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,600
Enforcing your rule everywhere in order to have peace

340
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,760
You make war you're making war when you make peace you make peace

341
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,980
But do you have if you ask people or groups why they go to war is to make peace

342
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,460
Not right and when you ask them why they go to peace is to not make war

343
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,880
So to not do something essentially you're fighting that thing that you don't want, right?

344
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,820
So the the concept of peace and war again has not been explored

345
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,980
spiritually philosophically and on and on and on to actually develop a

346
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:53,380
Point where we could say this is a state of condition of neither peace nor war that we will exist in

347
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,540
It's either peace or war and that doesn't work

348
00:27:55,540 --> 00:28:00,400
That's like saying black or white and I hate to tell you but most of everything is gray shades of gray

349
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:05,460
I could show you a shade of gray. That is so light. It appears to be white, but it's still gray

350
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:09,700
I could show you a shade of gray. That is so dark. It appears to be black, but it's still gray

351
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,240
So these are things that could be discussed in the future

352
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:20,420
But again, what will happen the various let's say the huge the main human collective and the main Draco collective

353
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:24,840
They both have the same idea, which is to explore and dominate the universe

354
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:30,280
But they will come to a crossroad and more than a crossroad to a point within each of their groups

355
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:35,100
Well, they will sense that the it's best if everyone worked together

356
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,640
Okay, instead of carving up territory and having truces and armistices, right?

357
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:48,480
You take over here and I take over there right? No, it will be that this is this will not happen till far into the future

358
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:55,180
This the soonest I see it ever beginning to happen is more than a thousand years from now

359
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,860
so I

360
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:02,160
Hope I shared because one of the messages you gave me share some things that I haven't done at all yet

361
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,760
And I think I might have right

362
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:11,420
Yes, and also things that you said off record without allowing me to record. So I appreciate sure. Yeah

363
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,920
No, sure

364
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,900
Since it since the clock is still ticking go ahead and fire something off maybe

365
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,770
You know catalyze the moment, you know what? I mean?

366
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,620
Yeah, I'm just super interested in our real history

367
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,640
You know the real American history that this stuff is not cool

368
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,360
You know like like you were giving me the real reasons why we did why we had the Civil War you tell me

369
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,080
I mean, I don't know what you can it's a trap

370
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,640
America was a trap. What happened was

371
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:46,440
There was a lot of stuff going on in Europe very very harsh stuff, you know, they wanted to exterminate certain people

372
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:53,020
Islam was created to prevent the spread of Christianity through the whole world, which was a good thing by the way

373
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:59,060
Because Christianity promotes ignorance and dominance and really negative stuff believe it or not

374
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,960
That in turned Europe inside out

375
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,380
But by the way, you know all of this, you know

376
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:09,720
How you destroy the all the false narratives is by using definitions, right?

377
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:17,280
I think before we've gone and this J es us character does not exist biblically or historically. It was made up just like

378
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,420
Oswald who shot Kennedy was made up use a Patsy

379
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,180
Yes. Yeah, just like just like Osama bin Laden was made up, right?

380
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,360
Right on and on and on like Einstein was made up and you know

381
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,640
But but he didn't do what they say he did right what here well

382
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,000
He didn't even exist the way that they say like for example, you know, there was no

383
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,600
crucifixion, right

384
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,660
That's pretty obvious whether you know it or not

385
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:45,920
I mean

386
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,400
It's it's really obvious because he was returned the the Roman

387
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:56,080
Governor Pontius Pilate returned him back to the Judeans to use their law. That's that's the key, right? So

388
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,780
There's no, you know, he's the most hate he talked if you read the New Testament

389
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,540
The biblical Christ is the most hateful character in the entire Bible

390
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,680
He hates everyone

391
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:14,540
He's he's like kind of like I'm like I call myself an equal opportunity hater. I just hate everyone

392
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:21,220
I mean, yeah, so, you know until you prove yourself, you know, like we talked about

393
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,540
The polionic code of law, you know, you're guilty until proven innocent, you know

394
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,220
Otherwise, why would they arrest you right? So I'm probable cause or whatever. So anyway

395
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,460
What what America was was a trap?

396
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:38,560
Basically, there was so much it was to blow off steam

397
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:45,900
They created all the corporate states, you know, they're all all the 13 colonies were corporations. You could look it up. They still are

398
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:53,340
They were brought they came over here and then you had a bunch of degenerates known as the founding fathers who wanted to join the

399
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,880
House of Lords and they kept appealing to the king

400
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,840
And he denied them so they mustered up enough money

401
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:07,740
To and they also waited for the smallpox pandemic to to reach a very high

402
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,300
state

403
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:15,100
when they started doing what they were doing and they had help from the French and all the other stuff and remember the

404
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:20,480
Bavarian Illuminati for formalized at the same time it all has very much

405
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,060
You know intertwined together

406
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,660
the George Washington character, which one the the one that

407
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,480
people talk about he died in the first week of the

408
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:37,340
Revolutionary War and they put a look-alike there that had no teeth. That's why when you look at the history

409
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,280
They're like, how are we going to get teeth in this guy's mouth?

410
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,160
Hurry up get some teeth in his mouth, right?

411
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,940
And when he would show up to the Freemasonic meetings and they want to do certain rituals

412
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,840
He flipped out because he never you know, he didn't know anything right? It was he was the look-alike

413
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,800
This is how sad and pathetic the American history is

414
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,080
You're on the brink of a civil war right now because

415
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,320
But not like the original Civil War that they called they was never called the Civil War until the early

416
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,540
Early 20th century. It was called the War of the States

417
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:09,840
And it was the federal versus the states and it was over commerce and taxation

418
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,040
But here, you know, what's interesting?

419
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:19,940
Do you remember a few years ago how they started doing all these protests with BLM and then Tifa and whatever else like that?

420
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:27,900
Property damage. So how they the Rolls-Royce SUV would leave bricks on the side of the road and these all these hip hoppers

421
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:35,540
No, is it true because I use this whenever I go politicking around not not that it'll make a difference

422
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,300
I guess in the grand scheme of things, but I try to put the money where my mouth is

423
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:43,600
Actually, sorry running for it will make more of a difference than getting the job by the way

424
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,660
You will bring more you will running actual the process of running, you know, like the trip. It's not getting there

425
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,180
It's the trip what you do while you're running will make more of a difference

426
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,080
But go ahead. It's true that they're all

427
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,220
George Soros funded and I don't know if you

428
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,680
I'm not gonna say this anymore. But George Soros isn't really who he's played up to be. He is

429
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,820
Most of the facts are correct

430
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,300
I'm not gonna I

431
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,460
No, not publicly

432
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,760
He's just a front man for another front man

433
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,820
You will never remember we started off mid-level management

434
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,659
Yeah, you're not gonna see okay, but look this way if you've seen their picture

435
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:26,880
You heard their voice or no or heard their name. They have no power

436
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,020
They are a representative

437
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,320
Just like for example, if you watch a Tom Cruise movie

438
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,620
Tom Cruise is not who he says he is in the movie

439
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,199
He's some actor

440
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:48,080
So you can watch a Tom Cruise movie where he plays a samurai's in Japan another one where he's a pilot Air Force, right?

441
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:53,440
You can watch him where he's a you know, he's not any of those things

442
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:00,460
Outside of the movie right so outside of whatever was reported to you that this guy is doing is not true

443
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:04,960
But if they tell you Soros is funding within the story. Yes, it is true

444
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,180
But overall you it laying blame which is what they want you to do is not okay, but this is my point

445
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:13,360
You could look this up

446
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,040
But in the early 80 it before 1860

447
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,760
Groups like Antifa and BLM were being sent out throughout the countryside

448
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,860
Raping burning pillaging stealing killing people all over the place to destabilize the country prior to the Civil War

449
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,700
There were black hooded men. They were black. They showed up middle of the night

450
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,340
They would torch barns shoot children women

451
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:40,420
Robbed steel all over the country particularly the southern like the Midland states

452
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:45,040
You could look this up, you know, Ohio, Carolina's, Virginia

453
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:51,280
Pennsylvania there were these marauding bands. They were like softening up the

454
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,660
The culture

455
00:35:54,340 --> 00:36:01,340
Before now they say the attack on Fort Sumter or something started the Civil War. That was like a semi defunct

456
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:07,300
Fort it was a false flag and they said put some drunk a bunch of alcoholics running the place

457
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,060
Just blow up something there and say they were attacked

458
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:17,000
Just like the Vietnam, right? What was they that they even the Pentagon admitted? It was a false flag

459
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,780
They never got attacked by Vietnam, right?

460
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:25,800
Remember the bait. What is it? The whatever the awful talking? Yes Gulf of Tonga they admit

461
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,440
Okay, but this is what they don't admit

462
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,680
Do you know that the Vietnamese sunk a US aircraft carrier? You could look it up

463
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,840
And they sunk it in port. How did they do it?

464
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:41,520
Sponge divers can hold their breath for 20 minutes on average. They got a bunch of sponge

465
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,140
sponge Vietnamese sponge

466
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,600
Divers to go underneath the aircraft carrier and with magnets and some rudimentary waterproof devices of timers

467
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,860
And I mean that it looked like something out of a cartoon

468
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,100
Placed on the hull of the ship

469
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:04,220
Away from the anchorage, you know, which is where the ship is reinforced and blew a big hole in it and sunk

470
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,140
You can look this up

471
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:11,660
the Vietnamese did sink an aircraft care but the reason why it's never made public even though it's what you can find it publicly is

472
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:16,600
Because if you sink someone's aircraft carrier, you saw my battleship, right? It's a lot worse than that

473
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:26,520
It's like a punch in the eye to an imp because what do aircraft carriers represent Imperial dominance, right?

474
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,400
Yes

475
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:34,600
You don't put all of your greatest assets in one basket. There's no such thing as an aircraft carrier

476
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:41,020
They're called carrier groups an aircraft carrier requires about a dozen ships to support it and they're the easiest things to take out

477
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:45,520
there's constantly war games being done with aircraft carrier groups and the

478
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,260
Opposition generals within the what they do in the Navy

479
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,620
They say you'll be team a you get the carrier group and team B

480
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:56,160
You get whatever weapon you want to fight the carrier group, you know within the same US Navy

481
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,800
what do the

482
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,080
team be always pick

483
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,500
they

484
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,780
they go and buy a

485
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,720
$40,000 a whole about a dozen

486
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:13,240
$40,000 speedboats or $100,000 speedboats and a couple of silkworm missiles or granite missiles

487
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,920
and that's it and they take out the carrier group in seven minutes every time and

488
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,020
They've been doing the same exercise since the 1970s and since the 1970s

489
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,720
I'm until about five years ago. Every carrier group has been taken out

490
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:30,520
In less than 15 minutes with just a bunch of regular speed boats

491
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:36,000
Which you can go down to the dock and buy and some silk silkworm or granite missiles

492
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,560
Very simple rudimentary, right?

493
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,660
I'm looking up silkworm missile you had mentioned

494
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,300
Granite before and explained the granite is what they shot into the Pentagon by the way. It's a 500

495
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,760
Well our house or own house who makes them

496
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,100
There's the p700

497
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:03,240
There's a p100 p200. I shouldn't be well, actually the p700 is a 500 kiloton. It's a shipwreck missile

498
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,140
P700 is a 500 kiloton

499
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:11,940
Thermonuclear in it's a ramjet and rocket-powered. It has a rudimentary AI

500
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,240
Satellite driven you can't knock it out with an EMP

501
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:21,540
It flies in a spiral and right before it hits the target. It drops to 8 feet above or 10 feet above the waterline

502
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,220
It's hypersonic

503
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:31,520
As a ceramic reinforced casing it's designed to go through it through the hull of a ship now fortunately

504
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:37,740
Oh, well, the the guys who launched the p700 towards the Pentagon did not have the codes

505
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:42,160
How do we know? Well because you didn't see a nuke go off, right?

506
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:50,020
So and those were absconded the the the missile that they shot into the Pentagon was absconded from the Kursk submarine

507
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,180
Which went to the bottom in the year 2000?

508
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,700
It imploded and

509
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:00,280
It had 21 of these missiles on board and they were all when they raised the Kursk all of them were missing

510
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:06,560
That wasn't that was an inside job with the Putin Putin covered it up all the Russian generals covered it up

511
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,440
They got wealthy off of that. How do you think Putin's worth 250 billion?

512
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:17,950
People don't know that I see Putin's like the richest man on the planet right 200 billion or some plus a lot of people

513
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:23,630
Don't know. I don't know if you heard of this Putin Palace and one of the biggest palatials of states out in Sochi

514
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,490
Well, they'll do that all these guys that do and I was like, look even the American generals

515
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,870
Every single one has a degree in finance, right?

516
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:35,470
He looks serious and once they get into power, it's kind of like what I got a

517
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:39,390
16 or 15 years old. I worked at a convenience store and

518
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:46,050
I wasn't happy working there, but it was you know, you could make you could work anytime was 24 hours, right?

519
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:50,750
So if you want a little extra cash, you could just schedule yourself anytime during the day

520
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:56,490
And this is what the manager tells me. He says it's 350 an hour. This is like 1980, right?

521
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:00,070
It's 350 an hour and all you could steal

522
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:06,570
I was like what the manager is telling me that holy crap. What kind of a institution is this?

523
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:12,070
It's exactly how well the US generals are the worst military commanders ever this planet has ever seen or the US generals

524
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:16,030
This is very well known established fact and all the military schools in the world

525
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:20,290
All they do is abscond they they go through the State Department

526
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:26,610
They have what's called the commercial program and how many how many stockpile numbers can we change and sell these things to whoever?

527
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:31,870
I'm serious. This is this is the condition that your country is and I go to the military

528
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:38,470
This is what I'm telling you is very well known in mid mid-level and upper management in the military

529
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,210
The common people know nothing about this

530
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:45,010
Also, you could be in the military know nothing about this

531
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:50,770
But we are colonel and above or colonel a major or whatever. They all know this and they all want to get in on it

532
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,170
I know this is pretty bad, right?

533
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:57,810
Okay, Isis when Isis came out in 2014 all those brand-new Toyota's

534
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:05,730
They made sure that they got the Toyota's from a plant in Texas because the plant in Texas fits them with the bigger radiators

535
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:09,570
So they have better cooling capability for running in the desert, right?

536
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:15,450
So all the people that had like, you know, two brain cells to rub together called up Toyota and said hey

537
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,730
We're watching TV and there's thousands of brand-new Toyota's. Why did you give?

538
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:25,810
Isis these Toyota's, you know, they're supposedly an American enemy. He says we didn't your American State Department put the order in for them

539
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,070
Oh the State Department

540
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,510
Yeah, you the American State Department

541
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,930
This is this is public this is actually

542
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:34,930
Toyota

543
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:35,270
Official

544
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:41,050
Response. I don't how many people are doing anything about it. No because you can't you're an idiot

545
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,990
I mean people are typically moronic

546
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:49,250
Idiots, so this do you see how shocking okay going back to the Civil War?

547
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:51,730
Yes, it was not a Civil War

548
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:54,470
Basically what happened as the u.s. Was growing

549
00:42:55,290 --> 00:43:02,190
It was commercial. You know this what you call the 13 colonies or the states or corporations are known as plantations

550
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:07,830
Like Rhode Island still known as a plantation. It's on their seal. You go look at it, right plantations. They call it. Yes

551
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:11,170
Yeah, it's on there. So, yeah, there are plenty. Thank you. This is the no

552
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,070
Yeah

553
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,790
Yeah, so what happened was?

554
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,930
Georgia, you know, Alabama, Florida

555
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:23,550
Carolinas and all that they each had collectives. So when they let's say grew cotton

556
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:31,010
Everybody brings their cotton to a cooperative and then it's sold overseas right to England and France where they were had the factories, right?

557
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:36,530
So when you're a factory in England and you want to buy cotton you get a bid of how much cotton you want to buy

558
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:42,070
And you give it to all the states and you know, Georgia wants $10 a bale South Carolina wants seven

559
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:43,990
Alabama wants five

560
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:47,430
Okay, so guess who you're gonna go with the one who is the cheapest, right?

561
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:51,610
And not only you're gonna buy from the cheapest you're eventually gonna buy all of it

562
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:53,090
Now you have to go to the next one

563
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:59,250
So when Alabama was five and Georgia was seven dollars a bale and Georgia finds out Alabama ain't got no more cotton at five

564
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,150
Dollars a bale. Do you think they're just gonna sell to you for seven now or they're gonna jack their price to ten

565
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,350
Yeah, they know you're gonna buy

566
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:11,010
Yep, and and South Carolina, which was ten dollars a bale. They gave it to ten a year ago

567
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:14,590
You think they're gonna jack it up to 20 now about the same, right?

568
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:18,210
So now all the people that are trying to price things in England their factories like wait a second

569
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:21,270
The cotton prices are crazy. You got to do something about this

570
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,090
Can't have that kind of

571
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:24,970
You know freedom

572
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,990
Right, so they went to

573
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:34,070
Graham Lincoln, he was dying a syphilis. He's been dying a syphilis for like ten years and they said listen jerk off

574
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:38,990
We're gonna back you up. You got the Freemasons and the Knights Templars

575
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:43,790
Oh, here's another thing if you go to Switzerland, you'll find a lot of mansions in the forest

576
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:50,430
It's like you'll be hiking in the forest somewhere in the mountains and there's a clearing and you're like, what the hell is this?

577
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:54,430
It's like castles and met in the middle of nowhere right compounds, right?

578
00:44:55,470 --> 00:45:00,530
So you walk up to one of these outer compounds and you look inside and guess what they have

579
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:06,270
as as their flag in Switzerland the Confederate flag and

580
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:13,050
It's been there for hundreds of years. So where do you think the Confederates got their flag from?

581
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,550
It's a Knight Templar creation

582
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:17,430
right

583
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:19,670
Anyway

584
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:21,090
so

585
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:25,330
So that what they did was they said whatever it takes go to war create a war now

586
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:28,370
There's nobody living in Washington DC. It was a swamp, you know, they

587
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:33,090
This is the the American government started in wall on Wall Street

588
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:39,390
Okay, that's where George Washington was sworn in the look-alike right where you know per se George Washington

589
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:42,490
let's just say then they moved to Philadelphia and

590
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:50,070
They started writing a constitution like it didn't come till 13 or 14 years later when they first wrote it

591
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:52,610
We don't know who wrote it. It was sent to the Vatican for approval

592
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:56,470
Right. It didn't come back for five years

593
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:01,470
And it came back and that's the one that they put it. This is probably you could look this up

594
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:09,250
Also, they knew that when they had election of congressmen and senators they they didn't want them to stay in there very long

595
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:14,590
You could look this up and in the Constitution says if you're going to be a senator you have to be an inhabitant of the

596
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:14,970
state

597
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:21,790
Right to be us to run for Senate you have to be an inhabitant of the state that you want to run for right to

598
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:29,770
The Constitution, but then it says if you want to run again, you cannot be an inhabitant of the state. Oh

599
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:34,590
And that means you can't ever run again because if you're an inhabitant already and you want to run again

600
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:40,270
But you're an inhabitant and you can't be so that's how they put the term limit to one term, but nobody follows this

601
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:43,230
You can look at everything up I'm telling you

602
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:47,810
Promise. Yeah, so that's how they made it a one term. So that's proof

603
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:51,850
Like look I've spoken to constitutional attorneys and I bring up said, you know

604
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:57,710
It's extra Constitution says that does not be misconstrued that any Court of the United States has any power in law or equity

605
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:02,250
You know what I just said that the courts have no power in law or equity

606
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:07,530
So what are they doing? I think a constitutional attorneys are all it doesn't say that and his buddies right? Hold on

607
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:12,030
They don't want to admit it because it was under I don't even know it they don't even know it

608
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,290
So someone tells you they're they're a heart surgeon

609
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:18,170
They don't even know anything about the heart constitutional attorney knows nothing about the Constitution nothing zero

610
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,770
I mean, this is we're living in such a shit show

611
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:27,570
It's it's unbelievable I just showed you how all congressmen and senators have one term limits

612
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:30,330
right and

613
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:34,850
Actually, there was someone who said this publicly a while back to one of the senators when he was campaigning to run again

614
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:35,870
And he stopped his campaign

615
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:41,970
Because he's like, yeah, I already said I want to follow the Constitution and he actually was honorable and he did

616
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:43,170
I think it was in Arkansas

617
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:46,670
Right, so you do have some honest people that come

618
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:50,130
No, no, this is like 70s

619
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:57,690
Yeah, this is when he was he didn't you can't say that that's defamation he said he never inhaled, okay

620
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:04,130
Right, okay, so he's still not inhaling

621
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:09,630
Okay, so that's what's going on basically and after the

622
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:11,750
after the

623
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:16,290
They got whatever they needed done because they terrorized the South for 20 years, you know

624
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:18,410
They the carpetbaggers and all that stuff, right?

625
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:22,210
They kept raping and burn and there were people from all over the world, you know

626
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:27,530
For example, the Russians sent a fleet to help Lincoln. Are you aware of this? You could look it up

627
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:34,370
the Revolutionary War the fleet was sent from Poland or Prussia, but the

628
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:41,510
Lincoln needed help. So the czar the Russian czar sent a fleet. You could look that up. That's public

629
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:44,950
Probably one of the Nikolai. Yeah

630
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:46,970
So

631
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:50,570
So there we go. So what happened after that?

632
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:54,090
Lincoln is finished. We don't need you anymore. I got rid of him

633
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:59,730
You should they they were gonna have him killed but his wife shot him instead. So it's like oh great

634
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:03,170
You know

635
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:10,190
Yeah, but anyway all the witnesses and all that, you know his wife shot him right there because he was you know, anyway

636
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:15,290
You could keep going on and on and on a lot of stories, but it doesn't matter

637
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:20,370
It doesn't matter right at this point. So this is the state that you're in right now

638
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:27,550
So then what Lincoln did he put in a general order 100 and this is which means no more Constitution

639
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:32,150
No more laws. No more Congress. No more Senate the whole country runs under general

640
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:40,010
Rule 100 and no general order 100. Do you ever hear of executive order like the president made an executive order?

641
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:44,550
Oh, yeah. Okay, that's an executive order. That's fine. They can do whatever they want

642
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:52,090
That's for the executive branch and worker and employees of the government. So people apply that to themselves. I

643
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:56,730
Don't care what executive order that I'm not an employee or anything like yeah, they can make executive orders

644
00:49:56,730 --> 00:50:02,870
Whatever they want mandates, it's for their workers, but when they do a general order, that's for the whole country

645
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:09,790
So it's called the Lieber code. They got Francis Lieber to write it and it's about it's called the army field manual army manual

646
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:14,890
Army, you know army procedures for the field or army field manual

647
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:21,670
Basically, the whole country's being run by the army. It's either a peaceful inhabitant or a belligerent

648
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:28,250
Okay, so that's what you're running under still right now and also if you further on to

649
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:33,910
1938 Erie Railroad versus Tompkins versus Erie Railroad

650
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:39,110
Was a precedent court case that said that all courts only work by contract

651
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,990
Right. Are you familiar with?

652
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:44,330
Tompkins versus Erie Railroad

653
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:50,710
1938 to it because we studied so much case law, but obviously nothing that ever matters. So Tom, they're not gonna bring that up

654
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:57,310
Tompkins versus Erie Railroad. That's why if you talk to any federal judge in private if you're reviewing a case

655
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:02,310
What the hell you're doing talking to a federal judge in private review in case say is this Erie bound or not?

656
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:06,870
that's the language they use internally Erie bound means it's contract law and

657
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:12,910
Everything they do is Erie bound unless it goes under the field manual, which it's a belligerent

658
00:51:15,110 --> 00:51:21,990
And you know how doctors have billing codes right for insurance. Well, every case number is a yeah every case number

659
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:28,510
Traffic ticket whatever through the what they call the justice system is a billing code through the Chris system

660
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:32,530
Which is the Dallas Federal Reserve. It's the criminal registry

661
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:34,150
investment system

662
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:37,750
It's all the cases go through there and they're

663
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,730
underwritten by fidelity insurance

664
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:48,770
With why are we getting into such details doesn't matter, right? Yeah, so this is the result of the Civil War

665
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:58,520
Federal Reserve is a foreign bank, right? You know that with private shareholders. Oh, you know that the Federal Reserve

666
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,900
not even the shareholders the

667
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,440
Officials on the board have much higher security clearance than the president does

668
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:12,500
Regarding anything. What would you label that? Like what do you call that level of security clearance? Is it majestic? Is that just hype?

669
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:18,060
No. Yeah. Well, they do have different categories and it changes from group to group like the the most client

670
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:21,240
Okay, you're ready for this. This has not been ever said before, please

671
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:29,660
Hard to look up but but true the heart the highest security group within government is

672
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,020
The DOE Department of Energy

673
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:40,540
They have the highest most classified, it's not the CIA. It's not the FBI. It's not the

674
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:44,740
Military, it's the DOE Department of Energy now let your mind run free

675
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,320
What is Department of Energy do?

676
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:54,120
Think about it all the free all the nuclear all the space stuff

677
00:52:54,120 --> 00:53:01,740
Earth protect, you know, there's a protection system a big, you know rail guns and energy guns to protect the earth, right?

678
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:09,420
Who do you think runs that? Okay. Okay when nukes are moved around nuclear materials moved by the OST the Office of Special Transportation

679
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:15,240
That's why on 9-11 you had a bunch of OST inspectors there. They even got caught on cameras

680
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,600
Where are you from something the OST?

681
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:19,920
What do you do and you hear the nuclear alarm because when the first building went down?

682
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,920
The nuclear alarm went off because they disbanded all the alarms that day

683
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:25,800
so anyway

684
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:30,540
The people are so stupid. I know people that were breathing in the air

685
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,660
Which is radioactive and they had melanomas had a read their nose removed

686
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:39,260
They had cancers and they still as there's nuclear just I don't know man. The doctor didn't say the you know, I was like

687
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:40,040
Oh my gosh

688
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,500
You know

689
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:44,720
They the the coroner's report by the way for 9-11

690
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:51,420
For all the people who died in the buildings everyone got a letter. It was vaporization. They were vaporized

691
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,040
And they changed it

692
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,440
Although the widows are all the close family

693
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:04,140
Everyone got five million dollars and had a had a sign an NDA that was about as thick as a telephone book

694
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:08,860
Great. I don't mean to interrupt you said it all over again because it cut off for some strange reasons say that

695
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:09,120
Oh

696
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,140
Well the coroner when he did the coroner's report on

697
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:20,320
9-11 everyone that died in the buildings was class was written down on the coroner's report. They were vaporized

698
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:28,100
The coroner knew or in the vaporized it cut out and the second was that all the close family members when they agreed to sign an

699
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:28,600
NDA

700
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,480
Non-disclosure agreement. They all got a check for five million

701
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,660
All the way that's where the widows are not then the one widow

702
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:41,480
Well, there's a few widows that didn't want to take the five million and got into Obama's face she died in a plane crash

703
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:50,740
Or a heart attack or cancer or whatever and there was a lot of other weird stuff going on in New York that day

704
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:55,260
and when the people saw the weird stuff they went to the police ha ha and

705
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,980
They filed a report and when you file a report with the police to get your address social security number

706
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:01,940
They know everything about you all those

707
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:08,320
250 it's more like 400 people that filed police reports on strange things that they saw died within two years

708
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,100
heart attacks car accidents

709
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,080
home invasions on and on and on and on

710
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,660
So you never want to go to?

711
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,880
You never want to snitch. Yeah, I didn't see nothing

712
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,420
They if they ask any authority asked you what you saw I said, I didn't see nothing

713
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,440
Right or your life is in danger

714
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:30,220
All right on and on and on because a lot of the weird stuff

715
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:35,720
It's really bizarre that had to happen for for the nukes to work, but that's another another

716
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:43,120
Topic another story, but I like leaning on 9-eleven because that is an event that you know how they have the Patriots

717
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,360
I'm sure you should never forget

718
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:48,360
You should never forget that you should never forget Pearl Harbor

719
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,460
Right that you know the chips are chained together

720
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:56,500
You know those ships that went under in Pearl Harbor that men were alive for a month knocking

721
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:00,320
SOS and the they'd have Navy SEALs that they were called frogmen at the time

722
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:04,080
They said we want to go get those men and their higher commences you go

723
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,420
Go near that ship to save those guys, and you'll be shot on sight

724
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:14,320
Right so don't forget pro. I don't forget the Civil War don't forget the Revolution really what it was about

725
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,140
Okay, the other thing about the Revolutionary War the history of the country

726
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:22,280
Was a King George he made a decree the proclamation

727
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,000
that

728
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,040
in 1772 or

729
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,840
1770 or 1773 don't hold me on the year

730
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:36,210
That all the colonists are to respect indigenous people you are not to invade them you're not to take their land oh

731
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,780
my gosh, oh

732
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,060
my gosh

733
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Right well

734
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:51,020
Do you right so what did what did you know one of the nicknames for George Washington was village burner and child killer right no

735
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:51,740
Yeah

736
00:56:54,440 --> 00:57:00,020
Now the whiskey rebellion was not a whiskey rebellion at all those the people that he George Washington's group

737
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:02,600
Promised that they were gonna pay for fighting and they never did

738
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:07,520
The same thing just like the tent villages that were set up in front of Washington DC

739
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,000
after World War one and

740
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,060
MacArthur and a couple other guys went in there and shot and gassed all the families and people asking for their pay from World

741
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:19,360
War one he could look that up tent city, Washington DC

742
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,240
1920 or whatever

743
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:27,340
And MacArthur went in there with rifles and poison gas. It was like 900 families

744
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:30,360
They wanted they just wanted their pay that they were promised

745
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:35,920
You look this up happened like 1920 or I don't know whatever

746
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:44,440
Yeah, so it's pretty nasty, it's all it's just unbelievable. You know talk about an 800 pound gorilla in the room in this country

747
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,740
It's not a Dutch state 800 pound gorilla

748
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:52,940
It's a 3,000 pound elephant and a hundred and fifty foot long blue whale in the room, and you still don't see it

749
00:57:57,710 --> 00:58:00,750
You know here's the thing. Let's go back to 9-eleven

750
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:06,590
How many 9-eleven truthers are out there and writing books on bullshit like space weapons and high end yeah?

751
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:11,550
There are high-energy weapons for sure and all this other bullshit and explosions and all the stuff

752
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:17,530
What's that? I always hear John Lear saying it was a do a DEW

753
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:22,030
Yeah, I don't know John Lear John Lear. He worked for the company

754
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:27,950
Wants to work for the company CIA you know you never for life, right

755
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:30,030
So

756
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:35,570
Yeah, it's kind of tiring. You know I can't spend more than five minutes watching anything online

757
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:39,550
Maybe ten minutes if I'm doing something else on my hands are dirty. I can't go hit the button

758
00:58:40,170 --> 00:58:43,170
It's really sad here. Here's an here

759
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:48,850
I'm gonna say something that was written 500 years ago when the printing press was mass-produced and

760
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:55,750
People could have stuff printed anywhere because before that a printing press whoo. That's such a big thing

761
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:58,430
You know you printed one page and passed it around right?

762
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:04,330
Well, they started manufacturing printing presses and made you printing material cheap. You know what the comment was

763
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:10,610
All this gossip and trash that people talk about it's now going to be mass-produced and handed to everyone

764
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:13,350
So what does the internet do?

765
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:20,750
All this trash and gossip and mind control and psyops that are right now has the opportunity to reach everyone on their devices

766
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:24,210
It's a giant re-education camp

767
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:28,430
Yes, it's about wasting your time

768
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:33,870
That's why it's you know people say life is too short. I think life is too long

769
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:38,790
You only need like 10 or 15 20 years on this stinking rock right now the way it is

770
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:42,430
Why do you want to live to like 50 60 70 or 80? That's stupid

771
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:45,870
The ink gonna make a change

772
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:53,690
Ain't got it because it's already done deal. What what needs to happen is the entire status of the planet needs to change

773
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:57,070
You see because you're in a just you're in a status right now. You're in limbo

774
00:59:57,970 --> 00:59:58,370
so

775
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:02,490
so, you know, there are humans that live millions of years, you know human types and

776
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:08,190
Even if you read the ancient texts, it was very common people to live up to a thousand or more

777
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:09,830
very common

778
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:17,570
so, you know, it would be very different than you know, imagine going to like a street market and you want to buy a rug

779
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:22,310
That's handmade and you're negotiating with the price on the guy and the guy's like come on, man

780
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:23,990
It took me 90 years to weave this

781
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:29,350
Right because he lives to a thousand right? That would be a totally different world, wouldn't it?

782
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:35,850
You see yeah, that's what's coming by the way, that's one thing I didn't say when the Alahim take charge

783
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:39,550
Entropy and aging and all this stuff will be reversed

784
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:43,910
So let's say you hear in the news. The guy was a hundred years old and he died

785
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,110
That would be like hearing a two-year-old died

786
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:53,890
You'll be going through puberty at 35 or 40

787
01:00:56,810 --> 01:01:04,210
Yeah, okay, that's fine. Yeah, I I don't I don't give up look I always say if it came in a can I'd be eating it right now

788
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:07,330
Anyway, that's pretty lascivious

789
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:16,990
Okay, well Greek is it okay it my wife wants to cook dinner is it okay if we pick up tomorrow and maybe early

790
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:19,410
Okay

791
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:24,190
Any I know you're two hours behind me. So it's for almost four o'clock where you are

792
01:01:24,190 --> 01:01:29,410
Is it? Okay, if you just look anytime you call me tomorrow. Yeah, I hope you I hope this was fruitful for you

793
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:34,310
I know I like jumping over the place because everything's connected wife's right here. Yeah. Yeah. Hey wife

794
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:39,970
I just uh, if we could just do it earlier in the day, I

795
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:46,790
Will call her Josie. Okay, we'll call it. Okay. Yeah, is it? Okay, Josie not oh, she wants to prep dinner

796
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,490
It can't wait. No, you go for it

797
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:52,630
And this is recorded you have permission to put it anywhere you want by the way or just hold it for yourself

798
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:57,990
Okay, sounds good if we did if you want to do if you wanted to redo it

799
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:01,110
You could take notes on it and ask me questions

800
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:05,170
We could compact it down and keep it less less squirrely ages of notes

801
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:11,930
I took today that I'd love I really would like to do a part two tomorrow. Do you have it? Let's do it tomorrow

802
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:13,850
Tomorrow would be later

803
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:17,110
Instead like three hours from now would be best

804
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:23,830
For tomorrow because I'll be out and about as in three hours later than today right now for you

805
01:02:23,830 --> 01:02:26,530
