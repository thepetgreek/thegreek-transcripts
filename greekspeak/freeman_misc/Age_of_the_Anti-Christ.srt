2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,800
Hello and welcome to the Free Zone.

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,120
Well, it has been one wild ride as we have all been expecting.

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,320
But we need to know, are we communicating?

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,440
I mean, who wrote your operating system?

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,440
Is your head in a vacuum?

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,560
We're going to find out as we speak with a natural philosopher today.

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,520
I call them that because if I ever felt like I was talking to someone from the future,

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,080
it's while talking with the Greek.

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,760
And so, after all of the shenanigans that we've been witnessing,

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,240
I could think of no one better to come and really give us a heads-up view

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,640
of our world as it is, as it has been, and what it will be.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,360
So, please welcome to the show The Greek.

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,440
It's great to have you here with us.

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,400
Oh, thank you, Freeman. It's, I guess, good to be back.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,480
Any kind of venue that we could come out and display or do a good public report

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,800
is always advantageous for the audience.

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,520
So, again, thanks for thinking of me.

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,320
Yeah, we are hungry for the knowledge we are.

20
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,320
And we're looking at a world in chaos.

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,360
We're seeing everybody function on the programming inside of their operating system.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,440
They don't even know that it's happening.

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,520
They don't know where this operating system came from.

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,880
Now, in February, nine months ago, we were speaking.

25
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,480
And you said, your vote is your vow to accept the electors' choice.

26
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,560
And I think we should open the show with that in that,

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,200
nine months ago, you said this. And now, here we are with liberals in the streets

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,680
and bloody, violent riots trying to flip the vote.

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,080
And it's blowing my mind, honestly.

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,360
I didn't think that the Hillary supporters would be out beating up people in the streets.

31
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,600
I thought, but what I do know is that what they, the they want is chaos.

32
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,600
So, let's look at the operating system that would develop into this idea that

33
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,920
you would write in the streets over this.

34
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,400
And the legal and lawful ways that this is also wrong.

35
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,040
Take it from whoever you want.

36
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,800
Sure. Let's look at it real simply.

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,840
What is possible, pretty much anything is possible.

38
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,920
And who can ponder all the possibilities?

39
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,640
So, you have to be a good observer to see what's happening.

40
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,800
And what is happening is possible because it's happening.

41
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,800
So, you know, when you talk about the operating system, you know,

42
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,480
let's use the computer as a metaphor.

43
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,520
You have an operating system, then you have programs, and then you have files.

44
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,480
Most people are actually trying to process files and programs, and they have no operating system.

45
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,400
And what I mean about that is your operating system, this might sound dogmatic now, comes from your God,

46
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,960
comes from your deity, someone you look up to.

47
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,320
Like if you're three years old and you're formative years, your parents are your God.

48
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,080
So, what I mean by God is a higher authority, not only in concept but in actual power,

49
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,960
like the unseen world, rules, the seen world, you know, shadow government, anyone, anyway.

50
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:26,080
So, what we're talking about here is things to come might seem fascinating to people,

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,280
or how things work because they really just haven't thought it out,

52
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,440
or they don't have the convention to access this way of thinking or seeing things,

53
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,400
because the operating system comes from your deity and they don't acknowledge that.

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,360
For example, every country has a patron or patron deity in the Western world.

55
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,400
Most of the countries have adopted the revived goddess religion.

56
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,440
And when I say operating system, it's where you get your law, not traffic law or tax law,

57
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,560
but when you eat what you wear, how you operate in business, how you raise a family,

58
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,040
how you keep time, that comes from your God.

59
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,320
And they have up the Western world has incorporated the revived goddess religion,

60
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:13,440
aka known as Justicia or Justice, Statue of a Woman Holding Scales Blindfolded and such.

61
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,680
Right, you'll see Statues. She's also known as Columbia, Britannia, you know,

62
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,400
a lot of other aspects of, you know, let's say smaller societies have their different gods,

63
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,760
right, they've revived various different gods and that's where they get their law form from.

64
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,040
Now, the interesting thing about that is if you are atheistic in any capacity,

65
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,000
you still cannot escape this. Like, for example, discussing, you know, having this discussion

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
with an atheist, they'll say, well, Greek or Freemony, I don't believe in any God.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,800
Well, that's really simple. You just ask them, do you then follow or believe in the laws of the state?

68
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,520
And they almost always say, yes, well, then there's your God in April 1st is your holiday.

69
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,160
So you see, this is the operating system and it's in place and no one is paying attention to it,

70
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,600
but it doesn't mean that they're not subject to it, right? Let's go back to the Justice aspect.

71
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,520
How many times have you heard in terms of law form? Let's, in this case, it would be legal form.

72
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,400
You'll have to be brought to justice. You serve justice as a miscarriage of justice,

73
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,280
right, and all of these things. So they're using this in front of you. They have the iconography

74
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,080
and statuary to prove it. Now, their agents and the priesthood and the entitled classes that rule

75
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,320
the rest of the people, guess what? They don't even know it in most cases. They are just following along.

76
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:41,120
So tie that into what's going on. I think you mentioned what the month is called February.

77
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,880
We discussed about what voting actually means. It means to vow that you are supporting the system

78
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,680
and whatever electorate body decides to elect. You are all for it. I'm with you guys.

79
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,280
And this is what's going on, let's say regarding the condition of what is possible.

80
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:06,480
I guess there's a protest against the electorate. But so these are the possibilities that cannot be

81
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,400
thought of but observed and maybe described. So that could tie into the rest of the discussion

82
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,240
because it's not very narrow and linear. So what do you think? Do you want to maybe perhaps go down

83
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,720
the path of the political path or just still maybe the general aspect of what the operating system is?

84
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,640
I'm really happy to hear your general views of things because I swear that you are from the future

85
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:37,280
Greek. So I think that you're you are the master of the obvious that no one ever sees.

86
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,840
Oh, thank you. I want to share that with with my audience because you point out things that are

87
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,720
just right in front of our phases and we never stop to think about them. So I really want to

88
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,840
follow your lead. Okay, well, you know, I have like a stock way of speaking and typically it's

89
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:04,080
metaphorically, you know, the last thing for mankind to discover is what's obvious, right?

90
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,280
And the obvious is just what's right in front of you. Let's not be hypocritical. I mean, people want to go

91
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:16,080
out and to far away places and far away thinking to discover things but typically their shallow thinking

92
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,320
gets them diving off into the deep end, right? So if you're going to be shallow about things, you know,

93
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:28,400
take care of business and what's just five feet around you first, you know, and the stock way of

94
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,320
starting off on anything like this is, you know, people don't even know what day it is. Now what I mean

95
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,360
by that, it sounds kind of bizarre whether you care or not, it's the concept of time. You know, you've

96
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,720
heard in the new age movement a lot of loosely thinking people say, well, there's no such thing as time.

97
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,920
Well, that's correct in a sense because time is nothing other than the recordation and memorialization

98
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,720
of events. So when you hear about time travel, you're not really traveling in time. You're either

99
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:04,080
going to past or future events and time is the recordation of such. So currently, if you ask anyone

100
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,640
what day it is, they're actually not giving you the day, they're giving you the date, they're giving

101
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:14,000
you something off of what I loosely call the Pope's work schedule, which is anything between January

102
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,440
through December, Monday through Friday. And they usually have this thing called hours and minutes,

103
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,600
which is what I call the wind up toy known as the clock. So typically, you know, just to refresh people,

104
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,160
if you don't even know what day it is, how are you going to navigate because time is important for

105
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,800
navigation. You know, if you're moving 20 miles per hour for one hour, that you've covered 20 miles,

106
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,120
right? Anyone that navigates or plots things understands time is important. How are you going to

107
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:46,080
navigate the waters of the universe, social aspects and even any cosmological aspect if you don't

108
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,360
know how to reckon time? For example, if you observe a what's called a birthday or anniversary

109
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:58,080
any year, you'll notice that it's a different day of the year every year, right? If you look at what

110
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,680
day it is today, folks, you look last year and look at next year, it's a few days off. So what day is it?

111
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,880
It's none of it. It's the Pope's work schedule, meaning it is nothing more than is if you worked at

112
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,840
a corporate headquarters and they gave you a chart with different color days and this is when you work.

113
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:20,960
So no one really knows what day it is. And in that day aspect is not about being usurped by

114
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:27,520
a schedule, but actually accessing information that anyone can access without buying anything or having

115
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,960
an allegiance or subscribing. So this convention of what's called the Gregorian calendar that's been

116
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:42,240
accepted by all society is very much considered, you know, the state of society on the planet has been

117
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:49,680
being pretty pissed poor if you can't navigate using any good timekeeping. And let me just throw in a

118
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,720
quick thing. This is kind of long-winded. See, years ago people settled their debts with the full moon,

119
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,920
which is really the new moon, rises in the east. That's why today you still get a moonfully bill,

120
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,520
don't you? Don't they give you a moonfully bill? It's called moonfully, but you see the moon rules the

121
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:16,800
month. And the day starts at high noon, right? Not at midnight. If you remember banking before the

122
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:24,000
electronic convention, if you'd made a deposit afternoon, it was considered the next day in the wild west

123
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,880
type of society in the US, they had court in the morning and they executed sentence the next day.

124
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:38,240
They hung you when? High noon. So we're having the day beginning at noon. And actually the time-keeping

125
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,760
conventions of the world, which would be Greenwich and the other one I believe is in Colorado Springs,

126
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,200
in Naval Observatory. If you look up, this was, I'm not sure if it's still there, but on their website,

127
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:58,240
Julian Calendar Day, they clearly tell you that the day starts at solar noon, but for scientific

128
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:05,680
purposes, I mean, it starts at high noon for scientific and astronomical purposes, but for the people

129
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,880
at civil midnight. That's like how it's kind of a put down sort of how like the dictionaries were

130
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,440
assembled 200 years ago, they weren't sure how to define words. When you looked up the word oats,

131
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,080
it said what they feed horses in England, but the staple of people in Scotland. So this is being

132
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:30,880
put in front of you and no one is really noticing that there's a shifting of time, meaning the way

133
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,240
you record time. Time doesn't shift because the events are the events. It's just that you cannot

134
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,880
record it. So now if you don't have a way of memorializing time, how are you going to memorialize

135
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:49,360
or record events? Very loosely. So that's why you have a lot of this false hope in things. Let's go,

136
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,840
keeping it back to the conversation, tying it back to the recent election in the US.

137
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,640
You have a character now under the covenant that I live by, by the way,

138
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:05,200
any, I don't speak poorly of the leader of any people because they're put there by divine right,

139
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:12,320
believe it or not. This is where the Asians are correct. But you have a character here who is,

140
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,200
let's say, allegedly the leader of the American society, now North American known as the United States

141
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,840
of America, what made him so popular is a very, very loose statement. Let's make America great again.

142
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,320
And that's all that it took. There's no understanding of that. What do you mean by that?

143
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,760
Just getting people riled up about it, you see? And if you want to understand that concept a little

144
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,920
more, even though this is perhaps a one hour or a one hour or two hour recording,

145
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:45,280
anyone is interested a little bit more on what's called this crowd mentality. I recommend them to

146
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:55,680
consider Gustav LeBond's The Crowd. It's on book form, ebook form, audio book form, and start delving

147
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,280
into how the crowd mentality works. And you will see it from a social perspective, how this man

148
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:07,920
really compiled something really well in the 1895, I believe. And that will give you an understanding on that.

149
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,880
But again, just to go back to maybe leading this conversation, people still have not realized that

150
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:22,080
they're not able to memorialize timekeeping and will awful timekeeping. Other things are within

151
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:28,080
their physical reality. You know, you ever notice how heat rises and cold descends, but in all biological

152
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,360
systems, the cold rises and the heat descends, like a cool feat and cool head and warm feet.

153
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:40,000
Or when you go up into the sky, it's cold and down in the valley, it's hot. All biological systems have

154
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,800
opposite movement. Why aren't people demanding from their technicians and engineers to design

155
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,920
artificial heating equipment to do that? So right now they're just passively ignorant of this

156
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,280
fact. And they have air conditioning and heating in their cars, homes, and boats and places that give

157
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:04,000
them a hot head and cold feet and no one is paying any attention. You see, you know, the other stock thing

158
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,800
is going back to their deity. Now most people when you bring that up, you know, they're God, they think

159
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,400
of religion and you have the major religions, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and such and

160
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:20,960
all the spin-offs. Do you know that none of those religions know or do anything that's in the text

161
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:29,200
that they alleged to subscribe to? Yes. At all. And I'm not talking about taking it out of context and

162
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,840
it's really easy to start a religion. Like for example, if you look at the, a lot of the Catholic

163
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,440
Christian memes, you know, if you want to start a subgroup in there, it's very simple. Get a

164
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,480
chocolate chip recipe, bake a cookie, bake a set of cookies. And if one of them looks like what's

165
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,600
called the Queen of Heaven, you tell everyone and in about a month, you'll have a thousand people

166
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,680
following you asking you about how that cookie crumbled, right? So this is very, very simple. I mean,

167
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,520
people again, the crowd mentality, but going back to no one knows or does anything that's in the text

168
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:09,920
that they alleged to subscribe to, meaning in context. And here's the thing, if these texts are

169
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,320
divinely inspired and you are told that no one can understand them or that's your interpretation

170
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,360
indirectly what people are saying is the gods are acting in futility. And I'll tell you for sure

171
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,960
the gods do not act in futility. They might have an IQ of two million and they're giving you baby

172
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,320
talk and you still can't understand it, but that message is not futile. Now here, just to lay

173
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,000
something out. A lot of times I refer to the what's called the biblical text and that's very difficult

174
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,160
to discuss because guess what? All of the versions that you have and all the languages have been

175
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,080
translated in based on King James or other things is not a translation. It is a version. There's

176
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:54,560
over 27,000 critical mistakes in that document. It's irrelevant in terms of getting the proper

177
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,280
message. Now what you're getting is a general outline of the story, but you will be it is

178
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:03,600
wrought with error. So you're going to have to go back to the languages of preservation. Sorry,

179
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,600
from that point of view, the same goes with any of the texts in any other language. These texts

180
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,520
are preserved in their original languages and it's not going to be given to you on a silver platter.

181
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,960
You're going to have to do the work. Now when you look at these religions as being the

182
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:29,440
let's say or as I stated earlier, your god is your law form and such.

183
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,640
And you have now debased it and are going by tradition. For example, Christmas and Easter

184
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,960
bunny and all these other things are not in the biblical text, but the majority is what

185
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:49,760
Christianity is defined. Public prayer and Islam, mosques and other things about women covering

186
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:56,160
their bodies and all that is not in the Quran. But they still do it. So these traditions or

187
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,040
let's go back to Buddhism, they have a little statue or Hinduism, you have certain practices.

188
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:07,600
You will not find that in the Rig Vitas or any of the writings either. So these cultural

189
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:15,840
traditions, behaviors that the people engage in also have a deity or an entity behind them.

190
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:23,520
But it is not the one that they think. So they've been kind of winked. So again, we have many,

191
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,600
many layers. Let's go back to the political aspect with this selection. How many times have you

192
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,840
heard of what's called the shadow government? I believe there was even a public speech warning by

193
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,160
Kennedy regarding that. And even Christ. Yeah, and the WikiLeaks. And actually, Woodrow Wilson had

194
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,960
alluded to that about there's a conspiracy so great no man can go against it or something like that

195
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,520
in paraphrasing. There is another entity behind that. So we're talking about a world of the unseen.

196
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,800
Now what I mean by that, it just hasn't been properly identified just like years ago if people

197
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,160
used hot coal to cool to heat their house and they close the doors and windows, they woke up dead and

198
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,400
they didn't know what killed them. It was the ether they called it. But later on they discovered

199
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,560
there's something called carbon monoxide and they had a carbon monoxide detector and now you know

200
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,760
not to do that because you can specifically identify the agent that brought that situation on.

201
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,360
Currently, humanity is in a state where they cannot specifically identify the agents that

202
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,760
bring about their condition, aka known as the gods or unseen beings. Yes, and I'm not really crazy

203
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,400
thinking that I have friends that you can't see. This is just based on what has been memorialized.

204
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:40,160
Now if you memorialized in texts and information we can access, meaning if you think like most people

205
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,640
that everything came into creation less than a hundred years ago and everyone that wrote anything

206
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,280
prior to you regarding the gods is an idiot or you don't have to believe in it, you are not

207
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,560
examining information that is available to you to explain many of the things that are going on.

208
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:04,880
Without a doubt, you know exactly what you're saying it's all social norms and none of it

209
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:14,000
is the documented evidence which again they're only allowed versions and then with this

210
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,680
traditional standpoint and the versions that they're dealing with and I've seen you know,

211
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:25,360
Christians that disagree with interpretations and get thrown out of their church or whatever

212
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:32,560
you know back and forth because of interpretation and we're looking at a situation where they

213
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:39,920
want to rile up the mob and all the fanatics are out there screaming kill all the fanatics.

214
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:46,240
So, right. Well here's the thing you brought up church and all of these institutions, these temples.

215
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:53,600
They are just revived a post-flood let's say paganism like the word church comes from Cirque

216
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,320
it actually Latin word for circus the three ring Circus or what's called the Trinity they won't

217
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,520
find that in the text but they memorialize that now let's just get down and dirty about it which is

218
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:11,760
actually true and clean is that Christianity was started pretty much very much how 9/11 conspiracy

219
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,960
movement was started. No one really knew how those buildings came down in public and mass groups

220
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:23,280
so they they have all of these people saying oh it was thermite oh it was some space weapon or

221
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,520
whatever but actually what brought them down is quite simple device and it's not what people think

222
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,920
because they don't understand the structure of the building. Now what was going on around the first

223
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:37,520
century there was a lot of incredible events happening and there was a lot of a rumor mill that was

224
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:45,680
going and the events were usurped by the typically a fellow named Simon Magus Simon Simon the

225
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:52,640
magician and he was quite popular and quite wealthy like a Houdini or a David Copperfield with the

226
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,800
budget of let's say Bill Gates or George Soros right and he was at that time period and he didn't

227
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:05,680
know what was going on either but he was able to promote for his advantage the frenzy

228
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:12,640
that was going on about the events in the first century then to focus on what he was saying about it

229
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:18,240
right and he was also a Samaritan descent which the Samaritans are very interesting if you look them

230
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,400
up back in the day they had their pagan gods but they also invited let's say scriptual law so

231
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,840
there were a good mishmash of everything and also when you look at the history of Simon Magus you have

232
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,720
the offshoots of what's called nosticism right and all these other aspects of Christianity but if

233
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,680
anyone studies the biblical text you'll see that everything that they're doing not some of what

234
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,240
Christianity is doing but everything Christianity is doing is either on the abominations list or the

235
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,160
don't do list of the biblical text now the problem with discussing this like this and not making

236
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:57,360
this a quote unquote religious discussion is I want to just make a comment there's quite a few people

237
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,960
unstudied and unfamiliar with the text that come out and say it was a different god of the new testament

238
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,200
than the Old Testament right many times have you heard that well the thing that they miss out

239
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:16,400
on that the so-called god of the new and Old Testament is the same one and it's not what people think

240
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,960
it is the Christ himself in the text now this is not as nothing to do with what you believe in

241
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,600
because the Christ was god himself manifest in according to the text so one of the main things that

242
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,720
they bring up is how in the Old Testament the Israelites were told to go and kill every man,

243
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,600
woman, and child in certain cities before they occupied the land and in the New Testament it's

244
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,560
all about love and peace and all this and there couldn't be anything further from the truth they

245
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:48,800
have not studied the text now I tell people in passing and they find it very shocking but who

246
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:55,120
is the most hateful character in the biblical text pause they can't answer it's the Christ how do

247
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,160
you know well you just read the text he'll say things like think not I brought here to bring peace

248
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:05,600
I came to divide with the sword I will bring terror amongst you oh another thing that's stated in

249
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,000
in the in the in what's called the New Testament is that you've been better off been at Sodom and

250
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,840
Gomorrah than what's going to come upon your village or city or how about this one um why do you

251
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,640
speak to the people in parable in riddle it's the truth is not given to them it's given to you

252
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,400
right so you have many of these aspects now what I mean by hateful meaning that hateful of the way

253
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,320
that man operates at this point right and even at that point now let's just jump back to the Old

254
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,640
Testament remember I just mentioned that they were told to go kill every man, woman, and child

255
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,360
in animals as well so it can't be the same god right because they have this concept and I just

256
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,520
showed that he's not about love and peace well why why did they tell the Israelites to go in and kill

257
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,280
everything and everyone that moved you ever wonder why well it's very clear in the text that they

258
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:59,280
were engaged in pretty abominable acts that are actually represented in parity today hey Freeman

259
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,000
let's go back in time we're gonna walk down an ancient canaanite village you ready I'm gonna let's

260
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,200
uh hold hands and go on a windy walk through let's say ancient canaan right this is we're talking

261
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,160
about the time that the Israelites were told in and go ahead and slaughter everything and everyone so

262
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:20,400
what we're walking down a public square right now and we're looking in one shop and what do we see

263
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,000
well we see a whole bunch of animals tied down donkeys horses sheep chickens and like you're like well

264
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,560
what's that for I said well this is a sex shop you know people like to get off before they go to

265
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,800
you know into the marketplace down the road this is what they do right so you get all these

266
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:40,000
animals possibly knocked up with human sperm oh let's go to the next shop what do you see there

267
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,360
oh I see all these little children and cages what's that for oh well you'll see down at the end

268
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,640
of the square there you'll see a seated statue it's made of bronze and it's a glowing red hot

269
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,160
and people are told to make a wish a prosperity by placing a child in its lap and searing it alive

270
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,880
but it's kind of hard to do business when you hear children being burned alive so they ring bells

271
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,040
you know if you've ever heard of a fat red character where a child is placed on his lap and you have

272
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:15,680
bells involved like jingle bells right that's mullick revived mullick now this is the type of society

273
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:22,560
that was operating out and open out in public back then so that these people were unreadable

274
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:30,560
that was so incorporated into their society that they would rather die than let it go and they were

275
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:36,320
accommodated by that now what you have in this modern society how many times have you said have you

276
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:42,400
heard let's say people saying oh we have to preserve Christmas you know the actual thing right

277
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:49,200
you see you see what's going on it is exactly the same society but it's in parity another thing I

278
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,240
bring up is what do cannibals birthdays and dolls have in common right I think I don't know if you

279
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:02,160
brought this up previously but you see these things all tie in together and we can go into what cannibals

280
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,720
birthdays and dolls maybe have in common in the second hour perhaps because that's a little bit of

281
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:15,280
a litany on its own so perhaps all of these things and these misunderstandings something is minor of what

282
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:26,160
religion is and discounting the facts behind it and then having pseudo academics or academics promoting

283
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:31,040
a dichotomy that doesn't exist for example the Old Testament God is different than the New Testament

284
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,840
God is foolishness right and by the way at this point I'll say this publicly I am embarrassed

285
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,840
to be in a room with anyone who has more than an eighth grade conventional education you know

286
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:48,160
for example have you ever seen people drive around in the cars of a bumper sticker my child is an

287
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,640
honor student at this school and my child goes to that school and they're so proud of it sure

288
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,360
well I want to make a bumper sticker that says that the only reason I'd said my child to a public

289
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:04,720
school or university is if I knew there were a complete moron so anyway that is a personal comment

290
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:12,240
on the current system and everyone's idea that everything is propaganda that this is just a tool

291
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:19,520
of indoctrination and is that what you mean by this? Well yeah it's indoctrination but either

292
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,960
accommodating the people like for example there's there's a reason why fast food is so crappy

293
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,760
because people want to be accommodated by fast food but and they don't really care about what the

294
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,680
ingredients are so how are you going to make a profit if you use higher quality ingredients so you

295
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,320
keep it at a minimal high profit because the people don't care it's what you get away with it's

296
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,040
with the market will bear you know here there's something that I've always discussed in the past

297
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:51,120
it's called pranking humankind right now is subject to a cosmic prank and in other words all

298
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,600
of your entitled classes your doctors your attorneys your professors your scientists are pranking

299
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,520
you now what's a prank look it up it means ludicrous trick but the primary prankers are your parents

300
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,920
in most cases meaning like when you're a child you're told about Santa Claus in the tooth fairy

301
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:13,120
or you told about this or that and one of them is like you can't see ghosts either right there's a

302
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,160
boogie man in the closet no you didn't see anything yes you did okay so you're being pranked by your

303
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:23,200
own parents who take the seat of God at that time because you're not aware of any higher authority

304
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,240
even the state as a child and at some point the parents tell you oh you're you're too old for that

305
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,360
right now you can't talk about Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny what's wrong with you right they

306
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,840
never apologize see that's why you have a lot of psychological problems with teenagers

307
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,080
in the western world is because the parents never apologize for all the pranking they did here's

308
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,960
another former pranking the parents yeah they have the steep psychological embedded thing that you

309
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,080
all need to do is apologize for lying to the child now here's the other yeah I was just gonna say

310
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:59,120
that's how Catholics become Satanus well yeah we can get into that no but you know you can't you

311
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:05,200
can't be a Satanus without being a Christian and I see so often that what happens is is that

312
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:12,240
disillusionment when the you know the prank is revealed and they're like they become the complete

313
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:19,520
opposite of what they were you know they're operating but it's but again it's not let's let's hold

314
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:25,280
the pranking thought for a moment Satan is a character that anyone can research he is only dealing

315
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:31,600
with major institutions he doesn't deal with each individual at a time he will in the future

316
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,280
with one individual aka known as the anti-Christ he's the only man in history that Satan will actually

317
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,720
possess all of the other ones are demonic possessions there are trillions of demons you can even

318
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,720
have five thousand demons in in in one person in one man or woman right so they're forget about

319
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,680
the seven billion people there's trillions upon trillions of these of these entities in the spiritual

320
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,600
realm you absolutely believe in deities and demons well it's not a matter of believing in them as

321
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,640
I've looked at what's been memorialized about them and I've found it to be validatable and sound

322
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,400
information and if you want to go that's what belief should be based on if I write you a check

323
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,440
for fifty grand and you call the bank and and there's fifty grand in the account to be transferred

324
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,240
to you for example you can go around telling people you just got fifty grand even though you haven't

325
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,960
yet because everything's in place for it to happen believe should be based on things that are in

326
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:32,160
place that will happen not some obscure abstract insanity that most people are operating on but let's

327
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:38,640
go back to the satanism well you hear a lot of people in these small occulted movements known as

328
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,080
satanists they're really not and they will tell you when they set up like a satanic temple that

329
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,440
who their entity is like for example the temple of set that is not Satan that is an ancient god

330
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:56,400
revived from aegypt for example and there are others various bells or balls or lords satan is in

331
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:03,360
control this this whole entire social construct is his meaning satan doesn't deal with a little

332
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:11,680
satanic temple that is a revived demon as a minor very very minor impure demon satan is in control

333
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,160
of all the governments of the world all the religions of the world all of your sciences all of your

334
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:23,840
entertainment very very subtly you see so to say that catholics leave that to become satanic well is

335
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,280
Catholicism one of the major religions of the world yes right so it is also under the control of

336
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,080
that right it's very easy now satan just means adversary now i want to just we're going to go back

337
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,040
to the pranking hopefully because that's very important i believe in some of the disclosure that

338
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,600
i like to give i didn't mean to derail you because we did cover satan pretty good last time yeah

339
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,880
but actually let's cover one one more thing in there when you read in the book of genesis what would

340
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:57,520
they give you regarding satan and all that is known as a serpent right people they it's been i

341
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:03,200
in iconography statuary and in legend even in film shown as a as an actual animal a snake right

342
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:10,240
now if you actually go read the text in in context you will see that is the name of an individual

343
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,840
that is very and very anthropomorphic have you ever heard of a man or a woman's name called robin

344
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,400
or someone called hawk does that mean that they're a bird no it just happens to be their name so when

345
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:28,560
you go and look at what's in the original language of preservation what is being translated as the

346
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:35,920
serpent is actually someone's name and this is someone that has taken the form anthropomorphically

347
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:43,200
spirit being that is engaging primary man and primary woman let's say right you know so there's

348
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,320
there's an aspect to that that needs to be looked at and i mean we can do 500 hours and not repeat one

349
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:53,520
thing and and give an encyclopedia on this that anyone can access the problem is people just don't

350
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,920
care at this point right but we're going to say it anyway now i want to go back to the pranking

351
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:03,360
and um you are all subject to a prank which is eluticrous trick

352
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:12,640
and uh what i mean by that is that if you try to rationalize a prank you cannot it's purely emotional

353
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,000
and if you ask the prankster why are you pranking me they never give a rational answer but the

354
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,920
ultimate answer is because i can and i feel like it that's why i tell people do you know i'd have a

355
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:29,120
false sense of optimism on this planet if you woke up this morning alive be thankful that you are

356
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,160
because the reality of the violence level of violence spiritual and physical on this earth is

357
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:39,920
not really comprehended by most people i tell people basically be thankful that while you were sleeping

358
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,920
last night wherever you were that no one came through the door of where you were sleeping and rip the

359
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,800
liver out of your body be thankful that didn't happen this is the potential level of violent side

360
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:54,320
everyone is living under right now and if you by the way someone did do that or attempted to do that

361
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,040
to you while you were ripping the liver out of your body if you ask them why are you doing that

362
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:05,280
they say because i feel like it and that is good enough and that's what i mean about the level of

363
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:11,040
pranking on this planet if you talk to any of the entitled classes the doctors the attorneys the

364
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:19,520
leaders of the people the academics and all that they're all working on a particular field of

365
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,840
their specialty but none of them know anything about what's been memorialized about that field in

366
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:29,520
other words there are set memorialized documented rules and how are they are to operate and none of them

367
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,800
know any of these rules are very few of them operate along them at all the giving an example like

368
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,200
what's called law enforcement you know there is no law enforcement that knows any law they're being

369
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:45,600
directed by the attorney general's office to do things right for example if you get pulled over

370
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,520
what's called pulled over with the flashing lights and the issue with ticket or whatever it

371
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,000
doesn't matter if they're a sheriff a local police or highway patrol or whatever do you know that in

372
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,520
order for them to properly be able to do that they have to have what's called d_o_t_ certification

373
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,200
and they the actual ticket itself has to be signed by the director of the department transportation in

374
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,320
federal office and how many of them do you think have to apartment transportation certification

375
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:17,120
not one and it doesn't matter because the rest of society will say if you tell an acquaintance a friend

376
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:22,160
a family member what happens is well you shouldn't have been speeding well you shouldn't have done that

377
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,720
that's what happens here i'm like but it's not according to the rules but does it well that's that's

378
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:32,960
the society we live in this is how people react so they're subject to the prank and also there's

379
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,320
a sense of voluntary like is him in it who we have has to be voluntary but most people don't know

380
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,760
what they're volunteering in the group of prankster will say here would you like to sit

381
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,880
and uh... you say yes and now he's placed a thumbtack on the seat you sit on it and get

382
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,840
you know damaged or injured from it and you jump up and say why did you do that this is well you know you're

383
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,640
the one who said yes i you wanted to sit you know the pranking part well that was you know that's how i

384
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:04,000
have fun you see that's how i roll that's how i roll and this is how your professors are this is how

385
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,080
your law enforcement is this is how your legal this is how your religious people are

386
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:16,640
confront any e-mama priest bishop guru regarding what they're doing and they're saying it doesn't

387
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,800
matter as just need to believe or leave me alone right they don't want to know anything so

388
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,160
we're not saying this because anything is going to change but we're saying it because this is the

389
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,600
rationale behind the irrational that's going on on this planet right now and what is going on on

390
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:41,360
this planet ultimately in a big sense is that folks time ended almost 18 years ago and you're in

391
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:46,240
the credits part of the movie right now what i mean by that is if you're going to shoot a two-hour

392
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,000
movie do you get just exactly two hours of film or do you have to get two hours in 10 minutes because

393
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,560
you have to roll the credits the credits started rolling around the fall of 1998 and what's you in

394
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,320
the reason i use that metaphor is simply this the purpose of the credits is to give credit to the

395
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,720
efforts and the people behind it and also it's to show what you didn't see in the in the main feature

396
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,600
and also the order of importance sometimes has changed but you get to see all the things behind the

397
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,960
scenes and the other interesting thing about using this as a metaphor is you ever notice while the film

398
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,480
is running if someone speaks or stands up you're promptly told to be quiet or sit down but when the

399
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,760
credits are rolling the film is still technically rolling but people are talking people are moving

400
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,320
around and there's disturbance in the theater but it doesn't matter because it's the credits that's

401
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:40,080
why since 1998 when you see all these things happening it just doesn't matter people don't see it

402
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,640
you see so we're talking about all the corruption the child trafficking even spirit cooking all coming

403
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:52,160
to the surface coming to the light and who cares right it's the movie is over you know it's they're

404
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,680
not going to tell you shut up and sit down and and this is how it's just pretty much you know

405
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:05,280
metaphors are simple and this is not an oversimplified metaphor it's just another perspective on what is

406
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,680
going on here's another perspective on what's going on i like to use architecture as a metaphor meaning

407
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:16,400
a thousand years ago structures especially public structures were built to last a thousand years

408
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,840
i remember growing up at the bison teniel in the us around seventy seventy six speaking to some people

409
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,840
in europe and saying two hundred year bison telling you kidding i'm living in a house that's a thousand

410
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:32,240
years old right so a thousand years ago public structures were built to last a thousand years a hundred

411
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,120
years ago public structures or most structures were last were built to last a hundred years look at

412
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:41,200
the skyscrapers in new york that were built around the turn of the century or a little after they're

413
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:47,920
still very robust and structurally sound now structures since nineteen ninety eight structures are

414
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,320
being built to last only twenty years go look at those big towers that are built in aja or in

415
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:01,520
duba actually go research it a little bit what is the life expectancy of these large towers twenty

416
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,760
years and to put it a little more perspective on the subject i was conveying down what's called a road

417
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,720
one day and i saw what's called a housing subdivision going up and i took a glance at it and i

418
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,040
pointed to someone look the people are so far gone they're putting their building their houses out

419
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,680
of compressed sawdust think about that for a moment you know what i mean by compressed sawdust

420
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:27,440
you ever see that particle board yeah it's all of a sod folks that's what it does matter the

421
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:34,000
reason why is why do you why should it be made it doesn't need to be robust because this information

422
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,320
is ingrained in everyone just like a plant knows when to come to seed society is now coming to its

423
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,440
point now it doesn't mean doom and gloom because anytime you preach doom and gloom in human history

424
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,880
you will always sound correct but the problem is whenever doom and gloom is preached they cannot give

425
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:59,040
you specifics what we're trying to do eventually all these we meaning what the Greek is saying is give

426
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:05,680
specifics and one of the specifics here is that what everyone is experiencing right now is the

427
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:11,760
precursor to the precursor of a middle east union that is going to be forming it's a group of

428
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:18,560
ten nations which only nine exist right now in what's called the middle east area and when this

429
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,360
union comes together it's going to be a very loose union not like the european union all of your

430
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:31,840
government economics judicial recreational entertainment education religion is going to be

431
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:37,040
based out of there and then coming out of there you see it's going to be the hub and it's going to

432
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,560
be projected from there through the entire world and if you want to keep it really simple before

433
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,360
getting into more specifics or maybe not you ever hear grandma say what goes around comes around

434
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:54,560
you ever look at a racetrack where's the starting line okay look at the starting line now where's

435
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:02,160
the finishing line the same thing even in the rubbish secular education system in academia they tell

436
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:08,720
you that man society started where messopotamian region well guess where man society is going to end

437
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,560
based out of there as well so it's very very very very simple and by the way this has also been

438
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:20,240
prophesied in many of your ancient texts but who wants to read the ancient text because those people

439
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:28,160
are just ignorant you know it doesn't matter why i don't believe in that you see so you know we're

440
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,960
modern now and by the way if you study any of the ancient writings do you know like ancient Babylon

441
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,240
or ancient Greece or even parts of Rome before they fell from their prominence in their writings they

442
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:46,960
described themselves as being modern yes so so you know let's let's tie this back we kind of like got

443
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,640
more of a narrow aspect here but i believe in going deep in certain aspects but just covering

444
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,360
broad things because you know shallow thinking usually gets people diving off something deep so

445
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:03,760
you've got to pin yourself down into a thought that's what meditation is by the way meditation is

446
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:10,800
like re chewing the cut you have a thought and you you keep processing it just like you have a

447
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,200
diamond inspected or they just glance at it and put it back in the in the sack or do they keep

448
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,520
turning it and look at every facet right and how the light goes through it from every direction

449
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,200
and when you hear about meditation by the way they really screwed up the western world on that

450
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,280
because when the body is active the mind is quiet and when the body is quiet the mind is active so

451
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,040
back i think many people that consider themselves contemplate over meditational are trying to keep

452
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:43,920
their body still and make their mind still that's how you go insane folks meditation happens when the

453
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,920
body is still the mind is fast you know if someone is running a marathon and you want to ask them

454
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,160
technical questions or shoot you to the side they'll say listen let me finish this run and then

455
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:57,040
we'll talk right because when the body is active the mind is quiet and when the body is quiet the

456
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:02,480
mind is active so if you're laying down in bed and you find your mind racing that's good you're probably

457
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,920
not used to it and you don't know how to take control of it but once you understand the simple

458
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,320
premise that i just shared with you folks you know you'll have fortune in understanding what meditation is

459
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:20,640
so that does help because yeah who can stop that you know you're supposed to stop all the thinking

460
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:26,960
or you know again that is a tradition instead of an actual practice the way that we see things

461
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:36,640
in the way that this is all going what crazy times okay so we're looking at we're in the uncredits

462
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:44,480
we've been the revealing everything going on behind the surface we find that our elite are all

463
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:51,200
bloodline tracking back to ancient lines we find that they are all trafficking in children

464
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:58,800
every single person that has come up in this last election has been accused of rape and then

465
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:07,680
we get a middle east union where the laws and the you know the the traditions are quite different

466
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:15,120
America has been set up as this role of Satan as the evil overlords of the planet

467
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:22,880
thanks to things like the use of 9/11 truth and all this revelation of how we know try

468
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,280
try pizza parties and hot dogs and things of that nature that are coming to the surface

469
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:36,160
what happens when as we start to boil into the second hour here we're going to lead into the the

470
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:44,880
process of enacting these stoning laws in in the west and and how this middle east union will

471
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:51,440
affect us sure sure and now when you when we say stoning laws and you brought up 9/11 you know I've

472
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:57,280
got to say this and and many aspects perhaps people have no comprehension or don't want to have

473
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:04,960
comprehension about the one of the major traditions that goes on is from the secular point of view is

474
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:11,360
the preeminence or predominance of the Christian era all right if from a secular point of view

475
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,160
this is known as the Christian era right that's why your your years are numbered as such right and

476
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:24,720
it's all erroneous the the figure of the Christ for example in all that you will not what's shown by

477
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:29,920
Christianity the crucifix and all that and the continents of the man with long hair wearing a loin

478
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:39,040
cloth and such is not in the biblical text at all and when you say 9/11 that is also a loose reference

479
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:47,680
to when let's say the the birth of this biblical character took place so in essence just to tie it

480
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:53,440
back to what sparked this me to say this is when you said 9/11 two things that are very important

481
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,960
folks to consider about 9/11 one is all of the discussion that is out there regarding it no one

482
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:05,520
goes back and discusses the type of construction that was used for those buildings and people don't

483
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,960
know that that type of construction was around for decades before or a decade before it was actually

484
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,800
implemented and the reason these buildings were not implemented because no one knew how to take them

485
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:20,400
down and until the method was developed or procured then they were built and it wasn't just the

486
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:26,480
World Trade Center it's the UN building Daegharmershade Plaza the Sears Tower this is a specific type of

487
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,360
construction now the reason I'm mentioning this is there's no one is speaking about it the other

488
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:36,560
thing that almost no one is speaking about is in the in the Christian era you have something

489
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:42,720
called Christmas the birth of what's called the Christ and no one discusses the accuracy of

490
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,960
the information that is available for that they all take for granted we don't know when it was this

491
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:53,120
is what how we celebrate it but what's interesting in the biblical text it gives you an astronomical

492
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:59,120
alignment when that happened very specifically and if you're going to do a cross-cultural cross-era

493
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,400
communication of time you have to use astronomical alignments you can't use ridiculous calendars

494
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:09,680
right because they change you know so in the biblical text it's very clear a virgin was giving

495
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:14,000
birth which 12 stars at her head cloaked with the sun and the moon at her feet that is very

496
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,440
specific alignment and we know from secular records that during the time of let's say the biblical

497
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:29,040
record when the Christ was born there was a census or head counting of the empire by Augustus

498
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,760
and also we know that herod had died about two and a half years after that time according to

499
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:40,080
secular records that puts you between 2 a.d. or 8bc so if you go look for this alignment that i just

500
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:45,120
mentioned the constellation Virgo with the tail of draco at her head with the sun in the middle

501
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:50,160
and the moon at her feet that is in the late afternoon and if you go to a nationalmical observatory

502
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:56,080
or computer that will show you that happened between 2 and 8bc and that happened on 3bc

503
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:02,880
on the day of 11 on the month of september around 640 pm so what when you say 9/11 that was what's

504
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:09,600
called a birthday party right if you get the meaning of that we'll talk about what cannibals

505
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:14,640
birthdays and dolls have in common as a metaphor to understand this society so i just wanted to throw

506
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:21,120
that in there as well to give a little more comprehension on what's going on yeah absolutely we

507
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:30,480
are seeing the birth of a new world and folks it is the year 57777 in the Hebrew calendar or the year

508
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:42,400
616 anolusius calendar or you know year 2016 and yeah well we we from memorialization it seems to be

509
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:48,480
there's a new kid on the block known as atom and that was around 618 years ago so when you're

510
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,560
referencing the biblical text you would probably around be around there now what's interesting

511
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:58,080
about the Hebrew calendar by the way the reason it's losing out a few hundred years is because they

512
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,800
decided to eliminate the years when they didn't have an unrighteous king so for example if you

513
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:09,360
didn't like George Bush Jr you reset 8 years like never happened right never happened and that's

514
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:14,720
what the and I don't know is that lawful to do that you see the answer would be no it's not lawful

515
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:20,480
it's not a lawful time keeping well for the pranksters in the historical system it absolutely as they

516
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,760
have kept us veiled this whole time hood winked as you had said and now they've got us running in

517
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:33,760
the streets screaming kill all the fanatics yeah and the fanaticism is what you are being shown like

518
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:39,680
for example back to 9/11 for a moment when 9/11 happened in within 30 seconds they said it was

519
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:45,600
Muslim terrorists it was loosely accepted because since the 70s 80s and 90s Hollywood had done a

520
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:53,440
very good job in procuring Muslim terrorists in film right and also news and and also the xenophobia

521
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:59,440
of how look how different they are kind of thing it's always you know just like with Asia in world

522
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:05,280
war two it's very easy to pin out an adversary because they look very different because you have

523
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,600
the sports mentality you know people are into sports you know it's about a bunch of people in uniform

524
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:15,520
chasing a ball and the reason why they're so easy to follow sports is because they look the teams look

525
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:21,920
very different you don't need to be a genius to figure out what's going on right so without a doubt

526
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:27,920
and we saw that whole sports mentality come out that's exactly what runs these politics and everybody's

527
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:36,080
like my team has to win and and now we see the results of what happens with poor losers and and these

528
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:43,200
in this very thought that you're having here I made me consider this idea of how many bloody murders

529
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:52,480
would you personally witness without television or Hollywood sure very few but it's kind of difficult

530
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,680
to say because without television or Hollywood there might be fewer distractions and people might

531
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:07,840
be out actually committing more of them right all right to Shay but so we can see how this has been

532
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:13,920
melded into the system just slowly and subtly that this has been going on forever and ever and

533
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:23,040
and that's the thing is that they have they've spawned these reactions when Kathy O'Brien who we

534
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:31,120
will be having on the show folks very soon you know has been talking about this for 25 years and it's

535
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:37,760
only now because it's a mob rule situation that they're going to react to this knowledge and

536
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:46,240
what we hope the Greek and I folks is that we give you data so that the reactions will will

537
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:53,920
you know be tempered by understanding and knowledge that this is not new it's not time to react they're

538
00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:00,480
forcing you to react at this moment sure and you know the reactionaryness of everything you know

539
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:06,960
if you were growing up let's say in the 50 60 70s or even 80s when world leaders or captains of

540
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,360
industry would speaking we're speaking you notice how they spoke about multi-generational terms they

541
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:16,240
wanted to do these big public works projects and social changes you ever notice now how captains

542
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:21,360
of industry and leaders of people only speak from a reactionary point of view when event happens

543
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:25,280
they're taken out of wherever just to make a comment there there is no more discussion

544
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:32,320
about you know multi-generational or long-term thinking at all and that is another clue you need to

545
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:38,080
look at folks to see how things are falling in place but you have to remember if anyone is familiar

546
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:43,680
with homeopathy right which is how little of a substance you can give or the subtle energies

547
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,520
it's the subtle energies that actually dictate the things that come later it's the shape of the river

548
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:55,840
not the water that dictates the flow you see so what's happening now and it's been happening for a while

549
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:01,200
is a lot of subtleties are being put in place that are allowing people to accept what's happening

550
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:06,240
and we'll probably get into a little bit more on the current situation like you brought up you know

551
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:11,920
the pitophilia the human sacrifice let's say you brought up the murders and the stoning and all

552
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:17,840
this how that people are being let's say indoctrinated or being it's they're being warmed up to these

553
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:23,200
concepts because these things are going to be very significant in the near future actually in

554
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:31,920
the next decade let's say the secular decade don't be pranked by the systems folks mob does not rule

555
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:37,440
the subtleties of your very character will make all the difference necessary don't run around

556
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:45,520
screaming kill all the fanatics because well that makes you a fanatic so what a wonderful understanding

557
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:53,280
to to start to bring about the knowledge necessary to to stand on a firm plane as the world just

558
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:59,520
erupts into chaos around you and know that you're not being pranked by this very same system

559
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:07,360
if you guys prank yeah yeah I'm gonna ludicrous trick yes yeah it is ludicrous it is all ludicrous

560
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:14,080
this whole thing that I'm watching right now is ludicrous folks it's insane I mean I mean I wouldn't

561
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:21,920
pick either one of these people to you know take care of my dog much less be the ruler of my nation I

562
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:29,200
the the things that have come out that people just don't care is blowing my mind but I don't want

563
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:35,680
them to really get it all in one punch like they are this idea of child trafficking and MK ultra and

564
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:41,840
all the true things that are going on behind the scenes in the dark dark occulted world of politics

565
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:47,840
and global governance so I don't want you to be reacting to that I want you to be knowing that

566
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:55,040
this information has been here it's it's we've been talking about it and we can change things but

567
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:04,000
homeopathically with subtlety as we interact with one another I want to conclude this by saying you

568
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:14,000
can find the Greek very soon at uncommon radio dot com that is uncommon radio dot com and he he gives

569
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:20,560

and then we're going to discover something special about people's tattoos as a matter of fact have

you seen this latest one I'll put it in the artwork for you folks this one blew my mind it's

579
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,800
going to be right there on freeman tv dot com for you it is a woman who had

580
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:30,080
Donald Trump is not my f.ing president down her entire back in a tattoo this is blowing my mind

581
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:35,600
because hell Hillary might still be president in the not too distant future it she'll be stuck with

582
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:40,560
this for the rest of her life we're going to talk to the Greek about tattoos the middle east union

583
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:46,960
doom and gloom and really look more into our homeopathic status these deities and demons that we're

584
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:53,200
dealing with so I hope you all will subscribe get over to freeman tv dot com and click subscribe

585
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:59,360
there are numerous ways to do it and it all helps in getting this media out to a bigger and bigger

586
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:06,160
audience so that we can really start to affect change in ourselves and then watch that radiator as

587
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:12,560
it comes up through the plant life around us though those around us all you can do folks is plant

588
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:18,000
a seed and watch it grow you're never going to beat this stuff in anybody's head and the more you listen

589
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,200
to the Greek the more you realize that they don't care they really don't you can bring out their own

590
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:28,800
books you can bring out their own data and say here you are completely wrong and they'll say well

591
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:35,680
that's not my book any final thoughts on that gree oh well you know I think we're going to really

592
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:40,960
finalize it in the next hour so I encourage anyone to just come on over to the membership area

593
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:47,120
it's a fantastic time folks it's really been going great and thank you all so much there's been such a great

594
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:53,440
rave review recently and over the last few months and you know all of this last year honestly

595
00:57:53,440 --> 00:58:00,720
has been just epic so get tuned in and we're all here for you I promise and there's going to come

596
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:05,280
a time where that river is going to guide us all together so I really look forward to seeing you all

597
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:15,600

598
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:21,200
and welcome back you wonderful members and all you new members I hope you are figuring everything out

599
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:27,440
and it is very simple for you of course I guess if it's not you're probably not hearing this portion

600
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:33,520
of the show I was going to say just write me freeman at freemontv.com if you have any issues at all I

601
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:38,080
probably should have said that in the live part so that the people I haven't trouble getting in could

602
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:45,360
hear it but it's wonderful to have this little space here with just us and I really am glad that you

603
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:52,240
guys have joined this trip and are hopefully enjoying every minute of it like I am because what an

604
00:58:52,240 --> 00:59:00,560
amazing world we live in and what strange times and how bizarre is everyone I mean we got to sit

605
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:08,080
back and be observers and and realize what's going on look at the long now and really take it in so

606
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:16,160
that we can then be the Christ or the seed planters of the future to allow other people to come in

607
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:24,960
and I I I quickly see how I clearly see how quickly people get triggered as in last week show

608
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:33,920
the name Jesus was brought to the surface and boy boy you bring that name into the puzzle and I get hit

609
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:41,520
from all sides I'm I'm I'm fanatical Christians are writing me say you know thank God you've come over

610
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:48,560
and radical anti Christians are writing me what the hell are you doing I can't believe you would

611
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:57,680
allow the name Jesus on the air and for me I was not raised with the religious system whatsoever

612
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:06,240
everything that I have gleaned about religion and and dogma has been through my own outsider

613
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:14,400
adult perspective so I don't have any of these triggers and so when I when someone comes on my show

614
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,440
and they they bring up anything of any religious I mean I've had the high priest of the church

615
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:25,760
is eight and on here you know I've had text bars and evangelicals I've had every range that you

616
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:32,800
could possibly imagine on the show and I'm not going to challenge your beliefs because it's futile

617
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:40,480
and we're going to discuss that with the Greek now because you know it's futile and if if I feel

618
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:47,760
like you're taking it in a positive light and using the spiritual armor then I say go for it because

619
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:55,280
we all need more hope and more ability to be able to feel like we can stand up against this evil

620
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,680
in the world so Greek what do you got to say well would it feel good if I gave you a stack of

621
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,440
hundred notes and you were passing them around and buying things that you wanted you know federal

622
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,200
reserve notes hundred dollar bills let's say and by the way when you look at someone calls it a bill

623
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,840
like who's going to pay that bill but anyway if I gave you a stack of hundred dollar bills and you

624
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:16,560
felt pretty good but all of a sudden you go somewhere and someone scans and says hey man I know

625
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:20,960
you've been using these all day but they're counterfeit what do you mean they're counterfeit well you

626
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:26,080
can't counterfeit a hundred dollar bill with a dinner napkin and a crayon you have to take a lot of

627
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:32,400
time to make it seem very much like the real thing right but it's not under scrutiny now you

628
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:39,200
brought up the J. E. S. U. S. aspect well when people bring that up with me I say which one because

629
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,920
every aspect of Christianity has a different one meaning one says you could do anything you want

630
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,840
it's all been forgiven the other one says if you don't believe in me you're going to hell the other

631
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:52,880
one looks like this the other one looks like that okay well you know if you have two people or three

632
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,680
people or ten people coming to you and saying that they have the truth and their story does it

633
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:03,600
match well the only thing is possible is that they're all wrong or only one is correct because the truth

634
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:11,360
has to match like two plus two in Swahili equals four will be the same in Japanese or English but if

635
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:17,760
it's two plus two equals five in one group and two plus two equals nine and another it doesn't work

636
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:24,160
you know so here's the point I always say this and it's true unfortunately or fortunately for

637
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:30,080
those that have eyes and ears discussing any biblical character whether it's Adam and Eve Noah

638
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:36,000
Abraham the Christ the Apostles anyone at all is almost nearly impossible because it's all been

639
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,200
tainted the reason why is because no one goes to the text and what I mean by that let's just say

640
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:46,000
it's easier to find the nuclear launch codes of a country's arsenal than to accurately discuss

641
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:53,440
any biblical character period and what I mean by that is very simple just what I just what I said

642
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:59,520
go read the text very simple give a quick analogy you know you know that Cecil B. De Milgei

643
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:06,800
did the movie ten commandments with the you know they they cross the red sea the waters open up

644
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:11,120
and they walk along the bottom you know and they go across the other side you ever you ever walk

645
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:15,120
on the bottom of a dried out lake bed and all the crap under there you're gonna be knee deep in it

646
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:22,640
right there's no way practical and also if you read the text it said 600,000 fighting men left

647
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:29,680
Egypt that means that if they each had two relatives that's 1.8 million people right if they each

648
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:35,520
had three relatives that's 2.4 million people you don't that doesn't work now if you go to Exodus

649
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:42,080
15 it says that a cold wind blew all night and the waters were piled up if you go look at the meteorological

650
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:48,160
report and Sinai in the springtime it goes down to about 20 25 degrees is that cold enough to freeze

651
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:52,000
water and the reason I mentioned cold enough to freeze water is how do you pile up water

652
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:58,960
freeman can you pile up water of course you can if it's frozen and if you read very carefully in

653
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:05,280
the text it says that they all crossed over in and come morning time Farrow tried to cross but he

654
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:10,480
fell to the bottom he fell to the bottom like lead he fell to the bottom like a stone is what the

655
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,240
text says now let me ask you how can you fall to the bottom if you're ready walking on the bottom

656
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:19,840
now what they did is they walked on an ice bridge parting the water the etymological

657
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:25,680
root means to part or separate now let me ask you this have you ever heard anywhere in the

658
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:33,200
else in the biblical text of walking on water right sure yeah I've walked on water because I've

659
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:39,360
lived in the northeast once and it was very cold in the winter so now you can't do this because now

660
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:45,200
we've philosophically did mystified the biblical text we're not taking its power we're not taking its

661
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:50,720
relevancy or the respect that it garners away we're just being practical also they crossed the

662
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:57,200
Jordan everyone likes to focus on what Cecil B. Demil is showing now there's a lot of Jesus movies

663
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:02,320
that show you the depiction of his execution how he was born and how he looked none of that is biblical

664
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:09,520
sorry folks here's another point of view I ask Christians very simply when Moses was speaking

665
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:14,240
at the mountain you've heard of the burning bush by the way Moses and the burning bush right

666
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:18,400
do you know if you read the text there's no burning bush if you read the text it states that

667
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:24,640
Moses saw an angelic being that was giving off fire and then the angelic being stood behind a bush

668
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:30,000
and the fire from the angel was not burning the bush was not consuming the bush where do you

669
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:36,640
get the burning bush out of that well I'm curious as to why we should even take any of this into

670
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:41,920
our operating system in the first place I mean what gives credence to any of these stories of

671
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:51,040
because it's a code it's a code and it's also a memorialized information of a very high

672
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:59,120
ranking database and we'll get into that maybe in the future and you've heard of what's called

673
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:03,120
the bible code where they open it and they give you a computer code and you final psalm have been

674
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:06,800
flawed and if you crisscross the letters and all that well that what they don't tell you is that

675
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:11,760
works and with Emerson's Moby Dick or Melville's Moby Dick also works in any literary work

676
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:17,520
there is a bible code in there that's very important and it has to do with geometric forms and

677
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:22,880
that will probably discuss in another time how's that but this is what's important

678
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:28,880
you ever hear of something any information transfer is not coming through and remember how we

679
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:35,040
said in the first hour that your law comes from your god so anything that is regarding deific or

680
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:40,320
spiritual information tends to take a higher order right and people's information base

681
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:46,320
and if they've got it all mixed up how are they going to study any any any information base how many

682
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:55,360
times have you heard for example bacteria or viruses cause the cold the common cold in winter time

683
01:06:55,360 --> 01:07:01,280
right well the most people follow that rationale or logic but it's acer nine and stupid why

684
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:06,720
because if that were true that would render the need for refrigeration useless the reason we have

685
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:13,120
refrigeration is to retard those little buggers right so it doesn't right so in the winter time

686
01:07:13,120 --> 01:07:20,400
their bacteria and things like that are dormant right so they can't be the cause of cold

687
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,640
what actually is the cause of cold is you're not eating seasonally because if you're in a cold

688
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:29,120
place you knew you'd food grown in the tropics it changes your body chemistry to the tropics right

689
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:34,560
so you're gonna freeze or get mucus right now now here's the other point let's go back to viruses

690
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:39,600
if you study all of the documents regarding virology even that infinite bastion of wisdom called

691
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:46,160
Wikipedia look up virology and they'll tell you that virology is a branch of toxicology and all

692
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:51,760
toxicology has to do with the liver function so how the hell are you going to catch a virus if its

693
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:57,600
viruses originated in the liver as mitochondria no one is paying attention to any of the memorialized

694
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:02,480
information that's what's important it's not whether it's biblical it's whether it's scientific

695
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:11,440
academic medical legal right anything yeah i have no idea what is the the crane crane fly effect

696
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:17,840
in that as i traveled around the u.s. and i think even across the nations or continents

697
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:24,960
i would find people talking about this mosquito eater or some places they called it a mosquito

698
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:30,640
hawk and what it was is a giant bug that looks like a one you know it looks like a giant mosquito

699
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:36,800
and people see them bouncing around the house and they say oh no no don't kill that they eat mosquitoes

700
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:43,040
and i've found this from east to west coast and the truth is that that bug is actually a crane fly

701
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:50,160
it's a common ordinary house fly it doesn't eat mosquitoes but everyone knows it does and everybody

702
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:55,920
believes it and i'm i want to take this and lead this into birthday cards cannibals and dolls greek

703
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:02,080
i i'm just dying to understand this let's give the perspective on it that i like to this is how

704
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:06,880
I introduce it let's say you're on a mothership you have intergalactic travel and before you go

705
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:12,560
down on a planet that give you a short briefing well if you approach earth briefing the shortest

706
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:17,360
possible brought briefing regarding the society on earth right now would go as such you cannot

707
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:23,280
understand the society of these people until you understand what cannibals birthdays and dolls

708
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:29,040
have in common now if that doesn't sound obtuse and weird i don't know what does and let's go let's

709
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:34,000
roll right into it like you said and this is one of the standard stock explanations that i give

710
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:41,120
now let's start when you go back even into the trashy secular history that we're given

711
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:46,720
where do they tell you everything started the Mesopotamian region right between the Tigris and the

712
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:50,400
Euphrates and all that and this is also in a lot of the ancient texts as well but let's just

713
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:57,920
just say you know this is where everyone sort of has agreed the origin starts the people in that

714
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:04,320
culture in that society spoke what's called a caldian Hebrew meaning that is a general classification

715
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:08,960
of languages just like when you say the latin languages that would be Italian, French, Spanish and so

716
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:16,720
Portuguese right so let's go back to the language in caldian Hebrew the people remember that you

717
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:21,840
get your law from your god right then the gods have priests the priests were known as the cahons

718
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:28,480
and the priests had convinced the people that if they make wishes of prosperity they sacrifice a

719
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:41,280
young child right and the and to a ball B-A-A-L or a lord all right and when they sacrifice the child

720
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:47,120
they would each partake in eating a tiny piece of flesh like the size of someone's fingernail and

721
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:54,000
taste of the blood this was part of the ritual and so the cahons were the cahons are the priests of

722
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:01,200
the balls so the eating of human flesh is cahon ballism or cannibalism you could look up the route

723
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:06,240
meaning of the word cannibalism comes from the cahon balls now cahon ball literally means priest

724
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:10,960
of the lord and you still have priests of the lord today don't you they profess such right you go

725
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:15,680
to a place that has a priest they say I worship the lord and what are you a priest thank you very

726
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:22,320
much there's a cannibals etymologically not right okay so this is where you get the what the word

727
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:28,320
cannibal means just means priest of the lord and it's associated with eating of human flesh now what's

728
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:33,040
interesting about this wish of prosperity is people were convinced that it would bring prosperity

729
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:39,120
to them in that culture and when you know what's interesting about the quote unquote family union

730
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:44,320
a unit and the psychology in the culture is when you have brothers and sisters and the parents take one

731
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:49,760
away and come back without them and as a child aren't you gonna ask where's our brother where's our

732
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:56,320
sister right so we have a missing child now in the family unit and the altar boys of these priests

733
01:11:56,320 --> 01:12:00,880
of the lord of the cannibals were able to take care of that or suit that a little bit by making an

734
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:06,560
effigy of a child a doll they say well when you go back the children are gonna ask where it happened

735
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:11,840
to the child so why don't you give them this instead to take its place so right now when you look at how

736
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:18,320
parents give children dolls to play with now you know where that ritual or custom or tradition comes

737
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:25,200
from whether you are doing it for that or not is irrelevant this is the origin of giving children

738
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:32,640
dolls okay super creepy yeah and it goes on and on out you know people usually respond by saying well

739
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:39,440
I had a doll I didn't but it has nothing to do with that it's the gesture okay now when the people

740
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:44,640
realize that doing this ritual didn't really bring prosperity they usually ran these guys out of town

741
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:49,680
but before they got run out of town or did get run out of town they figured out well let's do a

742
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:55,600
parody of this event and I had read this in a book that was published in the 1800s and I'm trying

743
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:00,240
to remember it's title thing was ancient rites and rituals rights being spelled RITES

744
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:07,280
of the Hebrew caldians and and I was trying to piece this together because it stated they had done

745
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:15,040
parody of events by baking a loaf of sweet bread and placing lights in it or around it and the

746
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:21,200
child would make a wish of prosperity blow out the lights reflecting or meaning blowing out the life

747
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:25,840
and everyone would eat a piece of this sweet bread which represented the body and to show that the

748
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:32,000
event brought prosperity anyone attending the ceremony brought a present now this sat in the

749
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,040
mind for a little while and I was like you know what that's the origin of the birthday party

750
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:46,160
insane yeah and now this is all done in gesture hey Greek we don't we just have a good time

751
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:51,040
we don't we don't kill children or each other but it's the gesture now this is why the

752
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:56,960
you see do you see now what kind of understanding you get on this society now the gestures and the

753
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:03,200
parody and the human sacrifice that is involved in what they do as pleasure and as morally acceptable

754
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:11,360
is not right now let me just throw a statement in there the gods love human children more than

755
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:17,920
parents do imagine the most loving parent the gods love your child more than you do now what do you

756
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:25,520
think whether you do this actual sacrifice or you do a parody of it what's the difference in the

757
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:32,240
spiritual realm right you see so this is where you're heading so that's why when I have discussions

758
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:37,360
with people say how a society gonna get better I say wait a second before we get into that I say

759
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:44,640
are you able to go to a store and buy what's called a birthday cake as such or a doll says yes of

760
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:50,400
course as it will your societies in the shit as long as that's available because that is a gesture

761
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:56,960
of human sacrifice that's why I always suggest now the you by the way that was the short explanation

762
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:01,280
of what cannibal birthdays and dolls have in common do you think well the audience might be satisfied

763
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:05,600
with enough of that I don't think we need to go into more of it because it's about as it's about as

764
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:11,920
macabre is can be right yeah yeah absolutely every that pretty much lays it out there that was Santa

765
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:16,960
clause that we got in her earlier that clause was different was more like but similar human size

766
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:24,560
so I'm saying just you know just shackles child sacrifice for a parody of this situation that is

767
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:31,680
just constantly the operating system and I mean okay let's go all the way back there was a time where

768
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:37,600
you had to be a people of the book and there was a group of characters wandering around and they

769
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:45,920
were in bright colored dress and they were they were stopped by the lead priest or what would be a

770
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:54,400
chic and and he he demands you know what people of the book are you and these people of colorful

771
01:15:54,400 --> 01:16:03,120
descent I don't know who they were they went and studied the the law and and came back and said

772
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:12,560
we are sabians and in this they became the followers of hermys and because hermys was one of the

773
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:19,520
accepted days in the Quran the sabians were there before then considered a people of the book

774
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:25,040
so now we're looking at this middle eastern union we got people tattooing Donald Trump is not my

775
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:31,280
having president across their back and we're all going to be expected to be a people of the book and

776
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:36,800
I wanted to give some people heads up about the sabians in case maybe that will come into play and we can

777
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:41,680
announce they actually were sabians and we're we're the followers of hermys because that's about my

778
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:47,360
favorite character and all of these different saviors so let's get into the Middle East

779
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:55,200
Assiria the anti-Christ and tattoos okay very important in this order we've all if anyone's heard

780
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:59,760
the Greek I've always been talking about what's coming around the corner with accuracy what makes

781
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:06,640
it accurate is that well it happens and it's it's just a good report now as we mentioned in the first

782
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:12,960
hour there is going to be a Middle East union and when this comes together you're going to have

783
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:18,320
whether it's popular or unpopular how many times have you heard the concept of the anti-Christ

784
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:23,360
you're going to have him as the ruler he's going to be surrounded by a council of older people now

785
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:28,080
why is it that whenever someone is unfavorable they're called an anti-Christ when

786
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:34,720
if you're going to pluck a concept or a character out of a source document you have to use the

787
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:40,720
definition in the source document right how many times have you overheard you know a poor leader

788
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:45,120
being regarded in media as the anti-Christ well if you look at the source document he is not

789
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:51,520
a poor leader he's actually a very charismatic leader a very powerful leader everyone likes him

790
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:57,760
right so where is the understanding on this now we're not allowed to make things up everyone has

791
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:04,320
their own opinion and personal belief but not everyone can have their own truth which has also

792
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:09,280
been happening so let's get into a little bit more of that now it leads into law form and to tab

793
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:14,080
twos so we have a Middle East union that's coming that's a prerequisite of ten nations now

794
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:18,800
and a lot of quote-unquote air quotes here Christian circles they think it's Europe there is no

795
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:24,240
mention of Europe in the biblical text at all other than all the nations it's very specific about

796
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:29,760
these nations being in the Middle East the problem is there only nine in existence today the tenth one

797
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:35,280
would be this country called Assyria it would probably be called the new Assyria and most people don't

798
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,520
know much about the Assyrians but there's several million Assyrians throughout the world there's

799
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:44,080
less than a quarter of a million in the Middle East now because of all the turmoil they are of Christian

800
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:51,200
descent meaning orthodox Christian and they cease to exist as a nation around 2300 years ago

801
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:57,440
and if you actually study the Assyrians let me just make a loose personal opinion statement here which

802
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:03,840
I rarely do Freeman okay one of the reasons they cease to exist as a society is because if they

803
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:11,520
didn't I don't think anyone would be here today why what was the Assyrians industry the Assyrians

804
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:17,440
industry was war straight up if they needed or wanted anything they just went and attacked another

805
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:23,920
country to get it have you ever heard of medieval torture devices they even have museums will

806
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:29,680
get teen some screws all these things right the majority of these torture devices and methods

807
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:37,760
of executions were invented and procured by guess who you got it the Assyrians there were quite an

808
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:44,960
interesting people in that respect now what what we're going to see is as I've been saying for

809
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:52,960
over a decade a new Assyria forming in northern Iraq and when it forms its boundaries will go into

810
01:19:52,960 --> 01:20:01,040
Turkey and Syria so back as early as 2000 what they called 2004 I was telling people learn to watch

811
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:07,360
Syria and Turkey and northern Iraq obviously because when this Assyria comes by its jurisdiction is

812
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:13,200
going to take some land from Syria and Turkey and when does a political move like that or geographical

813
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:21,440
mapping happen without a fight or turmoil or chaos hardly ever right so what do you hear about in the

814
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:25,600
news right now you hear a lot about Turkey and Syria don't you and northern Iraq don't you very

815
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:32,480
interesting so what you're going to see when this country comes about now the prerequisite for all

816
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:38,240
these ten nations are in place right and this is what this period is going to start in the spring of

817
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:45,280
2018 going until what's called 2025 is when the the the prominence or the gain of prominence

818
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:51,040
and the focus is going to be on the Middle East because of these ten nations and they're going to

819
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:56,400
have a central hub in Iraq a central three central areas the other one is going to be in what's known

820
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:01,280
as Israel the other one's going to be in what's known as Lebanon this is going to be like loose

821
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:08,000
capital cities kind of like in fashion you have London Paris New York right kind of like a tripart

822
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:15,680
uh... thing like that so this is what's coming folks in by the way let me just interject this is not doom and gloom this is uh...

823
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:21,200
you've reached the level of humanity right now where when all of these things take place and like i said in

824
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:26,240
the previous uh... interview we did the kill shots that are going to be administered to the society it's

825
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:33,440
not the end of the world or the planet it's the end of man's rule and it's the end of the gods or that

826
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:40,800
society the unseen being imperceptible after this time period when man is toppled his way his system

827
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:47,520
of doing things is toppled and redone the gods will be overt there will be no more question about

828
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:52,160
angelic beings and things you'll be able to see them in such right so this is a wonderful time that's

829
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:56,880
coming for if you see it as such right but uh...

830
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:01,680
what yeah so but the problem why it has to be done so violently is because people have reached a

831
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:07,040
point where they're unreadable how many times have you heard people say i will die from my belief

832
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,320
too many

833
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:14,240
yeah so guess what you're going to be accommodated for that okay so let's be careful what you believe in what you say

834
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:18,160
what you're willing to lay your life down but there's an ancient Greek saying that says that those that

835
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:22,240
those that are afraid of dying don't know how to live the reason i brought this up is because one

836
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:27,280
i do mention these things in public i get a lot of personal contacts that say well how do i do what

837
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:33,920
do i do to avoid the kill shots you know like the solar event and the asteroids and just the chaos

838
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:38,480
that man is going to ensue and i'm like what kind of question is that you know we're too far away to

839
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:43,840
answer give you a solid answer and the thing is why would you be afraid of that you see but we

840
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:48,640
let's go back to the middle east union in this antichrist character what people don't understand

841
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:53,920
about the biblical character biblical text and characters besides nothing uh... and how do i

842
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:59,040
why do i say this is go ahead and speak to your average average believer now the the jewish and

843
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:05,840
christian faith have hijacked the biblical text and when i mean by hijacked is exactly that taking it

844
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:12,560
forcefully with and not using it for its appropriate reason and just like few uh... no anyone that has

845
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:18,080
a sporting goods store ask them how many baseball bats they sell and they'll tell you many but how many

846
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:23,360
of those baseball bats that are sold are actually used for playing baseball hmm probably a third or

847
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:29,600
less because baseball bats make inexpensive clubs don't they when you see these religious people walking

848
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:34,400
around with these ancient text i assure you they don't know anything in them they're using it as a

849
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:40,640
baseball bat you know here bible fumping they've heard that before right using it as a club now

850
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:45,200
people that do understand these texts and and uh... there is no such thing as your interpretation

851
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:51,040
or whatever there is only one interpretation there is many versions for example if you go or an

852
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:56,720
ambassador and go to the u_n_ you don't bring a version stator with you you bring an interpreter

853
01:23:56,720 --> 01:24:02,880
stator with you right he has to be as accurate as possible now anyone is entitled to a version but

854
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:08,320
not anyone is entitled to differing interpretation if you have two people saying they have an interpretation

855
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:13,040
not a belief for a version but an interpretation and if they're not identical the only thing that's

856
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:19,040
possible is they're both wrong or only one is correct they both cannot be correct so these and to

857
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:24,800
say that it cannot be understood is by is the same as saying that the gods or those that transmitted

858
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:31,200
this message act in futility and they don't act in futility they might have an iq of one million

859
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:35,280
and they're speaking baby talk to you and you still don't get it but it can be comprehended

860
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:39,920
when you throw in cosmic censorship it makes it all difficult but maybe we'll discuss

861
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:44,560
the cosmic censorship someday or maybe if we have time but let's go back to the middle east

862
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:49,760
union the reason why i did this preface within the explanation is because anyone can see what i'm

863
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:55,440
saying in the text and you can see it manifesting not here to convince anyone i'm here to just give a

864
01:24:55,440 --> 01:25:00,720
good report why because there are there isn't any good reporting on this subject being done it

865
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:06,000
you know it really sucks what you hear about this subject matter and it behooves anyone that

866
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:12,400
discovers what is correct to speak so you know just that's why we're speaking hopefully

867
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:19,600
so so going back to the middle east union one of the most pre preeminent characters that is in the

868
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:24,560
biblical text and also on the minds and mouths of people is this anti-christ character and seemingly

869
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:30,560
no one has any details about it well here we go it's very simple the number seven how many times

870
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,800
have you heard the number seven being significant in the biblical text or has to do with spiritual

871
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:40,480
you're the divine quite a bit okay well what's interesting about the number seven is number four is

872
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:44,960
in the center isn't it you have three on the left three on the right take out seven objects

873
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:51,120
the center one is number four and then you have one two three on the left of it and then five six seven

874
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:56,960
on the right we're given the number seven metaphorically and practically in the biblical text over

875
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:03,680
and over and over the center figure is the christ figure that means that he was born exactly in

876
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:08,480
the year four thousand which was around september eleven three bc according to the pope's work

877
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:16,080
schedule or bit or in lawful time keeping it was around the 15th day of the seventh month by the way

878
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:21,520
september mean seven october means eight nova means nine and deca or december means ten think about

879
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:27,040
that for a minute so if the christ was born by the way on the year four thousand because these

880
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:36,240
essential figure who might have been born hmm under let's say the sixth millennium the sixth right

881
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:42,960
aspect of that number seven the year six thousand well guess what number six coincides with a number

882
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:50,800
of man whenever you hear satanic references to six six six that's bullshit folks why because number

883
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:58,640
six denotes man system right guess what one did man come on the scene when during the creation

884
01:26:58,640 --> 01:27:06,000
story six day you got five fingers on one hand that six you got two legs two arms torso and

885
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:12,480
head that six six feet under six feet tall anytime anything is written a prominence by man for man

886
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:18,960
it's divisible by six interesting that's why a lot of the king james versions they tell you there

887
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:24,160
sixty six books they're telling you in code that's a mocked up version of the biblical text

888
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:29,840
because the biblical text actually has forty nine books seven times seven but what they did was they

889
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:34,800
divided some books like first and second kings first and second peter for to get the sixty six

890
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:40,960
because they're mucking about you get it so number six has to do with man so on the one

891
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:46,400
did the six millennium come around roughly the fall of nineteen ninety eight so if this man's number is

892
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:52,080
six meaning six six six six and the reason there are three six is is because it's a number of a man

893
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:57,360
and you need two witnesses to verify something don't you from the mouth of two or three witnesses

894
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:03,760
so you have six you're sure it's six yes six and you're sure that yes six that's why you have

895
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:09,360
the six six six very simple it's a number of a man he was born on the six millennium so he that

896
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:14,400
would put him roughly around eighteen years old right now also the text is very clear that he is

897
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:20,320
of us serian descent hey didn't we just finished describing the aserians a little bit preman

898
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:26,720
interesting right so the anti-Christ folks whether you believe it or not know it or not or

899
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:32,160
care to know it or not or don't like with it what is being said here if you actually got

900
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:36,560
objective and studied what I just mentioned you'll find it to be true in the text and you must adhere

901
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:44,320
to it right so we have an aserian that is roughly eighteen years old that is the anti-Christ figure

902
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:50,160
right now go figure so what about all this talk about this is the antichrist that's the antichrist

903
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:53,840
well you know that doesn't really are they aserian are they around eighteen years old now

904
01:28:53,840 --> 01:29:00,160
don't be hoodwinked folks the alternative media in the mainstream literary works religious people

905
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:06,480
yeah too subjective you're not allowed to make up definitions of things that are extracted

906
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:12,160
from a source material right you cannot use when you say that uh you know the antichrist would be

907
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:18,160
known as charismatic and a great leader and and people calling George W. Bush the antichrist is

908
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:24,320
obviously flawed yes yes and you this you will hate to say it this way but you will get that from

909
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:30,240
the Christian perspective now here's the thing that I always like to say there are no Christians in

910
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:34,720
the world that comprehend the bible just like there are no Muslims that comprehend the Quran or any

911
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:39,600
Hindus that comprehend the Vedas or the Buddhists that comprehend the writings of the Buddha why because

912
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:45,440
if you adhere to a particular faith or religion institutional conventional like this and you actually

913
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:49,840
study the text that it was alleged to be subscribed to you would not be part of that group you

914
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:56,800
you would renounce it very clearly because why this is not my opinion if you made a list of

915
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:01,040
everything these major religions do and actually went to the text that they allegedly subscribe to

916
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:05,520
you would find that just about everything these believers do in his corresponding face is in the

917
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:11,520
don't do list or abominations list of the text that they allegedly subscribe to think about that

918
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:20,000
for a minute folks now that that leads me to tattoos and why it has become so prolific in the 21st

919
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:26,640
century yes very simple now how many people are familiar with the biblical text raise your hand

920
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:31,360
right well you might be think you're familiar with it because you're really just watched a lot of

921
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:37,520
movies or went to Sunday school or whatever but it's not what we're talking about if you actually

922
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:42,240
remember what we spoke about earlier that your law form comes from your God you know you ever heard

923
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:47,520
of the books of Moses it's a little bit of a bit of a kiss or there's a lot of laws in there isn't there

924
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:55,840
a 616 laws roughly right you've heard of that roughly right now what's interesting these biblical

925
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:01,440
laws are not religious if you actually study the context of them they're very much like the

926
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:06,560
constitution of a nation like what's the constitution of a nation the laws and bylaws and how the

927
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:11,920
government will be set up in function right if you actually look at a lot of the biblical laws which

928
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:18,080
by the way have not been done away with and I want to just interject one thing here and I do this

929
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:25,280
often but if you've heard of esop's fables like esop fables was like the the tortoise and the hare

930
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:31,840
you know fable okay well have you heard of the fox and the grapes just go look it up there's a

931
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:36,640
little one hour one minute YouTube on it the fox and the grapes is very simple a fox is going down

932
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:41,760
a path and he's it's hot and hungry and on the trail and it sees a grapevine and the grapes are

933
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:46,320
up high and it keeps jumping to reach the grapes can't reach them all afternoon and it says you

934
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:52,240
know what I can't reach those grapes but you know what they're probably sour anyway right so what

935
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:56,240
happens most people try to comprehend what's in the biblical texts and put it in context and they

936
01:31:56,240 --> 01:32:02,480
can't so they say oh you know what it's done away with right no it doesn't belong it doesn't adhere

937
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:07,760
to me the fox in the grapes because I don't understand it it's not you know it doesn't exist right

938
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:14,960
this is how science works right so so here's the point when you look at the biblical laws as being

939
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:21,120
a constitution or the way that you live your life and set up a country or a town or

940
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:25,280
what you eat what you wear how you keep time how you do business how you raise a family all these

941
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:31,120
things are in there right when the Antichrist figure and the Middle East is brought together

942
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:35,920
there are going to be suggestions made to bring world peace and I'm going to interject something

943
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:42,720
beyond tattoos here as well Freeman but when he when they are looking for a new law form

944
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:49,280
just like I used to say if you want really new idea read a really old book they're going to go back

945
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:54,240
and look at what things are based on and they're going to discover and people are going to discover

946
01:32:54,240 --> 01:33:01,680
that the biblical law form will begin to be re-instilled and for example in the biblical law form

947
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:06,800
capital punishment the death by stoning and things like that that's why you guys are being prepped

948
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:13,280
for that kind of stuff little by little but here's the point when you read in the biblical law that

949
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:18,320
if you for example have a piercing or marking on the skin you're to be put outside the camper

950
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:24,080
outside of the nation you were exiled if you did certain behaviors or certain things right

951
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:30,240
let me ask you if the entire planet across the equator or pole to pole takes on a law that

952
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:35,920
you you're not to mark your skin where are you going to go where are you going to be exiled to if

953
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:41,200
the entire planet from pole to pole and across the whole world is going to be under this law where

954
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:48,720
are you going to go you see my point so what I was when I saw and read that one third of humanity

955
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:53,760
will pretty much be wiped out so for social reasons or lawful reasons by others with the laws being

956
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:59,600
acted on very harshly I started looking at the proliferation of what's called tattooing back

957
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:04,480
maybe 12 years ago and I started telling people you know about tattoos and they're like yeah I do

958
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:08,640
I said you know how they're growing up you're usually for bikers or people in the navy you're

959
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:14,080
going to see everyone getting them not everyone but good amount of people because they're being set up

960
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:20,640
right and also when this law is put in place there isn't going to be tattoo police it's going to be

961
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:25,760
the people are going to be so enthralled in this society in this law form that they're going to

962
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:33,120
execute laws on their own right so this is why and also when this law takes effect it's not that

963
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:37,840
easy to remove a tattoo right or cover it you know most people that have them are known by others

964
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:48,320
right so is it in fact a death sentence loosely yes but conversely no because it's a setup now

965
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:53,520
here here's the other point that I want to make according to this how are you know I said there

966
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:57,680
aren't going to be any tattoo police that the people are going to do it themselves how is that

967
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:04,480
going to be possible because when this middle east union comes together around 2025 2025 2026

968
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:09,520
and you're going to have world peace prosperity liberty from things that you're attending to do and

969
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:14,080
you're going to have these charismatic people not only leading the world and setting up the world

970
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:18,080
in a way but they're also going to be performing miracles and reach a point where their arrogance

971
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:22,960
is going to lead them where they're actually one of them is going to declare themselves

972
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:29,760
God on earth right and the way you're going to identify him as such is this anti-craze character will be

973
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:35,760
in a mortal type of accident either a car accident or assassination attempt and he'll be declared dead

974
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:40,560
but then he'll be brought back let's say on an operating table and he will no longer have the use

975
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:46,160
of his right eye or his right arm but I am suggesting here I don't like to do this but I'm going to

976
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:53,040
go out a little bit or right Freeman that when he's brought back they're not going to certainly hide

977
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:58,720
that but what might be hidden is his eye in his arm he might have a prosthetic that functions really

978
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:03,520
well like an arm or an eye that functions like an eye and you may not know and there might be a rumor

979
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:10,000
that he actually lost his arm in his eye and he might need evidence on that but when this happens

980
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:16,160
this will be the first person in history to be possessed by Satan himself when I think I gave a

981
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:21,360
loose definition of Satan he doesn't deal with people he deals with the institutions of people

982
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:27,680
these demonic possessions and things that people see like ghosts of family and things those are

983
01:36:27,680 --> 01:36:33,920
various minor impson demons that is not Satan himself right so this will be a precedent where the first

984
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:40,000
time of Satan actually is guiding him so while this is happening and prior to that people on the world

985
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,400
will be convinced that look we have world peace we have charismatic leaders and we have a wonderful

986
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:51,200
law form that works and this now is the new millennium this is how we are going to be in a wonderful

987
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:57,760
world for the next thousand years and when the glitches start to happen these very aggressive

988
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:04,640
application of the biblical law form and what I mean by biblical law form being aggressively applied

989
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:09,040
like you know we all know water is good without water there is no life right but you know what is

990
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:15,200
them what is what material is responsible for more property damage and insurance than any other

991
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:21,040
is water you can drown a grown person face down in three inches of water water is wonderful

992
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:28,320
it's necessary for life but it's also can be used for destructive purposes right and when this

993
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:32,320
starts to happen in the world people are still going to be convinced with all the mayhem that's

994
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:37,440
going around them in chaos it doesn't matter we'll just get over it because we're on a thousand

995
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:43,280
year golden age that just begun and even on the last interview that we did that I mentioned

996
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:48,720
there going to be three kill shots a solar kill shot not a solar flare but the so the sun being

997
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:54,560
extremely hot for a duration of time and to the point where the full moon looks like the

998
01:37:54,560 --> 01:38:01,120
newnday sun to the two asteroids that hit the earth even when those things are happening their

999
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:07,040
billions dead overnight the people will be so enthralled and propagandized that they'll say it's

1000
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:13,520
okay if that there's a billion dead last night we'll get over it you see this is so imagine the

1001
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:18,480
level of propaganda that's going to be put in the next decade that is going to make people

1002
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:25,760
completely blind to what's going on around them right yeah even so this is with a setup and yeah

1003
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:31,280
so I hope we do you feel satisfied with that or should I go into more depth I mean so far I mean

1004
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:36,000
do you think the audience is is benefited from this at all you know from the cannibals birthdays

1005
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:39,440
and dolls all the way to the explanation of the Middle East Union if there is there anything do

1006
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:43,600
you want me to get more specifics on we can yeah it wouldn't have been long ago that I would have

1007
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:51,840
said oh this is crazy talk but I start looking at things like a stonna where the global world

1008
01:38:51,840 --> 01:39:02,560
religion council gathers in a giant pyramid around a sun table and I see the future the futuristic

1009
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:08,640
city that is a stonna in these buildings as you're saying that aren't built to last longer than 20 years

1010
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:18,160
but designed as portals it's a pre-plan city that is the same as a seal of Solomon to channel demons

1011
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:25,840
some of them are ineffective okay let me I don't like to give references in mainstream tv shows

1012
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:32,000
but have you ever heard of a tv show called Pimp My Ride right they take an old car and they

1013
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:38,320
invest you know thousands in the but a tv screen I mean it's just very elaborate right a lot of

1014
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:45,440
this is Pimp My Ride type stuff like Surn is physicist Pimp My Ride look at this crap we built this

1015
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:52,640
huge thing that spins absolutely nothing and it's only to show you guys that we have access to the

1016
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:58,240
banking system and we can get anything we want and you don't because there's no such thing as a

1017
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:03,760
God particle there's no such thing as an atom even it's a construct that was put together by Walt

1018
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:11,600
Disney so the atom as electron and pro tennis such was abandoned by the 1940s but Walt Disney said I

1019
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:18,720
really like it I'm gonna promote it okay just like Simon and Agas yeah yeah exactly he put a lot of

1020
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:23,600
his own money into millions and his own money back then as well to influence scientific community go

1021
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:29,120
along with it just like Einstein Einstein was like an Osama bin Laden character he didn't really

1022
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:36,720
exist as you're being told yes he did exist but not as you're being told so there's many aspects to

1023
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:44,640
this and which aspect do you not touch you have to touch them all because they're you know they're

1024
01:40:44,640 --> 01:40:50,560
accessible and they can be discussed and referenced now regarding of what's coming and regarding

1025
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:55,840
religion and what they're doing the thing is that people now what you're going to see coming in

1026
01:40:55,840 --> 01:41:00,160
the near future beginning not it's not going to come very in a very stark manner where there's a

1027
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:05,440
total flip but you're going to see people inquiring more and more into the spiritual realm what are

1028
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:10,640
the gods what are what a spirituality what are these religions based on right all these things

1029
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:15,920
they're going to be revisited and the the ridiculousness now here's the thing how many times have

1030
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:21,120
you heard like oh the Catholic Church is satanic or this religion is satanic or this or that or whatever

1031
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:28,480
that will no longer be said they they will be viewed as you cannot make things up or criticism

1032
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:34,080
that is not founded on something that can that it can be based on you have to give if you say

1033
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:39,600
a religion is satanic you have to show me how and you have to be using the terms properly see this

1034
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:45,520
will come into place what you will discover in the future is the world's major religions are

1035
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:51,360
as described in the biblical text not necessarily satanic even though Satan controls all the institutions

1036
01:41:51,360 --> 01:42:00,320
on the world but they are worthless meaning they have no value let me give an example if there's a

1037
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:08,000
basilica in Rome and they have iconography right images of let's say this one I'm basing it on what

1038
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:13,920
they call the mother queen of heaven or the virgin Mary and it's a painting and she's carrying the

1039
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:19,760
child and she has this red tunic type scarf overhead with a gold fringe of a gold border on it you

1040
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:25,600
might have seen that image right somewhere right in iconography now this basilica when they painted

1041
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:32,400
these icons they actually had a physical model sit there and they dressed up the model with you

1042
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:36,080
know whatever garments they were going to paint now if you go to this basilica I believe it's

1043
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:41,920
outside of Rome and you look very closely at that icon you will see that she's wearing this red

1044
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:48,560
sheer silk cloth in the image and if you look at the border very very closely you're going to see

1045
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:54,640
Arabic writing in the border and if you read the Arabic writing it states over and over repeatedly

1046
01:42:54,640 --> 01:43:00,320
in the border Muhammad is the only true prophet of God and it goes around the border of this icon of

1047
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:09,760
the virgin Mary who is isis when you look at the isis of course so right and isis by the way yeah isis

1048
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:15,200
is the Greek name for that goddess it's not the Egyptian name for that goddess yes it is the queen

1049
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:20,320
of heaven which is also mentioned you know how earlier in the hour we mentioned this is all the

1050
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:25,520
revived goddess religion let's let's get into you want to really get something in that's going to

1051
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:30,240
people can sink their teeth into or maybe not want to hear let's do that let's do have a lot of time

1052
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:36,880
okay the revived goddess religion is as such now is that when I used to speak on this people you

1053
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:41,200
say Greek your anti feminine is this no that's bullshit you know why because if someone

1054
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:45,520
card jacked you with a ski mask and then you found them later let's say the authorities capture them

1055
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:50,720
and you pull the ski mask off and it would happen to be a woman if you say you were card jacked by

1056
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:56,400
woman does that make you anti feminine or is it the card jack or just happened to be a woman it

1057
01:43:56,400 --> 01:44:02,320
doesn't make you anti feminine right you see we have this particular goddess religion that is

1058
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:10,320
against mankind not women or goddess is because one of the chief goddesses in that realm is Sophia

1059
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:16,880
wisdom and she is not malevolent she is benevolent now let's piece together a decade worth of

1060
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:20,080
research and I'm going to paraphrase here I'm not going to give a lot of references but anyone

1061
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:25,280
that goes down this path will stumble across this revived goddess religion as you mentioned ISIS

1062
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:30,400
and other things like that you will see now what I have discovered now I'm going to do a big paraphrase

1063
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:36,320
here because I can't even go into the details just too much time the revived goddess religion in

1064
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:40,880
the ancient goddess religion especially around the time of the flood was based on this are you ready

1065
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:45,840
this is what we're going to sink your the audience hopefully will have this sink into their minds

1066
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:52,080
okay here we go the teaching of this goddess religion because most religions have teachings do they

1067
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:59,280
not right the teaching of this goddess religion is that mankind was once in a godlike state

1068
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:03,920
and in that godlike state they were either hemaphroditic or asexual

1069
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:11,200
and the way you promote man to be in a godlike state is that you promote male with male union

1070
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:17,680
and when the males unite they become a feminine and sterile and when the females unite you promote

1071
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:23,280
female with female union they retain their fertility and might even take on masculine traits

1072
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:29,200
and they procreate without the men and when they procreate without the men they will have asexual

1073
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:34,960
or hermaphroditic men or people and that then you know you are going into a godlike state

1074
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:41,600
that's why I stated earlier all of your sciences all of your cultures have repatren or matren deity

1075
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:48,800
now have you ever heard of in vitro fertilization genetic babies right artificial insemination

1076
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:55,040
yeah we actually a Francis christian institute was our topic of the discussion last time we spoke

1077
01:45:55,040 --> 01:46:00,720
when they finally announced that it was legal to create genetically modified babies yes have you

1078
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:05,600
ever heard of gender bending chemicals like fafallates or plasticizers where the fish change

1079
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:12,160
sexes and when the swim in water that has plastics in it right yeah all of this on and on and on

1080
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:19,840
now is not as iris just in beaver sorry yeah or so so you know yeah that's fine here's the point

1081
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:26,640
though when you look at this now let me uh mentioned as we did earlier the justice is the matren goddess

1082
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:33,360
of the western world that is used in the legal or the legal court system is it not do the legal

1083
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:40,080
or the attorneys rely on scientific testimony don't they evoke witness testimony from scientists

1084
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:46,240
and don't scientists publish documents only after they pass legal scrutiny so can't we say that

1085
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:52,000
the scientific community is working with the legal community and can we say that the scientific

1086
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:57,360
community is engaging in a religion that is part of this revived goddess religion this is not a

1087
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:04,000
stretch folks this is an explanation not just a description see this is one thing that you do find

1088
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:10,160
in the world in a vacademia which is why i hate it so much i don't you see i hate what they do

1089
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:13,760
and what they do is they provide descriptions explanations are not allowed

1090
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:20,160
you see yeah yeah they do not explain it they just describe it and you don't ask questions so

1091
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:25,600
so the point here is the scientific community the religious community the legal and law

1092
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:30,080
community the government community your entertainment community i can say the entertainment

1093
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:34,560
community also i think on this you might vouch for it for you man is involved in the revived goddess

1094
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:42,480
religion aspect right um i mean are we not battling isis at this very moment in name only yeah yeah

1095
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:48,000
the isis thing is interesting because you know obviously the isis is all funded by western

1096
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:53,840
interests it's not just the us it's france in england very heavily all of those two yodas that

1097
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:59,360
you see them driving the new ones are manufactured in texas and the reason why they use the ones made

1098
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:04,640
in texas is because they have the slightly larger radiators or cooling systems that function better

1099
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:12,400
in the desert how do you know just things yeah when i saw war on isis on the headlines it is

1100
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:20,560
you know it i can't help but say it shocks me you know because i look just please carry on yeah

1101
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:25,200
now this this stuff with isis you know they are radical islam you know well but the thing is

1102
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:30,480
islam is not based on the korean and let's just be respectful you know the noble korean because it

1103
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:35,840
is a noble document and the reason why it's a noble document is it because it refers to the spiritual

1104
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:41,520
realm with accuracy just like the biblical text is the noble document here i want to interject

1105
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:45,520
one more thing here for you mean you're ready this is something else that the audience might find

1106
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:51,360
of great value if you read the korean and do what's in it do you know that there is several syrias

1107
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:56,400
in the korean that state that a muslim or a believer or a faithful one will acknowledge that the

1108
01:48:56,400 --> 01:49:03,200
law came from moses and do what moses says so let me repeat that there are syrias in the korean that

1109
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:07,920
state that if you're going to be faithful you're going to acknowledge that moses provided the law

1110
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:14,400
as a prophet and you will do what moses says you get that now how do we how do we know what moses says

1111
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:18,320
where do we get that well would be the first five books in the biblical text right where you find

1112
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:24,160
a lot of the laws well if it's korean tells you to do that or it's written that you do that how many

1113
01:49:24,160 --> 01:49:30,640
muslims do the Passover or you know do this or do that that's found in the biblical text none

1114
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:37,840
even though their text says they should right yeah gotta keep this team separated from that

1115
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:44,160
team right now all islam is all christianity is all hinduism is all buddhism is or whatever is a

1116
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:50,720
geographic adherence to whatever pagan deity ancient deity was geographic that's why when you look

1117
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:56,000
at christianity in Rome it's different than christianity in the east eastern orthodox it's different

1118
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:00,560
than christianity in england it's different than christianity in the bible belt is different than

1119
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:06,560
christianity in mexico because all it is is the revival of these local geographic entities with a

1120
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:12,080
christian name on it the same with islam you have over 40 different factions in islam the three or

1121
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:19,600
four major ones and they all do whatever local pagan deity was settled into that geographic area

1122
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:28,000
with a muslim name on it the same with hinduism the same with buddhism now in the eastern text you

1123
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:33,760
know when you look at buddhism for example you will see that they do certain rights and rituals but

1124
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:38,480
that's not what it's based on if you study it's based on living a life with integrity there's a

1125
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:44,000
story i like to throw out there for example where a woman her child was eating too many sweets and

1126
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:48,880
she went to the buddhism for advice and the buddhism for a total of come back in a month and i'll

1127
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:54,240
talk to your child she comes back in a month and they talk to the child about you know not eating

1128
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:59,120
so many sweets and the mother asked why did you tell me to come back in a month and he replied

1129
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:04,560
that at the time when you first came i was eating a lot of sweets myself because i was traveling so i

1130
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:12,000
had a weight a month so the buddhism is about living life with integrity not about what you see out

1131
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,800
there right now in the same with hinduism and the same with christianity there is by the way you will

1132
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:22,560
not find christianity in the biblical text it's made up by simon magus right you will not find

1133
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:30,720
judeism as such in the biblical text either that is a post-tomatic post-babalone in adaptation

1134
01:51:30,720 --> 01:51:39,760
it goes on and on and on and on that i'm saying this respectfully to honor mankind

1135
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:48,320
when we need to release people from their religious triggers their political triggers and all

1136
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:54,800
of the triggers that are just being unleashed on the world right now and we've made it to the end

1137
01:51:54,800 --> 01:52:02,880
of this hour great and i i wanted to get just um these final thoughts in in the idea that

1138
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:10,640
we can see this world that is is creating hermaphroditic reality and again folks that's hermys

1139
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:17,200
and aphrodite and you will find them in almost every nation's capital i mean in every state capital

1140
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:24,240
the hermys aphrodite i've covered this over and over again showing you all the different aspects of the

1141
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:31,440
hermaphroditic goddess worshiping system that is around you at all times this is your obelisk and your

1142
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:40,160
dome this is you know why they put the millennial dome across from big bend this is the hermaphroditic

1143
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:49,520
hermys aphrodite system that is coming to play in this crazy world that we live in that is absolutely

1144
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:58,960
wrapped up in this middle east union the concept of the anti-christ this one world dominated by

1145
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:06,640
i guess a being possessed by Satan any final thoughts on that will be coming and that would be it

1146
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:09,840
and by the way i know that you've done a lot of work with free masonry and you've

1147
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:15,280
looked at free masonry you will see it echoes a lot of the things that we discussed uh... and hopefully

1148
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:20,480
anyone else who has will this will benefit them in their studies of free masonry because it tends to

1149
01:53:20,480 --> 01:53:25,840
be the de-juretopic as well you know luminonity free masonry when it went out the same you will this

1150
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:32,240
will sort of clear things up and also uh... if anyone goes to the uncommon radio website right now

1151
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:36,800
it says done for a little while but we will have some things that you could sink your teeth into in the

1152
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:43,680
near future and perhaps even before this is aired uh... so that's pretty much and uh... maybe we'll do

1153
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:49,840
this again and we can get into specifics based on what kind of reaction uh... is garnered from these

1154
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:57,200
presentations right absolutely i will be looking at all of those emails uh... i want to thank you

1155
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:03,840
guys again uh... members for all the kind words you sent me and i think i have written everybody back now

1156
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:10,400
and it's really good to hear from you it really lifts my spirits and it's awesome to to feel all of us out

1157
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:17,280
there i can't wait for that moment where we're all really drawn together whether it takes a catastrophe

1158
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:24,960
or if we just finally decide to turn the tide and walk another way uh... i can't wait for us to all

1159
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:33,040
really come together the whole point of this show really is to not be pranked by the system

1160
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:40,240
to not have this common reaction that's going on from the triggers that are so obviously placed

1161
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:48,160
throughout time to boil up into now and to be secure in your own person so that you don't feel the

1162
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:54,720
need to have to strike and lash out outside of yourself but only deal with what's right in front of

1163
01:54:54,720 --> 01:55:03,200
you and around you because there's plenty going on uh... in your life right now and we just need to

1164
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:09,520
reach out and communicate and contact and become closer and closer together i have that's that's my

1165
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:16,800
only hope for humanity but i see how crazy it is and i see how the triggers happen and i can't

1166
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:21,440
believe people are rioting in the streets right now and pulling people out of their cars and beating

1167
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:30,960
them up uh... this to me is is the most bizarre thing and to have you on the before the greek uh... i

1168
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:34,880
had to put the gun there uh...

1169
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:42,080
with you stating that your vote is your vow and that you accept what the electoral college is going to do

1170
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:46,560
obviously nobody cares about that either

1171
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:49,600
perhaps not yet but again uh...

1172
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:54,720
the the only thing i would say to people is if you can objectify what's going on then you will learn how

1173
01:55:54,720 --> 01:56:00,160
to set yourself apart from it and deal with it uh... accordingly based on your law and your deity

1174
01:56:00,160 --> 01:56:05,680
whatever kind of information that you find is being relative it's very difficult to tell someone

1175
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:10,800
what they should do and one shouldn't because you do have the ability to do that uh... that is the

1176
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:16,720
concept of free will but again uh... free will is not what people think it is uh... if you're on a cruise

1177
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:22,160
ship going from London to new york everyone on that ship is going to from one to new york but you

1178
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:26,400
have free will on where you want to spend time on that ship and this is what life is the things we're

1179
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:31,760
discussing uh... and have discussed is where the society is going as a cruise ship now what you do

1180
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:37,040
within it is up to you but what i feel like i have been parted at least with a little bit of time

1181
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:42,720
that we've spent together is uh... where this how this big ship is being navigated what you expect

1182
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:49,600
to see on the horizon that is a great analogy that is perfect folks were on this boat together and so

1183
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:55,360
uh... let's just sit back objectively watch this but i don't mean sit back but uh...

1184
01:56:55,360 --> 01:57:02,720
we know they're triggering our reaction so let's go out there and be the true soul that you are and that's

1185
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:07,120
that's the the cure you are the homeopathy of of planet earth

1186
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:13,920
mm-hmm all right well thank you greek for giving us this time and folks thank you so much for supporting

1187
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:20,240
my efforts and oh we have so much to come next week again we will be speaking with fritt spring

1188
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:26,560

1189
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:33,040

1190
01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:40,160
