1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:16,000
Beaming out across the galaxy. This is where a conspiracy on the wild side meets the perspective of a lifetime. This is the free zone with your host, Freeman.

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:36,470
The Francis Crick Institute just announced that they are going to begin DNA altering. That's right, this is going to make the UK the very first country to start producing GMO children.

3
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:56,010
Now, it is currently illegal to implant these genetically modified embryos into women, creating designer babies. But as it is now, legislation has been passed, DNA altering is going to begin occurring in the UK at the Francis Crick Institute.

4
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:16,850
Now, when you start to tell people things like this, they tell you, well, I think you're watching too many episodes of the X-Files. And people only hear what their own bias will allow them to hear. And they will throw this off into the fringe zone and never accept it into their real world concerns.

5
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:34,930
Well, today we're going to talk to the Greek. And we're going to offer some practical information, not opinions. We're going to look into all levels of our being and our media. We're going to analyze the flip side coins of Alex Jones versus Fox News.

6
00:01:35,490 --> 00:02:01,590
And the most important part that I want you to take from this, tonight we're talking with the Greek. And the reason he is coming to speak to you now is because if you know something and you say nothing, you are just as guilty. So please, welcome to the show, the Greek, as we lay out for you some of this amazing research that he has been working on. Welcome to the show.

7
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,710
Well, thank you very much for having me, Freeman. It's great to be here with you.

8
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:24,490
Well, we're going to focus some on how do we change our world today. And we're going to just get into this idea right now. Okay, there's so much information coming out at people. It's just bombarding their senses. Nobody knows what to think about. And we have what now is known as the alternative media.

9
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:44,390
But I saw that immediately as a flip side of the same coin. Everybody's still focusing on the same issues and the same false reality. And yet they want to say, well, we have this opposing opinion, so therefore it's change. What do you say to that?

10
00:02:44,390 --> 00:03:02,830
Oh, well, you see, people naturally have a desire to learn. That's what separates us from the animals. We require training where we have to dedicate a certain amount of energy to learn and get input about the environment around us and especially how we should think and speak and behave.

11
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:29,050
And this energy is being dumped or damped out by what I call the dummy load. That's what most of the media is. And if you notice, it's just done on a weekly basis. There's a weekly story. It's like what happened about we were supposed to end society three times already last year with comets and financial collapses. And none of that seems to happen, but people seem to ignore it and go on to the next dummy load.

12
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:47,710
So we need to get more practical. When I say we, meaning because we're all here together and start really paying attention. I think I mentioned before, the most occulted and the most secret knowledge is actually discovering the obvious. So we need to start looking there, perhaps.

13
00:03:48,290 --> 00:04:06,990
Isn't that the truth? I mean, everything I have ever said to anyone is straight data, resourced, backed up for you to find. And yet I'm constantly bombarded with, oh, my God, I can't believe you think this. And I'm like, well, it's in the news. It is real.

14
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:25,410
I explained how we sent a Doritos commercial to Ursa Major through using the iSCAT antenna array. And I'm getting messages. Well, you had me with your information until you brought up that we sent a Doritos commercial to Ursa Major. Obviously, you're just full of it.

15
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:40,810
And I find that people won't even hear things that don't relate to their own personal bias. And then they come back and say, well, you said this. And I'm always like, I never said that. You heard that.

16
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:58,970
Yeah. And also, I don't think anyone on Ursa Major will really get that commercial because the type of wave provocation they're doing will not make it there. It's another thing about how people consider the state of technology that they're in is another form of deception or delusion.

17
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:12,510
Because the quality of what's been given or portrayed as high technology or even, like you said, the news is qualitatively very low. And people just accept it.

18
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:24,010
Okay, so for 20 years, we've had alternative media hosts. Let's use Alex Jones as an example, since I'm friends with him. Well, I know him, and I feel like I can talk about him.

19
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:41,550
As simply being the flip side of the same coin, when 9-11 occurred, I said, don't freak out. This is all for your reaction. And in a way, I was predicting the Alex Jones type movement in saying that fanatics are going to rise at this time.

20
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:56,950
And I mean, for 20 years, this guy's been the alarm bell saying it's the end of the world. And people are all taking this into their soul and acting on this planet in a very schizoid manner because of all of this information that's being bombarded on them.

21
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:04,730
Yeah, and that has to do with things that I discussed, like, for example, what's fit and proper, what's lawful and unlawful.

22
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:12,810
And if anyone hasn't noticed, the planet right now is under an unlawful society. And this is just to go back to Alex Jones.

23
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:24,130
If it were a lawful society, people take what others say very seriously. And if someone is going to preach doom and gloom, especially and give a time period when these things should happen, and they do not,

24
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:40,310
those people won't be walking around too much longer. They're held accountable in these life and death matters. And what's going on is, because it's an unlawful society, people allow this to go on.

25
00:06:41,590 --> 00:07:02,690
Well, let's talk about that then. Let's understand our laws, legal advice, and contracts, and try to figure out where it went wrong. Because if we want to go back to the birth of America, Freemasons coming over with their goddess Columbia and establishing justice on planet Earth, let's start there.

26
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:16,070
Because, I mean, people don't even know, first of all, that their nation was founded by this secret society. And they don't know that so much of what they're coming comes through this also religious programming.

27
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:38,050
I mean, I don't want to jump topics too quick, but we're looking at laws, legal advice. We might as well also throw in there the clock. Because, I mean, it was a regulation in the small towns back in the day, in the 1600s, 1300s, 1100s, where the church bell had to be able to be heard by the next town.

28
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:59,310
And the towns would be determined, the spacing, by being able to hear this chime that sets you to the clock. And folks, if you go around and look right now, you will see on every one of your cathedrals, that's where you get the town clock. This is where time comes from. So if we want to go legal and time-agreeing, let's look at that world.

29
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:21,630
Yeah, and there's many levels to that as well. Maybe we could squeeze that in enthusiastically, the other levels as well. Like, real quick, the church bell ringing. If you look at the etymology of the word church, it came from cirque, which meant the ancient circus. And it was borrowed and syncretized from various religions. The reason they're ringing these bells in public is because of the human sacrifices that were being done in public.

30
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:39,210
So that, wow, it's like, what did he just say? Yes. We could tie that back together again. But regarding law and timekeeping and all that, when we say law, I'm not talking about traffic law, tax law, or these things like that. I'm speaking about your basis for operating in the world.

31
00:08:39,210 --> 00:09:08,410
You know, what do you eat? What's fit and proper to eat or lawful to eat? What's fit and proper to wear or lawful to wear? How do you raise a family? How do you do business? You know, all of these things are your laws, like laws of physics describe the natural world. When we say laws for mankind is that it affects or it's the impetus to how he will behave. All of that law comes from your deity. And I know it sounds kind of strange. And many people want to debate me on this. And when they do, for example, someone says, well, I'm an atheist. I don't have a god.

32
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:36,690
How do you deal with that? I said, that's easy. Do you believe in the laws of the state? And they usually say yes. I said, well, then the state is your god and April 1st is your holiday. Next. It's very simple. It's part of the operating system. Now, the legal aspect that we sense in the Western world today, when I say sense, because it's very convoluted, you can only get a sense of it if you actually put your handle and study the legal system, you'll see it's what they call based on legal fictions, representations.

33
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:56,130
So when you look at the Western world, especially if you look at the American Constitution and the preamble within the first preamble, it states that the people are to establish something called justice. It's like, wow, what is justice?

34
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:16,610
It seems to be a statue of a woman blindfolded, carrying scales. And if we do some research on that, we will find that is the revival of the ancient goddess religion. Has nothing to do with law, never did, never will. And essentially, the people from Europe were coming West to escape justice because it was destroying them.

35
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:29,010
So if you want to know something bad is going to happen, it's very easy to determine that when you see this term called justice arising in society.

36
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:52,710
Well, let's talk about her for a minute, because I was really the first expert on the goddess Columbia. And it was my second film and I laid it out there and I explained her connections to the pentagram, her connections throughout the different goddesses of Diana, Minerva, Inanna.

37
00:10:53,420 --> 00:11:11,010
And what I found, also the connection with this pentagram, then it was a year later that Dan Brown came forward with the Da Vinci Code and kind of bonded the idea of the pentagram with the goddess, but never gave any explanation, which I had done.

38
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:24,850
And so, yeah, let's talk about Columbia and this goddess justice. And because I've asked Freemasons and people at the nation's capital, who is that standing on top of the Capitol Dome? And no one knows.

39
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:40,850
Yeah, the thing is also we have to throw in here, believe it or not, there is a parallel society to this materialistic human animal type, materialistic world that we look at sentient beings. And this is the spiritual realm and it is a multitude.

40
00:11:40,850 --> 00:12:02,510
And here's the thing, if we're going to say that everyone that came before us that memorialized information, what they call the holy writs of the world, and even in the mythological texts, if they're all just a bunch of ignorant savages, and because we have iPhones and we can spin a prop and fly in an airplane, we're more advanced and we should ignore everything that came before us is quite foolish.

41
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:17,770
If we look at all the information that's been memorialized by what we might call from the ancients, far reaching back, even to the local, let's say, thousand years ago, what's been memorialized about the spiritual realm seemingly has been ignored.

42
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:36,770
And that there is a mass plurality, and yes, there are many gods, there is a hierarchy of gods, just like in the military there is a hierarchy, from the private, you know, boots on the ground enlisted guy all the way up to the colonels, generals, and the emperor, this is how the spiritual world is set up.

43
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:43,270
In other words, the military ranking system on the earth is not unique, it was actually conveyed from the spiritual realm.

44
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:47,730
That's why you'll see almost every country in the world has a very similar ranking system.

45
00:12:48,390 --> 00:13:03,490
Now, within the ranking system of the spiritual realm, especially if we take heed to what's been memorialized, it seems like these lower level, what we call ranking spiritual entities, are interacting with mankind and have been for a very long time.

46
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:10,830
And it just so happens that one of the predominant inspirational spiritual entities on the earth happens to be female.

47
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:18,230
It's not that it's because someone might say, well, Greek, that's an anti-female, feminine sentiment, it's not.

48
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:29,190
It's as if you were, let's say, robbed by someone wearing a ski mask and you caught the assailant an hour later, you pulled the mask off, it's a woman, if you say I was robbed by a woman, does that make you anti-feminine?

49
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,610
No, it just so happens to be a female in this case, you see.

50
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,970
And this is also memorialized in the ancient texts.

51
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:43,770
Her priesthood is male, and a lot of people have misunderstood it as being a patriarchal system because of the male priesthood that she has.

52
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:49,930
And when I say she, there's actually more than one goddess as well in name and in attribute.

53
00:13:49,930 --> 00:14:01,710
But this is a long-winded preface before getting into the goddess religion, because you'll see there's the concept of ISIS, Columbia, decay in ancient Greece.

54
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:12,410
There's the Statue of Liberty, there's justice, Lady Liberty, all these things, they hearken back to this very similar type of system.

55
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:23,460
Yeah, and it's being carried forth in near secret, but yet at the same time, our capital is the District of Columbia.

56
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,440
Yes.

57
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,560
And there's not a single person I know out there that ever asked the question, well, who is Columbia?

58
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,920
I think I was the first.

59
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,300
Yeah, probably.

60
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:43,640
And even though it's, well, you know, it's pretty obvious though, wherever you go, you do see it, but no one wants to discuss it, as you would have been probably the first to do it, as you say.

61
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:56,420
But what needs to be looked at is very simply, when you're brought into, let's say, the paradigm in the law or legal system is justice, for example.

62
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:04,400
And you ever noticed, it's in the language, if you listen to what's being said, you are brought to justice, you serve justice, there's a miscarriage of justice.

63
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,620
And where is the law in that, you see?

64
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:16,940
Because when we study the history of it, these goddess religions impart great cruelty to the societies that adopt them.

65
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,620
Now, it sounds kind of harsh, but I'm not making this stuff up.

66
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,280
You know, this is a fact.

67
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:41,940
Typically, the societies that have adopted these, again, I'll repeat myself, adopted these goddess religions, end up falling into situations of great cruelty and apathy, and a level where humans intuitively sense things shouldn't really be this way.

68
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:49,960
But yet, your common citizen or plebeian or person will say, or man or woman will say, I want justice, we need to bring him to justice.

69
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:55,540
Well, if you keep asking for it, you're going to get what you're asking for.

70
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:12,240
And henceforth, a lot of the complaining and bickering and whining about the justice system, there is nothing wrong with the justice system when they speak about corruption and cruelty and privatization and monetization and all this stuff going on.

71
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,800
That is inherent in that goddess religion, or the revival of it.

72
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,560
Well, so we've made these social contracts with these people.

73
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:39,680
And really, as you're saying, in our more and more atheistic mindset, I mean, we are controlled by deist, the free masonic order, the orders in charge, you know, you have to accept that, you have to state that you believe in a higher power, a deity.

74
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:47,860
But yet, when we're looking at a Masonic lodge, you will see the Koran, the Torah, or the Bible, all on their altar.

75
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,300
Yet, Freemasonry has all the trappings of religion.

76
00:16:51,300 --> 00:17:00,580
So this obviously is a keen underpinning of why we have a goddess Columbia in their religious belief system.

77
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:09,660
But also just the idea that this religious programming, this tradition is idolized.

78
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:16,079
And, you know, we're like, we're not going to allow somebody in that isn't in the club that believes in religious programming.

79
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:23,140
And, you know, so let's look at where their mindset comes from in this religious programming.

80
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,500
We already got into the idea of the time, and we'll get deeper into that as well.

81
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:34,700
Sure. But in terms of the religious programming, it's beyond programming, it's more of the operating system.

82
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,620
And use the computer model, you know, the actual machine we call computers these days.

83
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:45,360
When you first start one up, you don't install a program, you install an operating system.

84
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,840
And then the program and then the files.

85
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:56,600
The operating system of, let's say, nation building or nations or groups of people, is that their government has a patron deity.

86
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,380
And you will find this throughout the entire history of mankind.

87
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:11,160
What's unique and what's going on today is that that concept has been brushed, not only under the rug, but out of the room and into oblivion.

88
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,180
No one is discussing what patron deity this nation has.

89
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,680
And this is the actual part of the operating system that you mentioned.

90
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:27,700
The Freemasons, they tend to be, you know, like it's said, a secret society and that they hold certain things in knowledge.

91
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:33,120
They do have this in their structure, the concept that each nation has a patron deity.

92
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,500
But they don't discuss it and they can't cognitively recall it, but they do sense it.

93
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:48,080
And part of speaking out publicly is that people go to a lot of these secret societies thinking that they actually have some deep knowledge.

94
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,540
And they don't anymore.

95
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,500
And I know this might be like kicking them in between their legs.

96
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:00,500
But what I mean by that is, you know, someone like Henry Ford, who started a car company on his own.

97
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:05,200
Do you think you can take his great grandson and give him all the resources and he can start a car company?

98
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,080
Probably not.

99
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:12,100
The people that originally formed a lot of these secret societies were very unique and very talented in that field.

100
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,900
And the people that come after them are just simply going through the motions, if that makes any sense.

101
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,260
Oh, absolutely.

102
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:26,080
You know, I don't for a second believe that George W. Bush or even Jeb Bush is a devout Christian.

103
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,240
And, you know, what does that even mean?

104
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,620
Can you get into that?

105
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,700
Sure. Well, this is a general thing, like you mentioned, in the Freemasonic Lodge.

106
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:39,100
They have the various holy writs of the corresponding religions, let's say.

107
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,100
And I have made this statement and have been making it and have not been proven wrong for years now.

108
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:51,340
That there is not a religion on the planet, bar none, that does what is allegedly in the text that they subscribe to.

109
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,300
And this is the truth.

110
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,720
And it sounds shocking on its face, but it's true if you look at it.

111
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,900
Now, religion just means something you do regularly.

112
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:06,600
Like if you brush your teeth and tie your shoes every day, that is a religious act.

113
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,300
It just means something you do regularly.

114
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:15,160
And because religion tends to tie in with a spiritual side of humanity or the gods, let's say,

115
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,120
that ties in back where you get your law and what you do based from your god.

116
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,900
But people are not acknowledging this.

117
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,540
And this type of discussion is typically not popular because, again, using the computer model,

118
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:32,760
if you're going to discuss computers, you might discuss this program, how you interface with it,

119
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,880
or the color of the webpage.

120
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:37,360
But no one wants to discuss the machine code, the C++.

121
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:43,440
You see, and this is what we're discussing is the machine code or the code behind what we call,

122
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,940
not just modern, but civilization at large.

123
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:55,000
And this is also probably a good point or very opportune to go into what's called timekeeping

124
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,540
because it is very important.

125
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:08,440
So with that, maybe we should mention that there's anomalies in people believing that the calendar is a timepiece.

126
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,200
How many times have you heard, you know, ask someone what day it is,

127
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,860
and they emphatically tell you something between January and December

128
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,560
and something between Monday and Friday with a number thrown in,

129
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,940
as if that is actually a timepiece.

130
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,540
It is not.

131
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,940
What we on the planet today are using as a calendar is not a timepiece.

132
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,900
You cannot reckon time with that calendar.

133
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,420
What I mean by that is if, let's say, you celebrate a birthday,

134
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,700
you'll notice that it's on a different day of the week every year.

135
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,180
What that calendar simply is, it is a work schedule for PAPL subjects.

136
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,560
I'll just say it one more time.

137
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,440
It is simply a work schedule.

138
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,140
That's why it's called the work week and the weekend.

139
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,720
You cannot keep time with it.

140
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,460
But just like a multiple choice question and answer test,

141
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,720
they give you four months out of the year that similarly denote

142
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,580
the correct correspondence of timekeeping.

143
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,000
Like, for example, septem means seven.

144
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,920
Octo, like octopus, means eight.

145
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,940
Nova means nine.

146
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,080
And decem means ten.

147
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,880
But everyone's writing December as twelve, November as eleven,

148
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,820
and so on and so forth.

149
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,980
So the way that time is being kept is part of the operating system as well.

150
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,900
And this is a recent phenomenon that the entire world is under this PAPL work schedule,

151
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:26,320
which is pretty fascinating to see in itself, how they've pulled that off.

152
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,280
Yeah, definitely.

153
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,340
Do you have any thoughts on the fact that we now have a Jesuit pope?

154
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,540
Not much.

155
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,880
Because here's the thing.

156
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,740
What's interesting is if you look at Christianity as you brought up,

157
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,640
and with the modern Catholic system,

158
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,560
and just to make a quick slice of what that really is,

159
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,180
first of all, you will not find Christianity in the biblical text whatsoever.

160
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,320
And second of all, the biblical text,

161
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,560
which is delivered to the world today based on what's called the King James Version,

162
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,780
is not a translation of what is known as the scriptures that are preserved in Hebrew and Greek,

163
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,220
correspondingly meaning Old and New Testament.

164
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,360
What is called the Old and New Testament,

165
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,300
which you will not find that in the text either,

166
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,440
that is, subtitles that have been put in after,

167
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,980
have yet to be translated to this date.

168
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,380
So what they have is a version that has been custom-tailored,

169
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,660
and basically the world still does not know what is held in those scriptures

170
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,760
unless you have done private research on your own.

171
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,640
Now back to the Christianity and the Jesuit pope,

172
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:38,800
what is called Christianity is actually started by someone called Simon Magus,

173
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,240
around the first century AD,

174
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,180
because there were things going on in the world that no one can explain,

175
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,520
things that were done in secret,

176
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,060
because the reason I'm saying they were done in secret is because they were actually public events.

177
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,240
So, go figure.

178
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,760
And they tried to syncretize, through syncretism,

179
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,960
they tried to explain modern day events in their time

180
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,920
by putting together all of these, let's call them pagan religions

181
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,220
from all over the world in concepts and traditions,

182
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,820
and they formed early Christianity.

183
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:14,260
Like for example, if anyone does any referencing to texts that are preserved,

184
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:20,760
these are secular texts about the Christians being thrown to the lions in the Colosseum.

185
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,400
If you go look at the texts that are preserved,

186
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,500
what they were actually doing,

187
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,680
because they would actually announce a decree before the games start,

188
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,160
just like they sing the national anthem before a baseball game,

189
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,520
and in those decrees before they allegedly threw the quote-unquote Christians

190
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,400
into the lions in the Roman Colosseums,

191
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,800
you will see that in the decree it states that

192
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,000
the reason they are thrown into the lions is because they are atheists.

193
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,780
In other words, they have an unidentifiable god.

194
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,180
This is really bizarre, but I'm not making this up.

195
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,580
Anyone who wants to really do the legwork can discover this.

196
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,800
Now what's interesting is that the syncretization

197
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,860
of all of the religions then solidified around the time of Constantine

198
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,780
and up until the first century AD,

199
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,220
and you have what's called the Catholic Church,

200
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,020
which is universal.

201
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,800
It's like we've swept everything that we can

202
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,400
and brought it up into one big pile,

203
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,520
and we've mixed it all together,

204
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,640
and we've syncretized it, and this is what it is.

205
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,000
It has no bearing on the biblical text whatsoever.

206
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,680
Yeah, I don't think many people are reading in Greek or Hebrew in these days.

207
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,240
Well, yeah, and even the thing, you know,

208
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,940
what's interesting when you do read in Hebrew or Greek,

209
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,920
or even in English, to understand the text,

210
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,560
it doesn't say that you need to learn any particular language.

211
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,320
It states that you have to have the ability to perceive with eyes and ears.

212
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,620
Okay, so on that thought,

213
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,720
and to take this to kind of back to the beginning

214
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,220
and on to another level,

215
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,000
when talking about the 9-11 programming

216
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,360
and the idea of the alternative media

217
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,020
then saying it's an inside job, it's an inside job,

218
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,780
you know, I was quickly one of the people saying,

219
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,500
no, you're throwing yourself into the fire.

220
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,640
They are going to use your own homework

221
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,760
to bring America to a war crimes tribunal.

222
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,900
And so, with everyone that is out shouting,

223
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,240
the government did a 9-11,

224
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,740
they are therefore throwing their own nation under the bus

225
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,060
without looking at the whole picture.

226
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,320
And I feel that, you know, it began in the Middle East,

227
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,180
it's going to come to the Middle East,

228
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,880
it's in the Middle East right now,

229
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,980
and with America coming down

230
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:47,340
and this potential of being called forward for universal war crimes,

231
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,880
what do you see going on in the Middle East?

232
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,980
Why is this such an important time and place right now?

233
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,540
Oh, from a geopolitical and from a large,

234
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,220
let's say, looking at the forest through the trees,

235
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,540
where now we are going above the forest,

236
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,940
looking at the entire forest,

237
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,560
you will see through history,

238
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,060
and I don't mean history like we started off,

239
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,320
alternative media just focusing every week on what happened,

240
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,900
but looking at history in thousand-year chunks,

241
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,640
let's say, or millennial or ages,

242
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,140
even in secular history,

243
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,700
you will see that it is stated

244
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,620
that civilization started in the Middle East.

245
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:29,220
And there is a lot of preaching and teaching

246
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,800
and all this stuff about we're in the end times.

247
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,900
Well, we're really not, but we are,

248
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,980
because it's not really, it hasn't been defined properly.

249
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,620
But what's interesting about everything starting,

250
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,900
like grandma said, what goes around comes around,

251
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,320
it is established through history

252
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,860
that everything started in the Middle East

253
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:51,700
and things are going to sort of wrap up in the Middle East.

254
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,480
And what you're seeing right now

255
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,360
is the precursor to the formation of a Middle East union.

256
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,220
Unlike the EU, see, the EU is also a union of nations.

257
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,120
It's going to be very different

258
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,220
than how the EU is operating today,

259
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,320
just to give the EU, meaning European Union, as an example.

260
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,800
Like I said, any time you preach doom and gloom,

261
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,580
you'll be popular.

262
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,540
And when they were preaching doom and gloom

263
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,580
during World War II with all of the bombing

264
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,740
and terror raids that were being done in Europe,

265
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,480
it was very convincing to say it's the end of the world,

266
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,020
and obviously it's not.

267
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,540
When I say world, meaning man's rule on earth, right?

268
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,880
So what had happened during World War II

269
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,700
was like the pulling out of teeth

270
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,640
of nationalistic governments.

271
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,420
Because you can't have, let's say,

272
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,300
ten nations forming a union

273
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,780
if they're independent and nationalistic

274
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,620
and don't want to work with each other.

275
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,840
So what people are witnessing

276
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,340
is that going on in the Middle East at the moment.

277
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,720
So a Middle East union.

278
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,720
In the future, yes.

279
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,300
And there are many, many, many details regarding that.

280
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,960
And it's not very difficult to see,

281
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,800
just as if, for example,

282
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,580
if someone is trained in chemistry,

283
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,220
and you're not,

284
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,500
and you walk in and speak with this individual,

285
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,920
he might say, well, don't touch that,

286
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,200
or don't mix this with that.

287
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:14,720
And you're like, why?

288
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,900
They're just two perfectly clear liquids.

289
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,200
What could go wrong, right?

290
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,960
So if you're studied in a certain field,

291
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,760
then you can impart that information, you see.

292
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,900
But most people seem to have wanting

293
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,080
to get stuck in this myopic, narrow,

294
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,700
oh, we're modern,

295
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,140
we don't need to look at what was written before us.

296
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,060
By the way, when you look at history

297
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,180
and other languages,

298
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,160
you know that every civilization before its fall,

299
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,600
or when it was in the period of its downfall,

300
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,380
which could have taken decades or a century,

301
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,640
always called themselves modern.

302
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,680
The Babylonians called themselves modern

303
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,120
in their texts at one point before their fall.

304
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,620
So did the Egyptians, so did the Greeks,

305
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,620
so did the Romans.

306
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,620
Interesting parallel.

307
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,220
Absolutely.

308
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,520
Well, in this modern age,

309
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,260
we are taking in tons and tons

310
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,240
of data and you were talking

311
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,760
about this info dump that,

312
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,040
this is one of the biggest problems

313
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,980
I see in our current trying

314
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,120
to change the world,

315
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,720
is that we just don't even know

316
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,640
what to focus on anymore.

317
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,000
And we get data, data, data.

318
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,500
And every day there's another thing

319
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,760
that you can twit and Skype

320
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,200
and chat and Facebook about,

321
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,820
social media all over the place.

322
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,560
And it's just going haywire, Greek.

323
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,520
And so let's talk about that.

324
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,080
Sure.

325
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,580
A real simple way to do that is,

326
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,300
let's just sidetrack here for a minute

327
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,180
and go right back to it.

328
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,080
Let's say we got a job working in the sewer.

329
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,000
It's the only job we could get.

330
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,740
It pays real well.

331
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,180
Do you skinny dip and drink the water

332
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,100
or do you put on a full hazmat suit

333
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,080
with breathing tanks?

334
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,560
Probably the second part.

335
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:53,920
Okay.

336
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,520
So anyone that does any research in society

337
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,140
will see that it's basically a sewer.

338
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,040
Every aspect, whether it's science,

339
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,180
within that system,

340
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,000
medical, legal, religious,

341
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,300
it's all really bad.

342
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,500
It couldn't be any worse,

343
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,140
like the frog being boiled kind of thing.

344
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,720
Everything is a little bit worse today

345
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,580
than it was yesterday,

346
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,280
but not as bad as it's going to be tomorrow.

347
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,460
It's a very gradual downslide that plateaus.

348
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:20,260
Okay.

349
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,540
So are we going to drink the water?

350
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,980
Not really, or the Kool-Aid

351
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,080
or whatever you want to call it.

352
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,500
So what that means then,

353
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,680
if you're going into the sewer

354
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,620
wearing protection,

355
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,580
you're actually setting yourself

356
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,220
apart from the medium.

357
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,360
You're creating a buffer zone

358
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,300
or a boundary layer

359
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,420
and you walk away from it.

360
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,660
An example for this,

361
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,400
just to fast track this thought,

362
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,920
is, for example,

363
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,220
during an election season,

364
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,340
people are always bickering

365
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,000
about following political leaders

366
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,520
and how the government is bad

367
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,800
and we can change it or whatever.

368
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,260
But when they do have,

369
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,360
let's say, an election,

370
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,760
and by the way, voters don't elect,

371
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,080
electors elect.

372
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,380
The word vote means that you are vowing

373
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,580
that whatever the electors do,

374
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,980
you'll stand behind it.

375
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,740
That's like a bombshell right there.

376
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,000
But if people want to change,

377
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,900
let's say, the way their government operates,

378
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,720
if no one at all,

379
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,120
this has to be an all or nothing,

380
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,400
if no one showed up to vote,

381
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,180
not a one person at all,

382
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,620
not even the crickets,

383
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,480
all of the government buildings,

384
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,720
local, state, city and federal,

385
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,400
will be empty.

386
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:30,380
Why?

387
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,740
And then anyone can walk in

388
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,520
and take the position.

389
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,200
Why?

390
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,620
Because they're going to say,

391
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,700
okay, the gig is up,

392
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,560
the next thing is we're in deep trouble

393
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,680
so we better leave now

394
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,640
while we're still alive.

395
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,260
You see, not violent revolution,

396
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,280
not protesting,

397
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,000
not all the stuff you hear,

398
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,720
it's all about the people.

399
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,040
I definitely see that.

400
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,920
I was introduced to

401
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,540
the Celestine Prophecies

402
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,060
by James Redfield

403
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,280
and it really described

404
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,540
what was going on

405
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,420
in my own personal view

406
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,480
as life had swept me up

407
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,020
and presented me

408
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,400
an experience that I could have

409
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,500
never imagined

410
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,340
or thought up on my own.

411
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,580
And at this moment I realized,

412
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,360
oh my God,

413
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:32,020
to be open to the opportunities and the possibilities that are being given to me.

414
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:42,240
And I have to be in a happy mindset, friendly and agreeable for miracles and angels to enter

415
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,480
into my life.

416
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:54,040
And I found that if the world followed these simple insights of connecting with beauty,

417
00:33:54,740 --> 00:34:01,000
therefore finding your inner peace and then projecting this out as an energetic form of

418
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,940
your soul, that that will attract the right energies coming back and you will find miracles

419
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,780
going on in your life where you're like, wow, I would have never thought to do this.

420
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,860
This is perfect.

421
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,940
Wow.

422
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,300
How did this even happen?

423
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:22,580
Well, what's interesting about that, it sounds wonderful, but we, in order to get to the

424
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,560
manifestation point, we need specifics.

425
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:29,500
And there's certain generalities that work, like most people that operate what they call

426
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,159
an automobile don't know how to rebuild the engine, but they know if they put the key

427
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:36,260
here and push this pedal and turn that, they're going to get the job done.

428
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:42,920
And when we're discussing help from the spiritual side, most people are completely devoid of

429
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,040
it.

430
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:48,800
Like for example, when people say angels and gods, they are under the misconception that

431
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,900
all of that is benevolent.

432
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:57,260
And if you are not benevolent, you are always going to show as being benevolent, you see.

433
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:03,180
It's kind of like if someone's going to counterfeit a note, do you use a crayon and draw a quick

434
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,820
doodle of Ben Franklin and write a hundred in the corner with a crayon, or do you try

435
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,200
to make it look like the original note as close as possible, you see?

436
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,120
So mankind has fallen for a lot of this, and we do need specifics.

437
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,480
And these specifics are part of what's going to be coming in the future regarding the spiritual

438
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:20,860
realm.

439
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:29,800
Well, using the concept of the idea of counterfeiting, you know, I would say at this time and space

440
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,360
that money is the deity of most people right now.

441
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,300
Sure.

442
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,640
And you know, most people refuse to research things that they established as things to

443
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,320
be worshipped.

444
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,000
Like, for example, like we mentioned earlier, you will not find anyone that categorizes

445
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,740
themselves as having a particular religious faith as ever researching what that faith

446
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,980
is supposed to be based on.

447
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,520
Because if they do, they retract and say, I can't call myself a Christian or a Muslim

448
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,320
or a Jew or a Buddhist or a Hindu or whatever, because I've researched what this is based

449
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,960
on and I just can't do it.

450
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:06,020
See people idolize and worship things, and once they get into that realm of worship and

451
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:10,800
idolization, they no longer want to look at anything about it.

452
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,620
And then it's very easy to have that system debased.

453
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,440
Like for example, all of the religions are debased currently.

454
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,420
All of the money is debased.

455
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:23,620
If you tell anyone, this is fiat currency, they say, well, I don't care as long as I

456
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,660
go to the store and get something for it, you see.

457
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:33,980
So there's this worship of things that makes mankind retract from using his cognitive rational

458
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:37,080
ability and then falls into these debased things.

459
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,780
If you ask people, why do they go to a particular temple or religion, they say, I don't care.

460
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,980
I just like there because I have a good time.

461
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,200
I feel loved or whatever.

462
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:53,480
So the worship of money is an interesting concept because what is actually being used

463
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,900
as money today is clearly not money, lawful money.

464
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:02,480
And it is just a means of exchange, unlawful means of exchange, right?

465
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:06,480
Because if you're going to do barter or exchange, it should be of equal value.

466
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,260
And no one seems to care simply because they worship it.

467
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:16,020
And anything people worship, for example, even people that go to these better universities,

468
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,220
they don't care what the professor says.

469
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,820
They just want to say, I went to an Ivy League so they can be worshipped, right?

470
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,860
If someone walks into the room and says, I have an Ivy League education, how dare you

471
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:29,780
question me about anything, you see?

472
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,540
So there's many things that are worshipped in society and money being the base of it.

473
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,920
And money is not the root of all evil.

474
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,080
It's the love of money.

475
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:43,000
And it's sort of like a joke that the spiritual realm, because they do have a sense of humor

476
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,660
apparently, is playing on humanity.

477
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,580
They probably said, let's take money away from them and watch how much they still want

478
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,820
it just to show that it's the love of money, you see?

479
00:37:53,600 --> 00:38:02,400
So these things are pretty much the money, the religion, all these aspects are debased.

480
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,580
There is nothing backing them up anymore.

481
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:09,340
And almost everything that mankind is dealing with right now is debased.

482
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,240
It has no basis, whether it's scientific, medical, and so on.

483
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,820
And the money being the root of it, because it's very hard to operate in society without

484
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,140
it.

485
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,140
And by the way, I've also said in the past, you hear a lot of these economic people making

486
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,700
comments on the economy and money.

487
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:33,240
Not a one of them ever says there's a difference between lawful and unlawful money and what

488
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,060
the money is actually based on.

489
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:39,540
If it's not based on anything, it is based on something, because you see numbers and

490
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,640
things flying around.

491
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,220
Again, escapes pretty much everyone.

492
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,240
But what I've said is that money just is portable land.

493
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,880
That's all it is, because in a perfect society, you'll be able to garner everything you need

494
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,380
from what's under your feet.

495
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,520
But when you travel and go to someone else's land, you can't bring your land with you.

496
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:04,240
So you bring precious metals and or something that is based on representation of the land.

497
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,600
So these things are very simple concepts.

498
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,660
But again, once they're thrown into the realm of worship, no one wants to look at it.

499
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:20,640
Well, this also has brought us to the level of waste and planned obsolescence and the

500
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,700
way that we are trying to make more money than we are, you know, things.

501
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,260
We're making more things than we need so that there's more empty houses than there are

502
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:36,780
homeless. And we have this built in planned obsolescence, which is only due to money.

503
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,580
I mean, what kind of idiot world would create such a thing?

504
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:46,020
Sure. Well, the thing about the homes is interesting is let's look at the Western world.

505
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,940
Remember, we said what goes around comes around.

506
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,800
Most of the Western world, meaning this hemisphere, let's call it America.

507
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:56,020
How did it start? It started with slave labor and stolen land.

508
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:01,100
Guess how it's going to kind of wrap up slave labor and stolen land.

509
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:05,530
So it's just these things are very simple.

510
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:11,250
You know, like what I mean by slave labor is back in the 80s, Ford was a motor company

511
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:15,990
was hiring line workers for 20 to 28 dollars per hour in the 80s.

512
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,210
Right now they're hiring them for 10 or 12 an hour.

513
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:19,950
Okay. Yeah.

514
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:25,910
Yeah. So minimum wage, according to a lawful perspective, should be around 23 bucks an

515
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,130
hour, about twenty two fifty right now.

516
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,470
Okay. So and stolen land.

517
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:36,290
What I mean by that is there hasn't been a legal or lawful foreclosure in the US in the

518
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:37,150
past 80 years.

519
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:40,110
It's all presumptive and people go for it.

520
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:44,970
So, boy, these are these are topics that people just don't want to look at.

521
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,030
Simple to understand.

522
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:48,710
You know, simple doesn't mean easy, does it?

523
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:50,770
Not usually. No.

524
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:54,570
Usually, as you're saying, the obvious is some of the hardest stuff to take in.

525
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,950
Oh, yeah. Yeah. You know, here's an example.

526
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,610
Throw this in maybe about the obvious.

527
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:03,090
You ever notice when you heat or cool a room, the heat goes to the ceiling and the cold

528
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,710
goes to the floor all year round.

529
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,130
So you have a hot head and cold feet.

530
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,730
But if you go out in nature, it's hot in the valley.

531
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,110
You go up to the mountain, it gets colder.

532
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,850
And if you go in an airplane towards the sun, which is supposed to be a heat source, it

533
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,870
gets colder and colder and colder.

534
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:24,570
Because could it be that in all natural biological systems, cold

535
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,010
rises and heat descends?

536
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:29,630
But in all artificial type situations, you have the opposite.

537
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:34,150
So where are the people asking their air conditioning and heating engineers?

538
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,130
Why don't you design systems that have an ascending cold and a descending heat like in

539
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:41,970
nature? Because right now we're getting hot heads and cold feet.

540
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,470
I have never thought of that.

541
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,310
And how obvious is that?

542
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,270
I mean, I am sitting here exactly in that condition.

543
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:51,250
I've got my slippers on trying to keep my cold feet warm.

544
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:53,070
And yeah, I got a hot head.

545
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,810
That doesn't make any sense.

546
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:58,150
So why would it be that way even?

547
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:02,510
Yeah, well, if you want to just give a quick slice, you know, for those that tend to be

548
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:06,550
technically or scientifically inclined, let's say whenever you have chemical

549
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:11,970
decomposition or things being destroyed or exploded, you have the heat that rises and

550
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,030
the cold that descends.

551
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:18,290
But whenever you have a chemical agglomeration where things come together and build

552
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:23,530
like natural growth, you have a cold that rises and a heat that descends.

553
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:27,710
Like, for example, if you called a medical person and said, I'm not feeling well and

554
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,770
they say, well, how do you know?

555
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,130
Well, my head is hot.

556
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,030
My feet are cold.

557
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,350
Oh, you're not feeling well.

558
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:33,230
But wait a second.

559
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,330
I thought heat supposed to rise and cold supposed to descend.

560
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:42,450
But you see, in all natural biological systems, whether it's the Earth, the planets, a

561
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:49,310
dog, a cat, a plant or you, the heat becomes dense and descends and the cold becomes

562
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:51,130
rarefied and lighter and it rises.

563
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,790
And no one is paying attention.

564
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,670
No one is going to that.

565
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:56,970
Yeah. Why?

566
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,390
Because it's right in front of us.

567
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:00,990
Right. The same with the timekeeping schedule.

568
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:06,950
You know, here's the thing, you know, the for thousands of years, the ancients kept

569
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:09,490
time using the sun, the moon and the stars.

570
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:12,490
And they were very precise and very accurate.

571
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:17,630
Like even today, if you want to convey an accurate time event.

572
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,210
Well, by the way, time is just the recordation of events.

573
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:24,250
So whenever you hear about time travel or this or time being a dimension, that's all

574
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:28,870
bunk. If there is time travel, it's traveling to a past event.

575
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,950
It's not time travel.

576
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,270
Now, Greek, that's semantics.

577
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:33,050
But think about it. All right.

578
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:38,030
So for thousands of years, people settled their debts with the full moon, which is the new

579
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:40,410
moon today. Don't you get a monthly bill?

580
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:46,530
Yeah. And the day starts at high noon, like before the electronic banking conventions,

581
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:50,910
the banks, if you made a deposit afternoon, it was counted as the next day.

582
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:55,310
Yeah. Some people say after two o'clock or whatever, but typically that's how it works.

583
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:59,770
And even this, if you go to your timekeeping authorities in Greenwich or Naval

584
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:05,210
Observatory in Colorado Springs, I believe in their website, they used to have a since

585
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,530
I've started speaking about this, I think they've taken it down.

586
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:11,650
But you can still find it under Julian calendar date that define the calendar.

587
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:16,530
And they tell you in their timekeeping authorities, they tell you that for astronomical and

588
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,150
scientific purposes, the day starts at solar noon.

589
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:23,110
But for the people, it's civil midnight.

590
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:26,130
Now, wait a second. That is such a put down.

591
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:31,530
What I mean by that is when dictionaries in the 19th century were becoming coalesced to

592
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:35,170
be put out into the public, they didn't quite know how to define words because you see a

593
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:37,970
dictionary doesn't give you the meaning of the word.

594
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:40,850
It gives you the diction of the word, how you should pronounce it.

595
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:42,990
So it seems like you know what you're talking about.

596
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:46,790
That's why when you look up a word in a dictionary, it always shows you the phonetic

597
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:50,730
spelling first, you know, like the upside down E means an A and all this other stuff.

598
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:54,890
But if you want to know what words really mean, you need to look up etymology.

599
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:58,510
But back to the dictionary, when they first started writing dictionaries, they didn't

600
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:59,650
know how to define words.

601
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:03,570
So, like, for example, when you looked up in an old Webster's dictionary, the word oats,

602
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:08,730
it's what they feed horses in England, but it's the staple of the people in Scotland.

603
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,210
What a put down, right?

604
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:17,890
So so so the scientific community and what you want to call them Illuminati or secret

605
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:24,210
societies or the people that are in the know know that the papal work schedule is not a

606
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:26,370
timepiece. And that's yeah.

607
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:32,450
Webster was a Freemason and he actually encoded many things into the dictionary like the

608
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:38,270
Bible. That was one thing should lead you to another, you know, see this reference

609
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:40,490
that and it would lead you into this code.

610
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:44,490
So, you know, even the dictionary was written by secret society.

611
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:49,410
Oh, yeah. And all the high noon, high noon is very important inside of Freemasonry as

612
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:50,950
well. Yeah. Oh, sure.

613
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:55,930
Sure. And that's how you know your concept of equinoxes, you know, equal day, equal

614
00:45:55,930 --> 00:45:57,330
night. And that's the St.

615
00:45:57,410 --> 00:45:58,930
John's inside of Freemasonry.

616
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:03,570
Yeah. But that is also erroneous because the term equinox equi meaning equal knocks,

617
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:07,910
meaning night means that there's an equal measurement that needs to be taken at night.

618
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:13,770
We can discuss that later, but the real equinox is and really freak people out.

619
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,230
It's very subtle. So the equinox is erroneous.

620
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:21,950
And even what they're calling solstices are erroneous, because if you even look in their

621
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:26,530
own documentations like weather websites, what they're calling the solstice, you'll find

622
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:31,730
like this year, the day was still what they were calling the solstice was about two

623
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:36,210
minutes shorter than the previous than the than the day that would come after that.

624
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,390
So they're not acting. But no one's checking right now.

625
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:40,770
No one wants to look at these things.

626
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:43,170
So because it's part of tradition.

627
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:49,290
But, you know, the timekeeping, the secrets and the secret societies, all of these

628
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:52,370
things are linked together.

629
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:57,810
And these secret societies, all they all they do, it's kind of like the the sewer analogy.

630
00:46:57,810 --> 00:47:01,670
They kind of look at the behavior of the masses and say, do we really want to share this

631
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:03,450
information? And they say no.

632
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,910
So they keep it to themselves to a certain degree.

633
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:09,830
But here's the thing. Then what they've done is they've removed the eyes of the people

634
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:11,490
and then blame them for being blind.

635
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,750
So it's a catch 22, you see.

636
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:21,170
So, you know, the information should go to mankind and it will not now because there's a

637
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,270
right time and a place for everything.

638
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:29,150
Right. And but in the near future, there will be a time where people will start to look

639
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:32,050
at what things are based on and referencing them more properly.

640
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:36,250
Absolutely. Etymology is an amazing study.

641
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:40,570
You know, when you start to realize where things come from, what they mean, your whole

642
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:41,550
language changes.

643
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:44,790
You start to understand the legal system in a whole new light.

644
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:50,390
You know why a human being is classified as monster or things of that nature.

645
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:52,190
Yeah. Or nice.

646
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,030
You know, you're a nice guy. This is a nice show.

647
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:57,190
People are nice. You know, if you look up that word and I don't like to give the meaning

648
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:01,370
of it because for some reason, when people look it up on their own, it has to have like

649
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:02,970
70 percent more punch to it.

650
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:04,810
And like they don't want to believe you when you tell them.

651
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:09,110
But the word nice, if you look it up in an etymological dictionary, it means foolish,

652
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:10,530
senseless, stupid.

653
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:15,870
Huh. So, yes, that's just it.

654
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:20,310
We are we are really ignorant and words are power and we know this.

655
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:25,670
Well, what they are is the action to it's the preaction to action, just like, for

656
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:26,850
example, in the military.

657
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:31,750
And in an analogy, you can have a commander sitting on one continent giving a word to

658
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:35,370
someone on the ground in another continent and then the action is conducted.

659
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:37,770
So they are very powerful in that way.

660
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:42,990
It's communication. And just like the military, before you attack, you make sure that

661
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:46,710
the opposition cannot communicate amongst themselves.

662
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:51,590
Now, if you actually look at how society is on Earth, if you think people are

663
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:54,370
communicating, you're not paying attention because they're not.

664
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:59,090
One of the first things that has been taken away is people's ability to communicate

665
00:48:59,090 --> 00:49:01,210
effectively. Amen.

666
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:06,910
Amen. Well, we open this show with the idea that the Francis Crick Institute is now

667
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:14,470
legally altering DNA and embryos and opening the door to designer babies.

668
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:21,490
And so I would like to close out this hour with you with the idea of the satanic

669
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:24,950
view, if you will, the idea of stark materialism.

670
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,570
Sure. How we've gotten there and what that's going to lead to.

671
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,210
Well, there's two aspects to that.

672
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:35,090
When we say something, let's say the mark of the beast or the end times or Satan or

673
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:40,090
the Antichrist, we in order to in order to prevent those topics or notions from being

674
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:42,990
debased, we have to go back to where those things came from.

675
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:45,850
And obviously they came from what's called the biblical text.

676
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:51,610
So we have to go and adhere to what is memorialized in the biblical text first before we

677
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:56,390
start making up porcupines and things like that, because then we are just drifting off

678
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:57,310
into La La Land.

679
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:03,010
If we go back to the text where we get the concept of Satan, we will find that the word

680
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:04,450
Satan just means adversary.

681
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,570
Like if I say black, you say white.

682
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:08,990
If I say ugly, you say pretty.

683
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,510
That means you're an adversary to me.

684
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:13,230
This is a cosmic thing.

685
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:16,650
Now, what's interesting is when we look at the ancient text, and this has nothing to do

686
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:23,590
with opinion or what you believe in, that the entire world is run by a cosmic adversary.

687
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:26,170
And for example, Satan just means adversary.

688
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:27,570
For example, court TV.

689
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:34,690
If you turned on court TV in Jerusalem, in the modern Hebraic tongue, the prosecutor is

690
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:36,490
introduced as Ha-Satan.

691
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:39,790
So it just means the adversary.

692
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:48,030
So what is interesting when we look at the ancient text regarding Satanism, this cosmic

693
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:52,870
deity or entity known as the adversary, and he does have a name, by the way, which is

694
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:57,790
memorialized in many texts, is in control, you're ready for this, of every government,

695
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:00,850
every major institution that man is involved in.

696
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:05,870
So all of your religions, all of your sciences, all of your philosophies, all of your

697
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:10,250
governments, all of your laws are controlled by this satanic cosmic deity.

698
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:11,570
Wow.

699
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:16,430
Now, what I want to say about that is when you have these groups calling themselves

700
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:22,590
Satanists, that is erroneous, because if you look at, for example, these Satanists, that

701
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:23,310
is not Satan.

702
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:25,450
Like, for example, the Temple of Set.

703
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:26,950
Set is not Satan.

704
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:29,050
Set is like the Lord of Darkness from Egypt.

705
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:33,510
And you'll have various sects that call themselves Satanists erroneously.

706
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:39,930
They are reviving these ancient balls or lords or demons of particular geographic locations

707
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,530
of the world. So again, we are not communicating.

708
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:48,650
But what I mean about the darkness, the second part to this, is that when you read in the

709
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:54,050
ancient text, beware the workers of darkness, for example, that is not necessarily visible

710
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:56,170
light and dark, but that as well.

711
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:03,290
And what I mean by this is, for example, in ancient days, society garnered most of

712
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:06,290
their behavior and materials from the light.

713
00:52:06,770 --> 00:52:08,570
The day started at high noon.

714
00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:13,030
The full moon was the full month and they used the stars and luminaries to keep time.

715
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:21,730
All of their materials to make furniture, clothing, foodstuff, buildings were garnered

716
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:26,450
from the light, surface minerals, trees, plant fibers, plant inks.

717
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:33,170
See, now this is the time of great darkness because your day is reckoned in the middle

718
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:38,490
of the night. Your new year is reckoned in the darkest season, in the darkest day, the

719
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:39,330
darkest month.

720
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:46,370
Your materials are all garnered from petrochemical products.

721
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:54,070
Can anyone really say that there is nothing that is petrochemically derived within five

722
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:55,070
feet of their reach?

723
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:56,890
All of your food is wrapped in it.

724
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:58,670
All of your materials are affected by it.

725
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:01,110
Petrochemicals come from the dark.

726
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:02,970
It's black crude oil.

727
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:05,270
And also the light destroys the dark.

728
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:07,690
If you leave petrochemicals in the light, they're destroyed.

729
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:12,990
So this is the light and dark and the satanic and, you know, and satanic.

730
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:17,610
You know, there's contrasts within each one and people fail to understand them still.

731
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:24,790
Amazing stuff, folks, his name is the Greek, and this is why he's going by getting us out

732
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:27,390
this information that no one else is sharing.

733
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:31,890
And so I can't give you a website or anything to share.

734
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:39,310
But you are now currently on AFR doing a bit of a block there and sneaking your way in

735
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:40,730
sometimes in the late night shows.

736
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:44,390
I love Danny. I just want to say that AFR has always been really good to me.

737
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:46,350
That's American Freedom Radio, folks.

738
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:48,650
Definitely check out their shows.

739
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:51,550
And you've got a slot right now you're doing, right?

740
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:56,930
Sure. And the site that we set up around that slot, it's called Ocelli.

741
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:58,490
And the Greek dot com.

742
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:05,170
And because I need adult supervision, Chuck Ocelli, I feel very much indebted to him

743
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:10,270
showing up two hours a week to be the sonic counterpart to the Greek because I just can't

744
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:14,130
do it alone. And it's called Ocelli and the Greek.

745
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:15,830
And it is on AFR.

746
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:20,330
Yes. And I do appreciate being here as well for these small bit of time.

747
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:26,010
Well, I knew we were going to have a good talk and folks, I hope you gain some from this

748
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:31,290
to really just to start to look at the obvious again and take things in deeper.

749
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:35,470
And members, you know, it always gets stranger on the other side.

750
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:40,830
So when we get back, we're going to take this thing off this out of the world and get

751
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:47,330
into advanced energy ideas, our future radioactivity, end of the world, prophecies,

752
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:52,190
predictions and everything coming for you in the members section right now.

753
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:56,230
The rest of you, thank you so much for tuning in every week.

754
00:54:56,350 --> 00:54:59,250
And I love seeing you all there at Freeman TV dot com.

755
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:04,310
And please give us thumbs up shares rates and all that good stuff whenever you're

756
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:06,950
listening to the show, especially on Stitcher.

757
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:12,390
I don't know if me bringing this up will make it go down even worse, but it seems that

758
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:16,870
on Stitcher when you're listening on your phone, you can give a thumbs up and it seems

759
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:18,990
like only the haters give the thumbs down.

760
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:24,850
So I would love to rise up in those top 100 ranks so that this show goes out to more and

761
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:30,030
more and more people because, you know, we're doing this because if you know, you

762
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:34,770
better share. And that's the last message I want to leave with you all is is share

763
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:39,390
this information with everyone that you can, because you want to feel like you had a

764
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:43,710
part in making the change and you don't want to live with the guilt of having done

765
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:48,210
nothing. So if there's no more else you can do, at least share the information.

766
00:55:48,690 --> 00:55:52,950
And that is at least, you know, the least you could do.

767
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:58,470
We all have a big job in front of us as we're learning to learn to get this true

768
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:03,430
information understood and to know what to focus on and what not to focus on.

769
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:09,190
So I'm so happy we have people like the Greek coming around to hone in our focus a

770
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:11,270
bit more. So stay tuned, members.

771
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:13,710
We're coming right back with some really good weirdness.

772
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:16,330
You're going to really enjoy this show and the rest of you.

773
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:17,650
We will see you next week.

774
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:21,030
And, you know, Freeman TV completely under construction.

775
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:22,530
So don't worry.

776
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,210
It's going to be awesome.

777
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,450
So if it's down, just don't worry.

778
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:28,410
