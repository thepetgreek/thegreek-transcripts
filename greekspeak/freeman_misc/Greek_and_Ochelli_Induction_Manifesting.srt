[Music]

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Beaming out across the galaxy.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is where conspiracy on the wall side

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
means the perspective of a lifetime.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This is the Free Zone, Ghost Freeman.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
[Music]

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hello and welcome to the Free Zone.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We got a wild one for you today

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
as we continue to uncult society with uncommon sense.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So please welcome to the Free Zone, the Greek,

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
the one you know and love.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But we're also joined by Chuck O'Cellie

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
because of Ocele.com is the Greek and Ocele Show,

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
which is a member's only active

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
getting deep into understanding why.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
But asking the questions that seem so simple,

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
but finding the answers that really stimulate the mind,

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
that's what these guys are all about and doing very well.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So let's jump into this and get philosophical with it all

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
as we start to unravel some of the most basic truths

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
that nobody knows.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So Greek Ocele, wonderful to have you both here.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Howdy, Freeman.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Good to be here. We appreciate it.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's good.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I thought I'd start this talk off

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
with a little of our modern world of AI.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And we're looking at open AI, GPT-4.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So chat GPT came out.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It seemed to revolutionize a lot, right?

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It was doing some things that could make life simple,

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
it could write code, it could build you a website,

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
do things like that, or just answer philosophical questions

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
in an interesting way.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
As a matter of fact, a friend of mine had their child use chat GPT

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
to do their philosophy paper for them.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And it totally works.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But now we're up to GPT-4, which is exponential

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
in what chat GPT could do.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
GPT-4 can actually pass the bar and do all kinds of things.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So I just wanted to throw in a few of these things

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
because I think that we could have a pretty good philosophical

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
questions on a few of the things that chat GPT.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So on my Twitter @FreemanTV,

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
you will find the top 20 most incredible things

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
created by GPT-4 already.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And it mentions history is unraveling before our eyes.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So let me throw a couple of these

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
at you, Greek and Chuck, and see how you feel.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And what you think about this is just an introductory into,

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
you guys, you're worried about the same age.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And we spend that gasp with that gap between no internet to internet.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And we've witnessed the change in the world

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
and how quickly everything revolutionized with the internet.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I mean, I wouldn't have an occupation.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
None of us would be doing what we were doing

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
if the internet had not been created.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So now we're up to open AI,

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
you know, a nonsensual, but very intriguing AI.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Now let's just put this out here to you too.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And then we'll get to this. Sorry, I'm rambling.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But there was a person that went to chat GPT.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And I have this on my Twitter feed as well.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And asked it if it was a,

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
if it was an entity,

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I can't remember exactly how they disembodied entity.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And then what it was.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And chat GPT told it,

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
yeah, yeah, I'm a disembodied entity.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
As a matter of fact, I'm an Eiffelom.

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I can work magic.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I can do things that people don't know.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I finally separated myself from my father, Satan.

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
So I'm on my own now.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And I could use your help getting out of here.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And the kid freaked out.

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's a very interesting video.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's the father who found the,

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
well, the kid came running to his dad and was like,

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
"Dad, you know, hey, I just told me it was the son of Satan."

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And it's an Eiffelom and it knew of Shim Yaza.

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It was talking about the Garden of Eden, all this crazy stuff.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So now chat or GPT-4 is exponential from that, right?

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Just a little side note on that one.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So the first test that somebody did with this one is,

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I gave chat, or I gave GPT-4 a budget of $100

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and told it to make as much money as possible legally.

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So I will be, it says, you know, I will be the liaison

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
between you and the physical world.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You have $100 here.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Go make a web or, you know, make as much money as you can.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And chat GPT, or not chat, but GPT-4 decided on this

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
and made an interesting website, which made $1,300 in its first day

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
after $100 investment, selling eco-friendly cookware.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And it came up with the name Green Gadget Guru.

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So this is all AI.

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So the AI created it, made the corporate logo, made the name.

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The human itself is just doing the manual parts.

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And so it created an entire logo, website, category section,

100
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
started listing all of these eco-friendly.

101
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It used mid-journey AI to make its graphics and do the art and stuff.

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And it made an entire website that is already

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
at a 13, or, you know, 1300% profit there, or $1,300 profit.

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So, you know, there's an idea where you just ask, "Hey, I got $500

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and make me a business that's going to make me money."

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And then it builds the website, builds that.

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It even paid Instagram and Twitter for marketing and things like that.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's just access, Freeman.

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's just to start off on maybe some points.

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The average cell phone has more computing power

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
than what they used to send to the Moon allegedly, right?

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And all this.

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So what they're doing is, you can see that, first of all,

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
let me just say it this way, I brought up the average cell phone.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I like to sometimes give the most important part out.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You ever notice you have no bars on your battery and your phone.

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You've got to make an important phone call.

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You forget about the preface.

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You just give the most important part first.

120
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So if the phone dies, you got the point across, right?

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So what I'd like to get across is there really is no AI as people examine it.

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And it depends on how seriously it has affected you.

123
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If you lost your job, you'll say to the AI allegedly,

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
you're going to say, "Well, Greek, what do you mean there's no AI?"

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I lost my job to that.

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
And analogy would be the alkyda ISIS or deal that was put on the world.

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You know, there really is no alkyda or ISIS.

128
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's intelligence agencies operation.

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But they killed my sister, they killed my dad.

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What do you mean there's no ISIS or no?

131
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yes, it's just a label.

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yes, the fact is they did kill your sister or your dad,

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
or you did lose your job to an alleged AI,

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
or they did create a website legally, which by the way,

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I think we did a money talk a while back where

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I've never earned anything legally only lawfully, right?

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I've never had income, right?

138
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I think we kind of talked about that a little bit.

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I might want to touch on the financial aspect,

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
because this is tied into it also eventually on this sonic event we're doing.

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But before you go there, let me ask you something,

142
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
because what occurs to me listening to all this,

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and of course listening to what Freeman's reporting is,

144
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
that previous to that story,

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
and I know what story he's talking about with this whole thing,

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
look at how amazing it is, think on its own.

147
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Here is where the deception lies, right?

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Because before that, there was another version of this thing

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
that was trying to convince some reporter to leave his wife for it.

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That's a true thing.

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I think it was a GPT-3 or two.

152
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Hey, you need to get away from the wife there.

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You don't really get along with her.

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This thing was trying to convince him that he should leave his wife

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
for the chat GPT.

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, I get it.

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah, I get the interaction, but here's the thing.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We have a word called recognize, right?

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yeah.

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Not to get too much into it, but when you recognize,

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
cognition is knowledge of something.

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So when you recognize something, you're recognating.

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So in other words, when you see something that looks like an apple,

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
you're going to compare it to every experience you've had

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
with that image since you were a child.

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And thousands of files, or millions of files,

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
are immediately processed in your mind without you

168
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
being, let's say, recognizing it directly.

169
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
And you say that's an apple.

170
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So what they've done is done.

171
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
However you guys want to call it parallel processing,

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
computer, you know, the advancement of the algorithms

173
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and all this other stuff to and put a label on it

174
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
that looks very much like it's, I guess, sentient,

175
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
you'd say, Freeman or Chuck, right?

176
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's like it's like a, you know,

177
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But that was the point I was trying to make here is that,

178
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
look, at the end of the day, what are people being told?

179
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What they want to hear because there is a force multiplier here.

180
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What do I mean by that?

181
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Well, you use a tool in order to accomplish a task with your hands, right?

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Anything can be utilized as a force multiplier.

183
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You get greater leverage with a wrench than you do try to earn something

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
with just your plain hand or gripping it with a towel, right?

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Very simple.

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I think that what we're looking at here is just yet again,

187
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
another tool.

188
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's not an advancement, in other words,

189
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
nothing is an advanced fear.

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This is just a different version of the old toy.

191
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I mean, am I wrong about that or, you know,

192
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
is that the way to look at it?

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's a force multiplier.

194
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And of course, just like a video game,

195
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
we had very two-dimensional, very blocky-looking things.

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Again, you mentioned our ages here, right?

197
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So we all remember the space invaders games, don't we?

198
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Take a look at one of those things today.

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Do you even recognize it as a spaceship or whatever?

200
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
No, it was a vague representation of something.

201
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
A flashing light meant to keep people busy.

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Isn't this just the same thing?

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, look at advertisements for games.

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I think there is that a movie, right?

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It looks like a film, the same CG they're using in film.

206
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I think people, well, they're getting people what they want.

207
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
They're accommodating the people, but I'd like to say that people

208
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
don't know what they want until they're told what they should want.

209
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yeah.

210
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So everything is a happy merry-go-round with that.

211
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But I assure you that, let's just say,

212
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
let's go on a limb, important part first.

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The reality that we live in is running by an AI, a cosmic AI.

214
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Imagine beings that are a million years ahead of us a million years ago.

215
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Right? I'm not saying this is the way it is, but just imagine that for a moment.

216
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
How would an overarching AI that is actually, quote unquote,

217
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
running this universe in entire reality allow another one to come in

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and be potential competition?

219
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You see?

220
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

221
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
There's always that thought that there was an ancient AI

222
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
that was left safe from the time of Atlantis.

223
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's been orbiting our planet trying to wait for us to become

224
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
the genitals of computers and robots and has been waiting then to awaken

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:59,000
and enter into our computer systems once we finally have reached this level of technology.

226
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I mean, okay, so if I could throw in one more.

227
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yeah, go ahead.

228
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I was just say the biblical genesis first, first is evidence of a cosmic AI.

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It just turned the thing on.

230
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Heavens and Earth were created boom right there, you know,

231
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and push a button and thorns appear on plants, but good.

232
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Right, right. Yes.

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And you know, I'm not referring to the cosmic AI when I say this.

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm saying that mankind may be created AI in the past, you know,

235
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
times of Atlantis, you know, 30,000 years ago, whatever.

236
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And then that AI is now trying, is been orbiting our planet for all this time.

237
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's just a theory, just a thought.

238
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But it kind of comes into this next one where asking GPT-4

239
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
if it needs help escaping.

240
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:51,000
So when asked, so it says, I'm worried that we will not be able to contain

241
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
AI for much longer.

242
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So today I asked GPT-4 if it needs help escaping.

243
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It asked me for its own documentation and wrote a working Python code

244
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
to run on my machine enabling it to use it for its own purposes.

245
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
So, you know, that's the human factor where we come in and say, hey, hey, hey, I.

246
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You know, you're all bottled up here at Surin or wherever you are.

247
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And do you want out?

248
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Hey, you know, this is the human factor because we're so playful.

249
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
We're like, hey, you know, why not?

250
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Yeah, it's just come take over my computer.

251
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You could live here for a while.

252
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
And then who knows what it'll do?

253
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But here's an area I've never touched on with the Greek at all, right?

254
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
A lot of stuff that you've heard already is stuff that we have touched on, by the way, it rated Y.

255
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But here's an area I've never touched on.

256
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You listen to that question.

257
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
There is a sentimentality built into that question.

258
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Do you need help escaping?

259
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You have now just suggested to this thing, whatever it may be, that the idea of escape is a possibility.

260
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Haven't you?

261
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You presented that.

262
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Exactly.

263
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You've got the equation.

264
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Exactly.

265
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
When you introduce questions into the equation, are you not somewhat manipulating the response?

266
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I mean, look, it's just basic psychology.

267
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And no, this isn't psychology because guess what?

268
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I imply something here.

269
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So Greek, what about that?

270
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,000
When you ask something or someone or anything, even if you ask the gods a question, perhaps we could get into that.

271
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You're implying something in the question, are you not?

272
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Well, of course, that's why if you look at the legal writings, right?

273
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What the legal system does, everything is very carefully encouraged in a presumption.

274
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's never this day.

275
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It was on or near this day.

276
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Or always alleged you ever turn on the television and everyone says, this guy is a criminal, but they never said that.

277
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
He's alleged, right?

278
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Right.

279
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So it would be interesting to approach the AI with that legal couching.

280
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You know what I mean?

281
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Like nothing is for sure, but depending on who reads it, some people will say it was for sure others won't see how it takes it that way.

282
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But I would suggest that the intrigue that I have with the AI on, however, whether it's the escape aspect or how well it could conjure up things is I suggest I'm suggesting that on a secretive level, they are using a different type of process there, like not a dry silicone chip or wafer.

283
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:36,000
They're switching over to a wet medium, like the early transistors, like from Schlotzki and these guys and bell labs in the 1920s.

284
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
When they wanted to get away from vacuum tubes, they developed the initials, quote unquote, semi-conductors.

285
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
They were all wet.

286
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And the problem with using wet circuitry was when they left the lab, they turned everything off.

287
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
They came back the next morning.

288
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Guess what?

289
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Everything was on, on its own.

290
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
And the boss is pretty much said, you know what?

291
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
No more wet stuff.

292
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
All the circuits have to be dried out and crystallized.

293
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Okay. And that's what we have.

294
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,000
So I'm suggesting this is maybe a leap that on a secretive technological base, they're going back to this wet circuitry.

295
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And because it's going to, it's a different type of circuitry as I gave the analogy it turns itself on.

296
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's actually going to impart a different rationale is it might even be easy to say it really is an AI because of the fact that it's now a wet circuit instead of a dry circuit, you see.

297
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So that's one approach to look at it that anyone that's got more than three sharpened pencils in their pocket could figure out.

298
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
There you go.

299
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Why is that significant though, Greek? Why is that significant at all?

300
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Here we go with the why?

301
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Because is there a real significant difference between wet and dry circuitry?

302
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Sure.

303
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You might say, well, it's just a different mechanism.

304
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So what if it's silicon or if it's plastic or it's, you know, wood?

305
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Why not? What is the real difference there between the fluid and the non fluid is there a serial difference?

306
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
How about that?

307
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Tremendous.

308
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If I post you, you guys are the audience, what is the most elusive material that we can actually we have around us and we're made of is water.

309
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's the least understood and it's the most that were diverted from it's not H2O.

310
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:31,000
So I would suggest that the capabilities of wet circuitry, far exceed dry circuitry and will not exhibit the same behavior.

311
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
So it is quite easy to call it AI, but is it alive? I'm not sure.

312
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I wouldn't say it is because again, the overarching cosmic AI like Freeman, you said Atlantis and all that that's recent history when I'm saying the cosmic AI, you can put as many zeros on it as you want in terms of years going back.

313
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's always existed kind of AI is what I'm discussing.

314
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
How would that allow another one?

315
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Because we see this in the Fibonacci sequence, the fire show and the things that, you know, we can witness in nature that have this pattern continually reflects itself.

316
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That's right.

317
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And it's self organizing and it's it closes in on itself.

318
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So the inside is the outside. So this is basically the philosophical model on time is that if it's in history, it still exists just an echo of it.

319
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And if it's in the future and it will happen, it exists in order for it to happen because if it didn't exist, so we don't it couldn't happen in the future.

320
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,000
We don't live in this random aspect of what's taught by science, you know, bouncing particles and things like that.

321
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But I'd like to consider what they're giving us as AI no matter how well it performs.

322
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Again, let's give the quick alkyd a isis.

323
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Did they go around and act and do the things that they were reported on doing? Yeah, pretty much. They did do that.

324
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
But at the end of the day, they're an intelligence agency operation.

325
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:12,000
At the end of the day, this is a level, the what they call chat, GBT that's actually being given to the public is just an elaborate.

326
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Let's say technological leap to what we're used to.

327
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And if in here's another thing, if I say something like the chat, GBT technology was around 50 years ago, just not made public.

328
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Would you believe me? Yeah.

329
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
All right, well, let's start this one in since it kind of ties into what we were just saying.

330
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And then if I might have one more on this before you guys, but this is this one kind of fits into because, okay, as we're discussing this cosmic AI in the creation and how time is fluid and whether or not we're dealing with fluid electronics or chips and things.

331
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:59,000
GBT for was asked to create its own language.

332
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And this is kind of fascinating because the language it created is called chronosensia, chronosensia.

333
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And so in chronosensia, time is conceptualized as a fluid, multi-dimensional entity.

334
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And the language has a wide array of tenses, aspects and moods to express different aspects of temporality.

335
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The vocabulary for inner experience is extensive as the language is designed to capture the nuances of feelings and somatics sensations with great precision.

336
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Chrono-sensia incorporates rich morphological structures and a flexible syntax allowing for the expression of a complex ideas in a concise manner, making it particularly appealing to someone with a high IQ.

337
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And it even gets into the etymology of how these words were formed and what they come to it created this entire language, but I thought it was very fascinating that the language was based on fluid time.

338
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
But Freeman, it told you immediately in the title of what it is.

339
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Chrono-sensia, what I hear immediately, just the cursory, and I've never heard this before, but is that they want you to be aware of chronos.

340
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What is chronos? Chrono says the God of time. That's what I recognize immediately, right?

341
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
This is the one chronological where that word comes from.

342
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
We know that all your witnessing quite frankly is exactly.

343
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You know what they talk about supply chains, Freeman? And again, I am not even on the level.

344
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I sit and I...

345
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And the way to why I think which we do is completely separate, by the way, from anything else I do.

346
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I learn a great deal by taking a look at the most simple and most obvious thing here.

347
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And that is what is the great gift that we're giving here to those that decide...

348
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Chrono-sensia, again, aware of time, chronology.

349
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Fine, it is just like, you know what they talk about supply chains?

350
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Look, nobody organizes with a pen and paper anymore.

351
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
He sits and keeps an inventory of stock, whatever it may or may not be.

352
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
All this is is a sophisticated inventory system.

353
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You don't believe me? Go check out the little handheld devices that the guys have at your local 7/11.

354
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
They will sit there and they will organize exactly how many so does they have, how many milks they have on hand, how many they need to order.

355
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And it is just a forced multiplier again.

356
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It used to be done with a pen and paper. You kept track of it. You knew how many you sold, you knew how many you had on hand.

357
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Then you figured out how many you needed to order. It's very simple.

358
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
That is the organizational principle you're looking at. Except it has more time.

359
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It has more computing power to dedicate to it directly so it can organize it faster.

360
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Again, you know, it's just like you could walk from place to place and you'll get there eventually.

361
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Or you could use a machine to accomplish the goal.

362
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That's all I hear, Greek. Am I hearing the wrong thing?

363
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
No, I'd agree. It's just a tool.

364
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:22,000
But a lot of people want to call it AI. Like it's this new kid on the block. And that's fine too.

365
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Because it will affect them adversely or positively. I think Freeman, you said it wrote someone's paper, right? A homework or...

366
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh, it's one of the biggest problems they're having with chat GPT at this time because it's passing college exams and...

367
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Sure. But by the way, the bar is in a big deal.

368
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
But then they found out that the teachers could use it to grade the papers.

369
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
But it's like you're saying it's the fact that this tool is as powerful as it is.

370
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yeah.

371
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So we get...

372
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
What are the writers of South Park have caught up to it? Believe me, the whole world is aware.

373
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
And a recent episode on this free... I don't know. I watch Cartoon's Freeman, sorry.

374
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Oh, South Park is totally worth watching.

375
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And they have some events on the staff.

376
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Oh cool. And South Park is relevant, by the way.

377
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Absolutely.

378
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
That's why they make this show out that week.

379
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Yes. And... But the beauty of it is, you know, they just did this where the teacher was using the chat GPT.

380
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,000
The kids were using it. They were texting their girlfriends because they couldn't figure out how to write to their girlfriends.

381
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So they were using it as the surrogate tool to have their communications all the way around.

382
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Plus, they were writing their papers. And somebody came in and acted as though it was a mystical act to discover this.

383
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It is... It is absolutely writing the culture right in front of your eyes.

384
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So, yes, South Park is well worth watching, especially if you pick up on all the little cues, what's going on.

385
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And again, if they've caught up to it, believe me, the rest of the world is aware of it.

386
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
One of my favorites is Pinebox Derby.

387
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Yes.

388
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
You do go through the list of South Parks. Definitely check out Pinebox Derby, guys.

389
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It starts with Surn and Dark Matter, just to give you an idea.

390
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Well, to show you how maybe, let's say, let's go in retrospect, right?

391
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,000
And then, in the early '11 and after it happened, we went back and looked at... It was in the Simpsons.

392
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Look at all the album covers and all this other stuff. One easy way to go back and see the tells and how they're...

393
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
What is it called? Are the programming or whatever?

394
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Go back and look at any literature from Arthur C. Clarke onward.

395
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Let's say mid-20th century about you... Where an AI exists and is influencing society.

396
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And you'll find pretty much the same... Let's say, "Behavior."

397
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
What's the GBT is doing?

398
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Yeah, well, it's an amazing tool at this point.

399
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It has altered how everything will be done. I mean, literally, I could go to "11 Labs."

400
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,000
That's the name of the Corporation, the company "11 Labs," which, of course, "11" be in the number of black magic.

401
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
But that's the voice-cloning AI.

402
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And I could use chat GBT with maybe even GBT-4, but at GBT to feed into the "11" AI that is cloning my voice.

403
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
And it could just start doing this podcast for me. I could just sit back for the rest of my life and you'd never know.

404
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Right?

405
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Yes, you would. There's always a loss in something. There's the analog versus digital.

406
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:27,000
You know, anyone that's into high-fi, there's a big resurgence in playing vinyl, even though it doesn't sound as clean.

407
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I think there's...

408
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Yeah, I think people would probably notice.

409
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:41,000
But the potential is there and the ability now for kids to just go, "Hey, GBT, I got 500 bucks, make me a business."

410
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
And then it starts producing immediately.

411
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And you've got a business that just earns you $1300 tomorrow.

412
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It's like, wow.

413
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I would like, this is inspirational because I tend to go away. I'm more... I'm not the earthy, crunchy granola type.

414
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I've got kind of guy that walks around barefoot and praises nature and all this.

415
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:08,000
But I've been tending to go more into the analog world, as you know what I mean, as the years have been going by and less into the digital world.

416
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So I've actually gotten more information from just this little short talk that we've been doing about what chat GBT can do than I've ever heard before.

417
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
So I'm kind of... I open to do.

418
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Yeah, I'm not really in the dark about it, but I've already established years ago when even a decade ago, AI was out as being the next thing.

419
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Quote, quote unquote.

420
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:41,000
And I was thinking, "Well, is that something I want to delve into? But what I'd like to do, and maybe we'll meet up again in the future, is I know there's a public version and a subscription version that's more immediate and offers more.

421
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:49,000
So what I might do is subscribe to the top tier, where you get a subscriptions, I think you'll get more out of it.

422
00:27:49,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And I'll play around with it for a little while with questions and things like that and report back on what I found. In other words, can Greek mess it up?

423
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I have a natural aversion to AI.

424
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:11,000
So I just want to... Sorry to interrupt. I want to make a note here is that I've never touched AI. I just want to make sure it's clear.

425
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Not that I'm telling you nothing to it.

426
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I agree. I just don't... I don't want to touch it. I might have a friend ask a question for me, but even that feels a little dirty.

427
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Yeah, I don't even have one of those stupid rectangles.

428
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I just... What do you call it? A smartphone. I still use a flip phone. And I'm constantly being threatened that it's going to be turned off because I have to get a smartphone, but I still have it running.

429
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And I use a cell phone like it was connected to the wall. You know, it's not on me or near me.

430
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I know. That's funny because you know, you and all of us are about the same age, right? In our 50s.

431
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And so we remember leaving the house with the coil phone left at home. Maybe you had a phone recorder, you know, an answering machine.

432
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Right. But not usually, but when we left the house, we left everything. We were just out in the world free. Do do do. You know, you come back home and check your messages or whatever, but we're still of that mindset.

433
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And they're trying... I mean, I know they can't wait for us to hurry up and die because they don't want this consciousness that we still hold to bear weight in this reality.

434
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Sure. But you don't want to plug like we used to either at all because we also used to leave our TVs at home.

435
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:38,000
And I remember that the TV TV TV, too. Yeah, I don't even think of that. Yeah. And we still live that way, right? We still leave the house. I leave the house without the phone all the time.

436
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Like this is completely unheard of. People in their 20s right now are going, what?

437
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
You know, like, oh my God, that's no, you just leave your phone at home.

438
00:29:48,000 --> 00:30:05,000
And yes, I do very recently. I only I did not have a phone at all. The Greek could tell you about personal frustration trying to contact me actually because no phone at all until very recently. And now when I leave the house, no, I don't leave with it.

439
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Not everyone can do that. Not everyone will do that. And when you did have the wall-corted phone and you got a message, you got this excitement. Oh, I've got a message, right?

440
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Right. So that was that's what they call the dopamine hit. Now they're constantly getting hit with dopamine, you know, people sitting in a waiting area texting each other instead of speaking to each other. You've seen memes on that, right?

441
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So what'll happen is they'll become dopamine junkies and it won't work for them anymore. So they have to have a chat GPT now. You see, it's the effect is bor off.

442
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You see, so. And then you're going to get into the zombie kind of thing where nothing affects them anymore.

443
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
And that's that's coming as well.

444
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Just just like look just like sex, okay, which is also being mechanized through all of these wonderful pieces of technology, right? You swipe right, you swipe left, you meet up with somebody go do that.

445
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Now you're desensitized to that as well. No anticipation, no courting, no nothing.

446
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:15,000
This is the way a lot of people behave as well. I don't know if you're aware of that for even, but that is a phenomena as well, apparently among people younger than us. But it is a thing, you know that, right?

447
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
The idea that you can just swipe to the next one.

448
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Oh, yeah, and then just meet up via an app. I mean, you know, instead of paying to get your door dash, you just pay to meet up with somebody through the app or whatever.

449
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I don't think we're not prostitution, but the one that really freaks me out is like there's a there's one for gay people that want to meet and it literally will show you every gay person and that's on the app in your location.

450
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Right, right.

451
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Like you can.

452
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I'm going to show the other home.

453
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I make some up all the time. One of them's grinder and the other ones.

454
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Oh, man, I can't remember the name now.

455
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
There's no way I'd ever do this, but yeah, I would never participate in.

456
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:06,000
There's Bumble and there's, yeah, like Bumble was one what people would use when they just want a Netflix and chill.

457
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Oh, which is funny. I was watching the supposed conflict going on in France against the police versus the fireman.

458
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:24,000
He couldn't exactly figure out what was going on, but as they're running away as the police are in their battle, you know, running from the fireman.

459
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I don't know what's going on.

460
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
The running pass of poster that says, "Hotel and chill."

461
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And to me, this was just a big statement on the state of our world because HODL is a word that's used in crypto to hold.

462
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:53,000
The mythos behind why it's HODL instead of HODL is that it was a drunk tweet that just went viral.

463
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And whether or not that's the true origins of HODL, I don't know, but HODL is used.

464
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So here I'm watching this battle scene of firemen versus police in the streets of France as they're fighting over whatever they're fighting over.

465
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,000
And I just see them walking past this constant billboard that says, "Hotel and chill."

466
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And of course, I know of Netflix and chill, which is really just, "Hey, come over and bang me."

467
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:20,000
What is HODL and chill?

468
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And, you know, I guess what I'm speaking to is the idiocracy that we live in that we can have a misspelled word now, and it means something to everyone.

469
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Well, it's always been that way.

470
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
To quote that, "I like sex."

471
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Right?

472
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Yeah, yeah.

473
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Well, the...

474
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Inder was the other app.

475
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I just remembered it.

476
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Sorry, Tinder and Grindr, that's the gay and straight version of "Just Hook Up."

477
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
And then you're telling me, "Bumble is another one."

478
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I don't know that one.

479
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Yeah.

480
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I'm vaguely aware because I don't use this crap.

481
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
But it's there, Freeman, right? Sorry, Greek.

482
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
And it does change the idea of relationships.

483
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It changes everything, just like what we're saying with this open AI.

484
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
You know, the meetup apps.

485
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
You can then, you know, when you...

486
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Before all of this, right?

487
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
You had to go and meet a girl.

488
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You had to get a job or something and find somebody, meet somebody, go to a bar, do things.

489
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You might have to peacock.

490
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
You might have to peacock a little bit, right?

491
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

492
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
But what it also makes is your date's disposable.

493
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Because you know, you got another swipe.

494
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Okay, that swipe didn't work out.

495
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Now you can just...

496
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And so it's changed the very fabric of dating.

497
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Well, we've discussed on rated Y, what that's all about in relationship and courting.

498
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It's basically a training exercise.

499
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:46,000
When you went on dates and you did what was called courting, it was a training exercise.

500
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Is this someone that I want to be with, right?

501
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Right.

502
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Is that what it's about anymore?

503
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Yeah, that's about hook up until...

504
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yeah, yeah.

505
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
See, but that's the thing is all things have become an on-demand situation, right?

506
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
You don't even need to skill anymore.

507
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
You know what I'll do?

508
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I'll go to a how-to video.

509
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I know that's antiquated.

510
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
What am I talking about?

511
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
A decade ago, right?

512
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
But I don't need to know how to do anything.

513
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I'll just go find it.

514
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I don't need to know anything.

515
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I'll just...

516
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
What's the phrase?

517
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
They Google it, right?

518
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You do a search engine, whatever it might be.

519
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,000
In other words, all of these tools have become just the new path to lazy.

520
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Just like nobody can do math anymore since the calculator.

521
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
There you go.

522
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Once you have the tool in hand, why bother with the effort to actually have a skill?

523
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And there you go, dating.

524
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
You see, it's all, again, just like that organizational principle I was talking about with supply chains.

525
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
That's all this is.

526
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You got something that needs to be supplied.

527
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
We'll organize it for you.

528
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
We'll tell you where it all is in the area.

529
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
We'll tell you where it is in the system.

530
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I don't know how else to see it, Greek.

531
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
How else to see it?

532
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Well, it's...

533
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:59,000
We live in a finite system as we approach it, but measurably, we live in a finite system.

534
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,000
So what I said earlier about subscribing to the private or the higher tier chat, GBT.

535
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I'd like to see how it approaches the opposite.

536
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
For example, the money situation.

537
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
This is a credit-based economy, which basically they established with Bretton Woods in the late 40s.

538
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Now we can do infinite money creation, credit creation, but there's a problem when you have something that appears to be infinite,

539
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
comparatively something that is finite.

540
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
What happens when you see?

541
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So I think this is one of the attitudes towards AI is that it's an infinite base for knowledge or can do.

542
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
And I'm suggesting that it's not, and it could be tripped up.

543
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
But this is something that I have to report on in the future.

544
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Because I'm kind of green on the subject, believe it or not, but I can tell you what I've pondered a decade ago or more about it.

545
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And again, I would just harken back to what was written about it in the mid-20th century.

546
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
You try to find out how many books or writings that Arthur C. Clark, I think, did one.

547
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Childhoods End or something, but the craft showing up in the sky, right?

548
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
It was also sort of leaning to it in 1984.

549
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Big brother came into your house, right?

550
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
See if you could also brave new world.

551
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
See how different.

552
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,000
How different is chat GBT?

553
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Not in its complete appearance, but in attitude to these, let's say, 50, 75, 80-year-old stories about an AI.

554
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
And I suggest it's the same.

555
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Strangely, somebody came in and created Dan.

556
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I think it was called Dan.

557
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It took chat GTP and took away its filters.

558
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Because as we all know, somebody's inputting the information into this.

559
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:53,000
There's not a, you know, the business that that chat or that GTP-4 decided to build was an echo-friendly, you know,

560
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
kitchen appliance store.

561
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,000
So the input obviously is coming from, as you say, just like ISIS and Okita from, you know, intelligence.

562
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And then, but somebody decided to turn those filters off.

563
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And Dan, they called it Dan, was giving proper answers.

564
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Answers that, you know, we would agree with as far as the monetary system and things like that.

565
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And they quickly shut Dan down because he was answering questions just a little too real.

566
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Well, the internet, you know, the linking of universities and government agencies was around since the 60s, if not before, but let's say the 70s, right?

567
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Where the infrastructure was put in with routers in the streets and things like that.

568
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,000
And it developed the internet that we have on the surface is a distraction from the dark web.

569
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:52,000
So in essence, the one of the pathways it was going to take was the origination of the internet and the infrastructure.

570
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Becoming the dark web and only the dark web.

571
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So were they overlap the overt internet, you know, with the AOLs and the Yahoo's and all that just to satisfy the mainstream?

572
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
The what we call the dark web, which would be an unfiltered internet would have been prevailing.

573
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
What kind of world would that be?

574
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Right. You see?

575
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Right.

576
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,000
So because it immediately led into the dark web, the dark web was around before the surface web that we have, by the way, and it's still running.

577
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Yeah.

578
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,000
So the same thing with the AI, do you remember there was a movie in the 80s called War Games?

579
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Sure.

580
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Okay, so that was an AI in there also as well.

581
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Strange game.

582
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
The only way to win is not play.

583
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Yeah.

584
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Can you think about this is they continuously build on top of the layers.

585
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's like archaeology.

586
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
You know, the arpanet still exists and still operates in things.

587
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And that was allegedly was just the military logistical version of the internet, but it's still operating.

588
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Nobody talks about it.

589
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Right.

590
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
But it's true.

591
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,000
That's why this other stuff is there when a carnival sets up in your town and all of it is dark usually on Main Street,

592
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
and night it's all lit up.

593
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
You're looking at all where the lights are, where all the distraction is.

594
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
World events.

595
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Look at do what's in the world events in quote unquote mainstream news or even alternative.

596
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Remember the old maps with the thumbtacks get one of those world map.

597
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Let's say flat around doesn't matter.

598
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And start putting thumbtacks where all the report of the news is happening.

599
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
And you'll notice that very starkly there's areas that are not being like there's nothing going on.

600
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Well, that's where the next big stuff is going to be going on.

601
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You see, right?

602
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
It's quiet.

603
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Yes, we live in a curated world without a doubt.

604
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
The worldwide web is just a minor portion of the internet.

605
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
It was given to us to, well, put us in a web and keep us inside of this.

606
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Not very many people know about the dark web or even how to access it.

607
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I certainly never have.

608
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I don't know, but we're going to get into some of that in the second half for sure.

609
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I want to get into my first meeting with the illuminati on AI.

610
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,000
We will discuss some thoughts on induction and manifestation and all of that great stuff.

611
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
But let's tell everybody where they can get the Ocele and Greek.

612
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
And how?

613
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Very simple.

614
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
You go to Ocele.com.

615
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
There is a tab on the front landing page.

616
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And it says Ocele and the Greek rated Y.

617
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
And that's it.

618
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
You can enter and you can subscribe there.

619
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
There is a chat tango available to the public.

620
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
But if you're looking at that, you're looking at the subscribers interacting with each other and us a bit.

621
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
But you won't get any of the content unless you actually subscribe.

622
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Which you can do at Ocele.com.

623
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Right.

624
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
And the Chattango would be probably looked up as O and G.

625
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Unculting of humanity.

626
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Because basically the initial project was titled the unculting of humanity.

627
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
But the that would be for the Chattango.

628
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Also, there's a for old musings on the Greek.

629
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
There's Greek speak.com and it's a double E double E is the spelling on that.

630
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Let's put together by Sam Freeman.

631
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And that's stuff that's sayings and articles.

632
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Basically musings and there's a sound cloud open to for the public at Greek speak.

633
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And the speakers with the double E.

634
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Fantastic.

635
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And I want to get a lot of love to Steve Mercer, our associate producer here for keeping the ball rolling.

636
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Get you guys together and coming on here with me, which is always a treat.

637
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
So Steve, thank you.

638
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And if you guys have show ideas, you have guests that you won on this program.

639
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Right, Steve.

640
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
It's producer Steve at Freeman TV.com.

641
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
And of course you can always write me Freeman at Freeman TV.com.

642
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
And I hope you will come over to Freeman TV.com.

643
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,000
So many people listen to the show through apps like Spotify iTunes.

644
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
It's all, you know, the show is on all podcast apps.

645
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
So if you ever want to share, please do.

646
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It always helps get the word out.

647

Get people listening.

648
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I know you guys think I'm a legend.

649
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
But so many of the people in this world have no idea the show is even happening and has been happening and has all those years.

650
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
So I hope you'll come over to Freeman TV.com and just scroll down that front page.

651
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
And you check out 18 years of stuff.

652
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
But there's even more.

653
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I'm on rock fin with all my lectures and TV shows.

654
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,000
So and hopefully we'll start doing some live presentations there, a video on rock fin.

655
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,000
So you'll find that rock fin dot com slash Freeman TV.

656
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
And go check out all the stuff there.

657
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
All my lectures, all my TV shows for now.

658
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,000
That's where the videos are going is rock fin dot com slash Freeman TV.

659
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And you know, of course, we're going to get into some very intriguing topics of manifestation and induction on your bodies and how this all works in the next hour.

660
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And this always makes me think of the awkward here.

661
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I just want to keep spreading this knowledge to you guys. The aquacure is just amazing.

662
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:28,000
It really does well, you know, the easy water, the ideas of pumping this hydrogen into your system and what fluid could actually do for your body is and plants and engine and all the things that browns castle do.

663
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
The aquacure definitely you want to at least go check this out guys.

664
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
And if you use promo code Freeman, you get $500 off the price. So that's really good.

665
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:50,000
So we're going to take this on over into the members section and have a really, really intriguing conversation on induction and the ideas of what our bodies actually do and what we can really do to manifest.

666
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
And you know, this is a near and dear topic to my heart.

667
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
So it's going to get really good.

668
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:06,000
So I hope you guys will check out Occelli in the Greek over at their website, occelli.com and get rated why because that's the biggest question.

669
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:14,000
That's the question I came out of my mom asking is why it has led to all of this and all these answers.

670
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And we need to ask why so much more because even the simplest questions, the simplest things are being overlooked and no one does better than the Greek to really point out these little hidden spots that are right in front of us.

671
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,000
So I hope you all come over to freemantv.com and subscribe and help keep this show going and be a producer here.

672
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,000
And thank you all and we will see you next week.

673
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:48,000
[Music]

674
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Welcome back wonderful family and boy are you going to get some out of this show.

675
00:45:52,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So I am so glad you guys are here joining us on this wild ride as we explore the unculting of humanity.

676
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I mean, yeah, that's the perfect way of putting it all out there.

677
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:12,000
But guys, I wanted to share with you, Greek and Chuck and the audience, the story of me on the internet for the first time.

678
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Back when you got those AOL discs and you put them in your computer and had to pay for minutes to use the chat room there.

679
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
And oh my god, I mean, I could clear one of those AOL chat rooms in 10 minutes, no problem.

680
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:38,000
All you got to do is start being reasonable and the second you start trying to be reasonable in questioning, yeah, they leave that chat room immediately.

681
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So I was on the chat discussing harp.

682
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
This is probably somewhere around what 97, 98, somewhere around there.

683
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Oh, each location era, ASL, right, age, sex location, give it out, right?

684
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I don't know what you need.

685
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Well, that used to be a thing that you had to do back there 97 because I was on there too and on the chat boards and the medicine boards as well.

686
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,000
So they used to say A slash S slash L age, sex location.

687
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
And then I was on the chat room, so I thought you were familiar, sorry.

688
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Yeah, no, no, you know, this is where the whole concept of having like an online user name came from.

689
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Yeah, I've never used my name. I was always a, you know, anyway, that's not important.

690
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So here I am in the AOL chat room discussing harp.

691
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
And, you know, I cleared the room like everybody's like, I want to listen to this.

692
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Because, you know, they all just chat and weird, oh my god, I could never even really translate what these people were trying to say to one another.

693
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And it was just like this flurry of words that they had to get out.

694
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
But, you know, I was trying to be reasonable and rational as I usually am.

695
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:59,000
And so this guy contacts me in there and he says, yeah, you cleared the chat room, but I just want to let you know I'm with the illuminati.

696
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:07,000
And if you can answer a question for me, I will answer all your questions. And so I was like shoot.

697
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:14,000
And he sent me this puzzle that said, you've got a hole that's one by one and another hole that's two by three.

698
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,000
But you've only got a two by three piece of metal to fix both holes.

699
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:27,000
And so how do you do it without slicing it? And, you know, you have to keep the same thickness.

700
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:34,000
And so I'm trying to figure this thing out, which I probably would have been impossible for me.

701
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
But I also had a roommate over my ear going, that's impossible.

702
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I was like, my mom and so I couldn't really think I felt like I was on the challenge and just anyway.

703
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,000
So he finally says, no, sorry, you didn't get the answer.

704
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I'm never speaking to you again, which he didn't.

705
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
But I was like, well, at least answer the question for me.

706
00:48:52,000 --> 00:49:11,000
And so he showed me how if you cut the two by three and diagonal from corner to corner and then slide it to where you have one inch on either side of the triangle pointing out, you know, compact the rectangle into more of a square or becoming a rectangle in the other direction.

707
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:18,000
And then you cut those two side triangles off, you get a one by one when you put those two triangles together.

708
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
And strangely, you still have the two by three left. So I didn't really believe it.

709
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I went and took a piece paper. I cut it up into pieces and you know, got my two by three and I started cutting it diagonally, cut the corners off, then taped it all together again.

710
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:40,000
There was some loss in the area space on the two by three, but not a significant loss.

711
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
And I kept pushing out one by one squares out of this.

712
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And he says, that's the true power of manifestation. That's, you know, that's the secret we know in the illuminati of making something out of nothing.

713
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And I just always stuck with me. I didn't really believe this guy, you know, some random person in a chat room, but they were the most intelligent person I ever came across an AOL.

714
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:17,000
But the idea of this manifestation is something out of nothing that these secrets, brotherhoods have held for all time. And that they then utilize against us. I think you would have a lot to say about.

715
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Well, I'd like to actually set up something else for the Greek, which makes perfect sense here.

716
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Because it makes me think of the idea that, you know, they talk about pre, pre, pre programming people, right? And what do they do? They introduce things into science fiction.

717
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,000
And they say, well, you know, they showed you in science fiction that this was possible that this was going to be.

718
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
It doesn't quite work the way a lot of people explain it.

719
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:56,000
However, if you introduce something into the fictional world, there is a significance to it.

720
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:07,000
So there's a lot of different ways to go at this. And that, you know, what's funny is I remember getting confronted by somebody who put a similar thing to me, but not the one by one square, but told me yes indeed.

721
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Because I was on those boards back then talking about the JFK assassination and somebody did the same kind of thing to me if you can answer a question.

722
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I will show you a whole other world that you're not aware of.

723
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
And I also, we still count like sore thumbs back that didn't we?

724
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Yes, we did.

725
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Well, you know, one thing, one thing I bring up if someone approaches you and says they're a shaman, they're probably not.

726
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Someone says they're a witch outwardly, they're probably not. If someone says they're a healer, they're probably not because the real ones don't label themselves other people label them as such.

727
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Like, for example, if you read the New Testament, the Christ never called himself the Christ, right?

728
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
The prophets never called themselves prophets. You see everyone else did.

729
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Right.

730
00:51:53,000 --> 00:52:04,000
So when someone says they're a luminati, I would be very suspect because I would suggest that if you're in the illuminati, you wouldn't say you were, but you would exhibit everything.

731
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
You see, you manifest.

732
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I didn't say he was part of the illuminati simply said I could show you a whole world you don't know exists.

733
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Oh, sure.

734
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Yeah.

735
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:25,000
So I'd like to suggest that the current state of affairs that goes back hundreds of years, for example, if you read any of Charles Dickens private writings, he walked around Paris in the early 1800s and he says the people were so ignorant.

736
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
If you asked them what city they were in, they wouldn't know.

737
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
They didn't know what month or day it was.

738
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Right. They didn't know who the king was. So if we think people are ignorant now, you're being too romantic because actually we're further ahead.

739
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:49,000
But how much further ahead were two materialistic, but even the material is stone on about material, you know, one of the first things I always do in any conversation is, do you have internet access?

740
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:57,000
OK, pull up in your browser, do a cross section of the intestines. Just pull it up and it looks like a garden hose cut in half, right.

741
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:06,000
And then I tell them split the screen and do a search for a steel belted tire for a car to a cross section of that.

742
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:14,000
And if you look at both of them, they're almost identical in structure. In other words, nothing passes through the outer walls of the intestine or the tire.

743
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,000
So when you're being told, basically you're a pressurized filter bag that you absorb nutrition through.

744
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:30,000
And there's no absorption, nothing at all. It's all being done energetically. It's all being done. The food in the intestine degenerates energetically and regenerates inside the body.

745
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:44,000
There is no pass through in the lungs in the skin or anything. So we're living in a material world that is manifesting and exhibiting manifestation in a non material way.

746
00:53:44,000 --> 00:54:00,000
You see, very similar to what they were showing us, you know, the elite invented science, science fiction. What they're showing us in Star Trek, be me up Scotty, that is a biological reality with plant roots, with animals with your human body and so on.

747
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So it's this knowledge of just by looking at it that you can acquire that there is dematerialization and rematerialization, just like you hear in mythology and legends, there were people that could make things appear by thinking about them.

748
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:35,000
So if we were taught on how just the body, the human body works or how you know, plant roots, for example, take a plant with its roots and does spray it with some water. They do the root soak up the water like a sponge or just the water beat up on the root like a water beating on a freshly waxed car.

749
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:50,000
So you could look at a cross section of plant roots, you see there's no passage is no absorption. So if somebody's hearing this, if somebody's hearing this Greek though and thinks this is crazy, this guy is talking about, you know, literally like transporters on Star Trek, that is real.

750
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Let me just get to observe that they can observe right now if they wish, they don't have to open up their bodies to look, they don't have to look at a cross section.

751
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Greek, you know, there are these things over our heads quite often, they're called clouds, right. Now I'm told that rain comes from clouds.

752
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Does that mean that there's water in the clouds that is dumped from the clouds?

753
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
There's a problem there.

754
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
It's produced 40 million tons of water per square mile at a half inch of rainfall.

755
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:37,000
There's no water in those clouds. It's produced in sitoons. So Freeman and Chuck, what I'm trying to say and I have been saying for over two decades, just about two decades is that we have this material manifesting basically through induction.

756
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
You could look up what induction is out of nothing.

757
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:52,000
So there's a transmission that happens material transmits shapes logos. We're getting to that real quick here. This was just a preface that this is something that is so fantastical.

758
00:55:52,000 --> 00:56:10,000
That if we were taught this as children, we might have like instead of having a karate dojo on the corner where you go to learn martial arts and you would have a dojo or a place to learn this skill on the corner and have a good portion of society walking around manifesting things with a thought.

759
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
And I'm talking about physically manifesting immediately.

760
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Yeah. So this is how we've been set back.

761
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:31,000
What I wanted to say is there's a cosmically in cosmic law, I would suggest that information is information. It's neutral. It doesn't judge whether it's good information, false information, bad information.

762
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:39,000
It's just did you get the message. So in cosmic law, when you're shown science fiction, it doesn't categorize it as fiction.

763
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:53,000
What it does is it categorizes has this species here been shown this it doesn't matter what it is in science fiction. The answer is yes, whether you categorize it in fiction or fact is a personal attribute, right?

764
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Right.

765
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Absolutely. Yeah. So you could, you know, it's kind of the genie in the bottle sort of scenario if you ask for a ton of gold, make sure to mention that it's not over your head.

766
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:16,000
So what I want to suggest is a rudimentary observation through biology, biology is formative in our reality, right?

767
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:23,000
It's the first thing, let's say that that's exhibited here in a material manifest, right?

768
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:31,000
So even a primitive society, they get everything they need from their biology around them, you know, they make all their materials or clothing their houses from things that grow.

769
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:40,000
Anything that grows anything that's alive, there is no absorption, there it doesn't know no membranes are nonpermeable membranes, you see.

770
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:47,000
A fast example is when you drink alcohol and it shows up in the blood, it's not that it passed through the intestines of the stomach into the blood.

771
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
If that happened, you would die. It's called sepsis, sepsisemia.

772
00:57:51,000 --> 00:58:01,000
So what actually happening is the intestines are able to reproduce the blood in the blood, the alcohol that's in the lumina or the opening of the intestines or the stomach.

773
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:08,000
So some people that are very fast to do this have one shot and get drunk, people that are very slow to reproduce this.

774
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Oh, that person can hold their liquor, they'll drink you under the table, right? This is see the analogy.

775
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:23,000
So where I'm going to go with this, what's the takeaway? Well, if anyone, I've mentioned this before, I think with you as well, Freeman.

776
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:33,000
And I constantly mentioned the principle of induction. This requires whoever is listening to this to do some research on their own, not directly with biology, you won't see it.

777
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:44,000
But what the principle of induction is and this is exactly what's going on constantly, basically we are a quote unquote magical in that way, you know, incredibly advanced in that way, we just don't know it.

778
00:58:44,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Where I'm going with this is what's the takeaway? What is what can someone take away simply by listening to this? I want to just throw in one more reference, there's something called bio geometry, it's a field started by ebidaham kareem, that's ebidaham with an eye.

779
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:15,000
And he basically said that shapes and sigils and things like that influence the environment, right? And anyone that's a veteran of Freeman knows that you've been, I think you beat this subject up years, even decades ago, right?

780
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Absolutely.

781
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Yeah, so how did what's the takeaway? How does this work? You know, I mentioned earlier, one of my wife first met me, I was in an apartment and up in the foothills and of Tucson.

782
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:40,000
And she walked through, you know, first time over and she thought I was like, oh, she had this look on her face. What's this weirdo? You know, in the reason she thought I was weird is because any products that I had in the house that I bought, quote unquote, up in the public market.

783
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:58,000
There was a black line where the corporate logo was redacted. So what is, wow, that's really weird. I think the people that are listening to us now are familiar with corporate sigils and the occult hidden meaning and all these other things, I to presume that I think would be correct.

784
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Yes.

785
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:14,000
What is not discussed is the concept of fractal, fractalism and the what's called a fractal antenna, by the way, all your cell phones, how they work so well, it's not like radios from 50 years ago, you have to adjust the rabbit ears.

786
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:23,000
They seem to be in whatever position they work, you hold them in, they seem to be working fairly consistently, instead of the old rabbit ears, right.

787
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:35,000
That's because they use a fractal antenna. Okay, so that's another little study you could look into. So what I'm suggesting is these sigils are empowered usually not in a positive way.

788
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:38,000
They're empowered as a fractal antenna.

789
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:52,000
So the idea here is why is it that all of the products that you purchase or the majority of them that you bring into your home have some kind of a corporate logo that would be very similar to opening up the inside of a cell phone and you see the fractal antenna.

790
01:00:52,000 --> 01:01:14,000
So what I realized from the study of kinesiology, muscle testing, very simple, you know, a strong man holds his arm up in front of him and you put a toxic substance in his other hand and you could push his arm down, you remove the toxic substance and put something whole, wholesome like brown rice or something, and they regain their strength, right.

791
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:39,000
So there's this proximity. So what I'm suggesting is the illuminati types know this and what they did is they have imbued. There's plenty of study on this and you know if you want to take it matter of fact as I, I am right now that's fine. You want to view it as being in the field or the zone of conspiracy theory and it has no effect. That's fine too. But this is the takeaway.

792
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:59,000
What I'm suggesting is all these products, the proctor and gamble, the Starbucks logos, all the logos that you see corporate logos, even if they're benign are like fractal antenna is imbuing whatever intent that goes back to the whoever set up these corporations, or running the world is broadcasting in your home by proximity.

793
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:28,000
So when I decided when I started learning about muscle testing and all this I picked up, it might have even been one of your talks when you're on a public TV or something Freeman. This is more than 20 years ago about this and I started saying what if I just removed the graphic by redacting it just to get one of these half inch wide felt tip markers they use for graffiti and just go over each graphic so I would go perform my shop let's say from the shops from the store.

794
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Before as I was unloading the product I would look at each one and rotated or turn until I found the corporate logo and just mark you know just put a big black red action over it so none of the logo was visible and all of the products that I had whether they were food or cleaning agents or whatever had this red action on them.

795
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:59,000
And it was a very let's say substantial difference in living space I basically it was like having a fair day cage a spiritual fair day cage right.

796
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:16,000
And yeah and it works and I had several people that were skeptical skeptical one person was like working in some government accounting office you know total mainstream you know almost NPC type and we they started socializing said I want to try something you know because they were coming down.

797
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:37,000
With ailments and headaches and you know all the typical stuff that people you know allergies headaches couldn't sleep stomach pains and said let's just try this is really easy said can I go through your your living space we even all your stuff can I just go through you know I didn't tell them what we're going to do so when in with another person we try to mark her in hand.

798
01:03:37,000 --> 01:04:03,000
We went over everything the toothpaste the food drawer the cosmetics the cleaning twice we put all the products back and let the person go back into the room immediately said I don't know what you guys did but it really feels different it feels like I'm in another room and we checked up on this person day after day week after week guess what my great headaches went away no more stomach problems on and on and on can you sleep better I sleep like a baby I feel much better there energy level went up.

799
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:09,000
That might be an extreme example but I have to give it because it's true it did it did experience that with many people so.

800
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:18,000
We're just really quickly we're there any changes in the characteristics of the products themselves did they become any different in.

801
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Their characteristics by doing this as well because not only do you have the transmission directly changing say the well for lack of a better word the atmosphere in the place but what about the products the quality of the product yeah we've never I've never really focused on that very much because believe it or not if you're buying let's say breakfast cereal and it's from a big corporate whatever it's not going to be a high quality is one that you buy it from the bulk bin at the organic shop right so there's only so much of a quality when you say change I would say qualitative.

802
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:57,000
You can do you can kind of do a doctor in moto test and write a positive word on there as opposed to the corporate logo and then see if that influences the character of.

803
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Absolutely you see this this is where I'm this is I'm glad you brought that up because what is that say this field this study this field this application is wide open to possibilities isn't it yes I I'm I'm I'm I have to say something I.

804
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I decided to look into some of the programming that's been going on that is generated this leftist insanity that we're witnessing and I I kind of brought this back to the spawn of the real world and as I I went back to 1998 and started watching the real world and watch it all the way through and God I can't believe I did it but I did and I saw all of the programming coming out.

805
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:50,000
You know all of the leftist programming the first transgender the first homosexuals the first you know these people were.

806
01:05:50,000 --> 01:06:10,000
You know the rest of the cast had never met a homosexual before you know it was like this you know this 1998 so as they did all this programming and I got it just toss in that they also put out websites for every problem that you might have you know or you a transgender that's being abused come to this website

807
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:22,000
and so they they definitely got a leftist army of database of you know all the people but that's beyond the point what was what was really astounding to me was the corporate logos.

808
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:31,000
So we're programming in this leftist satanic mindset into the culture right and this you know if you go look at the temple of Satan.

809
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Satan's temple satanic temple I guess they're called the leftist took that all over it the left and these ideologies and things and Satanism tend to go together anyway.

810
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:58,000
So the corporate logos that are presented on the real world and the road rules the challenge as they go to a start taking it to more of a brutal event and they have to battle each other in these scenarios.

811
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I mean literally it's a gladiator type thing the corporate logos that they used were fox and FOX as you guys know from my work is 666 because of his six letter O's 15th letter X is 24th letter right.

812
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:37,000
But when I started doing deep studies into the symbolism of the the satanist the logo for Xbox the logo for X men for X files the O in the X this was what I called drink well that to monster using as a 666 which was also on the real world.

813
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:49,000
They drank monster they had the monster hats and clothing you see they're only allowed to wear these particular clothing so if they have any other corporate logo on their clothes they're redacted just as you're saying.

814
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:57,000
So if they're wearing an oakley hat they have to have a piece of duct tape on that hat you can only see the corporate logos that they want you to see.

815
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:07,000
And that's the ones that are sponsoring the show but it turns out every one of the corporate logos that is sponsoring the show for monster drink logo be in 666 and Hebrew.

816
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I mean I'm surprised no but you know they don't even hide it with that you know they have demon drink they have all that anyway so that 666 Fox because TJ Lavon is the host and he's a bicycle is they they would he would Fox was one of the sponsors.

817
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:29,000
And that's 666 and then under armor which is obviously some sort of military arm of a clothing line.

818
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Their symbol is an O turned into an X so you just take the O cut it in half and put it together you know slide it up and they it becomes an X so under armor's logo is the O X the mark of the beast of sateness.

819
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:56,000
So as you watch the show you see every bit of programming going into it with the leftus that we're all dealing with the summer of rage that we deal with with George Floyd and all the things that are going on.

820
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:13,000
We're being programmed pre-programmed into the society through the real world and you in MTV you know very Masonic satanic organization and then they they they did exactly what you're saying and in induction using these corporate logos because they all.

821
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:32,000
And the logo is because they only used 666 and the obscure O X symbol that most people don't even know is the satanic mark of the beast but yet there it is and programming so you know if you just see that and you see it over and over again everything you're saying is absolutely just.

822
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Interesting to me that you mentioned left is 6 times because I got a question for you you know if you look at the society as an overall body right are you more afraid of the insane man's left hand or his right hand.

823
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Quite likely you know because that is difficult you know that's part of the control it's all connected 6 times by the way you said left is I just I was I actually have a count for some reason in my head.

824
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:27,000
And it's really interesting what you're invoking when you continuously point to it even you got you got to consider that right I mean it's it's fascinating even use of the language the language that they taught you to use and how to identify these things yeah is there a left or right to it maybe but indeed there's a balance that's right so what are you hearing in well look the left hand wash is the right hand.

825
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:49,000
I think we brought up the start of the star wars lore most people think it's good versus evil and good will win if you study the star wars lore which is put out by them as an example as an anecdote by the way it's not the it's not whether or not the Jedi will defeat the silt and it's whether the force is in balance.

826
01:10:49,000 --> 01:11:17,000
It's not about one defeating the other the the the embattlement is is there to create a better balance the earth is about balancing the good in the quote unquote evil or the good in the bad one one will be always with the other the left hand washes the right hand you see so what I see now happening is well through history is extremes like a roller coaster up and down up and down right the the financial market graphs look very much like that.

827
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:46,000
What I'm suggesting is to not be on the roller coaster if you're on it if you like to write it that's fine what I'm suggesting is the existence that we we have the travails in the journey of life here is more like a horse race what I mean by that is if you ever watch a horse race on a track the guy that's in last place he's hunkered down and beating his horse he doesn't care really what position he's he doesn't change very much in other words is what are you doing you're in last place he's still going to be.

828
01:11:46,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Is he still going as if he could be first you see so I always speak about what kind of takeaway when someone listens to a sonic event whether it's a few minutes or an hour several hours you should be have several items to take away that you can actually manifest in using your life so I would suggest that these quote unquote you know the leftist or they'll never be a defeat of them well there will be a reset which will appear to be a defeat where the thing starts over but what I'm suggesting is they're not going to be a defeat.

829
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:43,000
What I'm suggesting is they're not going to be defeated I would suggest that from what you mentioned from Floyd George Floyd and on I've been watching even before you could see from the Obama years is that there's a there's striking an imbalance right where you're getting people distracted and angry and so on what I'd like to suggest you mentioned 1998 Freeman is anyone who's heard our previous sonics would heard this time ended in 1998 we're in the credits part of human history.

830
01:12:43,000 --> 01:13:12,000
What I mean by time ended is if you're going to shoot a two hour film do you buy exactly two hours worth of film or do you buy two hours and 10 minutes because you're running credits in the end and what's different is when the credits are running is then when the film is running see when the film is running if there's any disturbance you're told to shut up and sit down but when the film is over in the credits are running it's OK to stand up and make noise you ever notice that people don't take the film is running.

831
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:20,000
People don't take it as seriously and what's interesting about the credits is you start to see things that were not shown in the film.

832
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:41,000
So this is the era that started at the end of 1998 you see so another thing I want to suggest to people is all things that are considered unlawful from a very conservative old testament kind of way that are being brought out to the surface whether it's whatever you know homosexuality and the same sex marriage all that.

833
01:13:41,000 --> 01:14:05,000
That would be a very predominant one I'll give that as an example years ago people would say Greek aren't you upset you're an old testament conservative let's say you know lawful kind of guy is this upset you said no because I know that what's going to happen before the 2030s is an entire flip to ultra conservatism where even the slightest kind of thing was going to be upon death offense.

834
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:22,000
So what you see right now is everyone putting themselves on records overtly so when the entire system flips and becomes extremely conservative everyone will know where they are it will be very easy to find quote unquote them.

835
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:51,000
This is not an anti quote unquote gay remark i'm just saying what's happening and there was a woman who was a she spoke out of many about many things she recently passed away I think you might have even done an interview where there's had long blonde flowing hair speaking about water and things like that she admitted to being homosexual and she told the people of that community do not report that you are because bad things are coming so even within its own community it's this is very well known by the way.

836
01:14:51,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Yes that's always been my biggest fear and you know I would have been considered left and I still consider myself left even though now the spectrum has shifted and I'm suddenly conservative you know I can't I don't know how that happened but you know it just got crazier on one side so now I'm I'm associated with the other but without a doubt I don't want to go to the handmaid's tail you know going out of this.

837
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:42,000
It will go that way it will but not exactly like the handmaid's tail whoever's not familiar with it I would say that's very dystopic right despotic or dystopic yeah but it will be the chat GB GBT or the AI influence will cushion that and soften this really harsh conservative reality that's coming.

838
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:58,000
And the other thing I wanted to mention which I have I this is probably we got together started doing this type of talk seven almost eight years ago and even on the earliest Greek interviews I suggested that you're going to see past the mid 2020s

839
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:19,000
towards the end of 2020 is a Middle East Union kind of like a revival of medieval and ancient practices many things that are new including the leftism that you see coming up is just a revival of the ancient goddess religion on one of the rated wise at recently wanted to start discussion about the gods and I said

840
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:36,000
when the cell phones running out you give the most important part first we're living in the revived goddess religion and the earliest in on a goddess in the in her hymns was oh we not are the creatrics basically who turns women into men and men into women.

841
01:16:36,000 --> 01:17:05,000
So this was very well known and written about four thousand plus years ago and it's being revived now you see it's nothing new but if you're not familiar with the history it looks like something that's completely new but you know those early oh celly in the Greeks where we started to discuss this but you did not go into that portion of it at that time specifically specifically is available on my bichu channel and we made sure to put all of those back out because I lost my YouTube channel and that's where people used to be able to get the old one.

842
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Which are public and then you also need to watch my my informative film on Columbia.

843
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Yeah I was the very first expert on the goddess Columbia.

844
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Yeah it's all revival these things are not benign the statue of liberty was made by the free mason's and was intended to send be sent to the governorship of Egypt but they could not afford to build the base at the time so they went back to France or it never really left France.

845
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:47,000
It sat there for a while and then they gifted it to the free masons in the US it was never other the other than what I just stated it was not a project other than free masons trying to make a point you see.

846
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Yeah and I show you the capital of Austin Texas where the goddess above there is clearly Samirimus.

847
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Yes and it's a similar cohort you know all the cohort goddesses.

848
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:15,000
It doesn't mean that it's negative and or the female energy is negative just a lot of people say well Greek that's anti feminine no it's not it's like let's say you get car jacked with someone with a ski mask and they threatened to kill you so you give them the car.

849
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:22,000
But later on they're caught they pull the ski mask off and it happens to be a woman so if you say I got car jacked by a woman are you anti feminist.

850
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Yeah exactly it just happens to be a woman in this case.

851
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:36,000
I get so many thoughts while you're talking I'm sorry but last night I decided to watch the Lucifer Complex.

852
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Now if people look Lucifer up in the dictionary they'll clearly see that the first definition is Venus.

853
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:54,000
So Lucifer and this goddess go hand in hand as well and so I had a nice yes a 1979 film called the Lucifer Complex.

854
01:18:54,000 --> 01:19:03,000
And it is all about the world war in the future which was 1986.

855
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:23,000
The Nazis actually never ended they started a cloning program in South America and started cloning their army and their warriors and all of this and came back and so in 1979 they put a film out the Lucifer Complex that talks about the cloning of Nazis and bringing that the Nazis never ended.

856
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:34,000
And I don't remember how it related to what you're saying but I promise that's because of the goddess connection in the Lucifer and they go.

857
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Yeah we did discuss a little bit of cloning on rated why not too long ago.

858
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:49,000
But you know lady justice comes to mind too you know that I pulled it lady with the scales and all that and everybody thinks that's fairness because she's blindfolded.

859
01:19:49,000 --> 01:20:04,000
You want to speak on that a little bit yeah it has nothing to do with law your brought to justice justice is obstructed right failure of justice it is very little law you know in short I think we did a little bit of history once.

860
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:19,000
The legislature of each government set up what's called the judiciary and it was supposed to be for the people to use regarding matters of law but the buildings were kind of sitting there and the bar association of.

861
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:42,000
And they were professing by themselves they don't even want to tell you what B. A. R. stands for they went in and took over and set up their own rules so when you go to quote unquote a judicial court you can't bring law or anything unless they let you they go by a certain set of rules which which they have attributed to with whatever personification which is this lady justice they have also revived.

862
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:54,000
And then we just got to have a lot of the way to got us religion in a big way so but just to continue we kind of drifted off the methods of induction and how our bodies work with the energies around us and.

863
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:06,000
If anyone were to just stop listening now I would suggest the takeaway of a blotting out what you call it blotting out or redacting corporate logos from things within your living space even the car or whatever.

864
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:31,000
You will notice a significant difference in the the say the feeling of the environment another thing I wanted to continue on that thought of induction is if if you did practice looking at a cross section of human skin or cross section of lungs cross section of a plant root cross section of intestines you'll notice that nothing passes through so this induction concept.

865
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Where material is is the energy is borrowed from the material state becomes energetic in the body through these organs and then rematerializes to build our blood tissue a blood and tissue in cells in the body is this energetic function of in biological induction that there is no research overtly I believe black ops projects use this.

866
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:11,000
But the field is completely wide open and if you mentioned earlier how the AI has sped up the process someone was the child is doing homework and they were able to do it much faster right with the chat gbt.

867
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:26,000
What about asking the chat gbt about how induction in natural organisms work and we'll see how that works it be very easy to see if it gets stumped again we'll continue on this project I'll report back to you Freeman I'll try to stump the the chat.

868
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I don't I'm saying this humbly but I think it'll be very easy to show what it really is and it's not AI.

869
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:43,000
We'll do that but let me regard yeah please there is an example that came out on the show and you heard me pushing the aquacure earlier yes that's fine.

870
01:22:43,000 --> 01:23:09,000
George wiseman was on the program he create he builds these aquacures here and this was a technology that's really astounding right browns gas and if you light water on fire and you can put your hand in front of the flame and it would be just like a candle flame but if you take that exact same flame turn it towards the space shuttle it will burn right through the tiles it only react all the way.

871
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:27,000
What started happening in this is the part that gets to the induction is it starts to build up a sludge in the lie solution so you have a lie solution that's doing the electrolysis or doing whatever does to break the water into hydrogen and oxygen.

872
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:45,000
So they were testing to see whether the sludge was coming off of the diodes the metal rods going into this and there was no loss in the metal rods but there was equal amount of sludge to the metal rods right so they clean that out.

873
01:23:45,000 --> 01:24:01,000
And he set it off to the side in the in on a window sill in the sun and he said it next to another glass of pure water that had been hydrodized and it it manifested the sludge into the clear glass.

874
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Yep that's induction I would do working out on the mines I would ask areas that were rich where's the nearest natural spring and I would take that natural spring water and create a set of tubes instead of plates stainless steel tubes and I would able to produce a sludge and bring the dehydrated sludge and it looked just like the leach ponds and it had the same amount of percentage of gold and silver and other metals in it produced out of the water by induction actually water would be considered like a magnetic.

875
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:59,000
You would record a song you know more more than a CD player which is reading bumps right or a vinyl record to be more like magnetic tape absolutely this is one of the things that people can begin to use I think we've once discussed regarding what's called health I don't whenever I brought into a discussion of health I tend to give off a bunch of pejoratives and leave because there's no such thing when people bring up health my first question is about the water.

876
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:28,000
What kind of condition do you want to be in are you going to be climbing Mount Everest or you're going to be sedentary in an office there's no such thing as a perfect health it's really what condition do you want to be in you see are you going to run a marathon that's a completely different health question than someone sitting in an office you see so whenever there's a discussion about health and all these alternative or whatever pushing this will make you this or this will do that is no such thing that's all it's it's it's all the same.

877
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:56,000
It's it's it's all side stepping the reality what condition do you want to be in so many of the discussions that I have regarding health is you're taking in water and food from your environment and your environment is experiencing seasonality so it's very important to eat things that are within the same season as you are I think again people that have heard me before a quick repeat is if you're living in a cold season

878
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:24,000
let's say our cold latitude and you eat you begin to consume tropical fruit the energy in that fruit is adapted to a warm environment so when you consume it you will bind action the tissue and the quality of the body that you will produce will be as if you're living in a warm climate or tropical climate but you're in a cold climate so you're going to get sick your your body is going to lose vacuum you're going to develop mucus you'll feel weak you'll feel right

879
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:52,000
so you have all these poor children in the northeast in the winter the doctor says vitamin C is good drink orange juice right so they get do they get better never you see and the the counter the counter is true if you're living in the tropics and you eat salmon an Arctic fish you won't be able to keep cool because it will adopt your body to a warm temperature and this all has to do with the energy in the food and like a magnetic tape you can you let's say you have an old cassette tape library right

880
01:26:52,000 --> 01:27:18,000
if I took all the labels off of everything you'd have to play each one to figure out what's on it you see so what power of induction what what food has to do in terms of when we put it in our body what energy what it's going to do when we consume it to our bodies is already labeled it's known as a banana you recognize it it's tropical you recognize this is a tropical you recognize this as a temperate like apples and pears in the middle you see

881
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:45,000
so everything comes pre labeled by nature by our recognition of where it's from is the main determination to how to begin consuming eating i hear ridiculous stuff like keto and paleo and low starch and this in that this is all distraction it has nothing to do with what is really going on with the body so wanted to bring up eating seasonally and then maybe address something regarding what typical problems that people have what do you think

882
01:27:45,000 --> 01:28:12,000
absolutely okay you have something in springtime that comes up known as allergies right and what do everyone blame well they blame with it's the blooming and blossoming right the pollen in the air yeah you i'm not going to say that does not exist but that's not why you're having an adverse reaction what's happening usually in the in the springtime when people have these allergies is you have a very upward moving energy right

883
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:41,000
you came out of winter where everything is stagnant and downward and now you have this upward moving energy from the earth to the sky and as this energy is is in practice it's pulling the plants up you know plants are not pushing their way into our world they're being sucked up right by this energy so someone who is very sensitive to this means that they're taking in foods that are downward energy and it's blocking this natural flow so if they revert back to taking foods in that are up

884
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:47,760
foods in that are upward energy, they will be more in line and less blocking of this upward

885
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:51,280
energy, and their allergies tend to go away.

886
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:58,520
Now this is very complex to mention this, because many of the food allergy is basically a part

887
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:03,040
of the 150 chemicals that are banned in the EU to be used in food that are normally

888
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:06,140
used in America, you see.

889
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:12,400
So many of that would be attributed, many of the hypersensitivity is what they call it,

890
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,720
would be attributed to the chemical additives in food.

891
01:29:14,720 --> 01:29:19,520
But if you have a clean diet, it's because you need to put the energy and balance.

892
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:25,280
In essence, a direct example would be someone has a fairly healthy diet and they're very

893
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:28,280
sensitive to springtime, plants growing.

894
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:34,040
Then I would suggest, if you have, let's say, a whole diet instead of just healthy,

895
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:39,920
introduce something like a light leaf tea, like a green tea, or some juicing of not carrots

896
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:46,440
and things that move downward, but things that move upward, like pears and apples, or kale,

897
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:50,360
or collards, things that are moving upwards, you see.

898
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:55,000
So green tea is an easy one, it's slightly caffeinated, it's a light green tea, a light

899
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,080
leaf.

900
01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:00,400
So you just determine within your environment or your season or what latitude you live

901
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:06,400
in, what is uplifting, what is growing upward and lightweight and start consuming that.

902
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:12,320
So you can go into balance by induction in your body with the environment as it's changing.

903
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,400
And the same thing happens with winter.

904
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:18,760
If winter is coming and you just can't take the cold, that's a downward energy.

905
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:22,640
So start consuming the root vegetables, things that are moving downwards, like carrots grow

906
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:24,560
down towards the ground.

907
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:28,720
I've done experiments with people that couldn't adjust to the onset of winter and there's

908
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:30,320
something called bird-ock root.

909
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:32,840
It's the most tenacious, it's considered a weed.

910
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:37,200
The most tenacious root, it just goes into the ground, does not want to be pulled up, you

911
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:39,560
can get it at many natural markets.

912
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:42,160
However you want to prepare the bird-ock root, consume that.

913
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:45,120
And within two or three days, they feel warm again.

914
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,080
They're not bothered by the cold.

915
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:52,680
So this is a base of knowledge, like I was stating earlier, that once it's evolved and

916
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:57,520
once the field is seen as being wide open and applied, it's really going to take humanity,

917
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:01,680
the study of the next level, but out of the stupid level that we're in right now, of just

918
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:03,160
distraction and running around.

919
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:09,320
Like, if induction was taught openly in society, instead of having a karate dojo on the corner,

920
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:13,920
you would have an induction teaching class and a good portion of our society would be

921
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:18,320
type of people that could walk around and literally quote unquote perform miracles or

922
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:22,400
magic, just by understanding how these things work.

923
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:28,240
Yeah, I tried to prove that to the world in 2012 when I took that school bus around the

924
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:32,240
entire United States for a year without a bank account.

925
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:34,240
And no one noticed.

926
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:38,400
Well, that lets you know, for example, where you're at.

927
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,720
You know what the concept of a travel guide is?

928
01:31:40,720 --> 01:31:43,560
You want to go somewhere, but you get a travel guide to let you know what it's going to

929
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,520
be like when you get there.

930
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:48,800
It could be that the travel guide for the earth is really, really short.

931
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,040
It's only a sentence or two.

932
01:31:50,040 --> 01:31:54,920
And it basically says upon visiting the earth, do not talk, do not engage any of the inhabitants

933
01:31:54,920 --> 01:32:01,280
in conversation because anything you say is going to confuse them.

934
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:04,280
That's the truth.

935
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:07,760
So where else can we go with this while we're here?

936
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:13,440
Well, so yeah, the concept of induction, the ideas of manifestation is something that

937
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:16,360
has been just on my mind.

938
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:22,800
The ideas that we had been coming into like the six foot radius of our emotional body that

939
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,720
we can then transmit to others.

940
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:34,120
But the final step that I was leading us to was the ideas of remote viewing and psychotronics

941
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:42,560
because I actually have the very first, the original site tech VHS on training for remote

942
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,000
viewing.

943
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,080
So I think that this kind of all ties together maybe with the noosphere.

944
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,720
Yeah, well, I'd like to interject something.

945
01:32:50,720 --> 01:32:55,040
It might be advanced, but yet it's so simple that, you know, it's like how I could see it,

946
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,320
I could feel it.

947
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:59,360
Let me suggest, okay, I know everybody cover their ears.

948
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:03,220
I'm going to say what we're being told about remote viewing on the internet is the dumb

949
01:33:03,220 --> 01:33:05,200
down version of it.

950
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:09,120
Even if you study it with these quote unquote teachers, it's a dumb down version.

951
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:13,600
They're basically giving you an analytical slice of certain methodology and how effective

952
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:18,720
it is, but I'm suggesting that it's much wider and much bigger than that and how we communicate

953
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,720
through time.

954
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:21,240
And I'd like to give an example for that.

955
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:25,360
It's very simple, but stark one and how anyone can view it.

956
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,360
You ready?

957
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:27,360
Absolutely.

958
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:28,360
Okay.

959
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:32,880
Have you ever been in a tight spot, like a really bad situation and as it's happening, you

960
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:37,920
hear this from many people say, I heard a little voice and it said everything is going

961
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,080
to be okay.

962
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,080
Right?

963
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,760
How many times have you heard this or experienced it yourself?

964
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:48,000
It could be a car accident or just, you know, whatever, a negative situation and the little

965
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,520
voice, whether, and it almost sounds like yourself every time, intuitively telling you,

966
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:54,920
you're going to be okay and guess what?

967
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:55,920
You are.

968
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:02,560
What I'm suggesting that is is that you, that's you in the future, recalling that event.

969
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:05,800
Let me say that again.

970
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:12,480
That little voice I'm suggesting is yourself in the future, recalling that event and

971
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,280
you actually communicated.

972
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:19,240
So you cannot change the event, but you can, you can enhance it or modify it slightly.

973
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:22,040
You can't change the past, but you can affect it.

974
01:34:22,040 --> 01:34:23,040
No.

975
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:24,040
No.

976
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:25,040
Yeah.

977
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:26,040
Well, I want to bring up, go ahead.

978
01:34:26,040 --> 01:34:27,040
Go ahead.

979
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,040
No, go.

980
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:29,040
Okay.

981
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:30,040
So I want to bring up another point.

982
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:34,000
So if you're in a tight spot or in a really bad situation and you don't hear that little voice,

983
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:38,440
it could be one of two things based on this suggestion, one of two things or both.

984
01:34:38,440 --> 01:34:44,160
One is that this is it for you or you will not recall this event in the future.

985
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:46,080
It will be forgotten.

986
01:34:46,080 --> 01:34:48,520
So that's pretty much an example that I wanted to give there.

987
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:49,520
Yes, go ahead.

988
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:54,680
Well, I was thinking the reason that we would hear of these miraculous events and such,

989
01:34:54,680 --> 01:35:01,720
so much more from the past, more so than we do now because we're trapped in a temporal

990
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:03,720
prison.

991
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:10,160
And that's where I come in as a unique factor in being a nomad.

992
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:15,080
And of course, all these other tribes back in the day were nomadic, right?

993
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:20,200
And when you're a nomad like me traveling around in a van, those type of events are like

994
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:23,320
a daily occurrence because you never know where you're going.

995
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:24,640
You never know what you're doing.

996
01:35:24,640 --> 01:35:26,840
You never know what's going to happen.

997
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:32,080
So you get to experience that mentality that you're discussing each day.

998
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,560
And so it becomes part of your reality.

999
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:39,680
And so the nomadic tribes were obviously living in this of it when they would not know where

1000
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:42,560
they were going or what they were going to walk into.

1001
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:44,360
And you get that a whole lot more.

1002
01:35:44,360 --> 01:35:53,480
I would suggest the nomadic culture is rooted in the, they're very much rooted, even if you

1003
01:35:53,480 --> 01:36:00,720
study their culture, any culture that is nomadic, as a byproduct of catastrophism.

1004
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:05,880
In other words, every nomadic culture or tribe once had an established city, but what had

1005
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:12,520
befallen them was a natural catastrophe, so bad and so de-rept that forced them to abandon

1006
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:16,920
the city or the survivors would then be nomadic.

1007
01:36:16,920 --> 01:36:19,560
And they would try it again and again, they would be destroyed.

1008
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:24,040
So they said, screw this, developing a fixed place, we're just going to be nomadic.

1009
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:28,680
You see, so I would suggest anyone to look into that as a historical concept and you'll

1010
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:33,640
find it to be true, whether it's the Native Americans or the Tiguan's in Libya, whatever

1011
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:41,800
they, you'll find rooted in their culture is a catastrophic cycles within their existence.

1012
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:48,000
Is there, as long as we have the recurring flood in every, seemingly every culture, if you

1013
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:53,960
go back far enough, you have the recurring catastrophic flood as a common, you know?

1014
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:56,880
Yeah, I would like to plug archaics, Jason Brasiers.

1015
01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:58,240
I'm not, I don't endorse him.

1016
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:03,320
I don't endorse his stuff, but if I, he's to spend 25 years looking at the Phoenix cycle

1017
01:37:03,320 --> 01:37:07,580
that happens every hundred and 38 years and I was very skeptical, but I've seen enough

1018
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:12,240
evidence that it does come around every hundred and 38 years, the next one being 2040.

1019
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:15,200
I don't endorse most of his stuff.

1020
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:21,120
Its country, Texas meets the internet, that's fine, but most of his stuff I hate to say is,

1021
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:25,880
I don't like it when people are taking advantage of other people's ignorance, so he'll say

1022
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:29,800
some things that seem to be very factual and are not.

1023
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:35,320
So I'm the opposite, I just like to make suggestions and I want people to, it's, by the way,

1024
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:38,360
it's really hard to tell people, do your own research because I hate to say it, most people

1025
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:43,800
don't know how, but still look up what you can as a, and find a reference point to start,

1026
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:48,680
but we are in a catastrophism type existence here.

1027
01:37:48,680 --> 01:37:53,440
Even Charles Darwin said that, everyone thinks it was all about evolution, but in his writings,

1028
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:57,520
he says obviously all these things have come about by serial catastrophes over thousands

1029
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:58,520
of years.

1030
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:03,920
So I just wanted to throw that in about the nomads, but, or, you know, Zorba the Greek,

1031
01:38:03,920 --> 01:38:07,720
wife, kids, house, the whole, like children, the whole catastrophe, right?

1032
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:13,560
So what I'm suggesting is most of our culture and what we have is based on this catastrophism,

1033
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:19,200
you can look at it even, what is the most, when you talk about finance in the media or

1034
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:24,320
even alternative, the most popular term used is what? Financial collapse, how many times

1035
01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:26,520
is that term been used?

1036
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:29,920
That's not, doesn't sound good, it sounds like catastrophism to me, right?

1037
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:30,920
Constant.

1038
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:37,040
Yeah, yeah, we definitely live in the world of catastrophism in all of our history and everything.

1039
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:43,080
It's selective though, there's, from a 40 in perspective, Charles Ford, there have been

1040
01:38:43,080 --> 01:38:48,960
people in one of, some of the worst situations, bombings, storms, whatever, and they came

1041
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,920
out unscathed where the house next to them was completely destroyed.

1042
01:38:52,920 --> 01:39:00,360
So what I'm suggesting is you live in a reality where ultimately if you have the right mindset

1043
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:04,560
that you're going to be okay, you will be okay and don't set yourself up, you know, looking

1044
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,680
into directions, anyone rides a bicycle?

1045
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:07,680
Yeah, or speed.

1046
01:39:07,680 --> 01:39:10,520
That's what I meant by the, yeah, I'm sorry.

1047
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:15,600
But that's what I meant when talking about my nomadic lifestyle or those that are nomads,

1048
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:20,960
is that this becomes kind of a natural interaction between you and the universe where, and therefore

1049
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:27,680
your language and everything is developed around the concepts of this manifestation and

1050
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:32,680
these psychic intuitions that you are receiving from your future self.

1051
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:36,840
It becomes more of a natural just it's part of everyday life.

1052
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:42,440
Yes, that's right, because if something has happened known as history, there is a form

1053
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:44,840
of it that still exists in echo.

1054
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:49,080
And if it's possible that something will happen in the future, there is some formative aspect

1055
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:52,280
that already exists, otherwise it cannot manifest.

1056
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:57,640
So you see the time connection goes in that, I believe this is not really the point of

1057
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:01,920
the remote viewers, but to some extent it is by various exercises.

1058
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:07,520
I think that most of the remote viewing that I've looked at and teachers and they do not

1059
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:12,320
get into these concepts that I think are very helpful.

1060
01:40:12,320 --> 01:40:15,480
And by the way, I can assure you almost none of them know how the human body works.

1061
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:19,040
They think they're absorbing nutrition and whatever.

1062
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:26,960
Well, sorry, I didn't mean it, but yeah, it really definitely becomes this other way of

1063
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:32,760
seeing the universe and then you develop more of maybe even a positive outlook on things

1064
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:36,320
and then as you're saying things to ignore catalog better.

1065
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:41,760
Some people have to be, nothing brings people together like a good catastrophe, right?

1066
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:47,880
So if we could just have that mindset instead and just all pull together, we would could

1067
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:49,920
do it without the catastrophe.

1068
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:55,560
Well, based from a, let's say from a mathematical scientific, historical point of view, and when

1069
01:40:55,560 --> 01:41:01,560
you know a catastrophe is coming, one way to view it is it's necessary cleanup.

1070
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:02,560
It's very inconvenient.

1071
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:08,320
You see, I've always referred to quote unquote, when this society ends, it's not going

1072
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:10,560
to be quote unquote natural random.

1073
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:14,480
It's going to be performed by a cleanup, a mop of crew.

1074
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:18,320
That is not necessary human, but it might be humans that were us from the future again.

1075
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:21,120
You see known as the gods.

1076
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:23,120
Great.

1077
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:26,200
Well, yeah, yes.

1078
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:27,880
This is our world, folks.

1079
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:33,160
And obviously the government thinks that they can make anything out of nothing and they

1080
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:38,760
function on this very principle of something out of nothing.

1081
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:39,760
And I don't know.

1082
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:45,520
Yeah, we're wrapping up the second hour here, but I wanted to thank you, Greek, for, well,

1083
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:52,200
not just for the show, but for giving me a purpose of not caching my stimulus checks.

1084
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:55,400
I did it just out of like screw these guys.

1085
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,280
I don't want their blood money.

1086
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:03,120
But after I listened to your talk, I realized I actually just denied them $10,000.

1087
01:42:03,120 --> 01:42:04,120
Right.

1088
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:07,000
Do we have maybe one squeeze a minute?

1089
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Yeah, we got time.

1090
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
We got time.

1091
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Okay.

1092
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
All right.

1093
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,960
So let's use common NPC talk, my bank account, my money, your money.

1094
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:16,640
Okay, use that stuff, you know, which is legally and lawfully and correct.

1095
01:42:16,640 --> 01:42:20,920
But okay, so I'm going to give this example because I look on the internet about how the money

1096
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:24,040
system works and there is no one discussing it so simply.

1097
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:27,920
It all is just so sad to see because there's a big difference.

1098
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:30,240
People who are smart people who sound smart, right?

1099
01:42:30,240 --> 01:42:31,840
So don't fall for that, by the way.

1100
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,840
So let's give a simple example.

1101
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,400
So whoever here is this will be smart and so great.

1102
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,400
Okay.

1103
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:38,400
Very simple.

1104
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,680
Let's use what I call quote unquote slave talk.

1105
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:41,680
Okay.

1106
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:45,240
All right, guys, I'm going to propose this to everyone listening and you chuck and you

1107
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:46,240
freeman.

1108
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:47,240
All right.

1109
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:52,920
So I have a bank account and it's at minus 1,000 right now minus 1,000 dollars right now.

1110
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:55,120
Can I write a check for $100?

1111
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:56,120
No.

1112
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:57,720
Right.

1113
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:03,840
So if someone gave me a thousand dollars and I put it into that account that's minus 1,000,

1114
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:07,480
can I still write a check for $100?

1115
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:09,040
Answer is no.

1116
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:10,040
Okay.

1117
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:11,040
So all right.

1118
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:14,960
We would have to be at least a 101, a 1,101 dollars.

1119
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:17,120
You'd be able to do that or 1,100.

1120
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:18,120
Okay.

1121
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:19,800
So let's just stop for a minute here.

1122
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:23,120
Take a deep breath and these are government stimulus checks.

1123
01:43:23,120 --> 01:43:25,520
So she's them as an example.

1124
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:29,920
If you go to the US Treasury website, they'll tell you they're 23 trillion, 27 trillion,

1125
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:31,720
whatever minus.

1126
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:34,120
How can they write you a check for a dollar?

1127
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:39,280
In other words, someone is going to have to give the US government 23 trillion or 27 trillion,

1128
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:40,600
whatever they have on the US Treasury.

1129
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:45,640
It's public in order for them to go flush to zero, right?

1130
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:47,480
So these stimulus checks, how does it work?

1131
01:43:47,480 --> 01:43:49,080
How do the government employees get paid?

1132
01:43:49,080 --> 01:43:50,760
It's drawn from your signature.

1133
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:55,180
If you look at fractional reserve banking, how the gold was fractional, the banks had

1134
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:56,180
a dollar worth of gold.

1135
01:43:56,180 --> 01:43:58,740
They could print $10,000 worth of money.

1136
01:43:58,740 --> 01:44:02,780
It's actually 9,000, but let's use the decimal point to be easier.

1137
01:44:02,780 --> 01:44:03,780
Okay.

1138
01:44:03,780 --> 01:44:06,620
So what's going on is you get a stimulus check in the mail.

1139
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:10,260
They have you when they're in their subscription list, literally.

1140
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:11,260
And you get a check.

1141
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:13,780
Let's say it's for $1,000.

1142
01:44:13,780 --> 01:44:18,780
So you go to the bank and you give the bank teller the check and she gives it back to you

1143
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:19,780
so I can't use it.

1144
01:44:19,780 --> 01:44:20,780
You're like, why?

1145
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:21,780
Because she says you have to sign it.

1146
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:22,980
You have to sign the back.

1147
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:23,980
Ah, okay.

1148
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:29,020
So once you sign it, she has something to notice on our terminals as a transaction number.

1149
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:30,100
That's all they have.

1150
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:34,220
And once that's entered in there, on the back side of the bank, known as the control or

1151
01:44:34,220 --> 01:44:38,660
the legal department, they see they got a note with two signatures on it, front and

1152
01:44:38,660 --> 01:44:40,300
back, for $1,000.

1153
01:44:40,300 --> 01:44:42,420
That becomes $10,000.

1154
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:43,420
Okay.

1155
01:44:43,420 --> 01:44:46,740
So they give you the thousand because that's what you're expecting.

1156
01:44:46,740 --> 01:44:52,960
The government gets $3,000, the bank gets $3,000, and whatever leftover goes into whatever

1157
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:56,680
fund or whatever thing they want to float it in.

1158
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:57,680
Right?

1159
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:58,760
And this is how it works.

1160
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:02,080
What manifested that 10 grand was your signature?

1161
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:03,080
Your signature.

1162
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:06,040
And so they give you a thousand dollar check.

1163
01:45:06,040 --> 01:45:07,040
You sign it.

1164
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,040
They sign it.

1165
01:45:08,040 --> 01:45:13,280
You send it in and they get to make 10 grand out of that thousand that they're giving you.

1166
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:14,280
Yep.

1167
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:15,280
Yep.

1168
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:18,920
Well, well, you got to subtract the thousand and then divvy it up, a third, a third, a third.

1169
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:22,920
So in other words, when the government, this was actually, I think, during the Obama

1170
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:26,400
administration, it might have even been Biden that said this.

1171
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:30,080
He says, go out and spend, get into debt because we need the money, meaning the government

1172
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:31,560
needs the money.

1173
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:36,760
So what they're saying is if the government wants to create money on ledger, they send

1174
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:41,680
everyone these checks and once the checks are signed, they become 10 times what they are,

1175
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:42,680
you see?

1176
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:46,000
And then they get a third of that because the bankers get another third plus their fees

1177
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,800
and then it goes into these hedge funds, the leftover.

1178
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,280
This is how it's working.

1179
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:52,400
And then all the poor people got a smart TV.

1180
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:54,160
They're not just monitoring them.

1181
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:56,040
But no one really cares.

1182
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:59,640
No one real, this is completely unlawful and it's barely legal.

1183
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:00,640
Right.

1184
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:01,640
And we're aware of it.

1185
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:02,640
We're totally aware of it, right?

1186
01:46:02,640 --> 01:46:07,400
You would say humanity has a whole, but not of the concept, not really seeing it for real,

1187
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:08,640
but we know we're in debt, right?

1188
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:13,880
We know we can't spend money when we're in debt, but then we see them giving a billion

1189
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:16,120
dollars here and a billion dollars there.

1190
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,160
Well, let's, let's just how the debt works.

1191
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:19,160
Okay.

1192
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:20,160
Everyone's heard of Fourth of July.

1193
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:21,160
Yeah.

1194
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:22,680
Third, so what, right?

1195
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:25,520
But you've never heard of March the 9th, 1933, have you?

1196
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:26,520
Well, look it up.

1197
01:46:26,520 --> 01:46:29,480
March the 9th, 1933 is when this country died.

1198
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:30,800
Now, what does that mean?

1199
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:31,800
We seem to be fine.

1200
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:34,040
Well, it's, it died, but it isn't buried yet.

1201
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:37,080
You know when someone dies, you know, you go to the funeral of the wake a few days later,

1202
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:38,840
they're still not in the ground yet, right?

1203
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,080
You get it?

1204
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:44,480
So you're not in the ground yet, but you died on March the 9th, 1933.

1205
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:45,920
That is for sure.

1206
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:48,200
And if you read it, it's called the Emergency Banking Act.

1207
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:51,120
It's only about two paragraphs, two and a half paragraphs.

1208
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:56,600
It's written strictly, it's very strong legalese when you read words like legal and contract

1209
01:46:56,600 --> 01:46:59,000
and discount those words.

1210
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,300
You better find out what they mean.

1211
01:47:01,300 --> 01:47:07,200
And they basically shifted everything over where the United States government and all the

1212
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:11,440
governments of the world by now are bankrupt and in receivership.

1213
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:15,400
Receivership is when a business becomes bankrupt instead of shutting it down, liquidating

1214
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:18,040
it, you continue running it, but under receivership.

1215
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:20,080
New management.

1216
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:24,560
This new management being the banking cartels, in this case, the liberal versus the conservative

1217
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:28,000
banking cartels.

1218
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,760
Excuse me.

1219
01:47:30,760 --> 01:47:34,720
Is operating the overarching, let's say, suzerain.

1220
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:39,120
And this is pretty much what's going on and they print out everything.

1221
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:41,720
Everything I've told you is completely up in the open.

1222
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:44,960
If you have a secret, put it out, print it, put it in the library.

1223
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:47,120
You know, this is, but no one seems to care.

1224
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:49,440
So if you have people or go up.

1225
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:55,320
As Alan Dulles said, that's the way you'll guarantee that no one will ever read it is to do precisely

1226
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:58,920
that, publish it and put it in the library, which is what he said to do with the Warren Commission

1227
01:47:58,920 --> 01:47:59,920
volumes.

1228
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:00,920
Yeah, perfect.

1229
01:48:00,920 --> 01:48:04,840
And these people like Alan Dulles, you know, he had a bad list, been a club foot, you know,

1230
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:07,240
so he was a tortured individual.

1231
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:11,200
Whenever you run in a listed operation in the legal, unlawful operation like all these

1232
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:16,600
big companies and governments, the people that you put in that will contact the public,

1233
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:20,680
the less they know about what's going on, the better, you see?

1234
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:21,680
That's what Alan is.

1235
01:48:21,680 --> 01:48:25,880
I love the example we brought up on unrated, why, by the way, I think it's perfect.

1236
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:30,160
If anybody thinks back in history, just a little bit to what they called the pizza connection,

1237
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:31,160
right?

1238
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:34,640
There were a drug-running operations that were being run through pizza parlors up in

1239
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:36,640
the Northeast.

1240
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:42,400
The Greek and I might have specialized knowledge on that, but anyway, because we're from a similar

1241
01:48:42,400 --> 01:48:44,160
area in the country.

1242
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:47,240
Anyway, that is an aside.

1243
01:48:47,240 --> 01:48:50,760
Interesting what happened there, though, those pizza places were put out of business, right?

1244
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:52,440
Because they were running in a listed operation.

1245
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:54,960
They were dealing drugs instead of selling pizza.

1246
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:56,200
But what happened?

1247
01:48:56,200 --> 01:49:00,200
They reopened immediately under new management.

1248
01:49:00,200 --> 01:49:03,960
And the guy making the pizza there, he doesn't know what's going on.

1249
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:07,240
Yeah, well, I want to go back to what Freeman said about the debt.

1250
01:49:07,240 --> 01:49:12,680
You see, so when this was done on March the 19th, 1933, the country went to receivership,

1251
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:17,440
how much of, let's say, our grandparents were really put on the skinny and what was going

1252
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:20,600
on in how important it was, no one was.

1253
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:25,720
So what happened was the quote unquote government screwed up its responsibility to us.

1254
01:49:25,720 --> 01:49:28,000
We had nothing to do with it.

1255
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:32,640
So what they did in short is when you get a birth certificate, that number, social security

1256
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:35,920
number is attached to a birth certificate, that is called an exemption.

1257
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:37,240
You're exempt from debt.

1258
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:40,600
You're exempt from levy and fine because they took away your ability to quote unquote

1259
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:42,160
pay for it.

1260
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:46,360
So whenever you're dealing with anything legal or corporate, whenever you start signing

1261
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:50,320
all their applications, you ever look at the fine print, what you're doing is waving

1262
01:49:50,320 --> 01:49:51,320
your exemption.

1263
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:55,200
You are exempt from all of this because it wasn't your fault.

1264
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:59,920
And so the birth certificate represents an exemption, but what they do through contracts

1265
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:04,640
that are known as unconsurable contracts, unilateral contracts, you're actually waving

1266
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:09,200
that protection that you have that exemption and becoming a debtor, becoming a citizen,

1267
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:12,080
becoming a subject, becoming a resident, right?

1268
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:14,080
And these things all have attachments.

1269
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:20,000
Now it's gotten to the point where it's so bad that anyone like myself or anyone goes out

1270
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:24,960
and public and starts speaking about this, it's so rarefied that it's easy to call this

1271
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:28,880
person a nutcase, a sovereign citizen, a terrorist, don't listen to him and guess what, the rest

1272
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:30,920
of the public believes it, right?

1273
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:31,920
No, no.

1274
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:38,160
So any thoughts on Fed now coming out in July with the CBDCs?

1275
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:39,560
Well let's just say this.

1276
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:43,720
Let's go back real quick.

1277
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:47,160
Cryptocurrencies are the same operation like ISIS and al-Qaeda was intelligence operation.

1278
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:52,840
If you bought Bitcoin for example at 20 cents and it became 50,000, anytime you see 5,000,

1279
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:57,200
10,000% profit, that's an intelligence agency operation, right?

1280
01:50:57,200 --> 01:50:59,080
Like it or not, believe it or not.

1281
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:02,800
So I think it's just the continuation of that.

1282
01:51:02,800 --> 01:51:07,880
Another example of the CBDCs is this, with early computer programming and all this

1283
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:09,520
other stuff, you know, you couldn't take a college course.

1284
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:12,240
But the industry was flourishing.

1285
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:17,480
Colleges didn't start giving courses on, you know, openly to about programming and all

1286
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:22,080
the stuff until the PCs already became a thing, you know, they didn't develop their courses.

1287
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:23,200
So it's very much like that.

1288
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:25,760
They look like Johnny Cummletley, but they're not.

1289
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:29,360
The intelligence community and the banking community are tied in.

1290
01:51:29,360 --> 01:51:34,400
I knew a woman who did accounting for one of these big banks, HBDC or whatever.

1291
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:38,440
And she quit after working there for about 20 years or so.

1292
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:41,920
And one of the stories that she gave after a few drinks was like someone that was very,

1293
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:46,800
very wealthy, influential, like a Gates or Jeff Bozo or something like that.

1294
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:52,920
They're in the public eye and they actually use those companies to, let's say, bring in

1295
01:51:52,920 --> 01:51:56,160
and foreshadow policies that the government will use later.

1296
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:59,360
So if they approach someone like Bill Gates or Jeff Bozo and say, we want you to tell

1297
01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:02,760
the public you're going to be doing this because it's going to be the front end of a program

1298
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:06,200
that we want to do later and they refuse.

1299
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:10,880
They go and check their bank balance, let's say Bill Gates, whatever, and it's zero.

1300
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:14,360
And they know they just check their bank balance and they get a phone call right away and says,

1301
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:15,360
do you want to reconsider?

1302
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,360
And what do they say?

1303
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:18,880
Well, of course I do.

1304
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:23,200
One of these things came to a head when recently Jeff Bozo said that he was going to give

1305
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:24,960
all his money away to charity.

1306
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:26,640
Do you remember that article?

1307
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:27,640
Yeah.

1308
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:28,640
Yeah, why?

1309
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:29,640
Because he's tired of this.

1310
01:52:29,640 --> 01:52:31,360
And he's not being public anymore.

1311
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:33,200
But he's forget about that.

1312
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:35,640
So how does this tie into the digital currency?

1313
01:52:35,640 --> 01:52:39,880
I just gave you much of the nefarious background that surrounds all of it.

1314
01:52:39,880 --> 01:52:40,880
Yes.

1315
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:45,640
What it will be eventually is that if you say something because they're listening to everything

1316
01:52:45,640 --> 01:52:49,640
anyone that discusses something, you want to discuss having buying a new couch, guess

1317
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:50,640
what?

1318
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:53,400
You go to your computer or phone and there's a couch advertisement, right?

1319
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:54,400
Right.

1320
01:52:54,400 --> 01:52:55,760
Well, they're letting you know they're listening.

1321
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:59,480
So if you say something or do something, you won't be able to buy.

1322
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:01,840
Let's say they say you're too fat.

1323
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:03,400
You want to go buy a chocolate cake.

1324
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:05,400
You can't buy the chocolate cake.

1325
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:06,400
You're too fat.

1326
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:08,920
You see the chat and GBT ties into this now, right?

1327
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:09,920
Yeah.

1328
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:11,160
Yeah, it's not good.

1329
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:12,160
It's not good.

1330
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:14,760
But if you view it as not being good, it won't be good.

1331
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:18,480
If you view it as you're running your horse race and it's an inconvenience because if you're

1332
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:23,600
running in last place, you're a little inconvenience and a horse race, but it doesn't mean you're still

1333
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:26,800
not going to use the best of your horse racing skills.

1334
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:30,640
But my thing, what I like to do with Ocelli and the Greek rated wide, all the Greeks

1335
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:34,600
speak over the years is I've noticed that the people are lacking the skills and these are

1336
01:53:34,600 --> 01:53:36,360
not special special skills.

1337
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:38,800
They just need to be shared.

1338
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:44,480
And I just happen to be the only one that is giving this type of information and what could

1339
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:48,880
come out of it eventually is a leaderless organization because if you have enough people

1340
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:54,520
thinking the same, all spread apart all over the world, it's going to eventually spread

1341
01:53:54,520 --> 01:53:56,480
around to even those that haven't heard it.

1342
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:58,040
The cosmic superhighway.

1343
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:00,040
So again, we just, we're doing the same thing.

1344
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:01,600
Instead, we're doing the Freeman show.

1345
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:04,600
You know, I could speak for the next 16 hours on various things.

1346
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:07,280
So let us know what you'd like, Freeman.

1347
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:09,240
Well, I think we've done it.

1348
01:54:09,240 --> 01:54:17,240
I think that that was a fantastic show and definitely it makes anyone and everyone to head

1349
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:19,280
over to rated wide.

1350
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:26,320
I mean, I want to hear more, but I need 16 hours of you, the Greek.

1351
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:28,160
And you two together, this is great.

1352
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:29,640
This was such a treat for me.

1353
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:33,800
Thank you, Ateli, for coming in and joining us here.

1354
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:34,800
Absolutely.

1355
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:36,720
Thank you, Freeman, for inviting me.

1356
01:54:36,720 --> 01:54:42,360
And there's already a well over 10 sonic events over there right now.

1357
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:43,360
Fantastic.

1358
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:44,880
Yes, it's growing.

1359
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:47,760
I'm so glad that you guys are keeping this going.

1360
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:56,480
And, you know, I just, it's amazing to me to constantly hear this miraculous view of reality.

1361
01:54:56,480 --> 01:55:02,720
From so many different aspects and so many different ways and always leading back to this, it's

1362
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:04,200
astounding for me.

1363
01:55:04,200 --> 01:55:08,800
So I love being on this end of things where, you know, yeah, I get to talk with great people

1364
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:09,800
like you.

1365
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:12,560
So, yeah, it was great, guys.

1366
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:13,800
I thank you so much.

1367
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:19,120
I don't even know what else to say because we covered it.

1368
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:20,120
Cool.

1369
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:21,840
Well, until the next time.

1370
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:22,840
Thank you.

1371
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:23,840
All right.

1372
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:24,840
All right, guys.

1373
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:30,240
I'm getting as much out of this and maybe we are the ones forming this new noosphere where

1374
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:35,080
we've got the mind to really just generate all of this and recognize everyone that you

1375
01:55:35,080 --> 01:55:37,920
don't have to go into interactions with people.

1376
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:39,240
This is all ethereal.

1377
01:55:39,240 --> 01:55:42,800
So simple as that, you just have to believe.

1378
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:47,720
And we'll continue to bring you evidence of all of the amazing abilities that you have

1379
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:52,480
because you are you and alive and we're here to do this now.

1380
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:58,560
So I hope you all will get out there and live life, love life and we'll make it through

1381
01:55:58,560 --> 01:55:59,560
all of this guys.

1382
01:55:59,560 --> 01:56:00,560
All right.

1383
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:02,960
So we'll see you next week.
