00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,800
Hello and welcome to the Free Zone!

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,600
Well folks it was bound to happen.

4
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,440
Aliens from Hell has been banned worldwide.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,760
I hope you got a chance to get to see that lecture of mine.

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,320
They have banned 28 of my lectures folks.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,680
28 of my shows have been banned on YouTube.

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,760
Many of them banned worldwide and it seems they don't want me teaching you this stuff.

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,440
So if you're going to look at Aliens from Hell, well you can't.

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,000
And I'll tell you it is so important right now for you to get that lecture.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,600
So the best way to get it of course is to go to freemantv.com and buy the DVD.

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,080
I'm going to have to get it out to you, get it to the members or whatever I...

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,080
[Music]

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,000
Currently it is.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,240
So you can not want Aliens from Hell.

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:21,440
And this is kind of bummer for me at this moment because of this new Obama Presidential Center that's coming up.

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,200
It is scheduled for the year 2021, excuse me.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,400
While the reason the Obama Presidential Center made me laugh on Twitter.

19
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,680
And if you're not following me on Twitter, it's freemantv.

20
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,440
I highly recommend it.

21
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:46,240
I was laughing when I saw the architectural design for the Obama Presidential Center which will be in South City, Chicago.

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,760
You know where Obama calls home. Well folks, this is an ancient Egyptian architecture.

23
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,160
Now as they're building this thing and they got the designs out there in the plans for you to see.

24
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,440
It is an ancient Egyptian architecture.

25
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,880
Now what really struck me is as you guys know I went to university for ancient architecture.

26
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,680
And there was this thing that they taught us about there when I was learning about Egypt.

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:20,720
And it was called a "Mastaba." And a "Mastaba" according to the professor at the university is an unknown building.

28
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,720
It is a building that they say is a faux building.

29
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,640
Right? Look it up. "Mastaba" - M-A-S-T-A-B-A.

30
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:36,880
And you will see that the archaeologists, the architects, they all classify this as a faux building

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,680
because they don't know what its purpose is.

32
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,440
And so they said, "Well they built these giant "Mastaba." I mean they're almost as tall as pyramid some of them.

33
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,800
And well maybe not that tall but they're pretty big.

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,680
And they don't know what their purpose is.

35
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,560
So they say, "Well it's just a fake front."

36
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,360
So that raiders would attack that thinking that that was what they needed to attack.

37
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,360
So anyway, Barack Obama's Presidential Center coming 2021 is there...

38
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,680
...as a massive Egyptian structure.

39
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,200
And what they're telling you, you can learn there if you're a good Chicago citizen is how...

40
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,320
What it means to be a good citizen.

41
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,840
What does it mean to be a good citizen?

42
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,560
Well we're going to talk about this today with our very special guest, the Greek.

43
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,560
And he is from UncommonRadio.com.

44
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,160
You definitely want to get in there and check this guy out.

45
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,760
Now all of you wrote to me and said, "We love the Greek."

46
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,040
You guys did.

47
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,160
They were like, "Who is this guy? How can I find him?"

48
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,760
And I'm like, "Well he doesn't really exist. He's a guerrilla journalist."

49
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,600
I mean he's not out there for your...

50
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,280
for you to...

51
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,280
You know he's there for you, all right?

52
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,480
He's there not to make a name for himself, not to be known,

53
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,120
not to have millions of people going to his website

54
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,960
because the Greek has come into you as a guerrilla journalist

55
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,600
to bring you this information that you need.

56
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,800
And this is going to toss everything on its head

57
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,160
as you have been trying to understand how our world works

58
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,960
and what it means to be a good citizen.

59
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,040
You're going to learn a lot more on this show.

60
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,840
And the Greek has something good to say about all of you.

61
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,320
I've been telling you you're the best audience.

62
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,400
Well you're about to find out why.

63
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,360
So please welcome to the show, The Greek.

64
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,440
Hey Freeman, great to be back.

65
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,520
I know and I'll tell you, I'm not wanting to give compliments

66
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,840
and let's just say this objectively.

67
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,680
I've been speaking publicly and semi-publicly for over a decade

68
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,640
and recently did a little website so people can get in touch

69
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,160
and this is probably the third sonic event that you and I are doing.

70
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,080
And people have reached out a few five six or so.

71
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,240
The number is not important but I would say that

72
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,240
90% of the people that I have been in touch with

73
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,760
or have reached out that have given commentary

74
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,840
that is objective, discerning and just downright well educated

75
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,440
have come from this audience.

76
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,400
Now don't take this as a compliment, it's a fact.

77
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,480
So somehow some way the crop of listeners

78
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:26,000
that you have garnered tend to be in the top 10,

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,160
if not top 10, 1% of what I consider to be surface dwelling

80
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,440
earth inhabited free thinkers and intelligent thinkers.

81
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,000
So I just wanted, I was sort of astounded

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,240
but I shouldn't be because it's a fact.

83
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,800
So if we're going to be objective just state the fact.

84
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,400
And again most of the people that have had the best commentary

85
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,800
and the most perceptive discerning and objective

86
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,360
have come from Freeman's audience.

87
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,520
So whatever you guys want to take that,

88
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,600
that's what I've experienced so far.

89
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,760
I told you folks, I told you.

90
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,760
Yeah, that's so awesome.

91
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,760
I love it because we are an intelligent group here

92
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,600
that are really seeking answers.

93
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
We are not out there in a witch hunt.

94
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,760
We are trying to sort things out.

95
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,840
So you're not going to hear a lot of politics

96
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,200
and things of that nature unless it's very important

97
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,520
because we see that as the theater.

98
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,680
I mean one of the things that we can look at

99
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,520
like we're going to discuss what it means

100
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,520
to be a good citizen a little bit.

101
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,480
When we're looking towards our elections

102
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,720
and towards the world's elections

103
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,560
and we'll get to the Middle East Union

104
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,320
and how these things are forming.

105
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,120
I mean it was reported that 28% of France voted.

106
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,000
28%.

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,960
You know?

108
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,680
I mean are we starting to move away from this whole charade

109
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,120
or is there something more nefarious going on

110
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,640
in this malevolent structure we have set up?

111
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Well yeah, interestingly enough

112
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,240
if let's say a group of people conspiratorial or not

113
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,880
but are going to hatch a plan to broadcast

114
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,080
or instill upon society that is malevolent or bad

115
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,280
it has to be presented as being good.

116
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,960
You know like rat poison is 98% good stuff

117
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,000
or whatever.

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,480
There is going to be something that is in the presentation

119
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,240
whether it's skin deep or not

120
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,360
that is going to be taken as the whole also being.

121
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,600
You see so the presentation has to be good

122
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,480
and the intent has to be shown as being good

123
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,760
even though the slightest examination you see it's not.

124
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,720
You know one good analogy for that

125
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,600
Freeman might be packaged food.

126
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,320
How many people might enjoy a brand or a type of food

127
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,080
and someone walks into the room and says

128
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,360
have you read the ingredients?

129
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,160
Well no I haven't.

130
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,760
Let's go see what's in this.

131
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,560
Maybe I shouldn't be eating this so much right?

132
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,880
So this is one of the aspects of maybe tying it back into citizenship

133
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,320
or citizen of what?

134
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,120
You see?

135
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,920
Yes.

136
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,520
There's much discussion about that.

137
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,400
Let's just, you know we've let's just say both sides

138
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,600
and the both sides of meaning information that people are getting.

139
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,160
You know you're getting the central party line

140
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,480
let's say the official line and then you have what's called

141
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,800
the alternative fringe commentary

142
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,400
and on the what I can comment on what can be seen

143
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,240
objectively on the fringe or the alternative is that the government's a

144
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,160
corporation and that makes it bad.

145
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,320
Let's think about that for a minute folks.

146
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,960
There is no discussion on whether or not it is a benevolent corporation

147
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,800
or a malevolent corporation and what is the status of that corporation?

148
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,240
No discussion.

149
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,640
Corporations folks are not bad unless they're bad corporations.

150
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,200
Right?

151
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,400
Now typically we've seen that theme being brought about over and over and over

152
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,600
what's called the legal fiction, the corporation and such.

153
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,000
But let's just take a moment from the whole thing Freeman.

154
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,200
I said listen Freeman we're going to start a corporation

155
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,440
and we're going to get all these billionaires to give us let's say

156
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,240
fun so we can help anyone in need

157
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,280
and when we've helped everyone in need then we fold it

158
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,800
and we go about our way.

159
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,000
What's so bad about that corporation?

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,520
That's all we do.

161
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,320
Yeah nothing.

162
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,520
That's fine.

163
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,680
But the problem is typically people don't understand because

164
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,600
this is it's not because they don't understand it's because what they're looking at

165
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,360
and it's usually skin deep.

166
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,160
The corporation is very simple it just shares liability so

167
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,880
instead of one person taking 100% liability they spread it amongst five people

168
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,680
so they each get 20% that's one way to look at it

169
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,240
or it's a representative body a corp oh meaning body you know even though it is

170
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,520
in the legal fiction.

171
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,200
So let's go back to the government aspect and the citizen aspect that

172
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,960
shows a form of maybe patriotism or allegiance doesn't it when you say

173
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,880
citizen which is fine.

174
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,840
Let's just go look at what the classified don't

175
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,840
hold me to this figure anyone could look it up is it 186 or 194 countries in the

176
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,320
world today somehow maybe more some states up to 300.

177
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,000
Let's just put it this way.

178
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,560
Most of the countries that you have heard about have gone bankrupt.

179
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,880
Now this sounds pretty okay now let's just say now that we've taken for granted their

180
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,040
corporations let's move on from this they have gone into some form of bankruptcy

181
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,960
between the 1930s and later and now if anyone understands what bankruptcy is

182
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,360
well you know you owe money and you can't pay it so you

183
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,120
you're shut down and when you just discuss bankruptcy basically people that you

184
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,080
owe money to they call them creditors come in

185
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,800
and like vultures they just divide the the the organization the store the whatever

186
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,560
the fixtures or assets on paper or not and to satisfy the outstanding debts

187
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,720
and they and they liquidate it it's gone right that's typically what's

188
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,160
thought about and they're very various chapters in bankruptcy

189
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,720
but let's say an institution like a large department store or an old

190
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,280
true store or hardware store or or something that has become a fixture in

191
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,840
society or community and offers it's better to keep it around than to liquidate

192
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,760
it well even though it goes into bankruptcy they put it in what's called

193
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,640
receivership you ever see certain institutions say under new

194
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,360
management right that's sometimes denotes a receivership so all it means is

195
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,440
that the proprietors and those that originated the business or the fixture in

196
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,520
society have lost all control of it to another group of people that they

197
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:29,920
had previous debts to simple isn't it now most corporations that exist today

198
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,040
that are in the government entity category are in receivership to what's called

199
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,040
the private banking institutions you want to call them federal reserves and

200
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,040
whatever that's fine and because they are in receivership

201
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,720
and they can they have no ability to pay for anything you they have put in

202
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,200
what's called credit systems every country has a credit system or it is a

203
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,280
credit based economy not a debt based economy a credit based economy

204
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,440
and that would be the foundation for perhaps presenting certain things so what

205
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,520
do you think up to this point Freeman I'm I'm I'm wondering the

206
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,720
difference between a debt and a credit based system okay let's just say let's

207
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,200
just put the debt side aside because that's all you hear about and no one can

208
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,240
explain it because if you're in debt how are you gonna and all you have is debt

209
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,680
and money is debt how are you gonna pay a debt with a debt right okay how can you

210
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,680
right so you so that is called you know an anti-maxim or it's an

211
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,320
impossibility in law let's just examine what is really going on

212
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,080
because these things in your people's wallets they're there either notes or

213
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,880
credit cards they're not debt cards they're either credit or debit or they're

214
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,920
notes right they're not not money cards and they're not debt cards right

215
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,720
right so the only evidence of any of that is secondary and we'll just get into

216
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,920
it a little bit you know for example when you go to a casino or one of these

217
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,320
closed loop organizations right that deal with what's called money when you sit

218
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,920
down at the black chip black check table the roulette table or whatever can you

219
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,600
just go into the pocket and pull out some notes or coins already have to go

220
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,960
and get chips from the cashier that are particular to that casino yeah

221
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,440
got to trade them in that's right it's the latter so when when anyone is born into

222
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,760
one of these government institutions that have gone into receivership

223
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,240
you are given what's called a credit line not a line of credit a credit line

224
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,160
and that credit line is so you can function in that society and that's usually

225
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,480
a number known as a social security number or it's issued by via the birth

226
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,920
certificate no no matter how nefarious or malevolent

227
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,440
you might think or presume it is i'm giving you the basic format in the template

228
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,160
for what this is okay so but what's going on is you have something called

229
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,480
human nature because this credit line is being issued to people is it not

230
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,000
it's not being issued to machines or dogs or cats at this point actually

231
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,240
these can be so so what's going on basically is that human nature is such a way

232
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,600
that if you told people essentially well you see you don't really need a job

233
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,600
because all you have to do is sign your name and you get food clothing

234
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,880
shelter cars or whatever you need utilities and all that and you don't need a

235
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,480
job you just need to find what your natural talent is and pursue that because

236
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,640
we have all these things that need to be maintained in society you need to

237
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,080
still work it's going to really confuse them right because most people have

238
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,920
the for thousands of years that if i don't work i die you know if i don't have

239
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,480
money i you know or grow what i need i die i need access to funds

240
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,000
so one of the analogies i give is imagine that if people were told at this point

241
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,040
just overnight or even 30 or 70 years ago you don't need to work for money all you

242
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,400
need to do is go if you need water gas electric food clothing a

243
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:03,120
Ferrari a you go if you're old enough to remember those little cars or a house or

244
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,040
rent or anything that you normally use what's called money for all you have to do

245
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,400
is provide the credit line number that you have and sign the name and you get it

246
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,480
now let me just give you this is not for everyone but this is enough people imagine in the

247
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,000
west typically you would you know you you go down the street and you see someone and they've

248
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,520
got the air conditioning on the windows open the water running and the stove on and they're

249
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,320
leaving the house and you're like how about conserving a little bit you know and turning off

250
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,760
you know all that stuff you know and it's like well screw you man it's already paid for

251
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:40,240
right that's you know you're going to get enough of that in human society at this point

252
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,600
that's yeah so let's go back to the receivership you know the something called a trustee you

253
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,160
know someone you trust to run the organization like a manager in a store as a trustee he doesn't

254
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,760
own it or whatever but he's running it and he's like the represents an authority the legal society

255
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:01,840
has been tasked as being trustees now even that little attorney that has a little office

256
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,200
down main street you know he is in the position where he has you know more access to the legal

257
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,480
society and these things and you do now when i see the legal society i'm not just talking about

258
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,600
attorneys and attorneys are not lawyers by the way you could look up the difference

259
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:22,160
i'm talking about this it's an entire society meaning there are judges there are attorneys

260
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,520
there are clerks there are police there is you see it's the entire society there are buildings

261
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:33,680
and institutions around them it's the entire society has been tasked to keep the rest of the people

262
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:41,840
in check now i think what we've just said is very simply i would say slightly contradicting

263
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,240
to what you hear in a lot of the alternative information avenues you know about let's say the

264
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:52,800
straw man and the debt based and and you really can't blame people for following their perception

265
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,560
and and even though it's skin deep or paper thin in most cases you can't blame them for following

266
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,800
it but we're not here to discuss who's right or who's wrong we're just maybe here to lay out

267
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:09,520
what is really going on that anyone can look at so it's really i can say Freeman it's

268
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,200
there's an aspect of human nature that is at the root cause of a lot of these quote-unquote

269
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:22,560
financial problems and not what we've been told right you see and and until this changes because

270
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,520
you know when you say you mentioned aliens from hell or whatever or earlier uh where do these

271
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,920
attorneys come from do they come from like alpha centurally through a wormhole or something or they

272
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,000
or are they people just you see are they from earth you see yeah so there's some strange inspiration by

273
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,280
the way folks if you read any the ancient texts you know you hear like Satan or you know the malevolent

274
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,840
forces in the world when you translate that into the language i'm not talking about the Hollywood

275
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,960
type stuff now what it actually means these malevolent forces are known as adversarial to you they're

276
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,000
adversaries so what that means if you say ugly they say pretty if they say hot they say cold just the

277
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,600
opposite of what you right so the attorneys actually represent that force boots on the ground

278
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,440
it's kind of like uh what was that a couple of alien movies like that where the aliens came in and

279
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,840
they looked like humans or whatever right right but spiritually right and this is not um and you

280
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,240
know societies and trouble when you the parents i think they stopped doing this a while back but

281
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,760
they said i want my child to grow up to be a doctor and a lawyer and essentially so you don't do

282
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,800
much and get paid a lot right you know they i don't think they do that very much anymore but i don't

283
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,480
think anyone knows what to say anymore other than still i think they're still pranking the children

284
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,720
though which we've discussed before now this is the planet of the prank right so so i wanted to

285
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:46,560
bring up that a little bit because how does that connect you with citizenship because you know it's

286
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:51,520
let's just keep this straight there's a lot of biblical clichés that are being used inaccurately

287
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:58,480
it's it's not money that's the root of all evil it's the love of money is a difference right yes

288
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,800
so absence of can there be love of money even though there's absence of money

289
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:09,360
sure because it we're not requiring the substance to love it do we right right so what what's

290
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,960
interesting this is from the humor or irony from the gods is that they because the gods by the way

291
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:21,040
don't speak well of humans by the way in case you haven't noticed so interesting uh they took the money

292
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,400
away and no one's noticed and just to prove the point aren't there still people putting on let's say

293
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,240
ski masks with guns holding up bank clerks for notes that are not money yeah are they still doing

294
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,840
it it's the love of money yeah you know you it's real easy to shut down a public thoroughfare just full

295
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,040
of get a thousand bucks worth of dollar bills in a bag and let them out the window at highway speed

296
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:51,280
watch what happens why why isn't it more important to properly navigate a five thousand pound vehicle

297
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:59,200
made of glass and and steal down the road then chase a piece of paper you know anyway yeah no it's a spell

298
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,160
it's a spell without a doubt oh yeah yeah it's also it's part of the cosmic censorship that i've

299
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,280
discussed and this is one thing that the listeners uh you you know would appreciate the high

300
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,600
weirdness aspect because i want to bring this up folks i i really want to get into the high

301
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,360
weirdness aspect of everything that is real yes it's real because not because i say so is because

302
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,760
you can say so once you're made aware of it very simple um and the high weirdness of all this is

303
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,320
is important to bring up because otherwise it's like oh the Greek is lecturing us again on he sounds

304
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,400
pedantic and you know he's talking about stuff we've heard of but i don't agree with it oh forget

305
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,320
about that i'm saying that listen this goes into the high weirdness category i mean this is beyond

306
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:46,720
you know the truth is stranger than fiction the truth is a lot weirder than fiction you know so this

307
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,680
is perhaps what we might want to go down and also talk about some obvious things but do you remember

308
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:57,040
Freeman if you ever have me on i discuss what's called cosmic censorship and i mean it means just that

309
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,440
it's you know what is censorship and what is cosmic meaning the world being affected you know from a

310
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:08,400
higher vantage point let's say right the the people i want to give to a metaphor in an old person

311
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:15,280
story if i may one of the metaphors on how cosmic censorship has been working on humanity now for

312
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:25,600
2500 years is this is an ancient metaphor let's say the censoring cosmically would be taking certain

313
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,880
critical information whether it is historical scientific cultural or or about the gods or whatever

314
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,160
and sealing it so people can't see it right so imagine a book or a scroll that's been sealed

315
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:42,000
and when you present that to someone and they say well i can't read it because it's sealed

316
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,920
right but then you present it to someone else and they say well i can't read that because see i'm

317
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:54,240
illiterate and then you present it to someone else and they say well i can't read it because i'm blind

318
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,440
so it's not just one simple thing the information is shut up you also have to consider the variety of

319
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,440
the people that are on the earth right now so what is what i want to get into perhaps is what's coming

320
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,600
in the future which is important to know and i'll say that because what is coming starting next

321
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,480
spring time because year goes from spring to spring by the way and the winter is an interim period

322
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,360
is that what you will start seeing in the next seven years or so is the blind are going to begin to

323
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,080
see more and the illiterate are going to be more literate and then the seal will open a little bit

324
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:33,520
you see so the cosmic censorship really affects now if i let me just explain what i just said

325
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,960
it affects those mostly that notice the seal don't they right Freeman because if you're

326
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,160
illiterate it didn't matter if it was sealed or not did it and if you're blind did it matter if it

327
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,920
was sealed or not so you see that you see the irony of this parable it's very it gets even deeper now

328
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:57,280
so but before these things are really open from a cosmic level the blind are going to get more vision

329
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,760
metaphorically and those that are illiterate are going to be more literate meaning you're going to

330
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,680
learn a little bit more about how to convey the the the the sea of information so this is what i'm

331
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,560
getting at for the next seven years that that's going to begin and what this is going to lead to is a

332
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,760
new paradigm on the earth which is going to appear very good but it won't be ultimately but it

333
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,920
will be because it goes back and forth you know right the the other story i want to give is an old

334
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:30,720
Persian parable or story this goes back to the days of zoraster let's say mythra back in the day

335
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:39,120
about the the waters that made people crazy have you heard this one no okay well back in ancient times

336
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:46,240
this certain angelic being came to a man and said you should go and stockpile with cisterns and

337
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,480
vases and containers the water that you know is good because soon all the water will be pulled away

338
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,960
from the earth and no one will have water to drink and when the water is brought back this new water

339
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,640
whoever drinks it will make them crazy so the man followed the advice and gathered all the good

340
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,920
spring water and he just drank from that so what happened the waters went away and then the waters

341
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,960
came back and whoever drank those new waters went crazy and when that was going on they all called

342
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,640
the man who was drinking from the water he had saved the good water let's say crazy they called him crazy

343
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,360
and he was really feeling abused and under you know under a lot of pressures he said maybe i'm

344
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:31,120
going to go drink some of the water that everyone else is drinking and he did and it made him crazy too

345
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:38,800
and now everybody was okay with him right i know it has more meaning and farcy but but but you get

346
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:44,320
the point yeah yeah it's a very simple way of showing and illustrating what is going on yeah we see

347
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:51,040
that constantly yes and that's why there is no real change and why we can't get people you know the

348
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:58,400
Hopi prophecy basically said you know rejoice at all of those that are flowing in the flood with you

349
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:06,080
and and you know share with them enjoy the fact that you are all being washed down this river together

350
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:15,120
and you know so we have these cycles and we have knowledge that i mean right now we look at the internet

351
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,960
and we feel like we're getting every little tidbit of information and everybody's all stressed out as

352
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,800
they're worried about the russian trump you know they're worried about the the french election they're

353
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:33,920
worried about this that and the other and you know this level of stress will never allow people to

354
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:39,600
start to find their true path right and also how efficient is it to stress for things that will

355
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:46,160
never really happen is that that's like dummy loading that's just waste that's for sure yeah and also

356
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:50,720
I think we mentioned before we started with if you're physically stressed you recover much easier

357
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,840
than if you're emotionally stressed so definitely definitely definitely you're much better off

358
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,360
working yourself down to the bone and and and feel it all good and and falling into your bed and just

359
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,880
out but if you're stressed you're gonna go to bed and you're gonna toss in turn and you're awake up in

360
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,600
the same condition tomorrow so they're putting you through a spiritual labor camp right

361
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:17,840
they're working your mind and spirit i think we've defined mind and soul or spirit and soul

362
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,000
which is a mind and breath and up before that people can seek what what those things really mean

363
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,080
because at this point many people are still quote-unquote stuck in the convention they're drinking

364
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,000
the water or or i think the cool eight is another more of a western apropos matter for and i think

365
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,920
that was after that thing that happened central america but i would suggest that the reason the

366
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:47,040
main reason you're you would want to listen to what's being said is so you live a life of efficiency

367
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:51,920
or more efficient and i think i've given examples about that and other times that we you and i've

368
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,800
gotten together and there's over a hundred hours of archives on uncommon radio and and that's

369
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,520
all you're gonna get there is just archives but in the future there'll be a new project probably a

370
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,320
podcast or something because i think i was mentioning to you freeman when you speak in public you

371
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:13,120
get to a saturation point of what can be said at open uh and then you you want to go to the next

372
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,520
level like you know i tell people i never share more than 10 percent it's not because i'm holding back

373
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,920
deliberately it just doesn't seem like it could be done in good taste like i think you and i had a

374
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,560
discussion you know when you were in in a public setting even a conference room you can address to

375
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:30,640
a certain point and when it gets kind of critical so you say hey freeman how can i speak to you

376
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,840
over here for a minute you know you want to speak more privately and more private more things will

377
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,480
come out and and more elaboration more of the same but it'll be you'll get if you think you've

378
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,680
ever gotten a haw moment listening to greek speak you're gonna get like a double triple a ha moment

379
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:51,600
and and of course that you know this is just the way things are more is always said in private you know

380
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,160
but what i want to just suggest is that you know we brought up pranking we brought up the dummy

381
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:02,080
load we brought up cosmic censorship but the thing is uh whenever you're going to convey information

382
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,520
you know it has to be useful what's the opposite of useful useless so i've ever heard of useless

383
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,320
information right oh let's have you ever heard of useful information i got to think about that

384
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,800
for a minute right why right it's got to be that way now in other words if whatever you're investing

385
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:25,840
you know i used to tell people by the way a long time ago you know if they hired someone or me you know

386
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,320
i'd say you know you don't ever have to be concerned about firing me because if i ever find out

387
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,120
i'm talking to the boss now if i ever find out that i am not making you money i will quit

388
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,040
you see how many people work and they're like oh i don't care as long as i get my hours you owe me

389
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:46,160
my hours right this is what's going on with information as well unfortunately people know that

390
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,720
they tune into stuff i need it on the background or whatever i like listening to this what do you like

391
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,480
listening about you know the particular host your show i don't know i just like it oh boy you know

392
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,880
how useful is that so let's get into a few things that might be fairly useful and one of the things

393
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,840
that affects everyone if your boots on the ground surface to our earth inhabitants is geopolitical

394
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:14,560
events but not as discussed normally and uh what does that mean uh that means that one has to know

395
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:20,400
the future and unfortunately freeman many people have when you say knowing the future it's some weird

396
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:29,040
nocturitumus or kc or psychic profit type stuff or misinterpretation of uh pro by the way a prophecy

397
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:35,120
cannot be changed because if it could be changed then it's not a prophecy you see but i'm not

398
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,920
discussing just the profism discussing about you must know the future on a practical level let's

399
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:45,520
get get more practical like for example if you speak to a civil engineer who builds bridges he knows

400
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,960
the future he has to know enough about the future combined with his studies uh in other words he knows

401
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,000
about how to design steel structures and he knows that once this is drawn up the construction clue

402
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,160
crews can follow it in the future and build it and it'll work and not only that that he has to

403
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,520
draw up a future maintenance schedule like how many years have to go by before it's painted and all

404
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:13,520
of these things not only should take place but they actually do take place for that bridge to stand

405
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,920
right and to get it even more simply than that uh you go walk into a room and um

406
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:26,400
grandma has got a chocolate chip uh chocolate chip cookie recipe out do you expect in an hour you

407
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,640
gonna come in and there's gonna be um a roast turkey in the oven or chocolate chip cookies

408
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:39,200
you see yeah so so we are actually engaging contemplating on information about the future that is

409
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,640
downright useful and practical but yet when you say what is coming on the future geopolitically

410
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,240
oh no one knows that or we can't know that why what's wrong why can't we are certain things

411
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,640
scalable yeah i would say most things are scalable right so why don't we start scaling you know

412
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:04,240
because typically i would suggest that i find that political discussions are in bad taste usually

413
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,080
they tend to get emotional and they don't talk about the ingredients on the box right right exactly

414
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,920
yeah just the brand just the brand and whatever i mean it's always a party what about the laws of the

415
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:21,360
nation what laws you know how many politicians or anyone come out say this in the countries in

416
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:28,000
receivership we're under a credit-based economy how many say that not even actually if you start

417
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,880
pushing the opposite fringe information well it's a fiction it's a straw man all that i think

418
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,160
you kind of get in trouble for a reason right and one of the things uh is that i think we mentioned

419
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,560
a lot of dictators typically send out people that speak out against them to find out who will agree

420
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:49,840
with them so now they know who is out there against them right so like Stalin's just sending people

421
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,680
out their bitch and about Stalin and then anyone that agrees with them then they know

422
00:31:53,680 --> 00:32:02,160
yep exactly so when you see a lot of the discussion about what is being discussed about a debt-based

423
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:07,280
economy again that is being put out by the legal society because the last thing they want you to do

424
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,200
is everything know as everything is paid for now now by the way but a lot of people have gotten to

425
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,600
me said greek this sounds i've looked up everything you said it happens to be true how do i get stuff

426
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:25,280
for free oh boy yeah well yeah yeah great i just want to say out loud folks my name is freeman i

427
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:31,760
existed long before freeman on the land i have never been a partial to the freeman on the land

428
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:40,320
tactics and i hope you all know that it was quite of a a cluster for me when they took my name

429
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,360
because everybody suddenly started thinking i was trying to tell you how to get out of your straw man

430
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,480
but me in the greek we're gonna get into money we're gonna discuss a bit more like are you authorized to

431
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:57,280
use your money right so uh yeah please carry on i just had to make that note oh please yeah i mean there's

432
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,120
so many notes that could be made i mean it just looks like one of those crazy quark boards and where they

433
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:07,040
tack everything up that's how it could be you know but i just want to go into the efficiency aspect

434
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:13,600
of useful information because knowing how the money system works by not because listening to you and

435
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,160
i today let's say freeman in the greek but actually doing research on there i will show you where to look

436
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,640
it up and how it's contrary to all the fringe information you're getting and also what the mainstream

437
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,320
is giving you but the the reason why i believe that the most useful information is going to be is

438
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,160
whether whatever you're studying whether it's how the human body works which it doesn't the way you've

439
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:37,600
been told by the way i think we covered a little bit of that yes we might a little bit again but

440
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,960
how money works what the religions really are all these other things that is not is that that's

441
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,000
all very good but what you're going to get caught up into as a surface dwelling earth and habit is

442
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,800
certain geopolitical events that you will either come across on the as what you know this show they

443
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:58,640
call the news or internet websites or it'll just be shoved down your throat you know whether you're

444
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,440
out in public or a family member someone say oh no look what's going on here yeah and now what are

445
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,600
you going to do are you going to be able to rationalize this or are you going to fall into that

446
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,760
emotional esoteric vortex of worrying you see because that's what worrying i believe is it's a

447
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,520
strange esoteric feeling that because if you if it was if worrying wasn't so esoteric you wouldn't

448
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,680
be worried would you right so i'm not talking about being subject to liability or bad things just

449
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:31,280
the act of worrying you know special forces by the way are trained to be confronted with really

450
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,280
bad stuff and immediately adapt with a cool head and react or or you know basically you know

451
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,840
take it on right yeah i constantly find myself full of stress uh and and i'm sitting around asking

452
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:51,840
myself why why do i feel this this worry and i i take account of everything around me and say you

453
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:57,440
know okay i've got food i got shelter i've got you know i'm okay why am i so worried all this it's an

454
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,720
esoteric feeling i do it's it's and just like love you know as an esoteric feeling you know people

455
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,720
that you'll be hard pressed to meet anyone who really knows what love is and the definition of love

456
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,360
could be very simple it's doing the right thing even though you don't feel like doing it i like that

457
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,880
yeah most people don't know what love is because again it's a esoteric feeling oh i really feel

458
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,800
hot for this person or i fell in love hey uh smells the last time someone said they fell into anything

459
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:29,120
and it sounded good right it just doesn't happen and by the way when you fall in love or you go

460
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:33,840
through infatuation you start out really high on the curve and then it what happens entropy kicks in

461
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:39,360
and what it just cools down doesn't it yeah it's much better to learn how to love and come together

462
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,400
and say i will learn how to love you you know the only place you kind of see stuff like this and

463
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,560
say don't massacre's tollywood movies you're gonna learn to love this you know it's like well you

464
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,280
know they're actually giving a little bit of truth in this stupidity but but the learning how to love

465
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,600
that's why for example in non-western cultures where they have arranged marriages they have a

466
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:03,760
percent success rate in the west where they meet through infatuation what's the divorce rate

467
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,040
i think it's 50% isn't it conservatively yeah and sorry the percentage of the first one cut out

468
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:15,360
oh it's over 90% success right on fixed marriages because they have no choice that we have to

469
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:20,400
learn to love each other right you know where when you who seems like when you have a choice

470
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,880
and by the way lawfully i just want to get into a proposal so we're all over the place but that's okay

471
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,960
it's like i'm being on an ice skating rink as you know as long as the blade is sharp we're fine

472
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,840
you ever notice how people proposed a men proposes to the woman in western culture

473
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,880
and then that poses problems because you know lawfully you're supposed to propose to the

474
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,400
patriarch in the family that's why when in a western marriage it isn't a patriarch either the

475
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,600
father or someone else giving the white the bride away yeah if the bride was in his how can he

476
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,640
give her away right why are you proposing to the women how many times can you propose to a woman

477
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:01,520
and she accepts but the father doesn't want it what kind of lifestyle is that you pro ask the father

478
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:09,600
first or the patriarch or the matriarch and once they grant you their blessing then you can pursue

479
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:15,520
right why why is that stronger well let's say you propose to the lady and she wants it but the

480
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,880
family doesn't want to be with you you what kind of a life are you going to lead now let's go the

481
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:27,360
antithesis of that you you ask the parents or the authority of the family and they give you the

482
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:32,240
blessing but the lady doesn't want well now they're gonna help help coaxering aren't they

483
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,400
absolutely so you're gonna have a much more successful and pleasant i'm not saying that this

484
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,840
should be done this is just a rational scenario do you see that Freeman how simple it is so

485
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,640
so anyway guys stop proposing to the lady and propose to the matriarch

486
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,560
to the father yeah and then you will get the support and even though she's not sure she'll come around

487
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,800
so i'm not saying this is not in trapment i'm just saying this is a interesting lawful

488
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:08,480
way of perceiving things that why isn't this discussed by the way anyway let's get to it i mean we're

489
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,080
you know the question is are you ready for the next level yeah i was hoping you would explain a little

490
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:20,880
bit the levels the cycles the seven years and how that is is playing out for us right now let's do

491
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,000
that there's there's a time period that is ended by the way i think we discussed being in the credit

492
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:34,720
part of human the human epic meaning that time ended roughly around 1999 1998 and there are four

493
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,520
seven-year cycles that are preceded by a five-year cycle and succeeded roughly by two and a half

494
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,720
years oh boy what did he just say just hit the rewind and you'll get it where does that come from okay

495
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,080
that comes from ancient rich ancient scripture there is a seven thousand year plan in place or

496
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:56,080
six thousand year plan in place and it's really hard to avoid that cognizantly or rationally for

497
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,560
example i recently had a discussion with someone who went to a Damascus tour a few years ago

498
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:08,480
and the tour bus person said Damascus is the longest occupied city for 10,000 years and you asked

499
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,400
the guy who's just said that when was the catastrophic flood historically that you know it was 45

500
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,600
hundred years ago well so how could Damascus be continuously occupied for 10,000 years one the flood

501
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,640
was 45 hundred years ago anyway people just don't listen to what they're saying you see they're not

502
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:30,800
paying attention so there's an aspect to this by the way carbon dating and DNA testing and all that

503
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,080
is not as valid as you've been told are you you're aware of that i guess that could be determined in

504
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:42,080
other places the inaccuracy of all that but let's just say this Freeman if you're going to shoot a two

505
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,080
hour movie do you get exactly two hours with the film or do you get two hours and 10 minutes because

506
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:53,360
you're going to run credits in the end a lot yeah yeah so what's been going on since 1998 is the

507
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,680
credits portion what's interesting about the credits is that you get to see things that weren't

508
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,080
shown in the film and also you know people that are behind the scenes and all that and there's a much

509
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:08,240
bigger crew than you then you than you were aware of just seeing the actual show but what's also

510
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,920
interesting about the credits using this metaphor is you notice that during the film if you make a

511
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,120
disturbance stand up or talk people tell you to shut up and sit down but during the credits if you

512
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:22,160
if you stand up and talk does anyone really tell you shut up the credits are running no it seems to be

513
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:29,280
okay to be noisy actually i worked at the movie theater this is just a weird little quirk uh and the

514
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:37,040
movie uh uh uh buckaroo bonsai i worked at the movie theater as a kid and for some reason i i don't

515
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,320
know why i got to mention this but for some reason in buckaroo bonsai no one left they all stayed there

516
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:47,920
for the entire credits and this as a person that cleaned the theaters after that this was completely

517
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,920
unusual and i still have yet to figure out why buckaroo bonsai keeps everybody there till the very

518
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,400
last word scrolls up the screen it's the weirdest phenomenon just thought i'd throw it out there

519
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,920
sorry oh yeah well they're probably got some serious juju going on in that film you know it put frames

520
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,280
between frames you know yeah uh uh or it could just yeah it's a cosmic thing that that that might

521
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,080
require quite a bit of investigation i'm gonna have to watch it again but okay so we're at the credits

522
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:19,760
now what's happening now let's say like buck uh like that movie if you if you remain seated it

523
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,880
it's the last show for for the theater for that particular epoch or day what happens the lights

524
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,040
come on the screen gets pulled up and you got this really ugly brick wall don't you know the sudden

525
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,640
the illusion is it was like countered like even tenfold again right so and then you start noticing

526
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,400
you know it's interesting how you don't notice how sticky the floor is from all the gum and soda

527
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,080
until the credits come on yeah during the movie it's not this doesn't bother you as much so this is

528
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,240
the metaphor that i'm using in human society is in right now what you're going into right now

529
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,200
starting next spring and this is not a date folks this is a the the world doesn't work on the

530
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,840
Pope's work schedule which is the Gregorian calendar we've mentioned this before you know the the

531
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:04,320
moon rules the month and the sun rules the day and when the sun and the moon pass through the same

532
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:10,240
ecliptic or the same path in the sky it's the equinox or it is the new year right and then they

533
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,960
reverse places again equinox by the way doesn't mean equal day equal night because if it did it

534
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,320
would be called equineum nox it's equinox which means a measurement to measure at night well that's

535
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:26,800
i think we got into that again prior so what is coming now is going to be very different than the past

536
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,640
seven years of tension that you've had or transition because you've noticed what what are the major

537
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,920
headlines geopolitically and nationally that people have been getting for the past less than a decade

538
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:45,200
let's see stories about corrupt politicians and political corruption missing airplanes and impending

539
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:52,880
financial doom how much how much have has that been repeated in the past seven years i'd say with

540
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,720
very fervent cycles and i just got thrown one more rape and and right right okay yes certain social

541
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:04,400
ills that are coming upon society yes and because i saw each of these discussed in the debates each time

542
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,600
i i even outlined it before the debates occurred i said you know we're looking at voter fraud we're

543
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:16,240
looking at political corruption and and uh you know manipulation we're looking at uh sexual

544
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:23,440
offensors which you know was bill Clinton you know they had the rape victims there at the they

545
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,240
brought it all up to the point of even britt talked discussing Barack Obama's birth certificate

546
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:32,880
for a good ten minutes of the debate which was between Hillary and Trump you know how did what did

547
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:40,480
this and so uh we didn't see the reinforcement of these uh these programs you know and and also to

548
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,920
bar from the gladio a period of tension these terrorist events you know the bus is the trucks the

549
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:51,280
buildings the shootings you know the glatio style you know tension yeah because the glatio was about

550
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,240
they called it a period of tension that's what they called it so this this period of tension now is

551
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,040
ending and you're going to be going into another cycle you in other words we're discussing what

552
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,480
the headlines that you're going to be getting are different now you say well Greek uh well they're

553
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,400
always different no they're not because we just brought up how they're all the very similar

554
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:14,800
this mindset is going to change and and i want to get into a little bit more definitive um from a

555
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,400
secular perspective meaning what's uh access historically about this middle east union because it's

556
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,640
not going to be like the european union whenever we talk about a union we think of the EU right uh

557
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,400
and common currency and all this other stuff and they almost have a common religion they're

558
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:37,760
particularly christian right uh so i want to give some similarities because it's always good to show

559
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:44,960
the parallels now if you if you go back uh before the this is before there was a european union

560
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,760
even though it was sort of discussed uh when you look at the cultural centers technological and

561
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,240
cultural centers of europe around what's called world world war one or world war two that was usually

562
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:03,040
the austrian hungarian empire around germany and places like that and those places were initially

563
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:09,440
gutted in world war one and world war two now when i say cultural and technological centers i mean

564
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,840
where does strouse come from where does bak betoven uh where do a lot of the um philosophers come from

565
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:20,560
where where does the the the school of psychiatry where did it come from Freud and all those guys you

566
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:26,080
see where do a lot of the technological and all from the that part of europe and it got

567
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:33,360
gutted um now if you look at for example the middle east where where's the cultural and technological

568
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,600
and financial center of the middle east throughout history while you've ever heard of babelon where's

569
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:44,000
babelon you're acting around you know uh that yeah and have you ever heard of damascus right it's

570
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:50,320
mentioned all throughout it was a very serious cultural religious and financial hub and uh

571
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:54,720
intellectual hub you know uh you have to include a little bit parts of lebanon in there as well

572
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,160
where what's being what's been gutted or being gutted at the moment you can you answer

573
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:06,000
where in the middle east do you see it yeah it's gone after the cultural and technological hub now

574
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:12,640
right this is this is this is what's going on now the other thing to remember about forming a union

575
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:19,280
let's go back to the europeans for example um how can you have an EU free men if all of the bordering

576
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:27,040
nations are extremely nationalistic how can you have an union you can't because each overly

577
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,640
nationalistic leader or government is going to be very persnickety and maybe to the point of refusal

578
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:38,000
of cooperating with its neighbors to form anything that even vaguely resembles a union think about it

579
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:45,040
you can't happen so so all of their teeth were pulled out right during the after the war you see

580
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:50,800
so they can't bite now what you see in the middle east how many uh nationalistic precepts and let's

581
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:56,640
say just conflicting ideologies you see in neighboring countries in the middle east quite a bit even still

582
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:03,120
and now combine that with the concept of the cultural and technological centers being gutted

583
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:08,400
and i mean literally right the Iraq war and now what's going on with Syria yeah and even ISIS blowing

584
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,200
up all the ancient monuments yes and that not even that let's just uh i want to go back to this one

585
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:18,400
thing with yes yes that but not even that but think what freeman what defines a world war

586
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:24,720
is it the casualties or the number of armies or is it the number of countries involved yeah that's

587
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,800
what i'd rather yeah now if you know any boots on the ground or people that live in that area that

588
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:34,960
have encountered ISIS they will give you along in a short list of ISIS is comprised of malaysians

589
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:45,840
Filipinos Pakistanis Chinese Vietnamese um uh some malays some people from the middle east that

590
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,840
of that origin that came out of europe now how many countries that i mentioned there about half a

591
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:58,480
dozen or more this is a world war based on that definition right ISIS is predominantly non they're

592
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,200
not from that area they're not from Syria they're not from Iraq they're from everywhere else

593
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,160
there might even be some south americans and australians thrown in there too oh we know the americans are

594
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:14,240
in there right right so okay technically it's a world war right uh you know ISIS represents a world

595
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,440
organization whether it's overt or as you you've been told is irrelevant because by the way if you

596
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,160
do a little bit of research on what was going on in world war two and why they had to be fought you'll

597
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:29,360
find it's completely false also what the way the people were dummy loaded i should say and i just

598
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:34,720
want to interject something which is frightening for the american population this is just take this

599
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:40,880
and as an objective comment if you have a political leader come out and just say something simple like make

600
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,000
great whatever and you get one third of the country to ban behind such a simple empty comment

601
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,720
it's pretty dangerous to think forward and say what if they wanted to say something else

602
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:57,760
if it's so simple to get a group of people to ban behind you with such an empty just because it makes

603
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,720
you feel good remember the esoteric feeling yeah so this is what you know also gets people

604
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:09,680
into ISIS so so again when you look at the european aspect right now it parallels very often

605
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:14,720
what's going on in the middle east uh mean because there's more to happen there still are countries

606
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:20,320
in the middle east that are overtly nationalistic and non-cooperative right so what you're going to

607
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:25,280
see if there's going to be a loose middle east union those countries will lose the ability to do so

608
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,640
now who they are you can figure it out on your own because right now if you look at the middle east who

609
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:38,320
are the two superpowers in the middle east well it would be Persia or Iran and Israel yeah you can say

610
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:46,240
Saudi Arabia but Saudi Arabia is a very loosely defined place you know how let's say draconian

611
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:51,440
so the Saudis are in terms of Islam do you know that on their own governmental website i hope it's

612
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,680
still up or might be may not they stated that they were actually Jewish a hundred years ago but they

613
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:02,960
can be converted to Islam the Saudis profess that right so so this is like you know this is again

614
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:08,560
going into the the bad taste or the poor character of politics i we don't want to get into that

615
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:13,120
religion and all that stuff because then i've discussed what religion is before as well we might

616
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:17,920
recap a little bit but right now if you look at the scene what the reason i brought up the superpowers

617
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:25,680
is superpowers do two things they either ally or they or they fight each other right they typically

618
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:30,800
even if they try to remain neutral to each other there's satellite influence is overlap at some point

619
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:36,720
which will either be a fight or an ally again right so what you're going to be seeing in the future this

620
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,160
i should i didn't want to really say this in public i'm going to say before more private

621
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:46,480
discussion but let's just say look for a loose economic alliance between if not loose even more

622
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:52,800
than loose between israel and iran coming okay the other thing that you're going to notice is there

623
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:59,920
is a couple of countries that have not been talked about like jordan lebanon how about have you

624
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:07,280
ever heard of we've discussed this before freeman assyria not syria assyria where is a syria you know have

625
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,560
you heard of the israel the israelite diaspora you know they left palestine and they were scattered

626
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:17,840
through the whole world you're right you hear that right very often no one ever talks about the

627
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:25,360
the assyrian diaspora which they had lost their nation or their state 2300 years ago they're all

628
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:31,360
over the place germany australia the us you know well guess what they're going to go back and form

629
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:39,440
their nation where is assyria ancient assyria to northern iraq but if you actually look at proper

630
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,480
terminal borders it actually went into parts of syria and turkey that's why over 10 years ago i was

631
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:50,960
sending out information saying there's going to be conflict between or involving syria and turkey

632
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,920
in the near future as well as iraq you know which already had been since the early 90s and like

633
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,720
reek why do you say that is it well because since when is a new country formed and it takes a swath

634
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:07,200
of land from two other countries without a fight or without turmoil of some sort right is so so

635
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,080
isn't syria and turkey been in the news for at least the past four or five years in that way or at

636
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:17,360
least three years dominantly without that why was i able to send out messages about this more than 10

637
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:24,880
years ago because i know what's coming and now you do too and i'm not asking you anyone to believe

638
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,680
any of this because can i talk about the word belief real quick of you okay like for example

639
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,600
someone says do you believe in god just walk away don't even answer that question to ridiculous

640
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:39,360
question why because the term belief is usually based on that you have knowledge of something that

641
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:44,320
has not occurred yet and that belief is based on that knowledge that you've received and you hold

642
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:50,240
it as a belief until what's in that knowledge based manifest so if you have belief that something

643
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:55,760
is going to happen in the next hour or the next month or the next year and it happens based on

644
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:01,600
the information you got guess what that was what a good belief wasn't it now if you get a certain

645
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,600
knowledge base of something that is going to happen and it doesn't happen guess what freeman

646
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:10,960
was that a good belief or not no that was a really bad belief you see so the term belief is actually a

647
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:18,240
very dynamic term again it's not we're bringing up this it's not an esoteric feeling you see it's

648
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,480
something that is rational and should be based on something you even hear that in conversation

649
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:28,240
i believe this will happen right right or whatever so asking someone to believe something on blind

650
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:34,080
faith or esoteric emotion like touching yourself or something is ridiculous or do you believe in

651
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:39,920
that something exists is ridiculous well it does it exist and can we find out that it does just

652
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:46,000
simply saying this is what i believe and i'm happy with it you need to walk away i mean you don't

653
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,440
need to walk away but it's advisable yeah yeah just at least change subject yeah change such a

654
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,600
hand i'm a plastic broom and reflect the vest anyway so at this point the majority of the people

655
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,600
still gone that down that primrose path and i i don't know who was old enough to remember what the

656
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:09,600
primrose path means but anyway the the the entire thing here is about are we conveying information

657
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:14,160
yes we are we are actually stringing letters and words together that people understand and they could

658
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:18,640
form a body of knowledge on that's what knowledge is you know it's very difficult to get knowledge

659
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,160
unless you're getting a divine download for example like an inventor or something

660
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:27,040
knowledge is conveyed through the meaning of letters and the meanings of words where they form

661
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:33,200
thoughts and images and ideas so that is basically what the purpose of let's say Greek speak or having

662
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:39,600
me on with Freeman is about is just to not to be convincing not i'm not selling i'm telling and not

663
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:45,280
for you to believe unless you find it to be valid or unless unless you find it to be substantial

664
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,240
then it would make a good belief you see at the moment because when these things manifest you

665
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,240
can say yeah there was this really obscure guy called the Greek that said about these things i

666
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,240
really didn't like the way he talked he's really rougher on the edges but unfortunately what he said

667
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:07,360
is true you see right so this is this is the aspect of sharing you see there's many levels and i'm

668
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:13,920
giving it in a way that is just with no attachments it's unconditional like do what you want with it

669
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:20,000
i'm not here to argue or debate or whatever this is just what is going on you do what you want with it

670
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:26,560
and and what i suggest is that of many of these rationals are put together whether they're historical

671
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:32,960
scriptural or however even intuitive because you you can also get information that is counterintuitive

672
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:40,720
you know but if you find it even intuitive you will leave live a life of more efficiency and this

673
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,800
is also a tie-in because we're going to get a little bit more into the money hopefully maybe on the

674
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:51,120
side of the way we are getting there so we're getting near the the end of this first hour so i hope

675
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:58,320
yeah summarize this for everyone and yeah so what's coming folks because you know this is

676
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:02,160
you know how a year ends you know let's say what they call the pagan calendar they start talking

677
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,560
you know the best of the previous year and all this right you haven't had the best of the past seven

678
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:12,240
years it's just a period of tension what you're going to see because the year goes from spring to fall

679
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:18,240
spring to fall winter is an interim period this is the last spring to fall cycle or winter to spring

680
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:24,000
cycle for the folks that are upside down right yeah on the other side of the world this is going to be

681
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,360
the last part of this seven years where you're going to see the mindset changing a little bit of the

682
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:36,320
cosmic censorship is going to be lifted and the this is the summing up of this rationale you've heard

683
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:41,200
of time is cyclical things repeat right and you have the small cycles and the grand cycles right

684
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:47,600
um not to get mystic but just people have heard of these terms uh when you look at something cyclical

685
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:51,680
let's look at the structure of it like let's say a racetrack or a track of some sort you know

686
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,640
Freeman can you can you envision where the let's say a starting line on a racetrack Freeman you see

687
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:03,840
it where it is right right now where is the finish line at the start right exactly now even if you

688
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:09,680
go back to the base let's just use the term bullshit education system that exists uh don't they

689
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:16,000
tell you that mankind started the messetapetamean region of the world right that all the scriptures

690
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,120
sort of go back there um and and even if you go to the hope again they tell you it happened on the

691
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:26,560
world at a far away place where it all happened at the same time um because by the way going from

692
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:32,560
two people to seven billion people in a thousand years is not that hard to do uh if you look at the

693
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:39,120
world population in the mid 1800s it was barely a billion it i think it was it was barely five

694
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:44,880
billion in the eighties or seventies wasn't it it's very easy to start doubling the population quickly

695
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:52,800
but anyway when you look at this cycle of the middle east uh when man society starts to get wrapped up

696
00:57:52,800 --> 00:58:00,480
and it's going to be at a height it's going back to where it started it's very very simple and it's

697
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:05,520
not being noticed as such and one of the other things that i want to bring up is that in the next seven

698
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,520
years and i was telling the freeman off air i kind of want to stay away from what's called the internet

699
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:16,880
and media because there's going to be a lot of ugliness uh coming to that area a level of carnage that

700
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:24,960
people have are not used to seeing and um like you know how many people really discuss objectively for

701
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:31,360
example uh freeman the bombing of dresden what really happened there very few but they know

702
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:36,480
it was bad do you know how many hundreds of thousands of people if not almost that died directly in one

703
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:42,240
night from that you know fire bombing you know you've heard like for example how many people you hear

704
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:47,680
about the atomic firecrackers that they dropped on japan uh how many you know it was roughly a hundred

705
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:52,320
thousand or so how many people do you know how many you know it was almost twice that much that died

706
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:56,880
with the fire bombing of tokyo and but that doesn't really it's not impressive though because it

707
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:03,200
wasn't a new right but the numbers are still there you see so that's what i mean there's going to be

708
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:10,080
um massinations and movements in the middle east that westerners are going to show that look

709
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:13,920
there's genocide going on or whatever but look let me just let me just reflect back to the

710
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:19,120
ingredients on the box on the hypocrisy of the western world do you know that they're um

711
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:24,480
in just in the united states alone there are almost a million people a year which is roughly

712
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:29,120
three thousand a day that are killed by doctors when i killed by doc i say killed by doctors i mean

713
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:35,600
by negligent practices overt and overdoses and just bad drugs do you know that eighty five or let's

714
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:40,000
say seventy five percent of all the pharmaceuticals that are legal now will be illegal in ten years

715
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,800
because of you know the warnings you know or so so the do you know that the how many millions of

716
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:53,440
people in this country or thousands per day died from just bad food and toxins that are you willingly

717
00:59:53,440 --> 01:00:00,160
use you see so you you're actually uh but because you're not paying attention to what is going on

718
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:07,840
you you're thrown with a few uh really sad events and you think it's the end of the world where

719
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:12,240
if you're going to have the end of his society it's going to come from what's on the side of a cereal

720
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:19,360
box not some army you know so this is a hot pot level if hypocrisy i just wanted to bring up in people's

721
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:24,320
minds that maybe they might want to think about like you know when you say brainwashing it doesn't

722
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:31,840
sound good then how about just washing your brain but uh let's let's get real is is the idea so hopefully

723
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:37,440
that was sort of useful to show what goes around comes around and people to get ready for the the

724
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,000
precursor to the formation of the middle east union that's going to be starting in about a year there's

725
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,040
going to be more talk and more centralization and another thing freeman just to throw in perhaps to

726
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:51,280
sum it up only i'm going to even just list you and i rhetorically get into this for a second if you will

727
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,560
how many times if you heard people preaching doom and gloom coming upon the united states emp

728
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:03,280
attack starvation grab a government crackdown or whatever god for decades yeah okay well the

729
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:07,760
past eight years specifically we've gotten hit pretty hard with certain things i say we whoever

730
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:13,680
we as okay let me ask you now profetically this when this middle east union comes around that all

731
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:19,520
the world's nations are going to support it morally and with material support how can the us offer

732
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:24,960
material support to the middle east and moral support if they are in complete catastrophe they can't

733
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:30,640
so that means if they are going to offer material and moral support to the middle east there is no

734
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:37,600
catastrophe coming to the us folks all right all the way through until until not until like the early

735
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:41,440
twenty thirties and at that point you want to be at least three days walking distance from anywhere

736
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:47,120
and that's another idea which will only be understood by those right now who know the scroll is sealed

737
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:51,120
not those that are illiterate or are blind and that's another not a put down folks that's just the

738
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:57,040
different levels of humanity let's be honest folks sometimes the biggest resistant you you find when

739
01:01:57,040 --> 01:02:02,160
you get new information is not from someone on the street or someone on a black with a black robe

740
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:06,160
sitting up in a court building but it could be from your own family members or loved one sometimes

741
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:11,440
that make your life the hardest when it comes to new ideas so I just want to say that yeah and in

742
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:19,520
the second hour you brought up how america had had fallen into creditorship and that

743
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:25,040
we're we're around because we're useful so I definitely want to get into that second hour

744
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:30,960
the idea of are you authorized to use your money you you guys are going to you're really going to

745
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:36,480
jump on this this is going to amaze you as you look at the laws as the greek and i start to uncover this

746
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:45,360
and get get much deeper into all of that story plus I want to jump a little bit into space folks

747
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:52,960
because the x thirty seven b is just returned after seven hundred and eighteen days in space record

748
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:58,560
shattering orbit around our planet sorry flat earthers why do I always feel like I have to defend

749
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:04,320
myself against flat earthers uh... what do you think about that oh it's an esoteric attack we're

750
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:09,840
using that word a lot today yes yeah there there's many uh here's the thing about the flat the

751
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:14,880
the earth is neither flat nor around just like both creationists and evolutionists are both

752
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,520
wrong if that mean but let's just you want to get really simple in the dummy load both democrats

753
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:25,600
and republicans are wrong right right there you go i don't like baseball so people should choose

754
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:30,080
your own team and leave me alone yeah i personally feel the critical thing you should take away from

755
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:35,200
that debate is that you don't know and if you can't admit that you got to look at something there folks

756
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:40,720
because uh... you don't know until you are in space until you're on your virgin space flight orbiting

757
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:46,160
the planet you don't know so right and whether the sun in and honestly it would knowledge should be

758
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:50,800
lead to what's called master ship you know from apprentice to master right if you want to be a master

759
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:56,400
full surface dwelling earth inhabitant you know the sun rises in the east and sets in the west and it

760
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,360
affects your orientation and architecture it affects the way you grow crops it affects many things

761
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:06,640
so you need to master that movement and is there mastery of those movements in agriculture architecture

762
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:13,200
and the rest i would say no so master the movements right right otherwise the rest of it is just

763
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:18,480
another movement called the bowel movement but anyway so we're definitely going to get into all

764
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:26,080
this in the second hour i can't wait and i hope that you guys will subscribe over there at freeman tv

765
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:32,960
dot com and and get all these bonus hours of it helps support this effort it keeps everything going

766
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:38,160
and you know it's necessary it is right now it's necessary it's less than a buck 50 a week you know

767
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:45,120
it for two hours you can you can shell out less than a dollar fifty and it just you know this this

768
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:50,880
cost money to do so anyway there you go subscribe to freeva tv dot com because it's awesome and it shows

769
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:57,200
shows that were going somewhere and please share this everywhere because we see constantly i mean my

770
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:03,520
numbers on youtube went from twenty thousand views a month to five thousand views all right this is

771
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:10,000
not due to lack of content this is due to algorithms and in the fact that they are crushing us right

772
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:16,000
now so it is really important that you share the information that is important and get this stuff

773
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:21,040
out there because honestly we we feel like low man on the totem pole over here because as greek was

774
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:27,760
saying there is already this mindset that has been crafted for everyone and if you don't fall

775
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:33,200
into that and let me tell you guys i'm contrary to almost every conspiracy theory out there and

776
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:39,360
people don't realize that and it's because there's so much more to look at and people are just taking

777
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:45,840
the surface and and going with it and so if you're not digging deeper and deeper into these topics of

778
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:52,320
the occult the esoteric or even politics uh and seeing you know the the real hidden truth behind

779
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:58,480
this and the message that is being planted into your brain uh then you are just stuck again in this

780
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:04,080
cycle cyclical situation which we are seeing happens uh over and over again in these seven year

781
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:10,320
cycles and now we're at the end credits and we are going to watch as this really starts to unfold and

782
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:15,840
and you know to ask the question what are you going to be when you grow up is almost impossible

783
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:21,840
in in the 21st century because everything is shifting and changing right now so fast and as as

784
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:28,800
greek shows there are cyclical sections to this and that's what the master magicians truly understand

785
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:34,800
you know the sun rises in the east this is something they can use and they use it all right and they

786
01:06:34,800 --> 01:06:39,520
leave us in the dark so we're going to get deep deep into this into the second hour i also want to

787
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:46,000
dimension to you guys that uh pv roasters the perump valley roasters the coffee that are loving the

788
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:52,080
free zone honestly they're just listeners they're the good local home brood company that is brewing

789
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:57,920
and and and creating the most awesome coffee it really is good that's why i break it up

790
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:05,520
i just wanted to mention that if you go to pv roasters dot com and order coffee from them get four pounds

791
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:11,280
because you're gonna want it and second it costs the same in shipping if you get one pound or four

792
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:17,200
pounds so you will save on shipping by getting four pounds uh same goes for their teas uh get you

793
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:23,280
know get get four pounds of that get four four sets of that so if you go over to pv roasters dot com

794
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,200
make sure to get four pounds of coffee because you're gonna love it and you're gonna want more so

795
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:32,240
you might as well just get the shipping all done in one boost so i had to throw that out there and

796
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:38,240
alanzo pachardo dot com he is thanking all of you for getting in and communications with him

797
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:43,680
great online marketing and you know he's the guy who helped me rebuild free man tv dot com so you

798
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:51,040
can see how good he is and then finally uncommon radio dot com home of the greek at this point as

799
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:57,760
he's about to go a bit more covert but there are our list and list of archives and he's gonna start

800
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:04,800
formally producing a podcast so get over to uncommon radio dot com if you really want to get into deep

801
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:10,080
deep deep topics with the with the the greek because uh you know obviously you can't cover this

802
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:16,480
stuff in an hour it takes years folks for us to get this all so also remember this there is no such

803
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:22,160
thing as an old show there isn't everything that has been said over the last 12 years on free man tv

804
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:28,080
dot com is still relevant right now everything that you need to learn and let me tell you folks i've

805
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:34,320
forgotten half of what i've taught you okay because it comes in and it goes out our brains can't contain

806
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:39,920
all that data so that's what these archives are for so that you can go back so don't think these are

807
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:46,400
old news stories this is an education that starts at the beginning so if you really want to

808
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:51,600
get into this go all the way to the bottom of the archives and start there with me start with the

809
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,960
freeman perspective which you can only watch a number of them because of the fact that they are all

810
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:02,880
band world wide so i'm gonna work on getting this information more to you but right now the only

811
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:08,080
way to get really the deep information that i have to share is to come over to freeman tv dot com

812
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:14,400
and purchase the DVDs because uh it is band world wide all over the internet folks and that's the way

813
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:21,120
it is even though everything i use is fair use i make sure of it uh i i can't stop youtube from just

814
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:26,080
banning it worldwide and that is what has happened so if you want aliens from hell you know get over

815
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:32,480
to freeman tv dot com and get that so we're gonna take this over to the next uh level into the next

823
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:22,320

824
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:35,680
and welcome back you wonderful members thank you so much always for supporting

825
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:41,360
of my efforts and keep in me going and uh i did forget to mention that if you do uh i want to get some

826
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:45,360
of that coffee you got to put the freeman in the freeman code so that some of the money comes back

827
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:50,000
to the show it's a little bit the eatout of the guys this isn't like they're paying me to say this so

828
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,200
i just uh you know i don't know they got good coffee and i forgot to mention that you should put

829
01:10:55,200 --> 01:11:04,480
freeman in the code so there you have it uh wow wow i really feel my brain is churning Greek it's

830
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:11,120
just churning so many things are going through my mind and i keep thinking b bold and mighty forces will

831
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:17,520
come to your aid and that that is like the critical statement for all that we're discussing but let's

832
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:22,880
get a little bit into high strangeness real quick because as we went off the air i was discussing the

833
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:32,160
air forces x37 b now this is a robotic uh space plane uh it's a it's a

834
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:39,440
it's you know it's completely automated there's no pilot it's it's a robotic space plane a drone

835
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:44,880
that orbits our planet doing god knows what and they're always so excited to discuss

836
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:52,240
how they don't know what the x37 b is like almost every or what it's doing almost every

837
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:59,760
news source is just gleeful about the fact that well we don't know what it's doing you know but we

838
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:06,960
of course know it's out there so this is a telepresence robotic space plane that orbits the planet for years

839
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:14,640
and uh the latest theories that were going on around this thing was that they were testing the new

840
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:23,920
electromagnetic uh propulsion systems which are noted as the impossible drive is what it's been called

841
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:28,880
but so they're testing this is one of the main things that has come forward from people

842
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:34,880
hypothesizing on what the secret mission of the x37 b is but this thing has been orbiting there's

843
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:41,520
two of them right and they have been orbiting our planet for years and years nonstop and and no one

844
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:48,080
knows why what or what they're doing so now when we see pictures of the x37 b it just landed

845
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:54,320
and the sonic boom uh i'll tell you when the space shuttle used to land in Orlando it would knock

846
01:12:54,320 --> 01:13:00,400
our garage door off its tracks with the sonic boom and so and people would be running not knowing

847
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:07,280
what the hex going on this happened again with the landing of the x37 b now when it comes down into

848
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:12,400
that runway and it gets uh you see and i've shown you pictures of this and we'll we'll include it if you

849
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:20,640
want uh these guys come up to the the x37 b and they are in full gear i mean they have their full

850
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:26,240
radiation burn suits on they have and all they're doing is coming up to this thing with like a giant

851
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:33,120
vacuum so greek what do you know about this the situation with this x37 b and and why these guys

852
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:41,360
are showing up in this they're they're full gear uh you know masks the oxygen tanks and everything

853
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:47,520
when it's on the ground it's not only the x37 b it's all the other stuff that you could witness uh you

854
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,800
know from back the early apparel stuff we're not talking about going to the moon we're just talking

855
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:56,160
about just going into what's called space there is this quote unquote uh hazmat decantamination

856
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:01,200
precaution that's being taken and and of course it's a minor detail but you know there's it's

857
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:06,160
all details need to be looked at don't they and i think you and i brought this up or i brought it up

858
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:11,760
and and and it's it's something that uh everyone will now know once we discuss it a little bit and i

859
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:16,960
think it's again like i profess this is a show it's just not take this as just being information

860
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:23,280
but the truth is not only stranger than fiction but it's a lot weirder too right so what is

861
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:27,920
weird about this how come there's no talk about why they're in decantamination or they just pass it

862
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:34,720
off like oh yeah that's just what they do well they do it for a reason right so what's interesting

863
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:39,840
about this is uh i think i let's just bring it up like uh to the listeners like i brought it up to you

864
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:46,320
and let's say we go into space you know we pass through the atmosphere and now all the blue is

865
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:51,840
below you and it's all black above and now you're clearly in what's called outer space and first

866
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:56,560
thing it's not a vacuum it's full of rarefied gases which i think i might have mentioned a little

867
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:01,760
bit but hydrogen tends to take around the 20 of position there are many other gases lighter than

868
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:07,200
hydrogen but that's another story the story here about the decantamination is very interesting

869
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:12,880
freeman uh do you know that if um you and i were in space let's say one of those spacesuits and we

870
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:19,040
opened up the visor and uh and took a shallow breath it was was what i brought up to you

871
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:27,120
and now to the listeners uh and you actually tasted or smelled space what you would get is probably

872
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:35,760
the most accurate taste feeling or smell and it would smell just as burning flesh would and i'm not

873
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:41,040
talking about a barbecue steak on the barbecue and the flames or something i'm talking about throwing

874
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:48,720
an entire living creature mammal or such with hair and skin and a bone and everything all set on fire

875
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:55,360
it is a very very stinky acrid condition that would probably bring the um

876
01:15:55,360 --> 01:16:02,400
dag reflex i would say to most people now if you notice what the the this thing that came down on

877
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:06,240
the uh youtube you'll notice that they pull up with a few trucks and they pull out something that

878
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:12,800
looks like one of these ventilation ducks and they start sucking whatever gases or things might be

879
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:21,680
in there right and uh this is just a precaution now uh i just want to state that if you are aware of

880
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:28,720
anyone that's been into space or even have heard of any training that nasa does you know for example

881
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:34,560
uh in the military they put you through training and uh you know eventually they do what's called

882
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:38,880
live round fire testing you know or range you know you could actually there are many people in the

883
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:43,600
military that get killed every year you don't hear about that just from live train fire training drills

884
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:51,520
live rounds uh in certain nasa applications when they do a as close as possible as space suit

885
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:57,760
testing as possible uh occasionally an astronaut will breach the suit and will throw up because of that

886
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:03,200
nasa knows to i don't know if they're burning gerbils or pigeons or dogs or cats

887
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:10,400
to pump that really acrid nasty burning flesh smell into the chamber where they're doing their testing

888
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:16,240
so i just want to bring up freeman do you think if this thing spends a year in space do you think there's

889
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:23,680
going to be a residue of this stench on there you see in space no one can smell your funeral pyre

890
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:28,960
yeah all right oh boy now think about funeral pyres is that they're so hot you don't smell any

891
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:34,480
right just talking about a direct burning of flesh which a people in the fire department and

892
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:39,200
stuff like that sometimes again you know it's the partial burning that gives you the dirt right not

893
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:45,840
the complete burn yeah wow but this is and out let's just say how you know how i often talk about

894
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:51,040
scripture or biblical text being of a higher vantage point and of high science for example like

895
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:55,680
you know circumcision let's say was done on the eighth day why because it science in the 30s

896
01:17:55,680 --> 01:18:01,920
figured out medics that the the highest coagulative ability of the human male is at eight days old wow

897
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:07,760
that accounts for something scientific doesn't it yes and also by the way the scripture the biblical

898
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:13,200
text if you read in certain passages in Isaiah it says that the the the light part of the earth and

899
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:18,000
the dark part of the earth is separated by a circle meaning the on the line so he can only see

900
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,520
that from outer space you know when the earth is round kind of deal right when you light a

901
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:27,680
sphere on one side so you'll get very high levels of science in there but one all things aside you'll

902
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:32,800
have descriptions that are passed over in a lot of descriptions that you see in ancient text

903
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:39,200
texts are like going down the road you see a speed limit 15 miles per hour and to enforce the speed

904
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:44,160
limit they put a speed bump so if you didn't see the sign the car will be jarred that you know

905
01:18:44,160 --> 01:18:48,800
you should go slow and everyone seems to want to speed through these speed bumps in ancient texts

906
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:54,800
right right and and one of the speed bumps is if you read in the ancient text that when burnt

907
01:18:54,800 --> 01:19:02,640
offerings were being done the the residue or the smoke coming off of the burnt offering was what

908
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:09,200
was a pleasing odor to the gods now where are the gods are they up there like the birds or are they

909
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:16,640
way out there like in space right yeah now tie the now tie that together what's in the ancient

910
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:24,400
writ with at people that have been in space discussing how space smells like burning flesh

911
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:33,840
boy oh boy oh boy think about that for a minute now this is a minor detail but I'm sure you haven't

912
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:38,160
heard this before and I shouldn't say I'm sure but if you haven't heard this before now you did

913
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:44,400
do what you want with the information but it certainly explains a lot more than just in passing

914
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:50,400
off a bunch of guys and decontamination suits with air vents around space capsules I think it lends

915
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:55,120
a little bit more of insight on what's really going on and how practical this reality can be

916
01:19:55,120 --> 01:20:01,280
what do you think Freeman yeah yeah and you got me thinking about that stumbling block because in

917
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:10,000
Hebrew the mastima is the angel persecutes evil in the Jewish belief system or is known as the

918
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:18,400
adversary Satan so mastima's the stumbling block was put there like in the story of the talking

919
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:27,840
donkey you know in the Bible that the stumbling block is there too as a speed bump and to make

920
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:34,480
you want to change direction and a bomb in the talking donkey as the donkey is trying to tell him

921
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:41,120
look there's a mastima in front of us a stumbling block we need to turn and he just keeps whipping the

922
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:47,200
donkey saying go forward because that's the direction I want to go right well in ghetto it's called

923
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:55,360
slowdown before you fall down right so it would be that but actually also the stumbling block is the

924
01:20:55,360 --> 01:21:02,160
Christ also because it just a not even getting into a discussion but he was adherent to a lot of

925
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:07,600
Moses and what's called the not Judaism but you know that Old Testament stuff he didn't come if he

926
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:13,920
came to start a new religion that undoes him being the Messiah so it you see what I mean right right

927
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:18,560
right because he's not he's here to fulfill not to start a new religion so this J.E.S. U.S. character

928
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:23,600
is actually an invention of Simon Magus and others through the ages which what a Santa Claus in

929
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:28,480
Easter have to do Easter Bunny have to do with it anyway we're not we don't want to attach this

930
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:36,000
a document you know the let's go back to the little spacecraft there I just find it that if someone

931
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:43,200
had let's say read the scripture or the Bible and had come across the passage that a burning sacrifice

932
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:51,040
was a pleasing odor where out there to the gods right and you heard that space smelled like

933
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:57,120
acrid burning flesh you you most likely if you could rub two brains all together you could you could

934
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:02,720
connect that piece of information that space smells like burning flesh with that passage you read

935
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:10,160
whether recently or a long time ago you could connect the two and say wow yeah yeah yeah and you

936
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:17,440
the folks this is what we have I've been learning through this last few decades is that very fact that

937
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:22,960
as we start to develop our scientific understanding of the world around us we consistently find

938
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:29,120
platforms within these ancient scripts that are describing the exact same thing you can look at

939
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:35,200
the Tao of physics and how all of physics was somewhat described in the Hindu belief system then

940
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:43,040
you when you get into that you're into shamanas and and and flying off the planet and Ezekiel and

941
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:50,560
you know the descriptions finally meet the the science that we now understand now I had no idea

942
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:57,600
that space smelled like acrid death and and burning bodies and how would you yeah exactly just like

943
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:02,160
I don't know whether the earth is flat or out you know well it has to be communicated again you know

944
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:07,040
can mean knowledge is communication communication is the meaning of words and letters and stringing

945
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:12,640
them together just like code on a computer and what you do with it is up to you the user now there's

946
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:19,040
nothing you could really do about knowing that say having two accounts one ancient one modern

947
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:24,400
the and actually would be from the Greek and Freeman right now that space smells like burning flesh

948
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:30,320
what can you do with that in your in your lives not much but it leads you into as efficiency when you

949
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:34,960
do watch the YouTube after this thing lands and you see the guys with the hazmat suits pumping air out

950
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,720
you'll be the only guy in the room that's going to annoy everyone saying they're doing that because

951
01:23:38,720 --> 01:23:43,120
space smells like burning flesh and they want to just clean it up and then they'll say what

952
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:50,880
right yeah yeah and it makes complete sense you know I've never thought about the smell of space I've

953
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,800
never thought about that oh no if you do a lot of thinking you know you'll get in trouble so

954
01:23:54,800 --> 01:24:01,440
well yeah try to be a lawyer and practice law right right right you'll you'll be a use car dealer

955
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:06,720
in no time but but here's the thing about this this is something that is just beyond thinking it's

956
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:12,960
based on good communication are you taking in what can be taken in and I figured we'd bring this

957
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:19,120
up you brought up the the craft and I said well by the way do you remember the decontamination and here

958
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:25,840
we are now conveying and imparting let's say a minor but major detail right and I think that

959
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:32,400
hopefully the the listenership will walk at least even just from that walk away and say wow

960
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:38,160
it doesn't help me be more efficient or whatever through my life but the next time I see that I know

961
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:43,440
why they're doing it and it's just piece by piece this is how we figure things out exactly and you

962
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:49,040
won't even remember then well where you picked that up yeah I know that's from somewhere yeah the

963
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:54,640
little red flashy thing on the screen yeah now I have brought up just to clarify for the audience

964
01:24:54,640 --> 01:25:01,600
in these two hours I brought up a mastima and I brought up a mastaba so I think I just real

965
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:06,160
quickly will define these two things for everybody so they don't get confused about you know

966
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:15,600
thinking Satan is connected to Obama's presidential center okay so a mastima M.A.S.T.E.M.A. is the

967
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:23,040
adversary within the Bible in the ancient Hebrew mysticism Satan was an emissary of God he was an

968
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:29,280
angel and there were multiple adversaries there was not a single Satan this was a later concept through

969
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:36,160
Christianity but in Hebrew an adversary a Satan was there as what mastima literally means is

970
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:45,760
stumbling block to stop you from making bad choices so that God would said a Satan and a mastima to

971
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:53,040
your path to try and direct you onto the right path so there was no red devil with horns in a

972
01:25:53,040 --> 01:26:00,960
pitchfork at this time Satan the adversaries meant multitude were there as as emissaries of God

973
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:09,920
and then I also brought up the mastaba which is M.A.S.T.A. B.A. right and this is an ancient Egyptian

974
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:15,440
structure that archaeology or texts have zero knowledge of what they're built for and they're

975
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:21,360
massive buildings that sit in front of the main center you basically they're opening gates into

976
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:26,720
the city center and they don't know what they're built therefore they don't know their purpose their

977
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:33,280
big empty buildings and here we start to learn as we learn that space smells like like burning flesh

978
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:38,240
and we understand that there was a biblical equivalent to this we start to understand that there was

979
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:43,040
way much more going on in the ancient past than people are willing to accept and this is one of the

980
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:47,120
biggest biggest biggest things that we must take away from all the information that we've been

981
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:55,520
gathering is that there is cyclical events on planet earth and humans according to Michael Krammo

982
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:00,800
you know go back millions and millions of years and so we're seeing civilizations rise and fall

983
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:08,320
cyclical catastrophes that have been noted documented in keptin secrecy so that those in the know of

984
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:14,640
these cycles can can respond before these things occur and that's how they end up with the the

985
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:22,000
situation that we're in so I wanted to clarify the mastama and the mastaba to make sure that we

986
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:28,640
understand why I find it so funny that obama's presidential center is a massive unknown Egyptian

987
01:27:28,640 --> 01:27:36,000
structure and then the mastama on the idea that we have a positive satanism in this puzzle until it

988
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:42,240
became this negative narrative and boy the narrative is everything folks yeah and also remember that

989
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:48,480
the the term satanism is not really used very well just like I think we did discuss it to a certain point

990
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:54,880
that this character or characters by the way are in this is their world at this time it's been

991
01:27:54,880 --> 01:28:02,080
handed to them humanity is just like you know when before something industrial goes into manufacturing

992
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:07,680
they create a torture zone for it you know like cars or planes or whatever to put them artificially

993
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:13,280
through five years of wear and tear in a few weeks you know right these these beings are set up to

994
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:18,480
basically be a testament to the robustness of the human spirit if that makes any sense just like in

995
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:25,440
Job do what you will but don't kill them right right it's a torture test or a you know you've seen it

996
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:29,760
where they wash cars and you know wiper blades you know can they go for a million times and all

997
01:28:29,760 --> 01:28:35,280
this stuff so this is what we're being put under there's nothing to fear about it but there is

998
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:41,600
many much to overcome yes I highly recommend folks that you go into the member sections growl down

999
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:49,680
to are you a satanist by Mark Pascio where we discussed the tenants of satanism and you will find

1000
01:28:49,680 --> 01:28:54,800
that you agree with most of them right and all the all the world's major religions and institutions

1001
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:59,760
are under that authority and of course for them to present something malevolent it has to be

1002
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:06,480
presented as good so when people talk to me about satanism I'm always like well which satanist because

1003
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:12,000
we we use it as a catch all phrase you know are you talking about the baby eaters which I consider

1004
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:18,320
our elite or are you talking about the church of satan you know which is is more of a charade you know

1005
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:24,000
but there's many levels to it it's not checkers or tic tic toe it's a level of chess but the thing is

1006
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:30,160
you always have to remember in chess you know the pawn can take a king right really rarely does because

1007
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:35,200
people are not that asleep at the wheel or at the chess board but I'm telling you humanity right now

1008
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:41,280
is asleep where their their kings are being taken by pawns constantly so all right speaking of which

1009
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:46,240
the the kings and all that you know we're talking about the mid the coming middle east union and

1010
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:51,920
of course what gets people's attention is nothing more than what's called money and you know how

1011
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:57,040
many times that subject comes up and just like time well it doesn't exist it's just an illusion or

1012
01:29:57,040 --> 01:30:01,760
it's dead or anything like that that's that's kind of like not what we're going down we're trying

1013
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:06,240
to be a little more rational and definitive and practical but I think we once brought up a

1014
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:11,840
Freeman what money what money is and have you do you remember should we just recap I think this is

1015
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:18,000
a members area so I think giving them more specifics is probably where it's at yes you know humankind

1016
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:22,480
being agriculturally based and of course people will laugh you know a computer programmer says we're

1017
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:27,840
not but go ahead and lock that joker up in a room with nothing agricultural not including the pants

1018
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:32,720
that he's wearing and how is he going to do meaning he needs food and water and even the clothing is

1019
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:40,160
agriculturally based even if it's petroleum it's a form of mining you see so because we are

1020
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:49,680
agriculturally based on that respect a perfect society would be that let's say a level of

1021
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:55,280
distribution where people live on the land and everything they need they get from the land food, water,

1022
01:30:55,280 --> 01:31:04,160
shelter, minerals you get the point it all comes from the earth you know now when it comes time to

1023
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:12,080
traveling and doing barter you can't take the land with you it's not portable so what you do is you

1024
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:17,120
take the absolute best from the land the most precious substance that has agreed on especially

1025
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:26,080
lawfully as a representation so money especially as it was gold and silver is what portable land

1026
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:32,560
think about that for a minute just just this is not for debate or argument this is just a contribution

1027
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:38,080
to the rationale of what money is we're not talking about the system that's in place right now

1028
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:44,400
talking about an old empirical thing you know like like anything it could be go down to its primary

1029
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:51,280
level does that make sense that money in the add the tally stick and you know the methods I've shown

1030
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:57,280
in but yes absolutely that makes complete sense because if you don't eat you die right and also

1031
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:02,640
the gold and silver is mined and it's also extracted and it also represents you know the most precious

1032
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:09,200
what you know aspect of what comes out of the earth so no matter how you slice it it's a money

1033
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:15,600
is portable isn't it even even today well where it's virtual or based on credit it's there's an

1034
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:20,240
essence of portability that is always considered to be you know the most convenient the more portable

1035
01:32:20,240 --> 01:32:25,280
the more virtual the more convenient you see all right so I bit coins up to eighteen hundred bucks

1036
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:31,840
a piece sorry you know here's the thing whether it's Bitcoin the thing is is it lawful and lawful

1037
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:36,560
has to be something that's referenceable and measurable a lot of people say well Greek what do you

1038
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:43,200
mean by lawful means it's measurable right if you can't measure it it's not there I mean it's not

1039
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:48,400
lawful and if you can't measure it guess what you can't manage it can you how can you manage

1040
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:53,040
something that's not measurable you can measure exactly yeah so we're we're going down you know if

1041
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:58,240
you start going into the world of the unlawful which the entire world is right now believe it or not

1042
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:03,120
and if you don't believe it go look at the ingredients on a cereal box is that even resemble what

1043
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:08,480
should be in there but you see yeah what's measurable about most of the food people eats is what

1044
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:14,560
is what is on the ingredients is that sound palatable I would say no in most cases not all cases but

1045
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:20,800
most now regarding the the money thing most people that are listening if not I should say well

1046
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:27,280
most I'm presuming are under in a country that has a credit-based economy now how do I why do I

1047
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:33,920
keep saying it's credit-based well because I'm just reading it off the treasury websites now any

1048
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:40,080
treasury any government any financial institution talks about credit like if you go to a credit

1049
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:45,920
rating agency or credit card company look at their contract and what it says is that we we can

1050
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:50,720
report our credit experience with you it doesn't say we're going to report whether you paid for it or

1051
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:57,520
not or didn't pay says our credit experience go read the contracts yeah it's very simple they're

1052
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:03,040
telling you but you know I don't know what that means yeah well let's let's get into it what what

1053
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:08,000
is credit mean you ever heard of years ago well I'm going to give you credit for it Freeman yeah yeah

1054
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:13,120
that would mean that I did something good yeah it means you did something good or basically if

1055
01:34:13,120 --> 01:34:19,360
you're seeking some form of gain it's due to you right right yeah okay you you're owed credit for

1056
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:24,400
that that's why in college they give you credits right you know there's nothing there or the little

1057
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:30,000
you get a gold star or something it's just basically a feeling of perception of belief the core

1058
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:36,160
belief of most of the credit system is that when you are born and you are given a credit line meaning

1059
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:40,000
it's measurable you know like the social security number that you have is different than the guy next

1060
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:46,240
you it's measurably different right right so in that sense it's lawful but the way it's being used

1061
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:52,560
and touted as money is not lawful now I think on the first hour I did mention this is almost like the

1062
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:56,880
Star Trek future remember when they brought someone from the past and said what do you guys use for

1063
01:34:56,880 --> 01:35:01,360
money and they explain to them we don't use money anymore because everyone is in agreement that

1064
01:35:01,360 --> 01:35:07,120
they have to do things and we don't need it okay this was actually this reality was really put in

1065
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:13,760
place in America in the 30s but look at the the mindset of humanity whether it doesn't matter

1066
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:19,680
where you are whether it's Russia America Columbia you know anywhere you get the picture Japan that

1067
01:35:19,680 --> 01:35:26,000
the people just don't want to grasp this kind of radical paradigm shift because before the credit

1068
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,800
system was put in and you had substance-based money you had to do you had to buy things with gold

1069
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:36,080
or silver or a note that represented that you get it and now doing a paradigm shift like that

1070
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:41,520
was too shocking so they said why don't we put the the law merchants or the attorneys in charge of

1071
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:47,120
it we beef up their paramilitary society known as the police because that they're paramilitary

1072
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:51,760
and to make sure that everything and everyone is held in line and we'll keep the plausible

1073
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:56,000
deniability going that if you borrow you have to pay back and if there's a debt you have to pay it

1074
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:00,320
or you're in trouble kind of thing right right or or you have to put up collateral so

1075
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:06,400
they're still keeping this plausible deniability up which you will also see with every field right

1076
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:10,640
any field you look at right now it's based on plausible deniability with something someone

1077
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:18,080
came up that they are propping up and enforcing as the norm which is false so before getting into more

1078
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:22,640
of this you know most you have some international listeners I'm sure I shouldn't say I'm sure but I'm

1079
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:27,920
presuming that there are people that not only that are in America and Freeman if you would pull up

1080
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:35,760
that law it's an American law is USC 12 United States Code Title 12 section 411 and read it it's

1081
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:40,000
very simple and the reason I brought up the foreign listeners is because they have similar

1082
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,680
codes in every country you see right would you be able to read it I think it'll have without it out

1083
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:50,880
if it'll have like 70% more punch if you read it because if I read it it's just the Greek being

1084
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:56,640
pedantic but if you let me share this yeah please remedy of law for federal reserve notes so

1085
01:36:56,640 --> 01:37:04,320
US Code 12-411 which is interesting in getting the information right and also the 12 doing

1086
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:12,480
to anyway getting all less so tarot on you issuance to reserve banks the nature of obligation redemption

1087
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:20,800
okay so here we go folks US Code 12 federal reserve notes to be issued at the discretion of the board

1088
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:29,440
of governors of the federal reserve system for the purpose of making advances to the federal reserve

1089
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:38,080
banks through the federal reserve agents as here and after set forth and for no other purpose

1090
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:45,200
are authorized all right stop yeah stop it basically in short it's still very simple but it's

1091
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:50,560
basically there are private notes internal currency between banks that can be moved around only

1092
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:55,600
by bank agents or federal reserve agents and then it says no other uses authorized now do I need

1093
01:37:55,600 --> 01:38:01,760
someone to interpret what no other use is authorized means do you know okay and we're looking at this

1094
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:07,360
kind of like the poker chips at the casino right where it's basically an internal system yes

1095
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:14,800
and only for the federal reserve banks through federal reserve agents and you're out it's beyond

1096
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:20,800
the poker chip system because imagine the poker chip system only being by casino employees and

1097
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:27,600
not the patrons right right right in other words imagine going as a patron to a casino and they

1098
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:32,400
hit you over the head because you have a casino chip which should only be held by the employee it

1099
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:38,080
would be like going as a patron to the casino and grabbing a uniform and a name tag that you work

1100
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:44,240
for the casino and you don't right that's the import of this well now I'm really confused

1101
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:49,600
great I mean if I'm not authorized to use my federal notes then what am I doing you

1102
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:54,720
I'm not just you're participating and now what what do you call something in your possession

1103
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:59,680
that you're not supposed to have is it called contraband yes right have you ever heard of people

1104
01:38:59,680 --> 01:39:05,600
getting cash seized by the authorities before for sure and why do they always tell you that it's

1105
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:10,400
drug money if you have a large amount of cash they presume that across the board because they're

1106
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:15,920
not going to sit there and explain it to the people because drugs are supposedly contraband also

1107
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:21,360
so they just throw it lump it into the contraband right so that large stack of cash is contraband wow

1108
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:26,640
that's right because you're not supposed to use it now now keep reading because sometimes people

1109
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:30,080
will read this and they're going to run into someone in the legal society which is going to try

1110
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:35,680
to twist it around and keep keep reading and I might have you pause and stop but go go ahead please

1111
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:41,680
yeah sure absolutely okay so for no other purpose or authorized was last of that said just say

1112
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:49,600
you know okay so the said note shall be obligations of the united states and shall be receivable by all

1113
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:57,360
national and member banks and federal reserve banks and for all taxes customs and other public

1114
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:03,840
dues all right stop now on the surface that looks like oh it seems like we can use it for customs

1115
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:12,960
and public dues and taxes right it's on surface but no yes and no yes meaning it can be used for

1116
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:18,720
customs public dues and taxes but by who the federal reserve agents only again you get it

1117
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:24,240
don't get twisted or wrapped around the axle on this you ever ride a bicycle with your shoelaces

1118
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:30,240
untied so don't let this happen to you here because an attorney will try to twist that in saying

1119
01:40:30,240 --> 01:40:35,680
see where you could pay you can't it's only again remember if you take that first sentence yeah

1120
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:39,360
yeah if you take the first sentence and apply it to the second just because it sounds different

1121
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:46,320
does it mean the first sentence is washed away exactly so continue okay so I you know the said

1122
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:51,360
notes shall be obligations of the united states yeah that's a very interesting statement right on

1123
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:55,360
its own yes because you don't need money because it's a credit-based economy you're just supposed

1124
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:59,840
to sign your name and use the credit line the number that was given to you right the social

1125
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:04,560
security number to buy anything you need food clothing and shelter it's considered public funds by

1126
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:12,000
the way and if you have a note that you're using that's a bank note a private bank note you're using

1127
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:18,800
it as an extra because you don't really need that and what it really represents is that it's a debt

1128
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:24,000
from the united states and we're going to get into once we let's go okay one more sentence and

1129
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:28,000
I'll tell you how they got into that pickle real quick all right so the last sentence of this

1130
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:33,680
code folks and I just know you know it's three sentences right the us code of 12

1131
01:41:33,680 --> 01:41:44,240
4.11 yeah is three sentences that outlines your money and the lawful use of it they shall be

1132
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:51,680
redeemed in lawful money on demand at the treasury department of the united states in the city of

1133
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:59,360
Washington district of Columbia or any federal reserve bank right now what does that mean you

1134
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:03,920
you have that bill you know people say here's a bill a dollar bill ten dollar bill five you know

1135
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:09,840
what I asked people I said who's going to pay that bill right right right right right all right

1136
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:14,400
20 dollar bill and they call them bills yeah who's going to pay that bill well it just tells you

1137
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:18,080
the united states is going to pay it's you're supposed to take those notes with the dead presidents

1138
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:22,720
on there and bring them to the bank to get lawful money now if you try doing that they're going to

1139
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:27,440
ignore you or arrest you or think you're mad remember first hour we're talking about the drinking of

1140
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:33,680
the water that made you crazy yeah so so at this point here maybe we'll talk about what you would

1141
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:40,000
be like if you saved your own water right let's just go back yeah so so what's interesting here as

1142
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,560
the best they can do and this is not advice or whatever I could just speak from experience it from

1143
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:50,640
others that when you always ask for lawful money you make a little note on any financial transaction

1144
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:56,720
or whatever you no longer have a tax liability now not saying you cannot volunteer into one or have

1145
01:42:56,720 --> 01:43:03,120
one but they it cannot be imposed on you as such because you're how are you going to pay taxes or

1146
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:08,960
anything with money you're not supposed to be using now let me just retract what I just said to

1147
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:15,920
a degree what they call taxes not one penny of taxes collected in the past oh half century has even

1148
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:21,200
paid for a stick of bubble gum or a sign on a politician's door it is under what's called economic

1149
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:28,880
theory and contract law now obviously the water that people are drinking have made everyone insane so

1150
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:34,880
the people that are enforcing this are insane to a certain degree just as those that are using it

1151
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:40,640
are insane meaning the whole world has gone crazy this is a very dangerous path to go down but the

1152
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:47,040
reason we're bringing it up now is because it's rational it's easily comprehended and just like the

1153
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:51,440
smell of burning flesh and space how can you use it well I don't know that's up to you but at least

1154
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:56,480
now you know you see right and if you're if you're well skilled and you want to achieve

1155
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:01,920
master'ship you can go to the next level with it of course but I just want to mention here this

1156
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:08,160
code is written on an eighth grade level which is unlike a lot of legal ease and it also explains a lot

1157
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:13,200
why cash is viewed as a bad thing now let me just get into a little technical aspect before I get

1158
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:17,920
into a little history which is important is that you notice how there are serial numbers on the

1159
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:23,680
cash and on and on transactions and on checks you have noticed that Freeman there are serial numbers

1160
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:28,640
on there oh without that yeah whenever you look for a serial number that's for record purposes only

1161
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:33,040
you ever buy a toaster or blow dryer or a TV and on the warranty card it tells you to put the serial

1162
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:39,840
number yeah warranty it right the serial number is a is it identifier well what I would suggest this is

1163
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:45,680
what's been done and also IRS offices do this by the way when you bring them cash is they keep what's

1164
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:51,280
they do what's called competent record keeping where every time you get a note you have a little book

1165
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:56,560
or however ledger could be done electronically you could scan it where you write the the bill the

1166
01:44:56,560 --> 01:45:01,760
the nomination and the serial number and you file it away because all those numbers that you're

1167
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:06,880
accruing are at the end of the year you supposed to send it to the treasury to get lawful money for

1168
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:11,920
it well the serial numbers and all that and that's why if you go to a government office where they

1169
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:17,760
tell you we don't accept cash if you push the issue what they do let's say you give them 150 and

1170
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:23,600
notes 350s they pull out a ledger and they write down on each line well 150 note this is the serial

1171
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:28,640
number another 50 note that's the serial number and I once asked one of the clerks at the office that

1172
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:33,520
did I said if you don't do this you've just created a tax liability for this office as she looked at

1173
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:39,600
me and almost dropped dead she was like how do you know that well I read 12 section title 12 section

1174
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:45,920
411 now title 12 section 401 doesn't tell you to keep competent records and serial numbers in

1175
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:50,960
that but that is the only other reason you start piecing together in Sherlock Holmes fashion what's

1176
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:56,720
going on here to be clear because the federal reserve notes are not lawful money for them to use they

1177
01:45:56,720 --> 01:46:02,240
have to then create something else out of it well no what they do is they keep a record that they

1178
01:46:02,240 --> 01:46:06,880
came across one with someone intending to use it but they no one can use it so once you have the

1179
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:12,400
record of all of them you go to the treasury to get real money and they can't give you real money

1180
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:19,760
so the whole thing kind of controversy kind of goes away doesn't it yeah so so the the other aspect is

1181
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:24,560
are you going to get lawful money no you're not because you're kind of this is a cosmic joke on

1182
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:31,040
humanity by the way you know but I just want to look we're going to revisit this again and I'm going

1183
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:36,880
to give some more practical examples but can we get into the history of how the US was bankrupted

1184
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:42,800
in simple without the crazy patriot mysticism and all that stuff that you hear online I think that

1185
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:48,800
would be helpful yes okay how you got into receivership what happened was the US was had lawful

1186
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:53,920
money gold and silver back currency basically silver back currency and of course you know since the

1187
01:46:53,920 --> 01:46:58,400
time of jackson you know they had the original bank and then it went to a private bank and then

1188
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:03,120
they got rid of it and then they try to bring it back with a federal reserve and by the way there's

1189
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:08,560
a book about some island creature or whatever and that that's that's not what I'm talking about yes

1190
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:13,280
I don't want to say anything bad about it but it's not there's nothing good I can't say it's

1191
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:18,880
wrong but it sure ain't right what you're reading there okay now this is very simple uh

1192
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:23,280
enough you look into the history because there's a lot of this stuff out there now I'm not going to say

1193
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:29,600
these people are shills or putting out misinformation but they're definitely putting out misinformation

1194
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:34,720
because disinformation can only be put out by the one who knows it's wrong and is doing it deliberately

1195
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:40,640
to twist everything the misinformation is those that are innocently doing it they just fell for it

1196
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:46,800
you see right is it disinformed is different than a misinformer or disinformed or is you know you can only

1197
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:50,720
if you're subject to a disinformer you're going to be misinformed it doesn't make it that's not

1198
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:55,200
good say yeah exactly yeah those that are subject to the disinformer become the misinform but I

1199
01:47:55,200 --> 01:48:00,480
can very much speculate that everyone that's producing right now anything about the economic

1200
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:06,480
economy out there on your internet fringe level or mainstream whatever is subject to misinformation

1201
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:10,480
right I'm not going to point a finger who's the disinformed because really I don't know

1202
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:15,280
who and it doesn't matter at this point just give it to a straight great yeah so straight what's

1203
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:21,840
going on is the the the American government let's say the US government and other governments got

1204
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:27,040
into contracts with the private banks to produce their notes and their money at a rate of 6%

1205
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:31,840
you get it the interest it doesn't sound too low it should be less but it doesn't sound too

1206
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:38,240
less and sound too high right 6% so what happened was the the government started giving all of their

1207
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:45,840
substance you know contracts title gold silver to the private bankers and when they brought it in

1208
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:52,320
they inventory it and printed notes in return but once the government gave everything of value to

1209
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:57,200
the private bankers and they converted it all to notes well guess what they still owed the 6%

1210
01:48:57,200 --> 01:49:01,680
didn't they so how are they going to pay the 6% to the bankers when they already took everything so

1211
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:09,440
the bankers came back and put them in bankruptcy for the interest that was owed simple is this I

1212
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:13,040
mean this can be understood like 12 year old you know eight year old can understand this right very

1213
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:19,280
simple we have an agreement at 6% we'll print all your money we've gotten everything from you to

1214
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:24,640
turn it into printable money and now you still owe us a 6% how are you going to pay we are out of

1215
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:30,160
money to pay you now well what happens when any organization is completely out of money and has

1216
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:35,360
no chance of getting anymore they become what bankrupted bankrupt now should they have been now in

1217
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:40,800
bankruptcy you have a choice either a completely liquidate and dissolve it no longer exists or if

1218
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:45,760
it's a useful fixture in society you put it in receivership you keep keep it going so what do you

1219
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:49,520
think they did with the u.s. government did they liquidate it and disappear it or did they say let's

1220
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:54,880
keep it around because it could be useful and put it in receivership the latter yes and this is why

1221
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:59,840
America still stands yes otherwise you wouldn't have you would have gone into whatever futile

1222
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:05,680
city state war lord stuff right you know right that wouldn't be allowed to happen because the

1223
01:50:05,680 --> 01:50:10,160
temples that are in Washington DC needed they didn't want to tear those down and by the way when

1224
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:15,200
you look at those buildings go look at the Lincoln Memorial what's inscripted it's what it's a temple

1225
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:20,480
that says it right there are you familiar with the inscription in this temple is those are considered

1226
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:25,200
temples in architecture it's not because I say so it's not a theory it's actually inscribed on the

1227
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:30,000
building this is a temple are you familiar with that so you know that about Lincoln but yeah I am

1228
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:35,280
very and you know every time they put out the high terrorist alerts and they're worried about

1229
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:41,760
Mount Rushmore or the Washington monument or you know I'm always thinking how are these even worry

1230
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:48,080
some objects you know what about the people the cities you know it's always these national monuments

1231
01:50:48,080 --> 01:50:57,280
which are temples oh yeah they are they are temples here I'm going to do just we're kind of maybe

1232
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:04,000
going for time or here but for time I'm just going to open this Lincoln Memorial inscription stock

1233
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:10,560
photos if you can go to that I can just drop it in and maybe have you read it real quick this is on

1234
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:17,920
the Lincoln Memorial this is just to not being pedantic but just just I think it has about 70% more

1235
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:22,240
kick-freeman when you read it I just dropped the Lincoln right there would you read that if you can

1236
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:33,360
open it this is the Lincoln Memorial all right give me just a second here as we I anyone can search

1237
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:39,680
Lincoln Memorial inscription right this is what you will read what does it say in this temple thank you

1238
01:51:39,680 --> 01:51:47,680
first words right it's all centered so that every day that is and is sure enshrined forever

1239
01:51:47,680 --> 01:51:55,200
right so in this temple as in the hearts of the people for whom he saved the union the memory of

1240
01:51:55,200 --> 01:52:01,200
Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever so yes very first thing you see in this temple and then you

1241
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:05,840
will find that in all of their building not all of their buildings but enough to say to walk away that

1242
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:12,800
you saw a bunch of temples there today yes so so are we I know I know when you're too informative

1243
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:18,240
you sound pedantic like your election but I want to distress the high weirdness of this stuff right

1244
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:22,880
so that's how you're going to remember it you know real memory comes in how it affects your heart

1245
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:27,840
like if you get really good news it affects the heart if you get really bad news it affects the heart

1246
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:33,280
that's why you remember things it affects the heart trivial stuff it's in the mind you forget you see

1247
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:40,400
yeah that's why yeah yeah so it's the heart that that is being directed and misdirected in this case

1248
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:48,320
in every case I should say let's just continue now we we kind of brought up the code that let's say

1249
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:53,120
legally and lawfully proves that we shouldn't you know society shouldn't be using those notes right so

1250
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:59,200
if you ever wonder they're fighting against cash you know is there a debate over who this should

1251
01:52:59,200 --> 01:53:05,520
there be cash or not no because the law clearly says it's illegal you see so but what are we to do

1252
01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:08,960
well it shows you what kind of a pickle you're in and I don't mean that literally because you're not

1253
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:13,520
really inside of a pickle but you're in a bind and you're not really in a bind there's nothing tying

1254
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:21,280
you down but you are been dictive directed down a path of utter and complete ignorance lawfully and

1255
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:26,640
legal about the leak what's really going on is the purpose of showing this ultimately right right

1256
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:32,880
so so so let's we spoke about the law that shows that we're not authorized to use that we also showed

1257
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:38,560
very quickly and basically how the US got into this condition and let's just go to the future

1258
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:44,880
very quickly you're going to get out of it no you're not because there's no demand for it change right

1259
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:51,280
that's why have you heard of Ron Paul discussing audit the Fed why why because all of the followers of

1260
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:56,320
Ron Paul are fully endorsing the Fed how many followers of Ron Paul or himself came out and said we're

1261
01:53:56,320 --> 01:54:01,200
not supposed to be using the Federal Reserve notes at all how many zero right and himself also so

1262
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:06,000
the whole thing is a show the whole thing is a show but this is not about the show this is about

1263
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:12,320
what's going on behind not just the curtain but the guts inside the wizard really is what we're talking

1264
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:19,040
about so let's say now so we've got the history we've got the code in front of us now what is one to do

1265
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:24,560
well there's not much you can do about it but now that you know about it what is this whole thing

1266
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:30,640
based on well obviously it's credit it's based on faith now well it's a really bad religion because

1267
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:37,120
a lot of people are being hurt by it if you know what I mean yeah right now the other thing is there's

1268
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:42,080
a couple of people about they're talking about respa and ftcpa which is federal trade and consumer

1269
01:54:42,080 --> 01:54:47,680
protection acts and all they basically said if anyone says you owe them money all you have to do is

1270
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:53,280
deny it well you just say they have to validate it not verify and there's quite a few people there's

1271
01:54:53,280 --> 01:54:56,880
a group call I think what lies in your debt I don't want to sort of promote I don't know if

1272
01:54:56,880 --> 01:55:01,760
they're still around but only did was say if anyone says you owe them money doesn't matter who they are

1273
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:05,680
forget about how much is it whatever it's like prove it and the only way they can prove it is

1274
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:10,320
whether a sworn affidavit no one's gonna swear to them that you owe them anything in a credit

1275
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:15,520
based economy so that these guys have had quite a bit of success but the thing is people don't contact

1276
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:19,360
myself I might even speak for freeman on how you can get stuff for quote unquote free because there's

1277
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:26,560
no such thing because ultimately free is that an acronym standing for from revenue emanated elsewhere

1278
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:32,160
I'm just putting that out think about it it's all credit now the purpose of the credit system is

1279
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:39,360
that you have a jurisdiction which is also a spiritual one when you see maps geographical

1280
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:45,200
political maps it's just not people spring ink at the printing press there's a spirit behind that

1281
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:50,400
and every country has a matron or patron deity in the world right now it tends to be the goddess

1282
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:55,360
religion and I'm gonna bring this back when you live in a certain jurisdiction like we were talking

1283
01:55:55,360 --> 01:56:00,560
about making good citizens that's defining a certain political subdivision or political group by

1284
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:08,000
border and culture right so what what the credit system is based on is that anyone participating in

1285
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:14,160
that system is in agreement that they've donated their body their labor their mind and all their

1286
01:56:14,160 --> 01:56:21,360
possessions and their children to make the system work right very simple the full faith and credit

1287
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:27,040
of the United States is what they're talking about but at the same time what the nefarious act here is

1288
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:33,760
of what they've put out for you to use has been deemed contraband now if that's not crazy I don't

1289
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:41,760
know what is now you want to get into really high weirdness now okay when you and let's just do what

1290
01:56:41,760 --> 01:56:46,400
I call slave talk oh well go over it again and how the banking really works on a practical level

1291
01:56:46,400 --> 01:56:50,480
because most people say I don't understand this and because they've decided they don't want to

1292
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:55,840
understand it how many times if you brought up math and people say well I'm not good at math well since

1293
01:56:55,840 --> 01:57:00,400
when did you decide that because people watch other people in the pranking and they're growing up

1294
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:04,720
and they're like oh auntie says she's not good at math and she's getting away with it so I'll go I'll

1295
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:10,400
spend my life saying that that's this is the deep rooted spiritual side of things children copy

1296
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:16,800
so you want to keep people that are if you have children keep the people away that say well I'm

1297
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:22,080
not good at this and that's all because then the children learn that bad behavior right you see

1298
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:26,080
what I mean the how many times you have people say I don't I don't understand I'm not into scientific

1299
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:30,480
stuff I'm not into math I'm not into finance you know what that's a crop a crop a crop a crop of

1300
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:38,640
crap folks that's a cop out the spiritual cop out now that doesn't mean that you don't that these

1301
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:44,160
things work against you as such because you deemed that you don't like it but they're things you can

1302
01:57:44,160 --> 01:57:49,120
work and exercise and get better at just like if you're not good at playing golf or tennis you can take

1303
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:53,520
lessons and you may not be a pro at it but you'll be better than if you didn't try to exercise a

1304
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:59,040
discipline in it so I just want to preface this simple story of how the money system really works

1305
01:57:59,040 --> 01:58:03,840
and you're ready Freeman we're going to do some slave talk here and just to illustrate to the

1306
01:58:03,840 --> 01:58:10,960
listener what their banks are doing bring it on okay now Freeman I write a check from my bank I'm

1307
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:15,440
using slave talk now I take out the book I write a check to Freeman a hundred dollars paid

1308
01:58:15,440 --> 01:58:21,040
of the order of and and I put it in an envelope and I send it to you in the mail you get to the mailbox

1309
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:25,360
and you see all the Greeks sent me a hundred dollars and you take the envelope and you go to the

1310
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:31,040
bank you open the envelope and you hand it to the clerk she looks at it all puzzled and she

1311
01:58:31,040 --> 01:58:39,040
hands it back to you and says I can't use it why oh you need to sign the back right okay so now you

1312
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:44,560
endorse the back and she you hand it back to the clerk and now she can use it well okay it wasn't

1313
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:49,600
good before no it wasn't good before because you need two signatures on an instrument to make it

1314
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:55,840
valid how do how can we show this otherwise take out a bill one five ten twenty or a note from

1315
01:58:55,840 --> 01:59:02,160
anywhere typically you will see two signatures on it right okay so so now we're going down to show

1316
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:07,440
how this thing is formed we're not going to explain all of it but it's a witnessing thing okay

1317
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:14,960
so now you hand the check that you signed the back of to the clerk and she's at the monitor

1318
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:20,320
before they say you used ledgers and she pulls up the only thing that banks have in their inventory

1319
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:26,720
which is transaction numbers so the next transaction number shows up and she starts filling in the details

1320
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:31,600
Freeman and all of a sudden a hundred dollars is created from those two signatures based on the

1321
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:37,440
credit system that we all agree on and debited to your account or actually credited to your account

1322
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:41,520
and you get a receipt that you now have a hundred dollars where you didn't before in the account

1323
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:48,560
you with me so far yes now if i were to really quick quickly check the account that i have especially

1324
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:52,720
in the old days before they had the digital stuff they like i see the hundred dollars is still there

1325
01:59:52,720 --> 02:00:00,560
so they didn't really send it over to you just like they couldn't email a tuna fish sandwich

1326
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:04,880
right right it just doesn't happen that's why when you hear people today's that i'm waiting for

1327
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:10,000
money to be wired i mean you're you're waiting to you i mean you're you're being played they're just

1328
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:17,440
playing with you okay so go back to the story now my bank now your bank now that you've got the

1329
02:00:17,440 --> 02:00:22,960
the hundred dollars in all the sudden sees that my bank that because the information is there

1330
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:28,640
and they immediately notify or not so immediately notify my bank that this transaction has taken place

1331
02:00:28,640 --> 02:00:34,400
so my bank now is like hmm we need to keep plausible deniability up with the Greek because

1332
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:39,040
if Freeman calls him up and says he just got the hundred dollars and the Greek checks the balance

1333
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:43,200
and sees that he still has the hundred dollars we got a little bit of a problem so we need to rapidly

1334
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:49,200
take the money out of the Greek's account so he's under the plausible deniability the plausibility

1335
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:55,040
that it got transferred to Freeman you see so what the bank what the my bank then does is

1336
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:59,360
takes the hundred dollars out of the account that i see and puts it in the comptroller section of the

1337
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:05,520
bank under my name let's say the Greek and stores it there for a few days and under the

1338
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:11,280
paperwork reduction act i think of after 30 days it can be declared as abandoned so they file

1339
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:18,880
certain paperwork let's say at 1099 a is an example on that hundred dollars that it's been abandoned

1340
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:23,280
just like you file an abandoned been paperwork for an abandoned car or funds or anything you

1341
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:28,800
you folks can get the picture very easily now after it's been abandoned because obviously i'm not

1342
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:35,520
doing anything with it then they file paperwork to claim it and now the bank takes it from you legally

1343
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:42,480
and the whole time it was just sitting there it there was no reason for it to be taken out because it

1344
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:49,760
wasn't transferred over to Freeman you see so this has been going on for years and years and years

1345
02:01:49,760 --> 02:01:56,560
and no one is noticing so when you start hearing oh the federal reserve all this and that oh wow

1346
02:01:56,560 --> 02:02:03,280
wow wow no it's the little branch office the way they work is how they're operating now i want to ask

1347
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:11,280
so if you were to able to file claim on the abandonment before the bank does yes can you just

1348
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:16,800
keep spending that money the well the thing is what happens is what you're supposed to do legally

1349
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:22,800
is uh uh what to a certain degree is yeah claim it once it goes into abandonment or before it goes

1350
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:28,560
into abandonment or if it goes into abandonment then counter that with a claim and take it back out

1351
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:34,160
deposit spend it and then claim it again and so you just need let's say 10,000 bucks or a thousand bucks

1352
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:39,200
for your whole life every time you spend it you put it back in and recycle it right because because

1353
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:43,920
the whenever you're writing a checker using a card nothing is being transferred out of your account

1354
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:49,600
to them it's being created on the other side in real time okay so the form you would need to claim

1355
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:56,800
this abandonment and then what would happen to you okay what happens to you when you try to do this

1356
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:02,480
is they send you a letter saying that there are certain consumer laws because we are a retail level

1357
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:09,920
we could refuse service to you goodbye oh okay so the bank just just says all right uh you figured out

1358
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:15,280
the game so you can't play anymore right and if you do this enough you try to open a bank out some

1359
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:20,960
of them they'll have you sit there for hours and not tell you why you're black called yeah not because

1360
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:26,800
what you're doing is wrong because what you're doing is right right makes sense so a lot of people

1361
02:03:26,800 --> 02:03:30,960
say to me am I doing this is this wrong Greek and I'm like well I don't know about it being long but

1362
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:37,840
I'll tell you for sure it ain't right right right now I still can't figure out how to come about

1363
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:43,840
lawful money I mean it just doesn't exist it's gone no anything is there was a story years ago about

1364
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:48,800
a guy at a hockey game one of these Patriot types and Buffalo or something he tried to pay for a hot dog

1365
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:53,120
in a beer with a silver coin yeah and he didn't they didn't know what to do with it so they called the

1366
02:03:53,120 --> 02:04:00,240
treasury and they arrested him for that so oh wow yeah yeah this is a sci-fi planet now yeah at the

1367
02:04:00,240 --> 02:04:05,840
free-your-mind conference people were trying to pay for their hotel with cash and they were not

1368
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:11,040
allowed to stay there that's different yeah we're talking about silver now lawful money but cash is

1369
02:04:11,040 --> 02:04:18,400
not lawful money by far what it really what cash really is it's when you take a dollar bill or

1370
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:24,080
five bill or ten bill hold it up with the president's side folded in half the left half is the front

1371
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:29,200
the right half is the back you have the issuing signature on the front and the endorsement signature

1372
02:04:29,200 --> 02:04:33,040
on the back you know left and right of the president don't think of the front of the bill in the

1373
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:38,000
back of the bill those are two separate pages stuck together right the front is both front and

1374
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:43,360
back where the president is the left side shows you the issuing signature in the account or the

1375
02:04:43,360 --> 02:04:49,520
evidence of some account to issue and the rear the back of it the right is the account is repeated

1376
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:55,520
we know the account is closed and it's endorsed so when you hold a bill of one five ten twenty or

1377
02:04:55,520 --> 02:05:00,640
from anywhere in the world what that represents legally is a canceled check on the closed account

1378
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:09,440
about it this is insanity now if you try to pass a cancel check on a closed account at a store they're

1379
02:05:09,440 --> 02:05:12,880
going to call the authorities how come they're not calling the authorities with this because they

1380
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:18,480
are under a spell right they all believe in the system that they've been taught into believe as

1381
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:24,560
we were saying in the beginning of this and then we can't really see the future yes you can but

1382
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:28,800
but carry that belief forward but that would be to try to substantiate what that belief is based

1383
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:33,280
on and you're going to see it's something very negative I just showed you the law the code which

1384
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:38,000
shows if you read title 12 section 401 do you walk away with a good feeling or a bad feeling because

1385
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:44,320
you have federal reserve notes the pretty bad feeling don't you yeah and be using them contraband

1386
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:52,720
that's why for example when these truckers get stopped with cash you know when people get pulled

1387
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:58,560
over by an authoritative figure they usually ask for ID lives since registration insurance all that

1388
02:05:58,560 --> 02:06:02,720
when they find the cash they walk away and they come back and they ask you for ID all over again

1389
02:06:03,680 --> 02:06:06,960
as if nothing happened like you're my in the twilight zone I gave it to you raise it well

1390
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:11,440
let me see your ID again and why because now they know they have to produce a federal reserve agent

1391
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:17,040
ID and how many of them do none right right so the person the trucker with all that cash needs to be

1392
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:22,160
a federal reserve agent to own it so now he's being charged with contraband so they're coming back

1393
02:06:22,160 --> 02:06:29,040
to reintroduce reintroduce the topic and see if he'll produce the proper credentials for owning

1394
02:06:29,680 --> 02:06:34,800
unlawful money holding right right right you can't own it right yeah so now you know what what you

1395
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:39,520
that's why you'll notice before cash is taken they go through these weird steps it's like this is

1396
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:43,920
we just did this already why are you doing it again now the people that are enforcing this the guy

1397
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:47,360
the beat on the street or whatever they don't know what's going on they're just called a legal

1398
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:51,040
department you know and even the guys in legal department don't know what they're going on

1399
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:55,600
it's going on either because they're subject to the same thing yeah and like we said earlier if

1400
02:06:55,600 --> 02:07:01,920
you're a lawyer practicing actual law you'd be disbard you mean selling selling car used automobiles

1401
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:05,840
yeah and I'm not joking about that I've heard of several attorneys that have been disbard and

1402
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:11,840
they always end up as selling cars either user knew right there's something mystical about that I

1403
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:17,840
don't know but but yeah so this is an interesting part now one way to do it like for example you know

1404
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:21,840
you walk you talk and talk you walk let's just say personally what I do whenever I do commerce

1405
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:28,000
with a note let's say they ring up you know 26 dollars and 11 cents well I'll pull out a 20 a 5

1406
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:33,120
into one and I'll say here's some coin the dime in the penny and I'll say here are three notes I hope

1407
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:38,080
you get money for it someday I never acknowledge it it's a 20 I never acknowledge it's a five or

1408
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:42,560
a one because it's a 26 11 let's say so I'll give them the 20 the five in the one I'll say here are

1409
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:48,800
three notes I hope you get money for it someday and they're like you know what the best is go to a bank

1410
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:53,680
and give them a check and say I'd like to exchange these for federal reserve notes and the clerk gets

1411
02:07:53,680 --> 02:07:58,560
nervous like I don't know what that is I'll be right back and she goes in the back and says this guy

1412
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:03,120
wants federal reserve notes for this check and the manager comes back with a stern face no eye contact

1413
02:08:03,120 --> 02:08:07,200
counts all the money out and then reams out the clerk tells him take the rest of the day off because

1414
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:11,200
the clerk is sitting there counting these for decades and they don't even know what they are right

1415
02:08:11,200 --> 02:08:16,000
because they're remember we talked about the cosmic censorship earlier how the information is

1416
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:20,720
sealed and you bring it to someone who can read and they say well it's sealed I can't read it but then

1417
02:08:20,720 --> 02:08:24,160
you bring it to someone who's illiterate and they say it doesn't matter if it's sealed or not because

1418
02:08:24,160 --> 02:08:28,560
I'm illiterate and then you bring it to the blind and it doesn't matter what's written because

1419
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:35,520
they're blind so you have three levels that infirmate you see right so right now the majority of

1420
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:41,360
the planet is blind and or illiterate and you don't have a chance because they're all drinking the

1421
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:46,640
water remember the Persian and meanwhile they're just saying well I'm not good at math right so

1422
02:08:46,640 --> 02:08:51,680
basically all goes down to food clothing and shelter now personally I played around with this a

1423
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:58,400
little bit without any success and I understand why because you ever hear people say fight for your

1424
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:02,320
rights and all that I said well it or stand up for your rights you've heard of that right

1425
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:05,840
what's okay to stand up for your rights but they're fixing on cracking heads and arresting people

1426
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:12,320
might be good to stay seated for that day I completely agree with you there it's all in our minds it's

1427
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:19,120
all in the narrative it's all in the spell and you need to you know walk away we need to find our day

1428
02:09:19,120 --> 02:09:25,200
dream and start to understand where we want to go and to bring in a little bit of high strangeness

1429
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:31,600
we brought in star-track money and we're winding up this hour now Greek so okay we brought up the idea

1430
02:09:31,600 --> 02:09:36,640
of star-track money and how they had you know a system that just supplied everything for everyone

1431
02:09:36,640 --> 02:09:41,680
they're like we don't have cash anymore that's old school Gene Roddenberry actually is

1432
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:48,480
reputed to have been involved in communication with the extraterrestrial source known as the nine

1433
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:54,320
and they used Erie Geller as one of the psychics to channel the nine and Gene Roddenberry happened

1434
02:09:54,320 --> 02:10:01,920
to be one of the people that was that sat in on these say-ons as if you will excuse me

1435
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:09,040
and you know then came forward with with whole new lines to star-track this was after star-track

1436
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:14,320
creation but then you'll see in things like generations where the story of the nine starts to really

1437
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:18,800
come and play a more so there's one just high strangeness with money star-track money and

1438
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:25,840
extraterrestrial source is living in acrid death smelling burning body space and then another one

1439
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:31,760
I wanted to recommend even as strange as it is and I swear guys I think the creators of South Park

1440
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:37,520
really listen to the free zone I they cover so much that I used to and I believe it's true and I've

1441
02:10:37,520 --> 02:10:44,400
heard it's true but the episode Pinebox Derby which starts with a particle from CERN gets into

1442
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:50,080
the idea of money and space money and these aliens come down and they give all the space money

1443
02:10:50,080 --> 02:10:55,200
and next thing you know Mexico's got water parks everywhere and they're all just using the space

1444
02:10:55,200 --> 02:11:01,760
money but I don't want to ruin the end for you but it ends in a cube so definitely check out Pinebox

1445
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:08,240
Derby on South Park I can't believe I recommend South Park now but it's true man and then the ideas

1446
02:11:08,240 --> 02:11:17,760
that we really do have this weird extraterrestrial say on type connection to our temples that are

1447
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:24,160
there and and this is where the spell of money comes from and then the rest is the narrative

1448
02:11:24,160 --> 02:11:28,880
and the narrative is what we believe and don't believe and what we're willing to learn and not

1449
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:37,760
learn and whether we see that scroll sealed blind or otherwise so yeah final statements Greg oh man I

1450
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:42,480
don't know there's there's the final statement is every statement basically because you can take

1451
02:11:42,480 --> 02:11:47,520
anything we've discussed and spin off and spend the rest of your life studying it the only thing I'd

1452
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:53,520
say is I appreciate you for having me again on the another sonic event and I really appreciate the

1453
02:11:53,520 --> 02:12:00,240
listeners I'm saying this objectively I'm sending you guys flowers maybe that you have given me a

1454
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:04,320
little bit more hope meaning the listeners that there are people out there that are really

1455
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:10,640
objective discerning and more than just intelligent but are perceptive and it's given me a little bit

1456
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:16,240
more of let's say a breath of fresh air that when I get emails and comments that are just really on

1457
02:12:16,240 --> 02:12:21,200
point and I ask them where did they find out about the Greek they said on Freeman I'm like this is

1458
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:26,640
just too uncanny why is it that anyone and everyone that is making sense is coming from Freeman so

1459
02:12:26,640 --> 02:12:31,760
I just want to thank the audience yeah and this is the truth folks so thank you guys and thank you

1460
02:12:31,760 --> 02:12:40,320
for having me on and also uncommon radio www.uncommonradio you'll just it's just a courtesy site where you have

1461
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:46,320
over a hundred hours of of archives and bring your popcorn and bring your aspirin because you're

1462
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:51,520
going to be entertained and you're going to get a headache and of course yeah there'll be more to

1463
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:56,640
come and thank you for plugging in there's probably going to be a pod bean in the future it'll be

1464
02:12:57,280 --> 02:13:03,440
more and more information and experiences and things like that that will hopefully be helpful

1465
02:13:03,440 --> 02:13:08,880
because if we're not helping people and remember folks when people talk about problems in the world

1466
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:14,800
if if if just half the people in the world helped one person that takes care of the other half

1467
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:22,640
doesn't it absolutely without a doubt folks be bold and mighty forces will come to your aid

1468
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:29,280
and help you to quit your job and save the world it's all in our say say don't say save the world sorry

1469
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:32,960
I'm just saying as a foot okay go ahead now you've got now you could say it but you're going to get

1470
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:38,240
the benevolent and the malevolent forces against you because the malevolent forces never wanted

1471
02:13:38,240 --> 02:13:43,360
the world to be saved during a better place but the benevolent forces are now coming to a time where

1472
02:13:43,360 --> 02:13:48,000
they're going to come down here and mop up just like you ever see a mop someone mopping up there

1473
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:54,480
like don't stand here be careful it's slippery so so either way you can do all the things that

1474
02:13:54,480 --> 02:13:58,720
require to make everything better but don't say that you're doing it for that reason I'm just

1475
02:13:58,720 --> 02:14:04,080
okay this is maybe a satiric advice but you could do it but don't say you're doing it save the world

1476
02:14:04,080 --> 02:14:09,600
because now you're voiced and witnessed that you're going to have all the cosmic forces against you

1477
02:14:09,600 --> 02:14:16,320
I just I know this is controversial yeah I got you I got you it's all in the in the terminology folks

1478
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:23,120
it really is it's funny because I didn't even think of because you know world like God has so many

1479
02:14:23,120 --> 02:14:28,800
different meanings inside of our minds and when I say it the world is the narrative that's going

1480
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:39,360
along inside of our minds and I want you to recognize that you can be driven by a beneficial

1481
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:45,680
force that is unknown to us that we call God that we call whatever that you don't even need a

1482
02:14:45,680 --> 02:14:53,280
name for that because you'll experience it and so when I say to save the world from my mind it is

1483
02:14:53,280 --> 02:14:59,920
saying to save the narrative to rewrite the narrative into a human structure into a a a

1484
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:06,400
a beautific structure that we all know that we all see in perfection yeah keep in mind the good

1485
02:15:06,400 --> 02:15:12,240
advice is this is not doom and gloom and this will be understood better later within the 15 years

1486
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:18,240
that are as left with as you things as you know it a lot of parents yes this is sober people this is

1487
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:22,960
not the new age types of love and light and all that stuff because remember most of the love and

1488
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:27,680
light that's in the world today is really malevolent because they have to package it as such

1489
02:15:27,680 --> 02:15:33,600
or ignorant or whatever but the practical reasoning behind it is a lot of parents come to me and say

1490
02:15:33,600 --> 02:15:38,240
Greek I have a two-year-old which should I do very simple add 15 to two that gives them a life

1491
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:43,040
span of 17 what would you do different in your life if you knew you're only going to live to 17

1492
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:48,080
doesn't mean that that child has to do that but boy you wouldn't go to school would you you'd have

1493
02:15:48,080 --> 02:15:54,000
more fun wouldn't you wouldn't you be more daring wouldn't you exactly some people say well what if

1494
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:59,840
nothing that this doesn't happen in 17 years or 15 years well still fine because now you have a very

1495
02:15:59,840 --> 02:16:04,720
unique individual but you have to be careful because you're on the planet of the insane and I'll

1496
02:16:04,720 --> 02:16:10,560
bring up maybe as a closing comment here the words of goita which I thought I came up with this on my

1497
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:15,520
own but someone pointed out he had said this 300 years ago is that you need not visit an insane

1498
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:21,520
asylum to meet disordered spirits for the earth is the insane asylum of the universe so be very very

1499
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:26,560
careful and just that's why I always encourage people if they have visitors date an insane asylum

1500
02:16:26,560 --> 02:16:31,920
you know where they let the the ones that are safe let's say out and people friends and family

1501
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:36,080
come to visit there's always a group of them that don't have any visitors and just sit down and talk

1502
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:41,120
to someone there and within the first few minutes you'll be like this person seems totally fine I

1503
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:45,120
don't know why they're in here and then within the next minute you're like okay I know why you're

1504
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:50,480
in I got it and this is what happens when you go out in public everyone seems fairly normal but

1505
02:16:50,480 --> 02:16:55,200
you start discussing things that we even barely discussed here and you will see how insane the

1506
02:16:55,200 --> 02:17:01,360
world is like like the Persian parable so again if this is the end of the hour I just want to thank

1507
02:17:01,360 --> 02:17:09,040
you Freeman and especially listenership for showing me the better side of humanity thank you so

1508
02:17:09,040 --> 02:17:15,680
much yeah that really really means a lot because that is our goal and guys I got some great shows they're

1509
02:17:15,680 --> 02:17:21,440
going to follow this up just perfectly we got Tim Freak coming your way check him out and Jimmy

1510
02:17:21,440 --> 02:17:26,240
Church oh yeah straight from coast to coast coming to give you the dark side the things that he can't

1511
02:17:26,240 --> 02:17:32,480
talk about while hosting coast to coast he's coming on the free zone and giving us the dark and dirty

1512
02:17:32,480 --> 02:17:37,200
on space so we're gonna get deeper into that we're gonna get into Tim Freak and we're gonna understand

1513
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:42,640
more and more about this consciousness that we're dealing with in the evolution of imagination I

1514
02:17:42,640 --> 02:17:49,680
can't wait it's gonna be awesome so looking for the spirituality in the 21st century and what I'm

1515
02:17:49,680 --> 02:17:56,000
finding right now as my computer is telling me I am about to run out of hard drive space okay so I

1516
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:02,000
guess I need to wrap this up and clean some stuff off of this Mac you know I've had this Macintosh

1517
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:11,360
I bought this thing at Occupy Wall Street at a Starbucks while everybody else was out protesting

1518
02:18:11,360 --> 02:18:17,760
in Wall Street I was in a Starbucks buying this Macintosh and I have had this thing I bought it used

1519
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:25,680
in 2012 and this is all I got folks because I have never made money at this show ever and you know

1520
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:32,960
I'm only now starting to accrue a sense of stability thanks to you and feeling like I have got a platform

1521
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:38,720
to stand on because I've been running on a treadmill this whole time and nine years running and so just

1522
02:18:38,720 --> 02:18:44,960
let you know I'm still working on this this thing's older than 2012 and that's that's how this is

1523
02:18:44,960 --> 02:18:51,760
of my system goes folks so thank you for allowing me to to start to maybe up my game a little bit

1524
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:58,960
because I'm telling you guys this has been grass roots as grass roots as you can get thank god this

1525
02:18:58,960 --> 02:19:04,160
computer was under warranty when I bought it because I bought it off somebody ripped me off so anyway

1528
02:19:14,960 --> 02:19:21,600
necessary we only get to skim the surface here so that you guys can know where to dig deeper and I

1529
