1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,280
All right, so it looks like we're recording and today let's say it's what they call a Sunday

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:16,180
the 21st of January, 2024 on the Pope's work schedule and you recognize the voice as

3
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,840
the Greek and whoever is here is here and whoever will hear it later or will hear it later.

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,660
This is the inertial domain group.

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,280
The reason we call it the inertial domain group is one of the aspects of water treatment

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:36,180
that we're going to be discussing and I put out a call or notice of something like a sonar

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,580
because I wanted to do it for several reasons to catch up with everyone, what I've been doing,

8
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,380
what the state of affairs is and what your interest and how your interest could be used in

9
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,380
it, right?

10
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:53,980
And if you're here you're probably interested and you'll find out if by listening as time

11
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,020
goes on whether you want to be interested or not.

12
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:03,460
So let's just say I'm going to do this backwards, the questions first, if whoever is here,

13
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:09,380
if anyone want to ask a question just chime in, just go ahead, raise your voice, unmute

14
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:16,620
or whatever and before we start let's see if there's anything anyone wants to know.

15
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:24,660
Okay.

16
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,660
Okay.

17
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,580
Lots of crooked noise there.

18
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,580
That's fine.

19
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,580
That's fine.

20
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,580
No, I'm used to it.

21
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,580
That's fine.

22
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,580
Am I hurt?

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,580
Yes, you're hurt?

24
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,580
Go ahead.

25
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,580
Okay.

26
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:42,380
The planetary bodies, earth, Jupiter, etc.

27
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:50,820
You discuss earth being ascentiate being these large creations being beings and last time I

28
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,180
heard you and Chuck discuss gods if you will, Elohim or humanoids.

29
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,180
Yeah.

30
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,940
So what am I trying to ask is Jupiter or these large heavenly bodies?

31
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,540
I don't know how to finish the question.

32
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,540
I'll finish the question.

33
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,020
Are they gods or humans?

34
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,340
They're human, right?

35
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:20,780
That's a simple like if the if the apple is red and the car is red, the apple must be

36
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,780
a car, right?

37
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,860
Because they're both red.

38
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,100
No.

39
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,780
What's going on is we're living in a state of confusion.

40
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,460
So if your mind could physically go back more than two weeks or memory and remember something,

41
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:41,700
it's going to be 10% foggy, 10% confusion and another 10%.

42
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,860
Should I ask this question?

43
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,100
That's just a human condition.

44
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,060
That's just how it might sound like a total asshole by saying that.

45
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,660
But that's just the way we are.

46
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:55,500
So the question you brought up is also in a modern context that anything we hear about, even

47
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:02,940
for me, the Greek in a modern context is still tainted by the society that we live in.

48
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,340
The type of society we live in.

49
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:11,780
And what I mean by tainted is that we were brought up now for more than 150 years that the

50
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,740
ancients were ignorance.

51
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,020
And we're the only ones that are smart, the current people, right?

52
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,580
So we're coming from a tainted point of view.

53
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,420
We have a flawed human perception of things.

54
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,020
So all of these things come together.

55
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,540
Now when I say that gods were human, it's because they all have human traits in the text

56
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,220
that they give us unmistakably, right?

57
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,820
And the planets who knows what's up there, who knows and how it's up there.

58
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:45,580
I've been looking at the planets and all this stuff for very deeply since the 1980s.

59
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,740
I kind of laid off the past decade or two.

60
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,140
But what I found out from old books and things like that is that no one is in agreement to

61
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:59,380
how many planets there are, how big they are, how far away they are, right?

62
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,860
And all the stuff they put out to the public about how big Jupiter is, how far it is, none

63
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:08,780
of it's substantiated, none of it, none of it at all.

64
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,580
So where do we go with this kind of stuff?

65
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,980
Well, we know what we know, which is not a lot, and we have to be happy with it until time

66
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:20,180
goes on and something else, be some knowledge breaks forward.

67
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:28,420
And I'm happy with that.

68
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,420
But thanks for the question, anything else?

69
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,620
Yeah, somebody joined with a slightly noisy mic and was just saying, check, check a few

70
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,740
minutes ago or a few maybe a minute ago.

71
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,740
We're here and you and you're making noise now.

72
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,500
So did you have something you wanted to ask?

73
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,060
I got a chuck, it's all right, man, chill, it's all right.

74
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,300
Okay, I'm just trying to be, it's, I think, no, I got it, it's a public forum, it gets messy.

75
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,820
Okay, so let's, so if that was just that on the water, what I want to get into is if those

76
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,140
that were subs most likely and those that have had personal calls on Skype and other things

77
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:06,500
with me, know that I've been up to something since around April of last year on the Pope's

78
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,820
work schedule.

79
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,340
And that's something is I've put photographs up on this chat group.

80
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:20,000
You will see a photograph, the first photo is almost like a very graphic kind of image,

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,500
a high concept image of what I call the scalerator.

82
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,580
It's a water device.

83
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:32,980
It's a large series of magnets in the middle and pipe goes around the magnets and it's full

84
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,220
disclosure and how it's made.

85
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,820
And the water runs through the pipe, but the key to it working and doing what it does is

86
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:48,900
that what you normally call magnetism, you and everybody else, yes you, which is, hey,

87
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,300
how do I get this piece of paper to stick on the refrigerator?

88
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,300
You got a magnet?

89
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,780
Well, you put the paper between the magnet and the refrigerator door and it sticks, right?

90
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,700
That's how you think about magnets working or when you see them pick up junk cars, right?

91
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,440
You hit a switch, like your magnet picks up a junk car, turns off the power, drops the

92
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
car.

93
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,740
Okay, it's not you, the moment you apply that type of magnetism to the water flow, it stops

94
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,500
working and nothing happens at all.

95
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:23,140
So going back to the inertial domain, if you look at that first, if you scroll up, first

96
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,500
image, this is going to be very image sensitive, by the way.

97
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,660
So if you listen to recordings, I think when Bruce, thank you, Bruce, for setting this

98
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,900
up in the link in the Skype chat.

99
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,540
I know it's not a lot, but I really don't want to do anything like that.

100
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,860
And Bruce, I want to thank Bruce for setting up this group call, technically.

101
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,820
You will be relying on photos and I will be numbering the photos.

102
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,220
So there will be no ambiguity.

103
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,900
The top very top photo is a picture of the device that you would see like in an ad or a

104
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:59,100
promotional piece or what's called a cut sheet in industry.

105
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,020
Number two, now I used a typed in number two on the lower left.

106
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,740
I put an X through that image, which is typically what they show you, magnetic water treatment

107
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,860
is, because that's not what we're going to be discussing.

108
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,020
You don't want to do that.

109
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,180
That is the normal accepted way.

110
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,220
So and then there'll be pictures three, four, five, and on and on and on.

111
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,020
And I'll be probably be using a free hand pen on the photo to put a much larger number

112
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,140
to be even more visual.

113
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,500
But if you go to picture number one, that's the device.

114
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,100
I call the scalerator mark one.

115
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,940
And I call it a mark one because it's a one inch.

116
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:40,500
So two inch would be mark two, the three quarter inches, the mark, point seven, five.

117
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Yes, and it did come up all this on my own, all of it.

118
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:52,340
So if we go to number picture number two, I'm posting what conventional thought of magnetic

119
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,980
water treatment of fluids is.

120
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,780
Now you see a picture there with the north south, south, north, red magnets.

121
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,260
I put an X through it and it's number two.

122
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,060
I'll make the numbers on another photographs more prominent.

123
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,660
And I put an X through it because that is not what we want.

124
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,580
It should be done because it has no effect, very little effect.

125
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,340
When I tell people in the water industry that do sell products that are magnetized, they're

126
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,300
like, what do you mean it has no effect?

127
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,300
Department of energy wrote a paper that if you don't do that, you're an idiot.

128
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,300
I'm like, okay.

129
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,300
All right.

130
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,820
I'll get into the water industry here too.

131
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:32,260
Because when you hear me talk about the water industry, sorry, I really, am I the only one

132
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,900
who doesn't have the access to the pictures because I don't see them.

133
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,260
I would ask if you scroll all the way to the top Bruce and someone joins in later.

134
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,620
Can they also get the photographs that were posted first?

135
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,700
Is there a way to alter the call?

136
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,700
It depends.

137
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,820
It depends on where you're posting them, Greek.

138
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,900
I haven't seen anything come up on my end.

139
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,980
I thought it would, are you sharing screen on your own?

140
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,140
No, I'm on a journal domain.

141
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,900
I could take a screenshot of what I see.

142
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,740
Well, you know the other, you know, I see the pictures in the screen.

143
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:11,100
Yeah, you know, you know, the other one that you're using a record with, Greek, you can

144
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,580
use that and share screen from that computer.

145
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,580
And that way we would see it.

146
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,580
I don't want to do that.

147
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,580
I don't want to do that.

148
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,820
What I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be just putting pictures up in this Skype conversation,

149
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,300
this, this actual call.

150
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,980
And if you get this is, I don't want to start complicating it.

151
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,260
Okay, then you want to repost them into this chat now so that they can be seen because

152
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,060
not everybody can see it.

153
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,780
So what if someone joins in a week?

154
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,300
They won't be able to see them.

155
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,300
They should.

156
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,860
So now that we haven't established call where you're doing this, yeah.

157
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,780
Yeah, they should be able to see it.

158
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:49,500
All right, I'm going to forward it again, the picture number one should see it now.

159
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Now I do.

160
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Yes, there we go.

161
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Yep.

162
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,740
Sorry, just want to make sure everybody.

163
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,620
I'm not going to keep by the way I've had the reason I have to prove because I'm not going

164
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,620
to keep doing this.

165
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,180
I'm not going to keep roasting, roasting, presenting, representing pictures every time.

166
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,380
So I want to make sure that if someone joins in a week and they listen to the recording,

167
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,700
they could scroll off from a week.

168
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,300
They don't see the first pictures in the second pictures, right?

169
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,900
And that only I don't want to get tough because if they say they can't see it, I'll say

170
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,180
to you bad and it'll be Bruce's fault.

171
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,180
Okay.

172
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,340
Thank you for not setting it up with you.

173
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,140
You're welcome.

174
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,340
Yeah.

175
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,900
I am not, you know, I can get into all this by the way until I could be like the best

176
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,940
computer tech you've ever seen, one of the best, but I chose not to because it's not

177
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,940
where I was.

178
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,820
Look, any geek or any nerd can do this stuff.

179
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,860
This is cookie cutter.

180
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,740
That's why when you're going to hear me talk about the people in the water industry and say,

181
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,780
oh man, Greek sounds like he's really hating on them.

182
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,780
No, I'm not.

183
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,100
I'm going to give you the perspective and I'm going to show you things that you normally

184
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:59,020
wouldn't see about them as if I just came to this planet and I saw what's going on.

185
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,660
I can give you such a clear point of view.

186
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,700
And when I bring up certain companies, I'm not going to mention names like natural action

187
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,380
technologies or green field, but anyway, I'll drop links and then I'll show you stuff and

188
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,380
then you'll be okay.

189
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,380
What am I looking for?

190
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,540
And then I'll bring up the points.

191
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,300
You know, be like holy crap.

192
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,300
Right?

193
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,940
So does that make them bad?

194
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,940
No.

195
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,940
Does it make them good?

196
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,180
Definitely not either.

197
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,820
And I'm going to show you what's going on with them.

198
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,380
And there's just those are just two examples because they're the dominant ones on the internet.

199
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,900
And I brought them up because that's more the airy, fairy alternative side of water treatment.

200
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:44,140
The mainstream academic side of water treatment is dead and it's stupid.

201
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:49,820
It's so dumb that you might as well put Fisher price or romper room on the label, right?

202
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,020
I'm talking Harvard University MIT also.

203
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:58,860
By the way, you know, this is not the first time here Greeks speak, but I dare anyone

204
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,940
to not notice what I'm about to say.

205
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:08,940
But go do a YouTube search on new technologies and you'll see a whole slew of videos from MIT

206
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:15,640
students bringing forward these new technologies and it's a bunch of pimply, snotty, eighteen

207
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:21,260
year olds with popsicle sticks and silicone glued together talking about this is some new

208
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,900
technology and you got to laugh your ass out.

209
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,820
People look at this and you should see the comments.

210
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,820
Oh, wow.

211
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,900
They're making fun of you.

212
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,900
Meaning society.

213
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,820
That's what they're putting in front.

214
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,220
And what I just said, you cannot unsee it once you see it.

215
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,180
Go look at all the new technology videos.

216
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:44,900
They showing you 18 or 19 year old pimply, snotty, MIT students with popsicle sticks.

217
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,700
Third grade science crap.

218
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,340
And telling you, this is how they're doing the new nano stuff and whatever.

219
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,500
They're making fun of you.

220
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
There is nothing.

221
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
You're not getting anything.

222
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,940
You're not getting any new technology at all.

223
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,380
Give me an example.

224
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,460
I like to make fun of people who still have hard drives because you shouldn't because

225
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,740
you should be made fun of if you have something with a hard drive because back in 1983, I

226
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,980
went out and bought an 18T answering machine because it didn't have a cassette.

227
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,020
It had a solid state drive.

228
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,020
I don't know.

229
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,620
Bruce, you probably remember that and you had answering machines instead of the cassette

230
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,620
getting messed up.

231
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,620
It was solid state.

232
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,620
No cassette.

233
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,620
OK.

234
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,420
That means that solid state drives existed for the public to buy even though it was $40

235
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,340
or an answering machine of $400 in today's money.

236
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,020
It was still available in 1982.

237
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:37,220
40 years later, plus you're still using a hard drive, you should be made fun of because that

238
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,220
technology was around 40 years ago.

239
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,060
Why are you making it demand for it?

240
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:48,460
Do you know that spinning a hard drive in any device is tantamount to 1950s technology?

241
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,300
It's not any different than watching a 1950s sci-fi when they show you a computer and they

242
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,500
show you the big reels of tape go back and forth, it spits out a piece of paper with holes in

243
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
it.

244
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
It's ridiculous.

245
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,780
So you're being made fun of and I hate that because why?

246
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:09,060
I'm not the type of person when I was younger or older, got kicks out of making fun of stupid

247
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,060
people.

248
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,100
I hate that.

249
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,900
You know, I saw people pick on other people that were dumb.

250
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,300
I said, don't do that.

251
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,100
You think they want to be dumb?

252
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,100
Right?

253
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:27,100
So when I see that happening today in industry and society all around that really pisses me off.

254
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,100
There's a text question in the chat.

255
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,100
I don't know if you saw it.

256
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,100
All right, I'll get to it.

257
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,100
No, I'll get to it.

258
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,100
Thanks.

259
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,100
So let's see.

260
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,100
So what I want to get into, first of course, is any questions.

261
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,380
And the second thing I want to get into is why I wanted to get the seminar together to

262
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,860
put out because I'm ready to put out an effort.

263
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,860
And before you do something, if you think you might want to work with other people, it's

264
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,460
good to figure that out before you start and then look for them, right?

265
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:05,420
But if you put out a statement or a desire and then with other people and they don't fulfill

266
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,380
it, well, now you know, there's no question.

267
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,780
You have to do it on your own, right?

268
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,420
So if you say, listen, there's this dragon coming to eat our children next week.

269
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,420
Who's going to join me to go fight it?

270
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,180
Well, a whole bunch of people say, let's go.

271
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,260
Well, you have a scenario because you've got five people.

272
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,220
Okay, so we need five swords, five, right?

273
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,720
Axes, right?

274
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Whatever, whatever.

275
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,420
But if no one comes and you're the only one that's going to go fight it, you're like, fuck.

276
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,420
Okay, now I need an axe.

277
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,420
I need a sword.

278
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,420
I can't take, I don't have to take five of them.

279
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,420
Right?

280
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,660
I can only wield one or two at this one time.

281
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,660
What do I, now I have to, you know, I got nobody.

282
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,180
Watch my back.

283
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,060
So what if this dragon whips his tail around me?

284
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,060
What do I do?

285
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,900
So now that's the whole scenario, it changes, right?

286
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,700
So that's why I'm doing this now because it's always good to pick something in life that

287
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,700
you're going to focus on.

288
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,300
Not the only thing you're going to do.

289
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,580
And then put a little bit of an effort and I haven't done something like that in over

290
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,820
20 years, the last actually 25 years.

291
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:08,220
Last time I did something like this was when I started a bike shop in New York City.

292
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,500
I really put all of my effort and all of my consciousness and everything just fell into place.

293
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,860
It was great.

294
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:19,340
And with this, this is even more noteworthy because this is not only something that has to

295
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,620
do with water treatment.

296
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,860
It has to do with physics.

297
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,940
It is a new physics.

298
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,020
It's not like Greeks getting into the water business.

299
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:31,700
No, we're in the physics business now, baby, because there's not a physics, I assure you,

300
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,980
there's not a physicist spell that F-I-Z-Z-Y-S-I-S-T.

301
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:38,540
They're very busy.

302
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,300
If they're academic physicists forget it, they're just having to stand by the door.

303
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,300
That's about...

304
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,300
By the way, the academic physicists is how they operate their whole lives.

305
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,700
Once they get a degree, they have to find a place working in a corporation.

306
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,140
And the corporations accommodate the academics.

307
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:01,340
They have a little area where the number of employees depends on how big the corporation,

308
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,660
some corporations could hire a thousand of them.

309
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:09,020
And they sit in the corporation, I do various tasks, you know, review this, whatever, whatever,

310
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,260
whatever, in their own little contained self-contained environment.

311
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,100
And the only other contact they have is with other academics physicists that are sitting

312
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,500
in a similar environment in another corporation or a government.

313
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:28,740
So they have this little self-contained society within a corporation or a government, and

314
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,580
they're very safe.

315
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,140
They all pat each other on the back.

316
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,540
They know absolutely nothing at all.

317
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,740
As a matter of fact, they've never built anything, they can't build anything, they have no creativity,

318
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,540
how it can back to, can you name anything that was built by someone with an academic that

319
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,260
you're as useful, no, you cannot.

320
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,220
It's not possible because it's the way that it is.

321
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,740
So am I hating on them?

322
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,740
No.

323
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,780
Am I giving you the objective truth about it?

324
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,780
Absolutely.

325
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,780
Right?

326
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:00,780
And this is across the board.

327
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,260
Look, I've even tried this scenario out in the pizza parlor today.

328
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,260
Everybody was laughing.

329
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,740
Yeah, we can't think of a damn thing any academic ever came up with.

330
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,500
So all right.

331
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,140
So I wanted to just bring this up again.

332
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,380
It's a long introduction that this is something very important.

333
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,940
But to say that it's more important in physics is irrelevant because now we're going to be

334
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,100
leaning towards the academic moronic side and that doesn't help people at all.

335
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,540
So let's just see what, I don't know.

336
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,940
See, do I have something in the chat, a question?

337
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,140
What size magnet and photo number one?

338
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,380
Oh, OK, that's a five and a quarter inch.

339
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:41,220
I will drop a link.

340
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,460
Let me show you the exact, let's do this.

341
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:52,580
What I will do, George, is I'm going to open a file here and I'm going to do a screenshot

342
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,020
of the exact magnet where you can get it and how much it costs and everything.

343
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,020
Is that all right?

344
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,580
Yeah, this is all about full disclosure.

345
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,620
Yeah, it's great.

346
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,860
So I'll show you exact supplier, everything about it.

347
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:12,100
OK, the model number and how much I pay for it and everything.

348
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,620
Here we go.

349
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:37,100
Oh, there we go.

350
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:45,260
Now, the thing here is about, I think also in the last Sonic I talked about how disgusting

351
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,740
truth 3D printed things are to me.

352
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,900
It would be like giving a rabbi a piece of pork.

353
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,700
You don't do, you know, just out of courtesy.

354
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,780
So you know how I feel about it.

355
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,140
But everybody loves pork, right?

356
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,100
But not a rabbi, right?

357
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,420
So I'm not a rabbi, but I know I don't need pork, but here's the idea.

358
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:10,500
You show me anything 3D printed and it's like showing a rabbi or vampire a garlic order.

359
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,700
It's garbage to me.

360
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:18,020
There is some aspects of 3D printing that are good.

361
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,100
I said some aspects, but not in this.

362
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,100
If you have to 3D print this, you got problems.

363
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:29,220
This is totally, it's like saying, I don't know if you guys are familiar with the watch industry.

364
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:35,380
People are very much still up on collecting old sacoes, tag cures, patek philips.

365
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,540
That's not more of a collection item.

366
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:43,780
That's more of a status symbol or Rolex is more of a status symbol again.

367
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:49,220
But imagine saying someone, you could go do a, by the way, a browser search and go to

368
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,740
images, a patek philip watch, go browser search and look what the inside of that watch looks

369
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,740
like.

370
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,820
How exciting do you think it would be to someone who develops those watches that you're going

371
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,860
to 3D print one?

372
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,300
You'll throw up right in your lap.

373
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:08,540
You'll be like, get out of here, disgusting human.

374
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,740
Look at the workmanship and all that.

375
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,860
So this is again the academics do that.

376
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,860
Everything 3D printed.

377
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,060
By the way, everyone that I've worked with so far was touting 3D printing.

378
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,460
So, does that make them bad?

379
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,460
No, but does it make them good?

380
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:30,460
Definitely not, not for this.

381
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,540
All right, so before I go on, I know there's a question about the magnet.

382
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,740
I'm just going to go on which direction?

383
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,260
Anybody want to plug in?

384
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:43,020
Do you want to hear first my experience with the water industry and what they're all

385
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,020
about?

386
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,780
You can, if you presume that it's shit, you've presumed well, so maybe we could bypass

387
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,780
the whole thing.

388
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,980
So, we can get into details from experience for six months.

389
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:59,020
We can bypass it or we can get into how this started and how we discovered.

390
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:04,580
We have a fork in the road, so anybody want to give some feedback on that?

391
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,620
I'd be glad to take it.

392
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:16,180
I was just going to ask, when you say those images are escalated, Mark 1, is that in, are

393
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,180
you referring to the diameter of the tube?

394
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,620
Yes, of the pipe, the conduit.

395
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,620
Okay.

396
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:29,260
Yeah, so that is what we call a 1 inch or 25.4 millimeter, 2.5 centimeter metric.

397
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:38,100
If you were a 2 inch, you know, a 50 mil pipe, it would be the Mark 2.

398
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,740
The Mark 3 would be a 3 inch pipe.

399
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,220
Yeah, and we can make them that large.

400
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,540
We can make them that large.

401
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,100
It's not a big deal.

402
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,260
The magnet size becomes a big deal, but I figured that out.

403
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,780
We'll get into that, that's very advanced.

404
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,780
We'll get into that later.

405
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,740
What I want to get into more now is by experiencing the past six months with the water industry

406
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:03,460
or how it all started and how it can transfer that information to you to answer any questions

407
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,980
that you might have or bypass one, bypass the other, not talk about one or not talk about

408
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,580
both, whatever.

409
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,820
But the important thing here is what I want to keep, and I will keep referring to, the

410
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:20,460
only way I see this going down, down the line and being developed is with people that are

411
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,860
workmen and true workmanship.

412
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:29,020
This is more in the line of a device that you would reckon as a fine set of golf clubs,

413
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:36,300
a fine racing bicycle, a fine umbrella, a fine watch, right?

414
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:40,100
Now I went and bought a fine set of golf clubs and they're 3D printed.

415
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:46,420
Would you lay them down here so my dog could take a crap bottom?

416
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,380
How does that sound?

417
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,500
None of that stuff applies here.

418
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,780
If you have an inkling that this thing has to be 3D printed somewhere or another, you're

419
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,620
going to piss me off to leave the call.

420
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,660
It's not that it's bad, but it's definitely not good.

421
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:06,420
I keep saying that is a Greek so judgmental, is 3D printing bad?

422
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,620
You know, there is some 3D printing that can be done that is nest and necessities, but

423
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:16,060
once people start going like geeks, like Eric Dollar says, to the computer to 3D print

424
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:21,100
everything that they could actually improve their human quality by actually practicing some

425
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:26,300
skills and developing a pipe bending skill, jumping to a 3D printer for that, I have no

426
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,780
respect for you as a human anymore.

427
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,620
You can be replaced by the machine that you're going to.

428
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,540
Why do I need you?

429
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,020
I should just go directly to the 3D printing machine.

430
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,020
You see what I'm saying?

431
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:45,220
If people that you meet are constantly giving up, progressing their own talents for having

432
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:50,020
a machine do it, why do I even need them?

433
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,020
Bypass them.

434
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,700
They go right to the machine that they're using.

435
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,140
I don't need them at all.

436
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,140
You see?

437
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:59,340
So this is more of a human thing that I'd like to maintain.

438
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,220
Again, imagine someone that collects fine watches and you say, "Oh, yeah, I have a 3D

439
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,940
printed version of your Patek Philippe."

440
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:13,660
By the way, if anyone doesn't know what Patek Philippe is, put in Patek P-A-T-E-K Philippe

441
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,340
and go to images.

442
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:22,020
Could you imagine someone who is an enthusiastic collector of these is presented with someone

443
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,020
that says I want a 3D print that?

444
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,540
You put it on the floor so I could take a crap on it.

445
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,020
I'd document it, a crap on it too.

446
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,620
Now, this is the level of humanity that we're at right now.

447
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,340
I want to avoid that, like the plague, completely.

448
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,500
Stay go the opposite direction.

449
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,300
And Vandy, you just asked about the Mark I and all that.

450
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,700
And I want to commend you also for making efforts on bending Pipe and all that.

451
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,220
And we will get into that.

452
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,980
I have developed several techniques on how to be masterful in bending pipes and having

453
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,860
them stay thermally stable and how to bend them with precision.

454
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,700
And there's nothing online about it at all.

455
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,180
I mean, the fine points that I will discuss.

456
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,900
I'm the only one that's able to do that seemingly.

457
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:07,500
There's some other monkey somewhere, I'm sure, but he's not talking like I am.

458
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:17,740
So this I would like to stay and see, define more of a high level handcraft.

459
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:23,300
To me, I'm beginning to sound like I'm I harken back from the 70s and 80s and a lot of musicians

460
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:26,540
were complaining about drum machines.

461
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,820
Now we didn't need all the machines in the synthesizers.

462
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,060
Now we don't have musicians anymore, right?

463
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:38,540
But that didn't work out that way because if you look at new movies, film scores, they still

464
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:42,180
use 100 piece orchestras, right?

465
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:48,540
If you asked me in the 80s, 40 years from now, would people still be using hiring, you know,

466
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:54,180
like John Williams making a film score for a new sci-fi cowboy movie?

467
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,020
Would he be employing 120 piece orchestra?

468
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:01,500
I would say definitely not 40 years ago, but guess what?

469
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,900
40 years later, they still are, right?

470
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:09,420
So there's no reason to get my panties in a twist about everybody around me wanting a 3D

471
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,060
print stuff because that will go away.

472
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:16,260
But right now it's, I see it as an obstruction and an annoyance.

473
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,420
So I don't know if I think I'll leave that subject alone.

474
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,020
But thank you for putting that up.

475
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:29,900
If you go to, actually, I'll do a quick, and feel free anyone to post an image, and I do

476
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,100
have some texts here.

477
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,340
Okay, I assume there is a particular number of magnets are in the array.

478
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:37,100
Yes, we'll get into that water industry first, please.

479
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,300
A bit of history also.

480
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,500
Find like a musical instrument.

481
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,900
Yes.

482
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:48,820
Now if you go to the images in a protect fleet, you could look at the back of one and

483
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:54,900
I'll put an image in just to satisfy what my desire and my was to say about it.

484
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:59,060
I put a link in also Greek.

485
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:02,700
Yeah, I'd rather just do images than links, by the way.

486
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,660
I would just suggest that because links get really messy and take you away from the page,

487
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,660
right?

488
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,420
But when you have an image, you could click on it and it expands and still keeps you

489
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,020
on the Skype group.

490
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,700
Yeah, I want to avoid links.

491
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:21,020
I even though I do put them up, just too many links and we start, that's fine.

492
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:26,860
Protect fleet, okay, and if you go to images.

493
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:32,740
On the back inside, I'll just put in, protect fleet inside, and I'll post an image to give

494
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,900
you an idea of what I'm talking about.

495
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:54,140
So, the water industry, we do have someone up for the water industry.

496
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,140
Great.

497
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,140
I want to get into it.

498
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:00,980
I said, I wouldn't have going to mention names like natural action technologies or Greenfield.

499
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:04,180
You know, I'm famous for doing that, right?

500
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:06,180
So I'll mention, they're both the same.

501
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,620
Okay, I'll start off with this.

502
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,300
They're not bad people, but are they good people?

503
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,940
No, they're not good people.

504
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,860
In my opinion, some other people's opinion.

505
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,060
I could tell you what's going on.

506
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,820
You could look them up.

507
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:25,660
You could find out what they're doing and they're exactly the same, but they're very different.

508
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:30,340
They're both try to be honorable and I'll get to the last part first.

509
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:36,500
This is more of the airy, fairly structured water side of the water industry.

510
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,660
Not the mainstream water industry, which is all chemicals and just big filtration and

511
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,660
RO.

512
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:45,980
I brought them up because they're more of the alternative side where they're not going

513
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,700
to run and ask you directly, where is your degree from?

514
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:57,540
We are you an engineer, like a company like Pentech or Haliburton would or other companies

515
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,940
that are into big water treatment, right?

516
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,460
So I brought up the two airy, fairly side ones where there's this thing called structure

517
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,420
water that was made more popular.

518
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,860
You guys probably heard of it.

519
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,900
What they do is they both run 2013.

520
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:14,340
There's this character, I call them a character because I can't watch more than 30 seconds

521
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,540
of his mug.

522
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,540
Clayton Nolte.

523
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,980
I never met the guy, I'm nothing against them.

524
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:25,380
I just basically he took a bunch of golf balls through him in a TPC pipe, ran water through

525
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,820
and say this is natural action for water, right?

526
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,660
And it was a big craze, everyone jumped on it.

527
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:37,260
These people started companies, these two people, two companies that I mentioned.

528
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,980
Nothing special.

529
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:43,900
Both people with some corporate background, cookie cutter, corporate cutouts, very easy.

530
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,840
If any, you want to start a company, you could be 40, 50, 30 years old, nine years old or

531
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,100
18 years old, doesn't matter.

532
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,820
The world, the fractional reserve banking system is ready for you.

533
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,300
There's ready.

534
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,660
Tell someone I want to start a company.

535
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,100
Oh, you got to get a lawyer.

536
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,500
And you got to get an accountant and they're both set up that way, cookie cutter, corporate

537
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,260
cutout, they're enslaved to the fractional banking system.

538
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,820
They don't know anything about money.

539
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,860
They don't know anything about business, anything about, you know, whatever they do, whatever

540
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,620
the account and say, whatever the lawyer says, they think they're good lawyers and they

541
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,340
think they're are good accountants.

542
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,340
They don't know.

543
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,340
There's no such thing.

544
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:24,900
There's competent lawyers and incompetent ones, but there's no such thing as a good lawyer.

545
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,780
And there's competent accountants and incompetent accountants.

546
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,780
There's no such thing as a good accountant.

547
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,100
Okay, so that's the more of the Greek speak side by being harsh yet.

548
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,260
No, being accurate, extremely so.

549
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,980
What they do though is they sell devices.

550
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:44,660
You can go on their websites, both of them, which I think are very tacky and I've worked

551
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,900
with both.

552
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:51,060
And you will find out that they offer these area ferry devices that, you know, air may

553
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,060
not work.

554
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:56,420
Basically, it's tubes in a golf balls in a tube and the water flows over these flow

555
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,260
forms, supposed to in live in the water.

556
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,220
Now, depends on which way the wind is blowing that day, that device might make the water

557
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,220
better or not.

558
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,220
Right?

559
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,220
And I'm laughing because that's true.

560
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:12,500
Now, one of the, they have two things that, they keep them in business, both of these companies.

561
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:19,100
Two things that keep them in business is one, the perception of good customer service,

562
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,660
meaning like if the, if you get the device and 99% of the time that you'll notice no

563
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,380
difference, they will give you all your money back.

564
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,820
No questions asked and take the device back.

565
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,820
Right?

566
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,460
So, do they get 99% of the devices returned?

567
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:38,180
No, about maybe 30% or more because most people don't care.

568
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,980
Even though some of them are $3,000 or $4,000.

569
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:46,980
The other thing that keeps them in business is that they sell water filters because they

570
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,660
have to sell something that actually does something.

571
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,660
Right?

572
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,140
A water filter is a screen.

573
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,780
It is a mechanical filter.

574
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,300
It will do something.

575
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,300
Right?

576
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,300
Every time.

577
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,860
It's to, based on its specifications.

578
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:05,100
It doesn't mean the water is going to taste better though.

579
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:11,620
I have had water run through various filtration types, media systems, whatever, you name it.

580
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:16,420
And they tout these filters as cleaning the water down to .1 micron without our row or this

581
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,140
or that treatment and that.

582
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,740
And the water tastes like crap.

583
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,740
It really does.

584
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:28,700
In other words, I've gone through places in the East Coast and just turned on the tap.

585
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:33,940
I can clean New York or upstate New York, just turned on the regular tap and the water tastes

586
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:39,100
better than these going through these filters because I, through long discussion, one day

587
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,260
I will get into water does not like to be micro filtered and it doesn't like to be

588
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,780
steam distilled.

589
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,780
Right?

590
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,660
So, we will let you know by tasting like crap.

591
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:56,060
So these companies, what they do is this is the alternative water business, the airy fairy,

592
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,500
the alternative.

593
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,780
They sell water filters to keep them in and they hope they want to sell the water filters

594
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,020
because it either works or it doesn't.

595
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:08,980
They sell these basically flow form things that don't work most of the time.

596
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,740
Actually, it's very subjective.

597
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:14,180
Some people say they work other people don't.

598
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:19,940
Now the irony when I came in is the scalerator, the Mark one, compared to what they're doing

599
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,820
even the filters is like a baseball bat across the head.

600
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,820
Does it work?

601
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,500
Are you fucking kidding me?

602
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:32,260
This is like your house is built near a mountain side and you come home one day and the

603
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:36,260
boulder just went through your roof and it's in your living room.

604
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,060
Obviously, does it work?

605
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,100
Crazy, does it work?

606
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:47,900
The thing about the scalerator that they've tried is that it must follow certain directions

607
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,380
in installation and I'm going to bounce around here.

608
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,260
This is again the experience with the water industry.

609
00:34:53,260 --> 00:35:00,900
Now one lab, this is the non airy fairy side, they took the thing and tested it.

610
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,260
They put it on the end of a water source like a nozzle just like you would have a nozzle

611
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:10,820
on a garden hose and it showed absolutely no change in the water.

612
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,220
But guess what?

613
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,620
It's not supposed to be used that way.

614
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:21,380
By the way, when I dreamt this up before any of them were even built or a pipe was ever

615
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:25,620
wrapped around, I had seen that it will reduce the TDS extremely.

616
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:30,200
It will change the water quality in many, many ways and it would be, before I even built

617
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,700
a unit.

618
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:36,940
So by the way, when I told people build this and it will reduce the TDS, I had not yet

619
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,500
take any TDS measurements but I was so confident that it would.

620
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,020
How could I do that?

621
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:52,620
But anyway, the lab showed, I'll post a screenshot, no change in the water, all these parameters.

622
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:57,740
And I said, well that's not, it's supposed to have at least 10 to 50 feet of runner length

623
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,740
in front of the unit.

624
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:06,300
If you don't know what that means, if you have a 100 foot length of hose, the device should

625
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,980
go in the middle of the hose, you have 50 feet behind it, 50 feet in front of it, or you

626
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,180
could put the whole 100 feet in front of it.

627
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,300
But don't put the device on the end of the 100 foot hose like a nozzle and water your

628
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,300
garden.

629
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,140
It will not do anything.

630
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:22,580
It needs runner length in order to work.

631
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:27,860
This is very anti-material, anti-mechanical thinking, right?

632
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:34,020
Because if I have a filter or one of these airy, fairy flow form things, you know, you put

633
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,220
it on the end like a nozzle.

634
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,220
It's going to work.

635
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,820
If you put a filter on the end of a hose or at the beginning of the hose, it doesn't matter.

636
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,340
It's going to filter wherever it is, right?

637
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,460
This is very, very, very location sensitive.

638
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:51,220
It reminds me very much of the Joseph Newman machine where he was able to do 800%, you know,

639
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,060
eight times more energy output.

640
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,820
And whoever tested it, he said, do not ground the device.

641
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,860
Because if you ground the device, that extra 700% goes under this into the ground.

642
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,860
And what did they do?

643
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,860
Oh, your device doesn't work.

644
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,860
Did you ground it?

645
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:05,860
Did you ground it?

646
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,860
Did I told you not to ground it?

647
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,860
Right?

648
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,940
So we have to, you know, you could still ground it.

649
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:14,220
You can still do safety parameters without grounding.

650
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,140
But anyway, they just didn't want to do it.

651
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:21,540
So whoever takes this device, I had another academic and an engineer do say, it doesn't do

652
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,540
anything.

653
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,540
I built it, it doesn't do anything.

654
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,540
I said, show me a picture.

655
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,540
You didn't.

656
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,060
You just see it on the end of a hose like a nozzle.

657
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,580
You know, it's not supposed to work that way.

658
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:32,060
I spent past month discussing whether it's not supposed to go that way.

659
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,060
What are you doing?

660
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,740
Oh, but I thought, I thought it would go right.

661
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,340
I'm like, okay, all right.

662
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,340
So, okay.

663
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:44,500
So, you know, while all this was going on in the back of my mind months ago, I'm thinking,

664
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:50,020
you know, one day, probably in late winter, you know, or early spring, I'm going to do a seminar

665
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,060
and talk about all this.

666
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,060
Right?

667
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,380
This is about us thinking six months ago.

668
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,620
Here we are.

669
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,620
Right?

670
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,420
So I'm so glad it's very important.

671
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,620
So I'm going to take a pause right there.

672
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,620
Now, I can get a, by the way, I can get it.

673
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:06,980
So I can get into more of the conventional water industry, but what I just told you about

674
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,460
them using it, they will not follow directions.

675
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,220
They say, we test devices.

676
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:15,740
We bring the water source to the device and we do not add anything after the device.

677
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,740
That's how we test things.

678
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,380
Fuck you if you don't like it.

679
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,940
And they refuse to do it any other way.

680
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,900
And that's the, that's the regular water engineer.

681
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:26,900
Right?

682
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,460
So there's not much to talk about them.

683
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,220
They're just as useless as the rest, but in another way.

684
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:37,500
Now, let me get a little more on how the, the airy fairy side, the structured water ones

685
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,140
are not useful either, a little bit more.

686
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,420
They don't follow directions either.

687
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:48,580
I'll put in some photographs of installations that were done by one of them and they're both

688
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,980
incorrect.

689
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,540
They did not follow protocol.

690
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,260
But guess what?

691
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,900
It still worked, not as well, but it still worked.

692
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,420
And one of them, both of them, were not the right application.

693
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:07,100
And one of the applications, I was so upset when I found out what they were trying to do

694
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,020
with the device.

695
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,380
I said, if I knew that, I wouldn't be talking to you.

696
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:17,660
I would go out to San Diego and decelinate the entire fucking Pacific Ocean.

697
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,660
Right?

698
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:22,380
This is how ridiculous it gets, right?

699
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:28,460
So in other words, they thought for some reason they could decelinate, salinated, well water

700
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,940
with it.

701
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,780
I never made such a claim.

702
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,820
And it did not have any runner length in front of it.

703
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,860
It was right in the utility, a remote drop of photo.

704
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,780
And the unit was spent a month in the back of a pickup truck being kicked around in the

705
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:45,020
support tabs that fall off and I wasn't told about it.

706
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:48,500
So this is the type of, so are these people bad?

707
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,540
No, but are they good?

708
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:54,020
I'll let you answer that.

709
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,020
See?

710
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,620
So again, this was months ago and I said one day, pretty soon, a few months, I'm going

711
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,100
to organize a Skype seminar group and talk about this.

712
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,100
Right?

713
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,700
So this is where we are so far with that.

714
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:14,540
I'm going to take a pause and have some coffee if anybody wants to ask anything.

715
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:21,340
Is it scalable, Greek, the runner length and the size of the magnet?

716
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,340
Mm-hmm.

717
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:27,380
It is.

718
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,180
It's very scalable.

719
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:33,540
But I can't say, it's like cooking rice.

720
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,540
You know when you get a rice recipe, it's usually for someone making it for themselves or

721
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,020
a family.

722
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,820
But if you go to a mess where you're going to cook for a thousand sailors on a ship, you

723
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,740
don't use a pot that you would use for cooking for five.

724
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,820
We use a big bat, right?

725
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:52,100
For a thousand P50 rice, a thousand cups of rice, right?

726
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,100
At least.

727
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:57,220
Well, what happens then is it's scalable, yes, but the proportions changed, don't they?

728
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,460
It's no more one to one.

729
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,140
Of course.

730
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:03,580
Yeah, you have to change it because something takes place, something takes hold, even the

731
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,780
same rice.

732
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,260
When you get to a certain scale, certain things change.

733
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,260
So is it scalable?

734
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:13,980
Yes, I've scaled them not too much larger because the liability, for me to go, I would rather

735
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,460
do the one inch ones right now, the smaller ones in the three quarter, then go to some

736
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:23,100
place that has a two inch line and, right, the liability because if you build a two inch

737
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:29,100
diameter one, which is four times the one inch in volume and rate, and you install

738
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,500
it somewhere and there's a problem where it's ineffective.

739
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:36,140
That's a lot invested because the two inch lines are not some, you know, they're much more

740
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,940
serious than a one inch line, right?

741
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:44,900
So I'd rather keep, I'd like to see at least a hundred of them out there in the three quarter

742
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,460
one inch models gathered data.

743
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,100
They have to be properly installed.

744
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:53,780
Now that's what I'm doing now is I've halted sending these out to anyone.

745
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:58,580
Whether it's a mainstream lab people, the airy, fairy structured water people or someone

746
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:03,700
that wants one, no, no, all of them from now on, at least for the next six months or a year,

747
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,180
are going to be done by me here locally within driving distance.

748
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,500
Driving distance is, I'll drive a few hours to you.

749
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:15,020
I'll drive even four hours to you, 200 mile radius from Tucson.

750
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,260
That's all, that's the only one.

751
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:20,580
And I'll put in some testimonials of one and one last one that went in last week.

752
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:26,020
The woman just can't stop mentioning how she had problems with her hair and skin and

753
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,020
water filter is in immediately.

754
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,880
As soon as we put the device in immediately, a minute later, everything she just went and

755
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,380
washed everything was sparkling.

756
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,780
The water tasted better right out of the tap.

757
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,100
Her hair and skin the same day started improving.

758
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,300
Now it's been less than a week and it's way better.

759
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,420
She's like, this is magic.

760
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,500
This is not a scalerator.

761
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,580
This is magical, right?

762
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,300
Because this is Tucson, hard water, right?

763
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,420
Now Vandy, he's been doing stuff.

764
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,220
He's been putting pictures and all that.

765
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,580
And it's rainwater tanks, right?

766
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:56,460
And if you're still on, you could chime in.

767
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,460
And that water is not hard water.

768
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:01,540
And if you want to just tell us a little bit of the improvements of quality or maybe not

769
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:06,900
noticeable because your water is pretty clean other than some algae in the tank, right?

770
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:18,580
Yes, but I have been using the scalerator on the mains in my house because I don't have,

771
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:33,660
I've got pretty good rainwater and TDS on the rainwater was about 59 and I made a single

772
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:38,380
magnet set up with the three magnets like in the pictures that you posted.

773
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:44,900
I've got 16mm feed line.

774
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,380
It's a high pressure poly line.

775
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:54,340
And I have, it's approximately, I'm trying to think in feed.

776
00:43:54,340 --> 00:44:05,580
It's about five meters from my mains tap and then I've got another 10 or 15 meters to my

777
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,500
house.

778
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,780
And I haven't tasted it because I don't drink tap water.

779
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:24,100
But I've noticed that it makes the water feel very slippery like a wash is better.

780
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:35,340
Yes, it washes better, but also like I do, I do biodynamic gardening and you stir your water,

781
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,340
you vortex your water.

782
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:41,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can put little droppings from a horn that you store in a horn and all

783
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,140
the other two, yeah.

784
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,140
Exactly.

785
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:49,620
But when you stir your water, you'll notice that after a couple of minutes, the texture

786
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,020
of the water becomes silky on your skin.

787
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,700
Yeah, it's more friendly as opposed to angry water.

788
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:03,980
Yeah, and so the water out of my tap feels very much silky like the vortex water and that's

789
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:11,220
the one thing that I noticed as well as the TDS dropped from before I put the, before

790
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:19,460
I put the on the mains line, it was coming out of my tap between like 79 and 95 and now it

791
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:28,940
comes out pretty much consistently at about between between 60 and 70.

792
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:34,300
But I did notice, I noted down how you said it needs running length.

793
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,300
Yeah, after the unit.

794
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:42,580
Actually, more after, more after, but you're good, but you don't have to consider that much

795
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:46,260
before the unit because the water is coming from somewhere either a container or another

796
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,140
line and the container will suffice.

797
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:53,940
But after the unit is important, the more runner length after the unit, even a kilometer

798
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,500
would make it even more effective.

799
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:59,260
I found that I'm not taking it to that limit though.

800
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:04,500
So, well, I noticed, I've got a, I've got a, a garden tap that is, um,

801
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:13,220
it's only about two feet from the, the scale orator and the water comes out of that at,

802
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:22,380
at, at a higher TDS than it does in my house, which is, you know, how much is that?

803
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:25,180
How much should the reduction?

804
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:26,180
How much reduction?

805
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:34,460
Yeah, it's about, it's about 74 out of the tap that's close to the scale orator and it's

806
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:39,260
usually between 60 and 70 out of my kitchen sink.

807
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,260
Okay.

808
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:44,500
Yeah, so it is considerable because what I've noticed with the TDS, now there's a question

809
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,500
here from Andrew.

810
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:50,260
I heard the Hunza have lived, have, have longer healthier lives than use glacier melt water,

811
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,780
which minerals also, the deterian depleted.

812
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:59,020
This is affect the block wall change, okay, and get some material stuff here.

813
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,020
Mineral infused.

814
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:07,700
Is there general health? Yes, there are. What this is before we get into the material aspects,

815
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,900
thank you, Vandy.

816
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,340
The material aspects of it or anything like that.

817
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:17,460
This is not a, right now we're going to be talking about the inertial domain, the energetic

818
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,460
parts.

819
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:25,300
What we've done here is discovered, I say we, right in the collective, that if we go

820
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:30,780
back to the first photo and below the second photo that's marked number two, I show that's

821
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:37,100
a typical scientific or promotional picture of how you should impose the center part of a

822
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:42,180
magnet on a water flow, whether you alternate them, it doesn't matter if it's the same North Pole,

823
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:48,180
North Pole, or alternating or South Pole, South Pole, that convection is wrong.

824
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:51,860
It will not yield, yields mixed results.

825
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:54,860
I've had good results with just facing a magnet to the water.

826
00:47:54,860 --> 00:48:00,100
If it's constantly recirculating in a tank, it will reduce the scale, but it will not improve

827
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,140
the water quality or anything.

828
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:06,300
The point that I'm making here and have been making for almost a year now since April

829
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:15,220
of last year is that I'm the first one to wrap the pipe or the fluid flow around the part

830
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,500
of the magnet that everyone is ignoring.

831
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:23,300
It's like I'm the first guy to date the ugly chick in the class, right?

832
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,260
Nobody wants to date her, so I ask her out for the problem.

833
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,580
What balls the Greek has, right?

834
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:33,500
So the best looking guy in the class asks out the worst looking girl.

835
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,140
Go figure, right?

836
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,540
This is exactly what's going on with the scalerator.

837
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:42,260
There is nothing written about the block wall, the domain wall, the needle wall, as a matter

838
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,820
of fact, it is a stepchild kind of part of science.

839
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,940
It is completely ignored.

840
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:56,100
Whereas this poor bastard Felix Block in 1946 wrote a paper about nuclear, I could post

841
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,260
it here.

842
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:02,420
It's a PDF, nuclear resonance, basically.

843
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:06,780
It's here, I won't post it.

844
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:11,940
1946, nuclear induction, F block, Felix Block.

845
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:17,900
So the block wall, the section of a magnet, where one field stops and the other one ends

846
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,260
which is the equilibrium part of the magnet.

847
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:25,700
You want to know more about that, by the way, Ken Wheeler, the fat ugly monkey guy, you

848
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:30,940
call it, I think he says so, the ugly monkey podcast or live stream, he does.

849
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:37,540
There's a video on there that he's put in Ken Wheeler through theory, papacis, block wall.

850
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:41,580
He has a video and he makes fun of how dumb humans are and all that.

851
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:45,500
And he mentions what the block wall is according to his findings.

852
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:49,380
But there is a paper by Felix Block, it's called nuclear induction.

853
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:56,020
You could look it up, July 19, 1946, very pedantic, whatever talks about, you know, because they

854
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:58,660
name that part of the magnet after him.

855
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:04,220
Now there's also the Neal wall, but neither one is true because it's not a wall, the block

856
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:08,820
domain, the center part of the magnet, you could look it up on your own, folks, whoever

857
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:09,820
wants to.

858
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,220
What is the block wall on a magnet?

859
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:15,460
It's not a wall because if you put two magnets together, that shifts to between

860
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,020
the two magnets, if you break a magnet, it shifts.

861
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,860
So it's not a wall in any way at all.

862
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,180
It's a domain that shifts.

863
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,980
It's a neutral point, right?

864
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:29,220
So this poor bastard Felix Block, they used his name on this thing and they tend to ignore

865
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:34,620
it completely in industry and the uses are immense.

866
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:39,620
Now we're talking about just the water here.

867
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:44,700
The reason why we're talking about the water is because it's unprecedented, the change in

868
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,420
water quality that it does.

869
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:51,500
And you're not using the part of the magnet that everyone is focused on.

870
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:56,820
And if you put in magnetic water treatment and go to images, magnetic water treatment devices,

871
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:02,660
go to images on your browser, you will see these poor bastards, thousands of companies,

872
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:07,740
hundreds and thousands have invested in selling these things to people that do nothing, almost

873
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:08,740
nothing.

874
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,780
When I say nothing, they're not consistent.

875
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,140
And I've tried them.

876
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,140
Right.

877
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:21,740
So when we go around the block wall, the water quality changes intensely, intense changes.

878
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:22,740
Right.

879
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:27,300
The TDS measurements that you're measuring are actually false.

880
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,060
It is a way for the, what I say false, is there a TDS drop?

881
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,300
Well, the water behaves as if there are.

882
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,300
It is.

883
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:36,660
And right here, I could drop in photos of my shower, which hasn't been cleaned in six months

884
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,380
and then you could see it's told sparkly.

885
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:42,820
It's acting better as if I was using our, our own water.

886
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,660
No mineral distilled water, but it's not.

887
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:52,460
What's happening is the water is being charged so much by the block wall, not discriminate

888
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:57,340
charging by the north or south only, which we can get into the north or south, you know,

889
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:02,580
the north or south pole of a magnet has a black hole in the middle of it, you can see it.

890
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,180
And that flips the pole.

891
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:05,540
That's the counter space part.

892
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:08,300
Well, we can get into that when we talk more about magnets.

893
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:11,340
Again, today is just to introduce the concepts here.

894
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:15,460
And to give a little bit of history of where I've been through the past six months with it.

895
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:20,620
And how happy I am that we have some, at least 40 participants here, I see in the group

896
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,500
that would listen to this.

897
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:26,580
But yeah, so can the, can the scalerator be attached under the sink?

898
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,700
I live in a condo and I can't modify the water.

899
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,740
I mean, yes, it can.

900
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:36,740
But what I would say under the sink is put it as far away from the mixing valve, you know,

901
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,780
where it actually connects to the sink with a, get yourself, what would be practical

902
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:47,740
if the sink, whether it has a cabinet underneath it or not, at least a 10 or 15 foot piece of

903
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:55,020
tubing, coiled up, not a small coil, but a wide coil go around the cabinet several times.

904
00:52:55,020 --> 00:53:00,100
Doesn't matter which direction before it goes into the sink faucet.

905
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:04,220
Yeah, I would do a minimum of six feet and it will work quite well.

906
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:07,500
Yeah, not as well as if it's on the main.

907
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,820
This is the part where they are indeed more research and development.

908
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:15,620
Remember, this is only, thank you, Michael, in the text.

909
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:20,460
This has only been in existence since April, the last year and I'm the only poor sap that's

910
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,300
talking about it.

911
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,380
This could be, this could be an existence for thousands of years, but I tell you it's

912
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:31,220
not on the surface as far as we know and it's not on the internet as far as we can tell.

913
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:33,700
And this is one thing also.

914
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,060
I don't think anyone's going to figure their side unless you have direct experience and

915
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:43,060
direct knowledge in this group or what I've been talking about because it's counterintuitive.

916
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:48,860
What I mean by that is if someone wants to copy this and they go to a computer like console

917
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:54,540
and they type in what the scalerator looks like or recreate it and they hit the button to

918
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,740
show me what influences the magnetic fields have on the water.

919
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:59,740
It will show nothing.

920
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:03,700
It will show, it doesn't even show a block wall and I have engineers saying, yeah, the computer

921
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:04,700
dish will block wall.

922
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,700
No, it doesn't.

923
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:06,700
They don't show anything.

924
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,340
Are you that hopelessly brainwashed?

925
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:11,940
Doesn't show anything, any effect of the block wall at all.

926
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:16,220
There is no way that anyone working in an engineering firm that wants to imitate this

927
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:23,580
will be given any funding if the super computer shows that such an arrangement does absolutely

928
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:24,900
nothing.

929
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,740
So the chances of this being copied by industry or whatever is next to nothing is zero

930
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:31,580
to nil, right?

931
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:34,140
And you won't get a patent on this either.

932
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,860
They'll let look at you and laugh.

933
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:41,100
But they'll put you through the saw once you know, I know someone who's gotten patent several

934
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:46,780
people and one thing they do allow is when you meet them, the patent reviewer, you can bring

935
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,460
in and do a demonstration.

936
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,460
You bring in the device.

937
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,900
It's a water device bringing some water tanks.

938
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,980
They give you a room to set it up and all that.

939
00:54:53,980 --> 00:54:56,420
You demonstrate it, right?

940
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:59,500
The moment you demonstrate it and it works, they're going to put you through the saw.

941
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:03,340
I don't know if you guys are familiar about the saw system in the patent.

942
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:11,540
Yeah, just like it sounds, SAW stands for special application withdrawal system.

943
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:14,740
They withdraw your application.

944
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:15,740
They withdraw your application.

945
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,900
They send you a letter.

946
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:25,700
We found that what you are applying for is matter of national security.

947
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,700
So they call it the saw.

948
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,660
So how do I know that?

949
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,660
Anyway, 35.

950
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:40,020
In accordance with the out one of them and yeah, that's one of them.

951
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,780
Yeah, but they call it internal.

952
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:45,100
They have an internal mechanism to flag them.

953
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:52,560
So this is a very rare opportunity for anyone here or whatever that is ingenious is good

954
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,560
with building things.

955
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,980
Don't say you're going to 3D print.

956
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:57,980
If you want a 3D print, anything, just don't tell me, please.

957
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,460
I don't want to know.

958
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:04,940
Just like saying you like to cook, but you reheat frozen dinners.

959
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:08,140
That's your version of cooking.

960
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:10,140
By the way, they have said on sonics.

961
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,060
Most people that say, tell me they like to cook.

962
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,940
I watch them and they don't know how to cook.

963
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,700
They're reheating stuff.

964
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:18,260
They don't know.

965
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:20,100
Big difference again.

966
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:24,740
So yeah, this is very, very exciting in terms of the water quality.

967
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,420
Now, this is so early.

968
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:30,160
I'm the only one that's really been pressing forward and working with this since April

969
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,160
of last year.

970
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,740
So let's say nine months or so.

971
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:40,140
And I've had at the same time in paralleling experiences with both conventional industry and

972
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:41,460
the airy ferries.

973
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,240
The airy ferries meaning the structured water.

974
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:45,840
By the way, there's no such thing as structured water.

975
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,640
It's a gimmick.

976
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:53,360
If anyone tells you there's such a thing as a water molecule with even Ken Wheeler with

977
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:56,840
hydrogen up here and oxygen in the brew it.

978
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:02,840
If it's so prominent and dominant, show me a picture, show me how that imposes itself or

979
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,680
fractals itself, even in crystal formation.

980
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,680
Show me.

981
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:07,680
You know what?

982
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,000
It doesn't because there is no molecular structure to water.

983
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,480
Water is one molecule.

984
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:17,280
All the water on the planet is represents one molecule of water.

985
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,000
I've been trying to give this analogy for 20 years, even with O'Chelle when we talk about

986
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
water.

987
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,800
We have an Olympic size swimming pool between us.

988
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,960
You're on one end, which is 660,000 gallons.

989
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,600
Might even be Olympic size swimming pool might be 666,000 gallons as bastards, right?

990
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:41,680
But so, okay, I tell truck, you know, you're on one end of the swimming pool and I'm on

991
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,680
the other.

992
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:46,840
When you drop a glass of water, a one drop of water on your end of the swimming pool and

993
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:52,240
I take simultaneously one drop of water out of my end or an hour later, it doesn't matter.

994
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:56,280
Is it the same drop of water or a different drop of water?

995
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,640
Now some people think they're slick and they'll say, well, I put red dye in it and I could

996
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,640
see the water.

997
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,280
No, you see the red dye, you don't see the water when you drop it in.

998
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,160
Ah, gotcha, you see?

999
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:09,120
That's the first irrational logic person say, well, I'll put dye in the water so we can see

1000
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,120
it.

1001
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:16,680
So when you drop the water in, you see the dye, not the water at it.

1002
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:23,060
So I'm telling you, it's the same exact drop of water.

1003
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:29,360
The same water that was used to fill that pool wherever it came from is still the same water.

1004
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:33,440
And I've backed this up many times with people that I've talked to in neurosurgery.

1005
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,720
Oh my gosh, what is neurosurgery?

1006
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,120
You have to do with it.

1007
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:42,120
So there is a miracle going on here that's been going on under our noses for thousands

1008
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:50,160
of years that we tend to lean on the subject matter as being miraculous water.

1009
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,440
But no one's talking about it this way at all.

1010
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,080
I hate seeing like the presumption, there's a whole bunch of people out there.

1011
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,880
You'll find them on YouTube.

1012
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,240
They got, I don't know, easy water in this water.

1013
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:04,040
That water, the water molecule for stage of water, prove it.

1014
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,040
Show me.

1015
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,200
The irrational and their logic falls very, very quickly.

1016
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:13,640
It falls apart even Vita Austin, who I revere as doing with the hydro glyphs.

1017
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:18,400
Sooner she freezes water next to photographs and thoughts and the water frost patterns

1018
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,000
revealed, you know, hydro glyph with what the photo or the thought was.

1019
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,120
When she starts a conversation, she says, we all know that water came from outer space,

1020
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,120
from meteorites and all that.

1021
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,480
I'm like, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

1022
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,760
Does that mean that her rest of her work is invalid?

1023
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:34,760
No.

1024
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:39,720
Is she allowed to say really stupid things?

1025
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,080
I mean like really stupid things and still be right about the hydro glyphs?

1026
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:42,080
Of course.

1027
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:45,120
Aren't we all right?

1028
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:52,040
So this approach on the scalerator, running the water line or the fluid, by the way, you

1029
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:56,600
know, sometimes I'll interchange water with fluid because guess what?

1030
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,200
Have you tried fuel in that?

1031
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:03,720
By the way, when I mentioned look up magnetic water treatment devices, when you're doing

1032
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,720
that.

1033
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,840
There's some rascals in there that want to sell you devices to run your fuel, right?

1034
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:13,200
Your gas line with magnets also and they start telling you to get better in PG.

1035
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:17,840
You know that bullshit, you're not because they're doing the same exact thing that the

1036
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:19,440
water people are.

1037
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,840
And in the water people, the airy ferries, they use cone, we use a cone magnet, very expensive

1038
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:24,840
cone magnet.

1039
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,440
And this doesn't matter.

1040
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:32,120
If you're facing either the north or the south or both or in parallel or opposing,

1041
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,520
doesn't matter.

1042
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,520
It doesn't work.

1043
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:37,440
Well, if Guineemann Greek, it doesn't work.

1044
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:38,440
Of course it works.

1045
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,920
The Department of Energy wrote a paper on there that if you're an industry and don't use

1046
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,800
magnets or water, you're an idiot.

1047
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:47,680
Yeah, but it doesn't work like this and you're still going to get scale, right?

1048
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,240
So what is this?

1049
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,840
Running any fluid along that part of the magnet.

1050
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:59,520
Now unfortunately, so far, not with much experimentation, but more like thought experiments, the best

1051
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:05,200
way to do this is by looping, it's called a spool, by the way, in industry.

1052
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:10,520
If you wanted to go make that pipe made out of titanium, which I like, titanium is a wonderful

1053
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,560
material for water treatment, by the way.

1054
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,880
It's extremely paramagnetic.

1055
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,880
It's not magnetic.

1056
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:22,440
It has some properties that are very unique as a metal.

1057
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:26,800
Otherwise, they wouldn't say they're stargates are made out of pure titanium.

1058
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:29,120
Remember, these stargates series?

1059
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,680
It was, again, people were taking advantage of the ignorance of the people.

1060
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:35,520
They closed the stargate and the general said, no one could go through that.

1061
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,120
It's pure titanium.

1062
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,160
Like, oh my gosh, pure titanium is soft.

1063
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:43,000
You could cut it with regular steel hacks off or, you know, dollar store hacks all cut

1064
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
right plate.

1065
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,840
That's again, taking advantage of the ignorant people.

1066
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,120
You tell people this in previous is pure titanium.

1067
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:50,120
Most people think it is, right?

1068
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,640
It has to be alloyed.

1069
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:58,080
So if I go to a fab shop to make me a titanium two inch spool, a real mean-ass scale

1070
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:04,240
reader, a mark two, and they want $20,000 to just bend the pipe and weld and polish it internally,

1071
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:11,920
externally for titanium, when you refer to that bend, it's called a spool, right?

1072
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,760
And the magnet, we're not going to call a magnet, we're going to call it a magnetic reactor.

1073
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:21,960
And the reason we call it a magnetic reactor is because I don't care at all about the magnetism

1074
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:27,640
of that magnet, you know, basically you care about magnetism of a magnet when you want

1075
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:33,680
to stick something to your refrigerator or you pick up a junk car or whatever, or use it

1076
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,600
in a relay.

1077
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:40,240
By the way, not necessarily true because this can also be used in relays in a way that

1078
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,560
below your mind.

1079
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:47,160
But we're not interested in the magnetism of the magnet at all, what's what the north and

1080
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:48,160
south pole are doing.

1081
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,360
We just, you know, give them their pay for the day and tell the north and south pole,

1082
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,800
go home, leave, we don't need you at all.

1083
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,040
We just want the block wall.

1084
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:02,800
As a matter of fact, all of the magnetic flux line diagrams that you see online are incorrect,

1085
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:08,040
except for the ones that Ken Wheeler has drawn up and people that I've studied with him.

1086
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:12,240
Now I also put up some photographs of what I've discovered with magnetic field lines, Vandy

1087
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:16,920
put one up the other day, the south pole and the north pole is a north pole and a south

1088
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:17,920
pole.

1089
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,360
There's a variation between the north pole and the south pole.

1090
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:22,360
They're not identical.

1091
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,760
What is not the opposite of the other?

1092
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,000
They're very different.

1093
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,600
And that needs to be explored and worked.

1094
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:33,320
I have done some mild experimentation with success, but I'm not going to go down the road

1095
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:38,600
and get a knock on my door one day and they're going to say, "Greek, if this works, you're

1096
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,920
a dead man, you know, I don't need another call like that.

1097
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,240
I've had those before."

1098
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:50,160
So this is something for someone else or when we get to a point where we can hide a little

1099
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,480
better, I can discuss more and what's going on with that.

1100
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:59,800
Vandy did post a picture in the chat of the magnetic field and I will post that again.

1101
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,480
We are not interested in water treatment.

1102
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,480
I am not.

1103
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:08,560
The scalarator has nothing to do with magnetism, but it does employ a magnetic reactor in a way

1104
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:16,240
that, for example, in a nuclear reactor, a nuclear reactor's purpose is to heat water,

1105
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,640
not to put radiation into the water.

1106
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,880
Thus it's called a nuclear reactor.

1107
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:28,960
A reactor is, it means it's initial purpose is being used in a secondary form.

1108
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,200
So you do need magnets.

1109
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,880
You can even use an electromagnet, by the way, but why?

1110
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,200
Why would you be pumping electricity into something, you know, voltage and currents where

1111
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:44,520
you can, unless being very light weight is an issue, but then you have the weight of what's

1112
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,360
providing the electricity.

1113
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:52,400
So we are using the magnets just to capture and create that block wall.

1114
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:58,080
And you could look up a block wall, needle wall, ridiculous.

1115
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:00,120
This is the stuff they are putting out to the children.

1116
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:08,440
By the way, when you look at science books, physics and all that, keep in mind that no matter

1117
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:16,640
how complex it looks, the goal and the intent behind all that is to fool ignorant children.

1118
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,640
Right?

1119
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:22,080
To not show what's going on, but to satisfy their curiosity with gibberish.

1120
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:27,400
I'm one of those people that whenever they show a movie like Goodwill Hunting or something,

1121
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:32,240
even like Felix the cat where they have all the equations on the blackboard, I would

1122
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:36,760
pause it and tell everyone in the room, those are Hollywood bullshit equations.

1123
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:41,080
They don't make any sense in why they don't make any sense and no one cares.

1124
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,080
No one in the room.

1125
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:47,400
You shut up, play the movie, you're ruining it for me, shut up.

1126
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,400
Right?

1127
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,120
It's like, I don't care about the equations.

1128
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:54,400
They look, they're fooling you even here just like they do and whatever.

1129
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,840
So I just wanted to bring that up.

1130
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:03,600
So yeah, I think maybe we've been kicking this now for an hour and a half.

1131
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,840
So if anyone comes on for the first time, they're going to be how long is this Greek with

1132
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,600
another 14 hour thing or whatever.

1133
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:13,680
Let's see if there's any other question.

1134
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,080
Yeah, can it be done a burky?

1135
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,080
Yes.

1136
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:26,240
As a matter of fact, what I will do, how about I post, I'll try to sanitize the name because

1137
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:30,280
I have to ask the person if they want to be public or not.

1138
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,920
Someone asked about the burky if that was Bruce, right?

1139
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:33,920
Who saw you?

1140
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,920
Yes, sir.

1141
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:38,760
I got a surprise for you then.

1142
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,760
Here you go.

1143
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:44,560
I will sanitize this and I will send it to right now.

1144
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:49,360
I want you to read this comment here.

1145
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:56,200
I just sent this is from last week.

1146
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:58,680
Thank you so much for selling me on the scalerator.

1147
01:06:58,680 --> 01:06:59,680
It's magic.

1148
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,680
This is not sent to me.

1149
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:05,240
This is sent to the person who recommended the scalerator and then forwarded the message

1150
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:06,240
to me.

1151
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,760
So this is a third party, right?

1152
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:12,040
I can't stop cleaning everywhere, sparkles and the water tastes amazing out of my burky.

1153
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:17,240
I saved some of the old and yuck, meaning the old water out of a burky filtered, right?

1154
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,320
Tasted like yuck.

1155
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,320
So.

1156
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:22,320
All right.

1157
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,360
Yeah, so yeah, it does.

1158
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:27,600
And burkeys, by the way, are great on paper.

1159
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:29,640
They're wonderful filters on paper.

1160
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:34,280
They do what they say they do, but I've never tasted water come out of a burky that tasted

1161
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,840
good and there's one reason for it.

1162
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:38,280
It's because of that stainless steel.

1163
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:39,920
The stainless steel holds the memory.

1164
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:40,920
Yes.

1165
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:45,120
Yeah, you have to know how to clean the stainless steel, not physically, electrically, and I

1166
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,240
could get into that in the future.

1167
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:54,160
It's very simple actually if you just get an AC power cord, interrupt the power cord and

1168
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:58,440
where the power cord is interrupted, you put your stainless steel there for five minutes,

1169
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:00,000
let AC run through it.

1170
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Right?

1171
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,960
Just take one of those cheap lamp cords and cut one leg of the lamp cord.

1172
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:05,960
Yeah.

1173
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,840
And so you expose the wire, right?

1174
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:11,640
Make sure it's unplugged first and then attach it with magnets or whatever to the stainless.

1175
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:16,560
I think it's not magnetic with some tape and make sure there's a light bulb on the end.

1176
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,560
There's a load.

1177
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,360
So when you plug it in, it doesn't matter positive or negative.

1178
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:22,360
It's AC.

1179
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:26,160
When you plug in the cord with the lamp on the end of it, one of the legs that are broken

1180
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,280
on the extension cord goes through the burkeys.

1181
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,800
The burkeys making the stainless steel becomes the conductor.

1182
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,640
Don't touch it.

1183
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:34,520
Make sure you don't have any pets or children around.

1184
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:38,000
While this is going on, some people say 10 seconds is enough.

1185
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,160
I like to do more than five minutes.

1186
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,200
But even 10 seconds will help.

1187
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:49,280
And then once you do that, do it dry, dump it out and then clean it with baking soda.

1188
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:52,640
Never use anything to clean a burkey that you wouldn't ingest.

1189
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,880
So you don't use like CLR Lyman scale.

1190
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,560
So I was like, "Can I use CLR Lyman scale?"

1191
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,440
I've been though, I finished saying that.

1192
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:59,520
All right.

1193
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:04,680
Would you drink CLR Lyman scale remover to your food?

1194
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:05,680
No.

1195
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,760
I just mentioned.

1196
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,720
Do not use anything that you wouldn't eat.

1197
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,320
So you would use vinegar?

1198
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,320
Yes.

1199
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,320
You would use lemon juice?

1200
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,320
Yes.

1201
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:15,320
You baking soda?

1202
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:16,320
Yes.

1203
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,320
All right.

1204
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,320
See?

1205
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,320
So stop using industrial chemicals and you'll notice how things will taste better.

1206
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,320
Look, you ever go to something that will help you?

1207
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,320
So help us.

1208
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:25,320
Yeah.

1209
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:26,320
Use regular tools.

1210
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,320
So help us.

1211
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:28,320
Yeah.

1212
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:37,760
So help us runner length, size of magnet length afterwards.

1213
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:41,440
How would that work in on the burkey when you're scaling it down?

1214
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,320
Is my curiosity here?

1215
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:46,720
Oh, no, no, the burkey, no, no, no, no.

1216
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:53,920
This, the comments that I just put here is a scalarator, a 700 degree one, a custom one,

1217
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:59,400
was put on the water main outside with a plumber because it was an HOA, got a license plumber

1218
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,400
to install it.

1219
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,880
All right.

1220
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,000
It was put in outside the house, plenty of runner length.

1221
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Okay.

1222
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,520
The pipe goes through the garage first and then it goes through back around the kitchen and

1223
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,960
it's got plenty of elbows.

1224
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:17,200
Every 90 degree elbow represents about 20 feet of runner length, by the way, anywhere

1225
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:18,920
between 10 and 20 feet.

1226
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:22,480
So let's say you have 10 feet of runner length with 290 degree elbows, you count it as

1227
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,680
30 feet, 40 feet.

1228
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:32,080
Each time you put a 90 degree elbow in a plumbing situation, it's like adding 10 feet of pipe.

1229
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,080
Energetically and mechanically.

1230
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,080
Yeah, that's terrible.

1231
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,640
They shouldn't be, it's not friendly to flow.

1232
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:41,080
They should always be using sweeps.

1233
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,960
But I found that they work to my advantage.

1234
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:48,120
As a matter of fact, if I build a scalarator with an extra wrap, like a 540 degree one,

1235
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:52,280
instead of a 380, right?

1236
01:10:52,280 --> 01:10:57,920
If I make it a 700 degree and I put two 90s on the end where it just blocks the flow, it

1237
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,360
almost as if water is in the scalarator, it sees those 90 degrees and it's like looking

1238
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,280
down an alley, you don't see it way up.

1239
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:08,080
But when you get down the alley, you can see you go right, you know what I mean?

1240
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,280
That's how those 90 degrees work.

1241
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,480
When the water sees down to that fitting, it doesn't see a way out.

1242
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:16,880
But it knows if it turns right or left, it'll get out, right?

1243
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:17,880
Terrible.

1244
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,320
It seems to work really well.

1245
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,480
It's kind of like, you know, all right.

1246
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,280
You want to run down an alley or like, there's no way I could get out of here.

1247
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:28,360
You're trusting that there's an opening on the right or the left, right?

1248
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,040
You don't want to get caught in a fight in here.

1249
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:35,240
So the water gets a little antsy when it sees these 90 degree bends and it tends to work

1250
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:40,280
better, a little excitement in your life once in a while, right?

1251
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,960
You know, shopperger said, yeah, for the water.

1252
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,480
In other words, shopperger says that the water has a consciousness, by the way.

1253
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:52,400
His consciousness was overtaken by the water consciousness several times when he was by a

1254
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:56,720
very lively, healthy river during moonlight.

1255
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:02,560
So you know, you can allow it's better than having the TV take over your consciousness.

1256
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,080
But absolutely.

1257
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,080
Yeah.

1258
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:08,000
So the burky here is just a burky.

1259
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,920
It's just a poor man's canister filter, you know?

1260
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:13,400
It's basically whatever water source you got.

1261
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:16,760
Like, if you go camping, you take a burky with you, right?

1262
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:17,760
You should.

1263
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,280
You just put it, you know, you go camping with enough people.

1264
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,640
Why are we bringing him, honey?

1265
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,840
Oh, because he's going to carry the water filter.

1266
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,880
That's why we're bringing him.

1267
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:28,880
Right?

1268
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:29,880
So, yeah.

1269
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,240
And whatever you dump in there, yeah.

1270
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,240
But I appreciate that.

1271
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:34,240
Yeah.

1272
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,240
Go ahead.

1273
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,240
I appreciate the heads up on that, though.

1274
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,080
That's a good information.

1275
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,080
Yeah.

1276
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:41,920
We'll be going into a lot of other water stuff that I've discovered.

1277
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:47,520
But generally, just to recap, and we will end it soon here.

1278
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,720
The O'Celi, there's a classic O'Celi.

1279
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:54,600
I think it was only for the O'Celi subs, not the rated Y subs, that I did about four years

1280
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:58,600
ago, five years ago, with him on how to treat water.

1281
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:04,720
It was basically pre-chilling the water, using $10, picture filters and buying some magnetite.

1282
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:09,920
And if you can't get that zeal light adding into it, whatever, pre-chilling, certain techniques

1283
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,920
and what to do and how to handle water.

1284
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:16,520
Whoever listened to it and did it, found the water quality was exceptional, better than

1285
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:19,840
Fiji, better than anything bottled, whatever, whatever, whatever.

1286
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:20,840
That was a classic call.

1287
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:25,480
We'll recap on some of those things again in case people here have not heard that.

1288
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:29,000
But basically, keep it cool, keep it out of the light, contrary.

1289
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,880
By the way, all these are these airy, fairy-structured water people and maintenance.

1290
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:33,880
You go to their websites.

1291
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:38,840
No where does it say, keep your water cooler out of the dark at all.

1292
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,840
No one does that service.

1293
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,920
And I don't even feel like I'm giving a service by saying that.

1294
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,280
But anyone who does that will find an increase in water quality.

1295
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:51,560
But we'll get into a lot of little tips and tricks because I have developed quite a few

1296
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:56,120
things because again, years ago I said, I'm no longer working with water.

1297
01:13:56,120 --> 01:14:01,880
I found it to be a dead end thing just because it's the wrong planet for improving things.

1298
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,480
This planet has a course.

1299
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,800
So if you see any technological improvement, it's not out of happenstance.

1300
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,520
It was planned a long time ago and as part of the course, you're supposed to go down.

1301
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:14,920
This is not the right place to start finding things that need to be improved and start

1302
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:15,920
improving them.

1303
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:18,680
If you think you can do that, you're making a big mistake.

1304
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:20,400
And I discovered that a long time ago.

1305
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,560
So I said, no more water work for me.

1306
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:27,200
And I had to do something about the scale.

1307
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,280
Came up with the scale rate or nine months ago.

1308
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:34,760
And that's pretty much my focus has been because, and again, I had not been talking about

1309
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:40,120
it for a while on the sonics because I had started intermingling with some of the groups that

1310
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:43,800
I mentioned here, both mainstream and non-mainstream water people.

1311
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:44,800
And they get scared.

1312
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,800
They're afraid.

1313
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:49,000
They also do what's called delay tactics.

1314
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,520
They capture, they kind of like get your attention.

1315
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:55,880
Oh, we're going to be really wealthy with this, but you got to wait like three months,

1316
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:56,880
okay?

1317
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,040
Don't tell me how many people have you told about this?

1318
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:01,760
Can you wait another two months and then three months go by.

1319
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:06,360
Can you give it a few more months, maybe told July and so you know what?

1320
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:08,720
Why don't you go like fuck yourself?

1321
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:10,880
Did I say that politely enough?

1322
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:14,800
So because delay tactics is a psychological thing.

1323
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,840
They did that to OJ Simpson.

1324
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:20,160
By the way, if you guys don't know the truth behind that, it's very well known amongst many

1325
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,160
circles.

1326
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:26,080
OJ Simpson is wife and Mark, whatever.

1327
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:31,200
They were involved in a very big human trafficking and drug trafficking network that was

1328
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:36,600
put together by judges in California, attorneys, generals, ex-military, ex-police.

1329
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:43,760
One of the guys went a little crazy, killed OJ's wife and whatever.

1330
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,440
And OJ was like, I can't stand this anymore.

1331
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:46,760
I couldn't stand it while I was going on.

1332
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:47,760
This is too much.

1333
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,760
I got to talk about it.

1334
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:51,640
And they're like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you might get into a little

1335
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:55,720
trouble, but you got to, well, you can talk about it in about three months or so.

1336
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:56,720
I know you're a really upset.

1337
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:57,720
Can you just hold it?

1338
01:15:57,720 --> 01:15:58,720
Can you promise this?

1339
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:01,120
You won't say anything for three months later?

1340
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:02,120
Come again.

1341
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:03,120
Oh, three months is over.

1342
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:04,120
Oh, OJ, you can't.

1343
01:16:04,120 --> 01:16:06,880
You know how many people's lives are at stake?

1344
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:08,360
Don't talk about it.

1345
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:13,400
I've seen these delay tactics over and over and over and over and over and over and many,

1346
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:16,080
many aspects of life and it really messes people up.

1347
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,160
Look at how OJ Simpson is now, right?

1348
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:23,040
I'm not OJ's, but I'm just saying I like to give that sterile, like to throw in these pieces

1349
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,040
of information.

1350
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:28,520
It's kind of like kicking the powers that be in the shins a little bit, you know?

1351
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:33,680
If you ever listen to me talk, I always try to bring up how 9/11 was a textbook nuclear event,

1352
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:34,680
not because I know better.

1353
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:38,960
Yeah, I do know better, but it's kicking the authorities a little bit in the shins.

1354
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,960
Don't you want to kick them in the shins at least once before you go?

1355
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:46,040
Maybe kick them in a thousand little ways, you know?

1356
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:49,200
So yeah, delay tactics.

1357
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:54,720
So anyway, this I'll be opening up more and more as we go on and I hope you guys find it

1358
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:55,920
of benefit.

1359
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:00,040
And like I mentioned the end from the beginning, what I would like to see, I'm going to be

1360
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:03,160
dedicating as much as I can to it.

1361
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:08,920
But at the same time, if my noodle, my brain breaks and I say I'm not doing this anymore,

1362
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,360
please excuse me.

1363
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:14,960
But what I would like to see is everybody in this call say we're going to mortgage everything

1364
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:19,920
we own and we're going to convince our grandmother to give her life savings so we can

1365
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:24,840
get at least a million dollars together and open a factory and all of us will be shareholders.

1366
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:29,800
That would then we wouldn't have to keep talking right then we'll say okay, why don't you

1367
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:34,200
say that in the beginning and why we don't need to continue these calls in the Skype group

1368
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:37,240
and let's get to work, right?

1369
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:41,920
So I just want to put that out there too.

1370
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:46,680
So with that said, we'll end the recording right here and we'll schedule another one

1371
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:47,320
real soon.

1372
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,720
(bell chimes)
