1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I took your advice on these solid state drives.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:17,680
Okay, all right, so we're recording a few seconds in and I'm going to try to get a little

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,800
bit of a sonic on some questions that have been asked regarding the scale rate or construction

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,720
and I figured it would be more value in recording it.

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,120
And so this way everyone here has access to it because that's what this is about.

6
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,280
So I'm going to start off by just saying these questions are very pertinent to someone

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,760
who is very, very pertinent on building one and I noticed that and I did have a discussion

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,280
with this person and they are pretty serious and seemingly capable so far.

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:55,680
Excuse me, so they send me emails and there's the right kind of email meaning if the questions

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,680
are right.

11
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:03,280
And I'm going to just go down the questions and I'll try to be as complete as possible

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,600
because they're very helpful.

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:16,640
So let's see, let's open up this thing here and see if we can get it going.

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,720
(slurping sound)

15
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,840
(slurping sounds)

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:37,540
(slurping sounds)

17
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,540
(slurping sounds)

18
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,540
(slurping sounds)

19
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,540
(slurping sounds)

20
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,540
Alright, I finally muted a computer.

21
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,540
(slurping sounds)

22
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,540
And work should have less background noise.

23
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,540
(slurping sounds)

24
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,540
Okay, so here we go.

25
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,540
A person says here they've ordered the magnet.

26
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,540
Do you have any guidance or recommendations on buying the following?

27
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,540
Alright, bullet point.

28
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,540
First one is the pipe. What is it made of?

29
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,540
Alright, the pipe.

30
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,540
Let's call it the spool.

31
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:44,540
If you go to industry when you have a... go to a fab shop and you have a plan of drawing of what looks like the scalerator.

32
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,540
And you want that pipe bent around like that, they're going to call it a spool.

33
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,540
So, it kind of makes sense.

34
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:59,540
A spool is just a winding if it's one or, you know, one time around, one to runs, once or a thousand times it's a spool.

35
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,540
So that's the industrial term for it from a fabrication shop.

36
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,540
So here the question, the first bullet point is the pipe. What is it made of?

37
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:16,540
What we're using, and I highly specify, and I'll give the reasons why, is schedule 80, that schedule 80, PVC.

38
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,540
The reason why we use that is several reasons.

39
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,540
First of all, I'll give the caveat.

40
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,540
I'm not a fan of PVC, polyvinyl chloride. It has fafaleates and it can pollute the water.

41
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,540
So, I'm going to apply the sizeors in there. Extra-ginty-mitter is blah, blah, blah.

42
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,540
All the stuff you hear about, bad about plastic, you'll find in PVC.

43
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:49,540
But the reason why we're using it, the main reason is because schedule 80, I'm saying this again, schedule 80, not schedule 40, it's the dark gray stuff.

44
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:56,540
By the way, guys, when I've been on Sonic's rapport, I've made game instructions to people, and why to use one over the other.

45
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:04,540
I need to be double-triple-clear because when I did the Sonic about the number 8 rise, I talked about the tarot, and there's two types of tarot.

46
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,540
Don't use the small one, use the large one, and someone sent me a box of the small tarot.

47
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:14,540
I don't know if that was to piss me off, or they just didn't get the detail, but I appreciate the gift anyway.

48
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,540
So, it's just funny.

49
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:23,540
So, let's go back to the pipe. Schedule 80. Did I say schedule 80? As in 80.

50
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:29,540
8 times 10 is 80. That's what you want to use. Now, that's dark gray stuff.

51
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,540
Most typically in PVC pipe, you'll see the schedule 40. That's a 4 or 0, and that's a white thin wall.

52
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,540
The difference is the schedule 80 is a thick wall pipe, and the other one is not.

53
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,540
And there's also a C-PVC. Don't use that either.

54
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,540
So, why really focus on the schedule 80?

55
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:55,540
Because let's say you're building these devices, and you want to get them out out in the world.

56
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,540
And you end up butting heads with someone in industry.

57
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:08,540
If you show them anything other than schedule 80, they're going to want a certain safety and material test to prove that the device can hold up.

58
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:15,540
But if you show them a device made with schedule 80, that is internationally accepted as a standard in industry.

59
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:22,540
So, what it does is it allows you to walk into anyone's door and be respected on what material you're using.

60
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:30,540
The second reason you use it, which is all tied to the first reason, is that it's a thick wall.

61
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:42,540
It's almost twice as thick as schedule 40, and that dark gray color is such because they have a higher degree of solids built into the plastic when it's being extruded.

62
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:49,540
And when you're bending the pipe and putting it under thermal stresses because it's thermally bent.

63
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:59,540
Chances of the pipe losing its dimension, its wall thickness, and becoming fragile and brittle is very, very slim with the schedule 80.

64
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:07,540
Where with the schedule 40, the thinner wall, the white stuff gets really brittle and thin doesn't work that well.

65
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:15,540
And when the unit is complete with the magnetic reactor and it's completely done, it's very robust.

66
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:21,540
I mean, you could grab it and beat someone with it and it'll be just fine or it'll fall off the bench.

67
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,540
Hit the deck, pick it up, it's just fine.

68
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:30,540
Where if you make it out of the other pipe, the other PVC, any other PVC, if it falls off the bench and hits the deck, it'll crack and break.

69
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:47,540
And that means that if you're giving it to a plumber, you know, you guys know why they call them plumbers. But anyway, if he's wrestling on this thing, the lock it down, tighten it, cut it, whatever fit it in the field, that he steps on it, drops it from his pickup truck or whatever, it's going to break.

70
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,540
It's not going to hold up.

71
00:06:49,540 --> 00:07:06,540
The only thing, the only material that will hold up is the schedule 80. And again, when you combine the properties of the schedule 80 versus all other types of PVC, because of its heavy thick wall, it makes it easier to work with and more consistent for bending.

72
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,540
Okay.

73
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:19,540
So I'd like to say if there are any questions on that, and actually if there are any questions regarding that material, the pipe and why we're using schedule 80, that's 80, that's the dark gray stuff.

74
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:25,540
And somebody wants to unmute and chime in with a question regarding that that's totally cool.

75
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:34,540
Otherwise, I'll go on to the next bullet point.

76
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:40,540
What size length of the pipe is this?

77
00:07:40,540 --> 00:08:01,540
The length of the pipe ends up being we have a jig, which we'll get into basically or if you could just bend it around, if you're making one for the first time, and you're bending it around a five and one quarter inch, that's five and one quarter inch diameter magnet, you're going to eat 34 inches of pipe.

78
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:13,540
And you start off with about a four inch tail, and by the time she wraps around that magnet, bends around and you're done, you'll end up with another three to four inch tail on the opposite end.

79
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:19,540
You need 34 inches to start with. Now your pipe comes in 10 or 20 foot sticks.

80
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:29,540
When you buy a piece of pipe, it's called a stick, 20 feet long, and or you get half a stick, which is 10 feet long, if you go to lows, lows sells it, by the way.

81
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:36,540
Otherwise, you got to go to a sprinkler, an irrigation or professional plumbing supply to get it.

82
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:49,540
So you're going to have to cut yourself if you're using a five and one quarter inch diameter pipe, and you could do pi D, which is circumference, then you got to add 28% right because you're bending around.

83
00:08:49,540 --> 00:09:01,540
Now it'll give you your length of pipe. And if you're using a smaller magnet, you could use less than 34 inches if you're using a bigger magnet, you got to have to use more.

84
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:07,540
So the 34 inches, you'll get three scalerators out of one 10 foot stick, right?

85
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,540
Because 34 inches just shy of three feet.

86
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:22,540
So you'll get three scalerators out of it, and about a little bit overfoot and a half left over on 10 foot stick, which you then you bend and make those internal spacers that you see in the middle of the magnetic reactor.

87
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,540
Have a little scrap left over.

88
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:35,540
Now if you're making a custom one and you want the longer tail, especially if you're going to get into putting flow forms in the pipe, you can cut it at just a 36.

89
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:48,540
You can do a little more length or whatever. But if you're going to wrap it around a five and a quarter inch magnet, you're going to want it centered around 18 or 17 inches, which is a total 34 inch.

90
00:09:48,540 --> 00:10:00,540
I also used to, the plans that I've drawn up is in radians. I go by degrees instead of white, but that, you know, people kind of freak out when they see that kind of math, you know, radians.

91
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:15,540
You know, that's why when I put up a picture of one that I call the 700 degree someone said, well, that's a 540 degree band. I said, yeah, but it's measured at radians in other words, the part of the scalerator that sticks out the study part that's not bent. That's part of the circle.

92
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:25,540
Right. There's a conference. So I'll give in the future. I'll put up drawings on that and I'll do it in both straight measurement radians and all that.

93
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:37,540
So, yeah, that's a good question. Well, they didn't have it at home depot. So the home depot doesn't have it. You could special order from them, but they're going to charge you five times more.

94
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:53,540
You can get it at lows, some lows. There's only one lows here to some that has it. You get at Ferguson's plumbing supply. You could call around. There is industrial plumbing supplies like Harrington is another one that has it.

95
00:10:53,540 --> 00:11:06,540
Any what's called an irrigation supply will have it. And if you call them and they don't have it in stock, it's embarrassing for them. So they'll say we'll have it tomorrow or two days for you.

96
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:19,540
Right. Shame on you for not having it right because there's a shop here of Ferguson's when I called them. They said, oh, we're out of one inch schedule lady. Well, we'll have a stick for you tomorrow.

97
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:33,540
Shame on you probably, so for legitimate plumbing supply, you don't have schedule lady one inch by Wow. A comprehensive hardware store will have it. There's a hardware store here on 22nd Street that's got everything and they have it.

98
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:43,540
And they could sell it if you find a really good hardware store. They will sell it to you by the intro by the foot. So you don't have to get a 10-foot stick. Just get a three-foot piece.

99
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:59,540
For two hardware stores that I could think of here in town that have it, but do not. Now, well, I shouldn't say do not do not use the white stuff or the CPV state see the schedule 4040 is the white PVC that you see at home depot.

100
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:12,540
And there's also this yellow stuff. It's for high temperature same size copper as copper. It's called CPVC. Don't use that either. Both that's crap. Now you can if if you want to practice bending pipe,

101
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:25,540
you might say, well, I'll use the crap plastic, but you'll have a bad experience bending it because the wall is so thin when you heat the pipe to bend at the wall will collapse and you won't it won't have a circular profile anymore. The pipe will be real flat.

102
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:35,540
So you won't have any there's no there's no sense that because how do I know this? The first scalerator I put up in the chat nine months ago was made out of schedule 40.

103
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:45,540
And it did come out really well on the bend, but it's the only one that I've ever done that came out really well the first one every time I try to use a schedule 40 repeat on it.

104
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:54,540
It just deformed too much. I didn't like it. So the schedule 80 is the way to go do not use the schedule 40 or the CPVC or whatever.

105
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:00,540
Now just to volunteer, there's someone while back that did something with packs.

106
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:18,540
I like the way I'm crossing polyethylene tubing. I like that chemically because the only thing PECs will release into the water for about a week or two and when it's put in service is a little bit of ammonia and some nitrates and once it cleans that out from the industrial manufacturing.

107
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:33,540
It's a very inert material as a matter of fact polyethylene pipe or PECs tubing with varieties there's PECs A there's PECs B don't confuse it with poly butylene, which is not PECs or polyethylene.

108
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:45,540
It's a multi-layered stranded kind of like the soda, you know, the two liter soda bottles that kind of plastic very difficult to bend it has a high internal resistance and memory.

109
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:51,540
And the only way to make a scale rate or out of that is by really hitting it with a lot of heat. We'll talk about that.

110
00:13:51,540 --> 00:14:00,540
And when it's complete, it needs to fit into a form that has braces that hold it in place. Braces just like you put braces on someone's teeth.

111
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:07,540
Every few inches you need to have somehow cinch it down and you always want to use non-ferrous material around it.

112
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:19,540
Someone had put a picture of very industrial individual chat that did a double one and I saw, you know, magnetic hardware around it and that's a no-no but we'll get into that in the future.

113
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,540
You know, all is forgiven because I haven't disclosed the important parts, right?

114
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,540
So if you put one together of peanut butter and chewing gum, I'm not going to laugh at you.

115
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:42,540
Because you don't know, but when you know, I still won't laugh at you because you're at least you're making an effort. But in terms of tubing, schedule 80 is the way to go for many reasons.

116
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:49,540
In the primary reason would be manufacturing you're making it so it maintains a shape and secondary reason it will be universally accepted.

117
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,540
No questions asked.

118
00:14:51,540 --> 00:15:11,540
Schedule 40 is garbage schedule and CPVC is garbage all other forms of CPVC or garbage for this application. It will not even if you successfully bend it with without deformation, it is not durable enough for the field.

119
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:21,540
And again, the PECS is a more high purity plastic. It's used in, you know, laboratories and pharmaceutical grade, but it will not hold the shape.

120
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:29,540
You're going to have to go through a process where you're going to have to make a form that holds it into that position.

121
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:39,540
And because it's a multi-stranded, multi-layered plastic, I believe separation, internal separation might happen in the pipe.

122
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:47,540
So for now, it would be schedule 80, that's a schedule 80.

123
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,540
That would be the way to go.

124
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,540
That was a good question.

125
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:59,540
And it was drifting away from the length, but 34 inches ought to do it for a five and one quarter inch magnet.

126
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:09,540
It depends purely on your magnet size. And if you're using a smaller diameter, five and a quarter is a good for one inch or up to one and a quarter.

127
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,540
If you're using a half inch or three quarter pipe, you go ahead and use a four and a half inch magnet.

128
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:23,540
The standard for magnets, non-metric ones, they go basically three, three and a half, four, four and a half, five and a half.

129
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:30,540
And they kind of dead end around that size. You can get a six inch magnet. They're kind of hard to find.

130
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:36,540
I'll get into the magnets. They get real pricey and they're hard to find.

131
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,540
So you're going to need about three feet of pipe to experiment with.

132
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,540
Thanks for that question.

133
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:47,540
So great. We're getting ready to do our first magnet reactor in there.

134
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:53,540
We're coming up to the pipe stage for the first one. Do you recommend to redo all like the copper leaves?

135
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,540
I'm going to get into that.

136
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,540
Okay. That's the next question. Yeah. Let's go right into it right now.

137
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,540
Okay.

138
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:07,540
No, not necessary. I'll drop an image of the first one that I made and sent out and that was tested.

139
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,540
I'll drop it in right now.

140
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:18,540
And if you're on the chat, which I'm sure you could just look in there. Let's see. I have it on another account. Let's just.

141
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,540
This is number one. This is a scalarator zero zero zero one.

142
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:32,540
That's made of a schedule 80. I'll even, and this is it right here. I'm going to forward it to the group right now.

143
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,540
And let me know when it comes up. Done just sent it said done.

144
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,540
If you're in front there, can you see it?

145
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:46,540
That's the first one ever made the second one ever made first one in schedule 80.

146
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:51,540
This one was made without a jig just bending it around the magnet as you see.

147
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:58,540
You got is that a Roger? Do you see it? Yep. George. Yep. Cool. Okay. You could just click on that load up zoom in.

148
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:05,540
Yeah. She's real ugly. She's so ugly. She's pretty, right?

149
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:12,540
Yep. And the dots you see there. That's the south side. If you flip it over, that's the north side of the magnet.

150
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:20,540
I mean, it looks brutalist. You know, if you look at it, you know, the brutalist architecture style. I mean, it looks like you could take that into battle.

151
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:26,540
Or it looks like real steam punk, right? Especially with the copper.

152
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:32,540
So there you go. And I'll get into the magnets and why it looks that way and why in those support tabs and all that.

153
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:40,540
This is number two. As you can see, I like to brag. I don't build junk. Anything I build always looks good.

154
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,540
Always did that since I was eight years old.

155
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:50,540
What I used to do was fifth grade science fair. I walked in with my science project and all the teachers jumped up. So you can't bring that in here.

156
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:56,540
You got to bring a project that you did not the adults built for you. And I'm like, no, I made this. No, you didn't.

157
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:03,540
I had the parents come down until now you made it all on his own and they're all like running around with their mouths open.

158
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:09,540
So I do brag about my skills. Yeah, unions on the end. That's right.

159
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:19,540
Unions are durable. The nice thing about unions is if you're cutting into a, is you referring to the photo.

160
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:29,540
Let's say, remember, this is a utilitarian project. This is not jerk off technology. It's not like a bread a filter where you just turn on your spout and board in there.

161
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:40,540
You know, this stuff to talk about doing the ghetto style water purification. This is utilitarian stuff. This is where you know, you're going to flip freak your parents out if you live with your mom and you say, mom, I'm going to go cut the water.

162
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:49,540
And put this thing in there from this guy on the internet. It ain't going to work. This is not known. This is not for those situations. This is heavy duty utilitarian stuff.

163
00:19:49,540 --> 00:20:01,540
So George, I understand you, you might know about the trades. So the reason we're using unions here is that let's say we go to field and we cut out about 12 and a half inches of pipe to drop this in.

164
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:15,540
We fit it with it doesn't matter what the other pipe is iron copper plastic. There's adapters and we adapt with the union and what's great about the union is you buy two sets to pair so for.

165
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:21,540
And you fix the piece of pipe that you removed to put the scalerator and with another set of unions.

166
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:40,540
So in case you have a hard time or you want to take it out, the piece of pipe you cut out is fitted with the unions also. So you just go back to where you put the scalerator and pull it out and slip the original pipe that you cut out with the other set of unions and you're done. You feel any.

167
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:47,540
Okay, you don't have to you could type. That's fine. That's why we use the unions.

168
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,540
And we need two spanners.

169
00:20:51,540 --> 00:21:00,540
Okay, when you use the unions don't use spanner one, you see spanner thinks we're bringing that up that my mind just went there.

170
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:05,540
Even an emergency, you should use what's called a strap wrench on a union.

171
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:16,540
Even if the union is made of steel or brass, not plastic because the spanner is any spanner you're not going to get a 12 point socket or six point socket around that.

172
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:25,540
It's going to be a spanner that has a three point contact jaw maximum and it crushes you're not going to grab it with a channel lock or anything or a pipe of spanner.

173
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:38,540
And what is strap wrench is what looks just like it sounds usually a piece of rubber around something that looks like a holding block and it cinches you cinch it down and you turn it.

174
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:45,540
I've seen people use channel locks and spanners on unions and it's a no no there's actually tools for it.

175
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:58,540
And then you just split tools that are made for them get it from the manufacturer that's the only disadvantage. Now if you got a firm handshake and you don't have a week chin, you could pretty much tighten down a union by hand.

176
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:07,540
Give it about a minute or two, let it arrest, especially if you use a O ring grease come back by hand and lock it down again by hand.

177
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:17,540
The only problem with locking it down by hand, you may not get enough torque that you would when there's thermal expansion and contraction, even with a spanner with something that has a large flange like a union.

178
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:24,540
You could lock it down. I think it's 15 to 16 foot pounds depending on the size.

179
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:36,540
And Newton meters, they've got the specs written on there for tightening when there when the temperature changes, you might come back and say, hey, it feels a little looser than it did or you know, or might get a little tighter than it did based on temperature.

180
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:47,540
So whenever you lock a union down, you lock it down, unless you're in a big hurry, give it about a minute or two to relax and then go ahead and torque it again with a strap wrench or strap handles.

181
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:57,540
Never use a channel lock or wrench. And if you're going to use a regular spanner on a union, don't tell me that you did, please. I don't want to know.

182
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:09,540
Good question. Anything else before we move on to the copper? I knew the picture would throw off the, for more questions.

183
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,540
OK.

184
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:20,540
So the next question, like George asked about the copper, the other question here is, you know, I've ordered the magnet. Do you have any guidance recommendations on buying the following?

185
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:32,540
This one was the pipe. What is it made of? Second is pure copper leaf for magnet coding. And I'm going to combine that with the next question, also, which is barium titanate.

186
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:39,540
And now the pure copper leaf came about several ways.

187
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:49,540
Not necessary. As you see in that first picture, that first one was great. And everyone after that with all the other improvements is great also.

188
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:59,540
Not necessary. I had a vision of people showing this to people and I've had people say, looks like a turbo looks like a break rotor, you know, all the stuff you get.

189
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:13,540
I like that initial commentary. And just waking up one morning, I got a flash in my head from building loudspeakers on using a ferrida ring on it, which is a copper band because there's a EMF going on.

190
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:28,540
Electromotive force whenever you move water that has conductive minerals in and around the magnet. And the way you damp out EMF, electrically, MF is by using what's called a ferrida ring copper ferrida ring. So I got into the idea of coding the magnets with copper.

191
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:33,540
And then also when someone looks at it, they don't scream break rotor. Right.

192
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:48,540
So there's no fault in that. It's just kind of annoying most people anyway, by the way have two modes with me. It's annoying and very annoying. So I figured if I could just keep it down and annoying, that'd be good. And I figured I'd code it with copper and also acts as a ferrida ring.

193
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:57,540
And I asked around for some copper prices, custom made, you know, stamped pieces and prices were outrageous.

194
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:04,540
So I said, well, this is the thickness of the copper matter. Yes, it does, but let's just start off with some copper.

195
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:12,540
And then the other thing was I have some barium titanate laying around. I have it in putty form and powder form. You can you're on your own with that folks.

196
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:25,540
Ebay sells it. You'll find it in common products like tooth filler. They there's a temporary tooth filler. If you have a tooth filling pharmacy has a little thing they've your filling falls out.

197
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:38,540
White putty in there, stuff the hole until you see a dentist. That's made of barium titanate to putty. You could dilute it with water. Barium titanate is also used in the ceramic engine coding.

198
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:44,540
They have these ceramic additive nano additives, whatever you put in your car engine in your motor oil.

199
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:57,540
Well, liquid molly makes one has barium tetanate, but I don't recommend using that one because it's oil based on Ebay and laboratory supply places they sell it in powder or putty form.

200
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:12,540
It's used in the dental industry. It's used in as a dielectric. It's used as a thermal grease. If ever worked on amplifiers and you look at where the transistors are mounted to the heat sink, you'll see a white paste that's a barium titanate also.

201
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:19,540
It's used in every common material, not something that your mom has in her cupboard, but it's common nonetheless industrially.

202
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:29,540
It is expensive, but it'll end up costing anywhere between one to five dollars a gram, which in regular math it's a thousand dollars a pound or whatever. You don't need that much.

203
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:41,540
I pick barium titanate because it's an extremely dielectric substance, extremely dielectric. It has some funky electrical properties, especially when you put it in the mid zone where you have magnetism and electricity mingling.

204
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:48,540
It has some interesting properties also because I went with the copper leaf, the gilding process.

205
00:26:48,540 --> 00:27:00,540
I decided to add the barium titanate paste into the gilding glue and where do you get that? I get mine from place called hobby lobby.

206
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:07,540
It's real cheap. Pack of 25 sheets of pure copper leaf is about three dollars.

207
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:16,540
You need about six sheets to do a magnet on both sides, so actually more like ten sheets because I do three coats.

208
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:22,540
And I have a copper leaf paint, a little water based that I would also add in some of the barium titanate too.

209
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:28,540
Just follow instructions on how to do gilding or applying a gold leaf or copper leaf.

210
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:35,540
It doesn't matter what metal leaf, the gilding process leaf is plenty of YouTube's on it. You need to practice.

211
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:40,540
And then you have the gilding process.

212
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:45,540
And then you have the gilding process leaf.

213
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,540
And then you have the gilding process leaf.

214
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,540
And then you have the gilding process leaf.

215
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:58,540
And then you have the gilding process leaf.

216
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:05,540
So when people saw it, you know, because magnets have that common color, most people in the world are familiar with it.

217
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,540
That's that, you know, anthracite, that dark gray blackish color.

218
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,540
Oh, it's a magnet.

219
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:16,540
But if you flash some copper, just like you know, flashing a badge or something, they know they get mesmerized, right?

220
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:22,540
Most people look at the coating, but I did notice that the ones that have the coating tend to be more robust in their function.

221
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:28,540
So it's very valid because it's very prominent when you look at the scalerator to see that bright copper.

222
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:34,540
And then when I mentioned very empty, it's like, oh my gosh, what's going on here? There's more than meets the eye. Yes, there is.

223
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:40,540
But what basically meets the eye about the scalerator, which is the pipe spool, the pipe wrapped around the magnet.

224
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:45,540
And just the magnet is really 99.9% of the job done.

225
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:53,540
And I'd say when you add the copper and the barium titinate in the glue for the copper, I'd say it's about 2% more.

226
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:59,540
A lot of people say it does not enough to matter, but everything matters because it's cumulative as you improve the process.

227
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:02,540
So these are the major questions so far.

228
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:11,540
I'm going to pause right here for anybody got anything else to say.

229
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:21,540
For you guys a question. Yeah, all right. Is there a way to measure or do you have an idea of the ratio, very of a titinate you would put in the glue and speaking of the glue.

230
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,540
I'm surprised it's water based not rubber.

231
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:33,540
Yeah, I would. Okay, the reason why you use water base is because when you use a metal leaf, you got to put a coating on it.

232
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:38,540
And I found the most otherwise rub off or oxidize. It's not very durable.

233
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:44,540
The best coating bar none is just plain old lacquer spray lacquer, not acrylic clear coat. That's junk.

234
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:53,540
But the old fashioned spray lacquer, if it doesn't say lacquer on spray cans or bottle, you know, you buy it a little half pint of it at the hobby store.

235
00:29:53,540 --> 00:30:00,540
It's junk. Don't get acrylic clear coat. So basically the clear coat that I end up finishing it with is lacquer.

236
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:05,540
And if you have an oil based on the glue, the lacquer will release it and you'll have a big mess.

237
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:12,540
So the standard right now is water based as a matter of fact, if you go look at gilding that was done hundreds of years ago, it was also water based.

238
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:18,540
It was made out of rabbit hide and egg whites.

239
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:25,540
So the reason I use the water base, you put it on let it get tacky 10 to one dilution.

240
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:35,540
So I dilute my paste, my barium titanate paste. So it's a very fine flowing paste. Flows more than ketchup.

241
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:43,540
And I add that to my glue and then a little bit of distilled water. And it doesn't really change the viscosity until I don't change the viscosity to the glue 10 to one.

242
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:49,540
So it's a really small fraction of barium titanate. There used to be, I did some experiments with barium titanate.

243
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:56,540
It's one of these materials that, what are these miracle materials when you mix magnetism and electricity. You don't need much.

244
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:06,540
You just need the presence of it to start working, especially if anyone remembers 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago, there was a craze.

245
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,540
With building crystal cells like batteries that never run out, right?

246
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:17,540
Or the way you recharge them is by shorting the battery out with David Hutchinson or actually what's the John Hutchinson.

247
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:23,540
And that was there, and John Bidini, they're building these crystal cells, they were just light up in LED light forever kind of thing.

248
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:29,540
And what they didn't tell people is they use all these salts with a tiny amount of barium titanate.

249
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:34,540
So I was always, I've always been enamored with it. And I said, let's add some.

250
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:41,540
But we're using a, the standard water base. If you go on hobby lobby or any hobby shops,

251
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:53,540
art shops that sells leaf material, copper leaf, and you ask them what glue to use. Most of the glue is available in the most preferred ones on the water based one.

252
00:31:53,540 --> 00:32:00,540
And you apply it quickly and it dries to attack. It never dries hard. It always stays tacky.

253
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:05,540
And the barium titanate goes in with that glue, just a tiny amount, 10 to 1, I'd say.

254
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:23,540
And the nine parts, so the glue to one part, very heavily diluted barium titanate. And if you find that it made the glue too thick, you could, you could, you could fin it out with a little bit of alcohol and water, just tiny amount of alcohol, not too much because I could sometimes coagulate and curdle the glue.

255
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:32,540
So, yeah, part of me is like at the such early in the game to bring up the barium titanate is too fine of a point.

256
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:41,540
And I'm enamored by its properties that I just want to bring up everything in serial fashion, everything that I discovered to this point.

257
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:46,540
Is that okay to that help?

258
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,540
Yes, it did. Thank you.

259
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:57,540
Anything else regarding the pipe and the coatings because we haven't really gotten into the magnets, which we will.

260
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:03,540
The magnets, are you using an adhesive to glue them together to make them smaller?

261
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:07,540
Yep, yep, like get into how to make that.

262
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:14,540
And the next thing is a device to measure TDS, not necessary. I'll give a story again that I keep finding repeated.

263
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,540
A TDS meter, yes or no, you know, it's up to you.

264
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:23,540
You know, explain why measurements and lab tests are not important with this in minutes.

265
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:29,540
Okay, so what can the Mark 1 be connected to this continuing on this email?

266
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:34,540
What can the Mark 1 be connected to for testing purposes? Is that a garden hose size? Yes.

267
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:38,540
Now, here's the thing about it. I don't know if I've mentioned it enough and I will again.

268
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:48,540
If you send the Mark 1 or a scalerator to a lab for tested, they will show that it doesn't do anything, no change to the water whatsoever because their standard with devices are.

269
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:53,540
They attach it to a water source and most labs, by the way, do not provide that kind of service.

270
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,540
Most labs of test water just work on samples.

271
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:05,540
They have a standard sample size, 500 milliliter that you give them and they just take drops out of the bottle like a bunch of idiots and tested like that.

272
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:13,540
There's very few labs that you'll find at all that will test the device like the scalerator because you need a running water source and they just don't do that.

273
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,540
They just don't do that.

274
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:27,540
They have the corporations that have labs that do things like that or whatever, but if you find one that does, they will show that it has absolutely no change on the water because they hook it up to the end of a hose and they use it like a nozzle.

275
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:33,540
You know, imagine hook it up the scalerator like a nozzle on the end of a hose and you squirt and water through it or whatever.

276
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:42,540
A crazy willy out on everything wet. It doesn't do anything. It needs to have at least 20, 30, 40, 50 feet of pipe in front of it.

277
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:47,540
It's called runner length. You got to have a runner length in front of it.

278
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:54,540
And the more runner length, the better. Yes, you're right. So how much does more runner length, the better? I don't know.

279
00:34:54,540 --> 00:35:00,540
I don't know, but the more runner lengths, the better and under pressure, the better.

280
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:07,540
Okay, so that's it. Hopefully we'll answer that. How do you test it? This is a utilitarian. This is not jerk off technology.

281
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:15,540
You know, like bread of filters or jerk off technology, right? You just anybody go to Walmart, get one pour water in it, pour water out, you think you're done.

282
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:21,540
This is not, you know, for people living in their mom's basement, she'll kick you out if you bring this up.

283
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:25,540
This is utility stuff. This is where you got to go be a man.

284
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:33,540
Trench out a hole, cut the water main and fasten it in. You're going to have skills and you're going to have that balls and confidence.

285
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:44,540
Okay, so basically again, reiterate the question, what can the mark one be connected to for testing purposes? Is that a garden hose size? Yes, but you got to have garden hose in front of it.

286
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:55,540
So you buy two garden hoses. However, you're going to connect it with a short length and imagine the longer part of the garden hose 30, 40, 50 feet is in front of the device.

287
00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:07,540
And you block it off with a valve or a nozzle. So when you pressurize the entire line and then let water out and then you'll see what it really does.

288
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:12,540
Okay, I'll acquire material soon as I can play around little would like to chat so you're okay.

289
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,540
All right, now the next question.

290
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:25,540
Let's see you go now. Well, then I'll get I don't know if the magnet. Okay, first magnet are arriving tomorrow. Okay, here we go.

291
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:35,540
Another email, same individual. Barium, tonight is a little more confusing. Are you making a mixture? Are you applying it? I think I went over that.

292
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:49,540
Pipe bending techniques, the hot sand method. What do you think? Yep, absolutely. And I think that's it for the questions from this individual and I will continue.

293
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:56,540
Yes, someone just put a comment, Bruce 90 degree bends in create simulated, increased length.

294
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:10,540
They do a 90 degree bend, simulate runner length, you could find lab reports, old reference books on water flow through pipe and then how 90 degree bends, not sweeps, but sweeps also how they reduce flow.

295
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:21,540
I estimate that I'm adding a 90 degree bend in a runner of plumbing is the same as adding anywhere between six to 10 feet of pipe is the consequence.

296
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:39,540
And I do find that when you add 90 degree bends directly in front and behind it does work a little bit better. Yes, for some reason it's he's this dead end, you know, that it has to go around and it seems to improve the, you know, improve the, the effect.

297
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:45,540
Now, I just got to keep interjecting this thing has only been in existence on the surface of the earth as far as I can tell for 10 months.

298
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:59,540
Maybe a little, yeah, a little less than that. I'm the only one that could pretty much act as the boss on the subject and I want to change that that's why I'm doing this on other people to get involved in this.

299
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:08,540
So yes, we're still learning we're going to keep learning because this is not the water businesses, the physics business and start playing around with it and seeing what it does, you'll find out what.

300
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:15,540
Right, so let's just jump into the magnets and Georgie or if you anyone was ready to build it is going to be jumping off the bit about the magnet.

301
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,540
When I first hooked this up.

302
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:32,540
I turned on the water and I was like, OK, I noticed the water is kind of fizzy fuzzy and I'm thinking, you know, I want to get away from the front and back of the magnet, which is the north and south pole as much as possible.

303
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:40,540
And I know by looking at diagrams, even though they're false, if you want to correct diagram with the magnetic flux lines look like look up Ken Wheeler's book.

304
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:50,540
Thank you guys will be in just put in Ken Wheeler magnetism, go to images and you'll see what the magnetic field lines look like and you'll see where the domain the block wall is.

305
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:57,540
There still is some influence from the what I call the centrifugal part of the magnet, you know, the north and south.

306
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:11,540
And in my mind intuitively it hit me like, how can we minimize and bend those fields that are the north, south, poles, the faces that everyone is used to and everyone is thinking about when you mentioned the word magnet.

307
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:15,540
I want to pull them away from the center axis of that domain.

308
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,540
I don't I do that.

309
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:26,540
How about I stack smaller circumference or smaller diameter magnets that will tuck the field in and make it more of a period.

310
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:31,540
Of a pyramid right it'll bring the field away from the outer part of the magnet.

311
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:40,540
So I grabbed two small max slapped them on real quick is that wow water quality changed got more got sweeter got lighter that fizziness went away.

312
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:54,540
And I stacked on some more mags not much of a change took them off not much of a change, but as soon as I took off the outer two magnets and just had the big one that that fizziness came back again I was like with the three inch magnets as you see in the photo that proportions.

313
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:59,540
That's a five in a quarter outer three in a quarter or three in an eighth inner.

314
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:09,540
There's nothing special about the proportions you could use a smaller magnet but in the five in a quarter magnet it's got a two and a half inch hole so you're not going to put a two and a half inch magnet.

315
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,540
It's going to fall right in the hole.

316
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:23,540
So I did plenty of experimentation with removing the outer magnets mean the smaller magnets left it on the either space and just having a single magnet and there's a big difference in anyone who's already experimented with the space.

317
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:28,540
I did with the scalerator would a test I believe to the same.

318
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:32,540
If you just use a single magnet you'll notice an effect on the water.

319
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:41,540
But if you add a smaller magnet on each face correspondingly you'll notice an even bigger effect immediately and go ahead and someone does anyone's done it chime in give me some feedback.

320
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:46,540
So that's what I've noticed with repeatedly.

321
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:53,540
Okay, how do you connect the magnets? Well, they're magnets when you attach those magnets don't do anything funny.

322
00:40:53,540 --> 00:41:00,540
You just put them on correspondingly how they would go normally like you were sticking something to a fridge on the face of a piece of metal.

323
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:09,540
So the the north side of one of the smaller magnet goes to the south side of the big magnet and the south side of the small magnet goes to the north side of the big magnet.

324
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:22,540
And when you place the magnets over the two smaller outer magnets over the single larger magnet in the center you'll notice that sometimes if you move them around they want to jump off.

325
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:25,540
Yes, that's right because there are field reversals happening.

326
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:35,540
So just center them and rotate them clockwise or counterclockwise you'll find they'll settle in and you'll center up and you go and do a visual center on them.

327
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:52,540
And if you look through the whole the smaller magnets cover the larger hole and you have access to the back of the smaller magnet and what I do is I put a few drops all around once I got them centered of a sine or acrylic acrylic glue which is crazy glue.

328
00:41:52,540 --> 00:42:03,540
You could use the you could use the gel or you could use the flow you know what they call minute glue crazy glue, sine or acrylic, sono, or athletic whatever the chemical term is, crazy glue.

329
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,540
It's very cheap.

330
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:20,540
And the gap between the faces of the magnet creates a capillary zone. So the moment you put that glue in there which it also likes that it will creep in between the the back face of the smaller outer magnet in the large face of the.

331
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:34,540
The larger magnet and it'll creep in there and immediately harden and dry once you put drops of glue every 120 degrees or every 90 degrees immediately hardens up.

332
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:42,540
And another way to make that glue hard enough is water vapor or water spray or by the way nothing special.

333
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:53,540
And just played around with broken magnets and shit magnets and I've just put a just placed them together how they normally go and put a little drop of glue in the corner and try to separate them they will not separate.

334
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,540
You could soak them in acetone.

335
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:09,540
And that would do it now you could use five minute epoxy not necessary in other words you don't have to add any kind of adhesive between the magnet faces meaning the faces of the smaller to the larger magnet not not necessary.

336
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:19,540
You may and you don't even have to use a fast setting glue use a slow again setting glue the if you add the glue if it's a liquid a low enough viscosity.

337
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:37,540
The cavity inside the large magnet you will see the internal faces of the outer small magnets just put your glue in that in your room and it will suck through and and grab you don't need to do any special adhesive because remember once these magnets settle in and they're not shifting around they'll just stay in place anyway.

338
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,540
That's what they do that's why they're called magnets right.

339
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:50,540
So that's what I've been using is just basically the crazy glue the side of a crew glue I get it from Wal-Mart Harbor freight whatever the cheap stuff that flows.

340
00:43:50,540 --> 00:44:03,540
I use a pipe that goes a fitting a shim and once I think my first magnet is centered I slide my paper shim through to align the other magnets so they're aligned is a line in critical.

341
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:16,540
So I just know what's more in critical is the magnetic field lines are aligned again because as you place the smaller magnet on the larger magnet notice they do attract you know you put them on how they normally would attract but they like to bounce around a little bit so you just count.

342
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:29,540
Root just rotate them like a tuning knob and you'll find the lock into place makes everybody happy you know that people sitting next to each other on an airplane for a long trip right you want to be comfortable.

343
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:37,540
That good enough to work you get anything else because you're the only one that brought up the magnet using.

344
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:40,540
Yeah that was spot on.

345
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:56,540
Cool now remember don't get crazy with the glue I mean no pun intended when you put the smaller magnet on the larger magnet face if you look inside you'll see you see the faces of the all the magnets you could just run a beat of anything in there plenty strong.

346
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:13,540
Yeah just recap the smaller of the south side to the larger on the north right and then yeah just like they normally would go yeah don't don't try to reverse anything you know you'll know by the way if you go north to north you'll know you're doing that it will not want to go right.

347
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:20,540
You just put the magnets how they want to go now when I work with magnets I mark them all the big I got a red marker and a white marker.

348
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:40,540
I mark all my faces just to be easy because I get kind of fancy with the magnets when you buy a magnet it's it's cut off of a block and all that and then mag you know cured metal and ceramics and all that it's got some really sharp edges when you order a magnet and you take it out of a container you you could cut yourself on that edge of the magnet sometimes it's so sharp it's not.

349
00:45:40,540 --> 00:46:00,540
It's not a deeper or anything I put the magnets on a laid spin them and I have a large diamond pad and I round off the edges if you look at the photo I think if you could zoom in on the photo that I dropped with the copper magnets when they come when the magnetic reactor is done you could zoom in on that pick right there real close.

350
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:17,540
I'm going to zoom in use them in real close you'll see there's about a two millimeter millimeter and a half radius on those magnets they're rounded off on the edges now that I mentioned it you can see it you could zoom really zoom in on that you'll see that the edges on those magnets from round it off.

351
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:35,540
Now that I made another discovery doing that when you spin a large and I spin a round off the edges before I assemble them so you want to round off the corresponding edges on the smaller magnets if you're going to do it I don't recommend building these early ones that you do that but I just do that.

352
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:50,540
When you by the way when you spin a magnet in the lay that about 600 RPM and you start putting friction on it whatever you're touching on there is going to go red hot right away and it shouldn't hint hint.

353
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:52,540
Let me repeat that.

354
00:46:52,540 --> 00:47:04,540
What we could do with a little bit of fine tuning is get a solar panel and a little battery spinning a large magnet with a flywheel little bit of friction you run some fluid through that you'll heat your house.

355
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:07,540
Was a 12 volt battery.

356
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:22,540
You know what you're doing you could super heat anything with a rotating magnetic field and you need a little bit of friction you'll be making other words you put 100 watts of power and you'll get 150 200 watts of heat out of it is the free energy I don't know you tell me.

357
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:37,540
And when I started running because you want to run my diamond abrasive pads on to round off these magnets I had to keep them really wet the moment the moisture and the water the cutting fluid stop there's just water.

358
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:49,540
It got red hot anything that touched it right immediately just you know I started an experiment I noticed that you can create tremendous amount of calorie heat with rotating magnets and a small amount of friction.

359
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:54,540
Anybody wants to go down that route you got to go for it now just gave you a big hint.

360
00:47:54,540 --> 00:48:05,540
Right in form of we get as big as Westinghouse or general electric one is big companies we can open we can have 10 different departments doing things with what we've discovered with the scalerie or.

361
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,540
But I doubt that's going to happen.

362
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,540
But about the relay.

363
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:14,540
Okay the relay what relay.

364
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:21,540
Last seminar you said that we can relay the reactors.

365
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:30,540
The the turbidorator is another device. Yeah, in other words we can know we can make a new type of relay because we've discovered also a play in our magnetic field which I'll get into.

366
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,540
I want to introduce the turbidorator.

367
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:38,540
Yeah, we know what relay switching relays are right they're basically electromagnets.

368
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:46,540
And they have a certain field size and a certain functions and they do have problems when you put them in metal cases next to each other whatever.

369
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:55,540
But now I know how to make a plane or magnetic field meaning when you look at any magnetic field at the face on the opposite field is on the backside.

370
00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:03,540
Well I know how to make a magnet where you look at let's say the north end of the magnet but on the opposite side there it's a north also.

371
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:08,540
South goes 90 degrees to it every time. Right.

372
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:13,540
Very power it's amazing when you rotate that sucker you get other phenomenon.

373
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:24,540
We'll share this in new time on a different call let's say we'll start a different subject and that I probably will start doing more like video stuff shorts.

374
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:37,540
I'll just take a video of the phenomenon and show you the setup right because it's more elaborate than this the mark one the scale or you couldn't come up with anything simpler than that there's only two components.

375
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:42,540
The magnetic reactor and spool of fight and the rest of it is embellishing.

376
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,540
You couldn't come up with a simpler device no one can you know.

377
00:49:45,540 --> 00:50:03,540
I mean they're put it this way it couldn't get any simpler than this the turbiterator which is a three part device that uses this plane or magnetic fields is a little more complex actually a lot more complicated but still requires the same skill set if you can build this you can build that.

378
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:07,540
It's more elaborate and we'll get into that as time goes on.

379
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:13,540
Right you could see right now you don't know what the turbiterator is or does you're not missing anything are you.

380
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:16,540
Well just what you said.

381
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:21,540
Yeah well it leads like someone said you're not in the water business you're in the physics business.

382
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:42,540
Because no one's using the block wall no one at all at a patent reviewer keep sending me patents for weeks and weeks look at all these patents with magnetic treatment of water I went through none of them are like this they're all using the face of the North and South they're all hitting the fluid with the they want to all these different ways of how magnets should face the water I'm like I'm not doing that.

383
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:57,540
As a matter of fact you want to shut down the scale orator from working go ahead and hook it up and then get yourself a big bar magnet or whatever and sandwich it put the magnet right on pipe just like everybody else does watch what happens boom stops working.

384
00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:11,540
Yep this is an amazing amazing amazing there is no one with a capital W that is doing this running the fluids exclusively solely over the block wall only and with

385
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:31,540
purpose with purpose I've had dozens of patents people send me and not a one is doing this not a one no one everyone's getting creative with because you know they're still locked into that eight year old nine year old it's a magnet you know so you got to use the side that we all know about right.

386
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:40,540
North or South right oh should we should we put the North and North or South and South or North and South none of it none of it avoid that avoid that.

387
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:55,540
So yeah so that's basically the magnetic reactor and then there's the fitting when you when you wrap your pipe and it cools down and all that around the magnet you'll find sometimes it's too tight go ahead and file away some of that material.

388
00:51:55,540 --> 00:52:08,540
If it's too loose you want to put some epoxy a non not JB weld because it has iron in it use a clear epoxy or use PC 11 I'm a big fan of PC 11.

389
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:34,540
Look it up that's p peter Charlie number 11 epoxy and you just build up some material every 90 degrees on the magnet not you don't have to slop the whole edge in the magnet you know in other words if the magnet sloppy doesn't go it's it flops around flops through the pipe I like to fit the magnetic reactor into the pipe like a nice slip fit a tight slip fit even a mild press fit.

390
00:52:34,540 --> 00:53:03,540
I don't like it sloping around because it has to be centered you do a visual center when you along the pipe if you center the the magnetic reactor the large magnet in the center of the pipe visually in three locations opposite each other she centered she's good to go must be centered first one I did I stuck the magnet I'll drop a photo of the first one.

391
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:17,540
Again when I put it in there I just push the magnet in the pipe and after I installed the magnet when a stew and I noticed the water got crappy magnet was still in there but it was not centered.

392
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:23,540
So I started moving the mess let me just visually centered it and I grabbed it with some zip ties.

393
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:38,540
And the water got really good and then I moved the magnet water got crappy wasn't centered. That's another it's a very critical thing that the block wall the domain wall is centered along the main path as much as possible.

394
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:48,540
And I'll drop a photo and show you what a ghetto radar looks like the first one ever made I'll show you what it looks like on the install.

395
00:53:48,540 --> 00:53:54,540
It's real ugly because I did it real fast this is the foundation wall.

396
00:53:54,540 --> 00:54:06,540
I did it real fast like you know over like a half a pack of cigarettes and five cups of coffee in the morning so excited to get it in there soon I got some daylight you know.

397
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:17,540
And there it is and that one's dated around April 18 of 2023 so I don't know if you guys got that picture somebody just chime in if you got it you can see it.

398
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:23,540
Yes and if that if that's not ghetto I don't know what it is.

399
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:33,540
You could see I was in a hurry there's no unions at schedule 40 it's magic marker you know I did my my line up where I was going to cut things and I just.

400
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:41,540
Bold marker I just make sure when you stick it in with the glue because it's that hot glue it's called hot PVC got five seconds.

401
00:54:41,540 --> 00:55:02,540
Once you slip it in then you can't move it right so so let me make some bold marks and it was wet it was yeah and and you could see the magnet Scott this is after I before I buried it or closed off the area I can get to it pretty well because it's got sand around it and a hat at cover access cover now but.

402
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:11,540
Reason I got the zip ties there isn't I didn't even bother bonding the magnet magnetic reactor anything but I know she was really off center.

403
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:21,540
And you can see the bend is not really that great you know the the upper pipe on the return doesn't bend down and line up with the lower pipe at all like it does later on.

404
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:34,540
And it still works is because I've got majority of the pipe centered and it's just zip ties and that's the first one this is the first desperate attempt to get it manifest.

405
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:38,540
And boy was it was it worth it.

406
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:46,540
Now if you if you scroll up to the gray one that I just dropped in the images you could see the big formative difference there.

407
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:53,540
That's the second one that I built a week later by contemplating how it should be done.

408
00:55:53,540 --> 00:56:06,540
Okay and I do apply tabs I don't know you could go back and see photos of other ones I do make plastic tabs if you if you guys recall the ones that if you scroll up.

409
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:21,540
Ones that are in the cases. By the way there's a pick someone put there about a Lord kelvin's experimenting Andrew where he splits the water flow now just ignore that no it says nothing to do with anything like that.

410
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:26,540
If you scroll up I don't know if I have the wildrop.

411
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:40,540
What I'm going to do just for finishing purposes I'm going to go see the other account here that will forward another image of if you were to order one from me.

412
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,540
And the check is in the mail like they say and I know you're going to pay for it.

413
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:50,540
You will I will get one of these to you you're going to settle with me on it.

414
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:57,540
I'll be if you act professional with me I will be very professional with you kind of thing right.

415
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:00,540
You will get one.

416
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:13,540
That looks like this is the shorty I call it because the ones below are a little larger I'm going to drop an image here again use you guys are probably seen these before.

417
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:20,540
We'll get something that looks like that in a very nice military grade pressurized case.

418
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:24,540
Right it's got a nice finish to it.

419
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:29,540
Or you'll get the larger model that has some fittings on it.

420
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:35,540
That will look like this let's see I'll send you a forward this one.

421
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:42,540
Or you'll get the larger it's still one they're both one inch pipe.

422
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:44,540
That looks like this.

423
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:47,540
I'll just drop that one in.

424
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:52,540
So when you get a device for me and you don't know me.

425
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:57,540
Say boy this guy don't make junk he makes some good shit when there it is.

426
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:04,540
That one has a gold leaf on it it's a it looks silver but it's a gold leaf and it's an imitation gold leaf which is made of cotton.

427
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:07,540
It's a gold leaf which is made of copper and zinc.

428
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,540
Barium titanate clue.

429
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:16,540
Yeah call this the tactical version it's got the us army tan colored 2k spray coating on it.

430
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:20,540
Now what you'll see on both of these is once the magnet is fitted.

431
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:31,540
I have a chinking material or a cock that goes between the pipe and the magnet and some tabs that are bonded to the pipe and the magnet to hold it in place.

432
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:34,540
I see that on both of them.

433
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:43,540
And those tabs are at 36 degrees apart because why because the heart sits at 36 degrees in the body.

434
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:45,540
36 degrees right.

435
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:49,540
It's an important angle.

436
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:56,540
So if you guys see those images those are with what the finished products look like if you were to order one from me what you get.

437
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:04,540
It is impressive. It's not like you're getting something from Amazon or cheap box it comes double boxed in a really nice case.

438
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:08,540
And you're also paying five grand for it.

439
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,540
So it should look good.

440
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:13,540
In the larger version that you've got the Greek.

441
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,540
Yeah.

442
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:22,540
The two circles either side of the scale or a they just flanges for the feeding.

443
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:25,540
The circles mean left and right on the foreground of the case.

444
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:26,540
Yeah.

445
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:28,540
Those are the other halves of the unions.

446
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:31,540
You could just put in what a pipe union looks like.

447
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,540
Yeah.

448
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:33,540
They just did.

449
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,540
I didn't want to have them attached.

450
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,540
Yeah.

451
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,540
Are you familiar with the plumbing union?

452
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:45,540
Those those two circles on the foreground in the case get attached to the main.

453
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,540
Oh yeah, gotcha.

454
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,540
Yeah.

455
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:49,540
Yeah.

456
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:53,540
Anybody anybody else see that?

457
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:54,540
Yeah.

458
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,540
I'm not extra parts for anything.

459
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:57,540
Yeah.

460
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:58,540
Yeah.

461
00:59:58,540 --> 00:59:59,540
So the flanges.

462
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,540
Yeah.

463
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:01,540
There's the outer flanges.

464
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:07,540
The flanges that are mounted to the scale orator are the ones where the old rings are.

465
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:11,540
These are the outer flanges that get mounted to where you do your cut in.

466
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:12,540
Yep.

467
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:13,540
And the center.

468
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:14,540
Yeah.

469
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,540
And in the center.

470
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,540
Is that just a bushing that you had it on there?

471
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:18,540
Yeah.

472
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:25,540
And in the center because it looks all right, imagine you got a big magnet and you adhere to smaller magnets and you got this gap you look in there.

473
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,540
It's like, you know, so what I did.

474
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:32,540
Remember I said when you get stick a pipe, you can have some leftover about a foot.

475
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:35,540
You cut yourself a three and a quarter inch piece.

476
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:39,540
And you have yourself a cone, a metal cone or a wooden cone.

477
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,540
Heat one end of the piece.

478
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,540
Plastic and you flare it out.

479
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:47,540
Until it fills into that gap of the smaller magnet and you turn it around and you flare it out again.

480
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:48,540
It's not that easy.

481
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:49,540
I have a.

482
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:53,540
Excuse me, a jig that I made to do that.

483
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:56,540
A jig that maybe I could show.

484
01:00:56,540 --> 01:01:02,540
Yeah, it's a no, I don't have done a photo of that, but I made a special jig out of wood.

485
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:05,540
That you you just cut a three inch piece of pipe.

486
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:11,540
And as you heat the pipe, you basically with a small press to press it down until it stops as a stop.

487
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,540
Players the part out.

488
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:14,540
Right.

489
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,540
And then you heat it up like a mandrel.

490
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,540
Yeah, like a mandrel.

491
01:01:18,540 --> 01:01:19,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

492
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:22,540
I'll I'll be the future make, but it's not necessary.

493
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:23,540
It just looks good.

494
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:28,540
It's just a well formed when I send it to a guy as a company says, wow, that's a nice.

495
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:33,540
Well formed plastic piece in center because they form plastics and they're like, how do you do that?

496
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:41,540
Or he just said, well, for someone who has a business who forms makes forms and injects plastics, he's called it a well formed piece.

497
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:42,540
So I take it as a compliment.

498
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:48,540
But I just like plugging it up.

499
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:57,540
If you really feel mean, you could get yourself some, you know, that epoxy, that clear epoxy that you know when you go to a bar and they have pennies and things in the bar.

500
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:00,540
With that heavy clear coat material epoxy on it, right?

501
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:07,540
Go ahead and mix up some silver dust and barium tetanate with that epoxy and just fill in the gap.

502
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:14,540
The gap, poured and you know, put a block or something on the backside and fill that area up with that epoxy is fine too.

503
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:20,540
But it gets expensive when you put expensive dielectrics in there because I remember barium tetanate and silver powder is not cheap.

504
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:21,540
You could do that.

505
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,540
That'll increase.

506
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:26,540
It's a little make the water seem a little more juicy.

507
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:33,540
Let's just say all these little things will get into later with the adding dielectrics to the magnet and things like that will do.

508
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:36,540
But it's not that much of a difference.

509
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,540
It's just a little bit nicer.

510
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:46,540
It's kind of like years ago, you bought a plane car with a radio and the dealer says for 300 bucks more will put a pin stripe on the car.

511
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:48,540
As it go faster.

512
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:50,540
Well, you know, it's a pin strike, right?

513
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:52,540
It's more than a pin stripe, but you know what I mean?

514
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:54,540
It's just options.

515
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:57,540
It does get a little bit better.

516
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:02,540
So basically that's just a fill piece in on the magnet.

517
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:07,540
So you know, little curious children will stick their fingers in there and say, hey, look, it's just too magnet stacked.

518
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:13,540
It's again, I was just inspired as just in like the way it looked just imagine bonding to smaller magnet to a larger magnet.

519
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:15,540
That's what it looks like.

520
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:18,540
And I figured let's fill that hole.

521
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:21,540
Also on installation, it's much cleaner.

522
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:26,540
It won't get filled with dirt and water, you know, because there's a step in there, right?

523
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:31,540
So again, now we're that we're on the magnet's attaching the magnet.

524
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:35,540
What I do when the magnet I have a tight fit.

525
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:42,540
And if it just so happens to be a sloppy fit, either way too tight grind out some of the pipe, use your brain.

526
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:46,540
Don't be don't grind away so much pipe that you compromise it.

527
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:49,540
Just a little.

528
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:57,540
Or if it's too big of an opening, go ahead and every 90 degrees or 120 degrees on the magnet, apply some epoxy.

529
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:02,540
You could do a couple of dabs and when the epoxy hardens, file it down as needed to center it.

530
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:05,540
It should be a nice press fit, not a press fit.

531
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:13,540
Usually when you see press fit in the fab world, it means you need a tool or press to press it and no, it's a good slip fit.

532
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:19,540
Like when you slip it in there, you could walk it with it, you could walk around with it under your arm and the magnet won't fall out.

533
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,540
That's the worst thing too.

534
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:28,540
When you're playing with it, when you're putting this together, it's on a table, someone tries to pick it up and move it and the magnet falls out and hits the deck, right?

535
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:31,540
Because it'll shatter, it's a ceramic magnet.

536
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:37,540
And by the way, let me just add this, every time I talk about something, I've got to add various sundry things that sound tangental.

537
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:43,540
I'm using these ceramic magnets in an era where everything is gone with these neodymium little fuckers, right?

538
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:48,540
Neos don't work. You could try experimenting and has a slight effect.

539
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:55,540
The real high powered magnets don't work because the field is so tight and the block wall is so tight, right?

540
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:58,540
The stronger the magnet, the tighter the field.

541
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:02,540
And you could notice this by the way, by handling them.

542
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:09,540
If you have a small neomat, I don't want to get it in the neosubject, but it's really strong, rare earth magnets they call them.

543
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:13,540
If you handle that, how strong is this magnet?

544
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:15,540
You bring it close to a piece of metal, nothing, nothing, nothing.

545
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:18,540
It gets real close and then bam!

546
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:21,540
Holy shit, that's a strong magnet, but yeah, let's pay attention.

547
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:26,540
A comparable strength magnet that's ceramic, of course, can be much larger.

548
01:05:26,540 --> 01:05:32,540
As you bring it closer, let's say refrigerator, and you're like, "Oh, it's start, I feel the pull, I feel the pull, I feel the pull."

549
01:05:32,540 --> 01:05:35,540
Because the field is much wider.

550
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:44,540
So we're living in an era where basically these ceramic magnets are in industry and everywhere else being phased out, unless it's for cost.

551
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:50,540
Because these are big and chunky and they're heavy and they don't have the field intensity.

552
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:57,540
But for this application, they work way better than the neos. If you tried neos, it wouldn't work much at all because the field is so tight.

553
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:02,540
So I just needed to bring that up because we're on the magnet subject.

554
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:07,540
But basically, when I apply the magnet, now you have two situations that go on.

555
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:12,540
You want that magnetic reactor to stay put.

556
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:25,540
So you have two things that will affect the device once it's installed. You have a torque load when let's say a plumbers hooking it up, he's twisting and turning with his spanners, right, hopefully not if they're using unions.

557
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,540
You don't have to use unions.

558
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:30,540
In the install, you might have to force it, right?

559
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:36,540
So the overlap where the pipe is also has to be bonded to use PVC glue for that.

560
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:46,540
If you shoot in close up on the scalar finish, scaler, in the cases, real close, you'll see that the where the pipes, the spool overlaps is also bonded.

561
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:53,540
You could see the fill it, they're a fillet of material that just PVC glue or plastic epoxy for that.

562
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:57,540
Now again, the magnetic reactor where it fits into the pipe, you got two things that will disturb it.

563
01:06:57,540 --> 01:07:01,540
One is a slow torque load twisting bending.

564
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:11,540
And the other thing is what I call a shock load. Shock load would be like you're walking to where you're going to install it and from the truck and it falls out of your hand hits the deck.

565
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:14,540
Boom, it's the ground. That's a shock load.

566
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:19,540
Shock load would be someone giving it a good whack with a mallet. There's a shock load.

567
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:33,540
All right, what we know from basic fab work is that in order to resist torque and twist, you need a rigid glue, something that is preferably even more rigid than the material.

568
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:43,540
That's why, for example, young children when they start playing with wood glue, they're always amazed when they glue the two pieces of wood together and they try to break it that it.

569
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:51,540
The glue is stronger than the wood, right? Yeah, I remember that. I don't know if everybody remembers that playing around wood glue when you're really young.

570
01:07:51,540 --> 01:08:00,540
And when you glue the wood together is like, shit, why is stronger where I glued it stronger than the wood itself? Okay, that resists the torque and twist.

571
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:02,540
Okay.

572
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:29,540
So we use that kind of glue every 60 degrees, every 90 degrees, and we leave some areas open, then we use a flexible glue because the flexible glue takes the shock load really well where if the hard glue that's stronger than the plastic or stiff from the plastic will break with the shock load little shatter.

573
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:36,540
Let's go back to the popsicle stick children playing with wood glue, they use the regular white or yellow wood glue.

574
01:08:36,540 --> 01:08:48,540
And after a few hours, they go ahead and break, pull it apart and they say the popsicle stick breaks for where it was glued, right? Now, that that's your shock load breaking it.

575
01:08:48,540 --> 01:09:03,540
But if you had a very flexible glue and you put the two popsicle sticks together with your, your really young nephew or grandson or whatever, and you ask them pull the popsicle sticks together, it's real, they won't break, right?

576
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:11,540
They'll just twist and bend, right? And you'll see the glue kind of flexing and stretching, right? You get it?

577
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:23,540
So what would I've considered from experience and also projecting my experience on what could happen? The two situations, one is a heavy shock load and one is a torque load.

578
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:34,540
So I want two types of glue. So if one fails, so if it takes the shock load and the rigid glue fails, I've got the flex glue still holding the magnetic reactor in place and vice versa.

579
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:51,540
Right? If the, if the flexible glue fails, I've got the rigid glue holding it. And once I have those intervals of glue in there, I then have a color matched water based latex high quality that I've matched.

580
01:09:51,540 --> 01:10:00,540
I took black, cock and gray, cock and mixed it. I've heard women in Washington called cock cock. That's fine too.

581
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:09,540
And they, it depends on what accent you have. So you take the black cock and the gray cock and you mix it to get the color of the gray plastic, I like that.

582
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:18,540
I put, whenever I use fillet material like that, even the poxies, I have a small plastic bag, a zip lock bag, those freezer bags are durable.

583
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:30,540
I put the material in the corner of the bag, I tie it real tight and I have a little pouch with the glue, the corner, I can snip a little tiny one millimeter into the corner of the bag and then I have like a pastry black bag where I could flow the material out.

584
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:37,540
Really nice. And then I have some solvent to smooth it out as needed. Right? That depends on your skills.

585
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:49,540
If someone ever asked you like cock their bathtub or whatever, if you're happy with the way you do that, you probably be happy with the way you'll do this. If you're not good at that, you probably won't be good at that. It's not necessary to make it look finished at this point.

586
01:10:49,540 --> 01:11:00,540
And I believe that the finishing aspects struck and some of the structural aspects will best be done in the future, maybe doing a short video and uploading it somewhere.

587
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:10,540
I think if you do enough videos or whatever on Skype, it'll kill Skype. I'm not sure. So maybe it's best Bruce or someone else, Sarah might help me with that where we upload a video like on YouTube.

588
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:23,540
Oh my gosh. Or you know, some other whatever free thing that you sign up for shorts and you know, in the title will be appropriate and I have a description and you can say, well, how does the Greek finish this? How does you put that?

589
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:32,540
Right, but I'm not going to do all this. We can watch the build them. So yeah, go ahead.

590
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:36,540
We could even play the video right over Skype.

591
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:44,540
Yeah, I think it's better to do reference type stuff where it's clean and it's poignant because over Skype, it may not be perfect. First shot around.

592
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:58,540
I could do a video and then have it edited, you know, just to like we know people do on YouTube, right? Or Vimeo or whatever, right? Honestly, there's so many free. Yeah, do so. Or you could do the video over Skype. Yeah, turn it on, turn it off. Yeah.

593
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:08,540
I think it records video also, doesn't it? Yes, sir. Yeah, but even doing a video over Skype, I got to get lighting right. You know, you know me, I got to do it right. I'm not going to get.

594
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:18,540
I know. Yeah, so I got to get a little studio area together. You know, I know people won't mind if a cat or two jumps over stuff.

595
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:28,540
But yeah, I just got to do it right. The lighting got to be right. The setting has to be right. Camera has to be right. Maybe more than one camera. I don't know. I have all that stuff ready to go.

596
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:33,540
I don't like to do junk. You know, so.

597
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:48,540
Also, it's not necessary to do all that setup if no one's going to build anything, right? And I noticed the more interest, the more, the more interest I see, the more interest I will put in and more time I will put into help whoever wants to do it.

598
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:51,540
This is something that.

599
01:12:51,540 --> 01:13:05,540
Again, it reminds me I was reading about Michael Faraday is like something came up, raises, says, just thinking about Michael Faraday, look up Michael Faraday guy with an eighth grade education basically created the foundation of the entire electrical world.

600
01:13:05,540 --> 01:13:09,540
Or in the 1700s, 1800s, right?

601
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:18,540
1800s, 1800s, 1800s, or whatever. And he had no education, no whatever. And he basically no mathematics, no equations, right?

602
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:28,540
Just like I've got, you know, descriptions here's some conductive wire. Here's a piece of iron and look what I've observed when I do this and look what I've observed and I did that.

603
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:34,540
And he was not into turning it into a business. He just wanted to document everything. I think he was a canite.

604
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:42,540
It's a religious sect where it's like a teacher that it's bad to make money. It's bad to be wealthy or whatever. I'm not a gang.

605
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:48,540
But at this point, I'd like to get other people interested in doing see what comes out of it.

606
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:55,540
Because if it does turn into a business, even on my and more strictly a business and proposal, there's plenty to go around.

607
01:13:55,540 --> 01:14:02,540
I mean, there's plenty of customers and all that, you know, and I'm leading the way on it anyway until someone else wants to lead the way on it.

608
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:10,540
Because this is very, very important application and discovery of use of the block wall of a magnet.

609
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:20,540
Again, I want to stress on this. There are magnets involved, but we are not using magnetism. That's why we don't call them magnets when they're assembled to call them a magnetic reactor.

610
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:25,540
Kind of gets the mind away from sole purpose of a magnet.

611
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:40,540
You bring up a magnet to even someone who's a fizzy cyst. The first thing they think of in their mind, I know actually if they have any mind left after education or university is magnet sticking to something, you know, poles.

612
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:50,540
They have no idea that the block wall is useful as it's being used here and they never will, by the way, in the ever that they have left.

613
01:14:50,540 --> 01:15:02,540
So this is an application on many, many, many levels. And I just want to any, if there's any questions about the coatings, the pipe bending, which we have not gotten into yet.

614
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:07,540
Or whatever, maybe should I get into the pipe bending a little bit?

615
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:08,540
Yeah, type of.

616
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,540
Oh, yes.

617
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:25,540
Okay, type of sand, sharp sand. There's different types of sand, L kinds of sand. There's something called sharp sand and they use it. It's a AB sand when they make roads, you know, they mix gravel and sand and they put the ass, they pack it down and they put their ass, folder, some mental.

618
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:29,540
You can buy it. It's called sharp sand. If you don't have it, it's fine.

619
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:34,540
Any beach sand will do play sand will do call it sand anything.

620
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:45,540
The proper temperature I found the best temperatures 360, 370 degrees. I go to a secondhand store and buy medium sized pots.

621
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:49,540
Leader and a half pot thick wall aluminum, anodized pot.

622
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:57,540
There's a lot of, you could use cast iron. You want the side of the pot to be thick. You know how so I'm stainless steel potters have a thick bottom and thin side.

623
01:15:57,540 --> 01:16:04,540
It takes much longer and do it over an electric stove top cast off top doesn't matter get yourself an infrared thermometer.

624
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:07,540
So you could shoot it at a distance when it gets to you.

625
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:12,540
340 degrees. The sand give it a stir every so often.

626
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:22,540
We figure out what that is Celsius. I think somebody figure out 340, 360, 370 degrees is your working point depending on your outdoor temperature.

627
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:31,540
Winter time. If you're outdoor temperature, it's fall or winter you're going to keep it in the 360, 370 range if it's a hot summer day.

628
01:16:31,540 --> 01:16:34,540
340, 350 degrees sand is fine.

629
01:16:34,540 --> 01:16:44,540
And you want to plug your pipe and when you plug your pipe, you have a dowel with a stopper wrapped around that it could be just a piece of rag with masking tape.

630
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:58,540
And your dowel is like a push rod it goes down into the pipe a couple of inches because you don't want to heat up the very ends of the pipe where your plumbing fittings go because they're going to deform potentially right.

631
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:03,540
So what you're really doing out of let's say 34 inches of pipe.

632
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:12,540
You only need enough sand for let's say 30, 27 inches.

633
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:21,540
Usually I have two dowel ends that are 4 inches long that I stuff into the ends or one end is 2 1/2 inches.

634
01:17:21,540 --> 01:17:26,540
So you could see you know those barrel cleaners they have on a canons.

635
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:38,540
It's like a stick with a brush or a ball on the end of it cloth ball basically just make something like that and attach to the dowel so when you pull it out it comes out with the dowel of plug.

636
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:42,540
And so no hot sand ends up on the last couple of inches of the pipe.

637
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:46,540
That's pretty much it. You got to use a metal funnel.

638
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:56,540
Don't grab your mom's plastic funnel because you know what you pour 350 degree sand Fahrenheit for plastic funnel your mommy is going to ask you what you do to the funnel.

639
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:59,540
It'll melt and fall into the pipe and make a big mess.

640
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:14,540
So you need a metal funnel or a glass funnel but I don't like working with glass when they got stuff that have to work quick.

641
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:17,540
Pipe of cups.

642
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:23,540
Paper cups will work. Yeah because flashpoint of paper cups over 450 Fahrenheit so you'll find.

643
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:28,540
Whatever takes I use the funnel because I like to not think about it.

644
01:18:28,540 --> 01:18:41,540
And when you fill up the pipes to dump it out put your your end piece in your plug in. Right now I get really fancy you get really fancy have very elaborate stoppers with valves on them filters.

645
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:47,540
And when I put my stoppers on there I put about two or three PSI of air.

646
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:55,540
And there's actually air pressure inside the pipe that keeps the walls from deforming also but that's too technical right now.

647
01:18:55,540 --> 01:19:00,540
Yeah I mean in these the level that I'm making them now I could send it to a space agency.

648
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:06,540
And they engineers would look at it and say this thing is really really high level tolerance manufacturer.

649
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:15,540
I don't need to convey all the various things I do that that don't matter and getting one or two or three of these built getting the working not necessary.

650
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:24,540
But eventually I will get into how to make a high precision one and show all the jigs and fixtures and mandrels and all the stuff that I made.

651
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:32,540
And it'll just it'll just bog you down right now and off to be on for the next six hours to explain all that.

652
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:39,540
Or the 30 photographs. I'm not going to do that right now it's too early in the game and I think you guys appreciate that.

653
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:53,540
But what you want to do with the hot sand in the pipe is put plugs very I can't stress how important it is because the hot sand does not go to all the way to the end of the pipe you want to keep that true dimension undisturbed right.

654
01:19:53,540 --> 01:20:00,540
Because that's why you're where your fittings go and your fittings are dimensionally accurate I mean they're not that dimensionally accurate plastic things.

655
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:13,540
If you go to a plumbing supply you grab a handful of any fitting of the same size you'll notice they all feel a little different when you try to put it on the end of a pipe they don't really make these plumbing fittings of high tolerance so you don't want to disturb the end of the pipe.

656
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:21,540
What I do is I have a heat gun it's called a heat gun yes I use it for paint stripping or whatever it gets real hot.

657
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:34,540
600 degrees Celsius 1200 degrees Fahrenheit kind of thing on high. Right so while my sand is cooking usually it takes me 15 to 20 minutes to get the sand up the temperature on a low to medium flame.

658
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:44,540
No reason to hit the pot of sand with a high flame because it'll just it doesn't the heat doesn't transfer to the sand and so fast right so why burn up your pot and your burner.

659
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:58,540
Now I have another thing that I do is I mix magnetite if you don't have it it's fine about 20% magnetite in with my sand now magnetite's black iron you know black sand it's iron crystal.

660
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:05,540
And when I started doing this I noticed that whenever I put it in there because it holds the heat real good.

661
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:19,540
And I noticed the one ever I heated pipe with the magnetite mixture and I rubbed solvent strong solvent and that would normally melt the plastic.

662
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:27,540
If it had been heated with the magnetite internally or externally the plastic did not want to melt it changed the plastic.

663
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:45,540
And I made it resistant to solvents and I thought I was just you know maybe the solvent got aired out lost at the potency or whatever and I said hmm maybe the magnetite transmuting the pipe you know formula changing it making it more resistant to solvents so I said let's do a couple of experiments.

664
01:21:45,540 --> 01:22:05,540
I went back and forth with heated non heated heated with magnetite heated without magnetite and then every time the pipe that was subject to the hot magnetite mixture was extremely solvent resistant so I just want to I've mentioned this on a regular sonica while back.

665
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:19,540
And I believe that it also affects the water quality because now if the plastic is less resistant is more resistant to solvents it's actually resistant to leaching stuff into the water right it's more inert.

666
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:34,540
So you're going to have a better plastic that way again not necessary but it is it is it is a good point and that a lot of people are not as far I have a half a ton of magnetite here on the property thousand pounds of it high grade that's not fair right.

667
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:47,540
If I don't have magnetite where do I get it well you know eBay will send you a little pouch for ten bucks or something whatever you could be industrious on how do you I've talked about been talking about magnetite for years so.

668
01:22:47,540 --> 01:23:02,540
So basically that's heating the pipe with the sand but just don't other than the stops I preheat the pipe with that heat gun by rolling it back and forth you don't want to you always want to be very even you could use a blow dry but you want to get that pipe.

669
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:24,540
Up upwards of 120 degrees externally so you basically you have a room temperature or ambient temperature pipe when you pour that hot sand in that schedule 80 hot sand is going to give up all its heat just to get that pipe hot before it makes it flexible and you're going to your working time in the pipes going to be real stiff.

670
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:53,540
So if you preheat the pipe externally with the heat gun or blow dry to at least 120 degrees by rolling it back and forth on the table or on the ground while your sand is being heated you want to heat the pipe really as much as you can without it getting soft because once it gets soft without the sand filler can deform and you remember when you're heating preheating the pipe before you put the sand in there you again you avoid the last three inches.

671
01:23:53,540 --> 01:24:03,540
On the ends because you don't want to deform them again right so you can put markers on there or whatever just be a good boy remember where you're pointing the gun.

672
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:22,540
And and when I preheat the pipe to about 120 130 degrees by hand rolling it around as many ways to preheat a pipe you don't have to use the heat gun or whatever I don't recommend using hot water because it's dangerous splashing and around and all that but you could if you had a trough with boiling water that would work fine but

673
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:36,540
how are you going to not heat the ends again so I use a heat gun and for the moment you know while it's hot you could set it aside be quick get your plugs on one end and start pouring your hot sand in there.

674
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:43,540
And once you got your hot sand in there getting grab your heat gun again you know we're talking about like an industrial heat gun you could be gotten very cheap.

675
01:24:43,540 --> 01:24:58,540
Hair dryers can help but they don't work very well you can if you just have a hair dryer go ahead and plug up the back the intake so the so you can put it on high and the restricted air flow allows the blow dryer to get hotter right.

676
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:11,540
And when you put your hot sand in there keep hitting it with a blow dryer on the area where you start bending it again because this is schedule 80 now no fault if you're working with schedule 40.

677
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:23,540
I'm not trying to be an asshole about it even though it is junk if you're building one at a schedule 40 which is the white plastic PVC go ahead it's fine.

678
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:31,540
Even though it is junk for me and for you will be if you start using even though the one I have installed here in the house still is schedule 40.

679
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:50,540
It's a very big difference between the white PVC schedule 40 and the schedule 80 the working experience very big difference the schedule 40 will will bend very rapidly with the hot sand because of its thin wall and it's the type of plastic that it is.

680
01:25:50,540 --> 01:26:03,540
So basically as you bend it around you need to find a way to hold it so you can need some kind of a clamping system as you go and you don't want to use clamps that have a flat end on it because you're going to put a flat spot on your pipe.

681
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:14,540
So if you're using a one inch pipe you yourself some one and a quarter which slips over cut little sections of curved parts you can make curved parts out of epoxy at a wood whatever you could create pieces of cardboard whatever.

682
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:28,540
And you're going to have to figure out how you have a clamping table and a clamping system which I could photograph and show you guys what it looks like and all that but it will just like over if I start to show up putting pictures of all the fixtures and all the stuff that I built to make these.

683
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:37,540
If you're just starting out you'll be intimidated you'll be bogged down you'll say holy shit I got to make this this this that and this this and that to make that but that.

684
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:49,540
Now I don't want to do that right now because the first one and even the first schedule 81 that I had no jigsad nothing it was just done on the ground by hand with some welding gloves.

685
01:26:49,540 --> 01:27:03,540
And yes I used heavy leather gloves because guess what it's hot plastic it won't really burn you but you you can get a like a real bad you know you'll be sore all night you don't want to be handling hot pipe hot plastic with your bare hands.

686
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:16,540
Now if once you start forming the pipe around the magnet or around some space or and you have a way to hold it you might want to people you know hold this here push it down there you know whatever.

687
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:31,540
You might want to start incorporating get a spray bottle and the moment you hit the sections that you have held down and are happy with with a spray bottle it immediately cools the plastic enough that it becomes rigid and it will not move.

688
01:27:31,540 --> 01:27:39,540
And then once you go around with a spray bottle and saying you know a rubber that missed hits the water it will freeze the plastic in that position.

689
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:46,540
And then when you're done with it you're happy go ahead and pull one of the ends or both of the ends on poor that hot sand out of there.

690
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:57,540
And when you're pouring the hot sand out of that round spool you got to keep turning the spool up and down so first time doing it it'll be funny because you'll be getting sand everywhere you think you got to sand out and you turn it up.

691
01:27:57,540 --> 01:28:05,540
And then when you put the hot sand over the place be careful remember it's coming out of something that looks like a French horn.

692
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:18,540
So that's pretty much the quick overview on the bending process at this point at this point the once you build one and you know that this is what you want to do.

693
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:39,540
I do recommend building rudimentary jigs there are some YouTube videos where people are bending pipe and their version of rudimentary jig which anybody could do very quickly is they have a table or just a sheet of wood that they drilled holes in on a grid pattern or selected pattern and then pegs.

694
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:49,540
Right so as you bend your you could look this up bending PVC pipe on YouTube and I think there's a chick that's doing it and she basically has a bench with holes in it.

695
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:57,540
And as she's bending her pipe she sticks these pegs in there that holds the pipe from wiggling out you know out of shape that's another way to do it.

696
01:28:57,540 --> 01:29:11,540
I remember whenever you're putting something against a round flat plane against a round plane that's soft it's going to put a flat spot and a deformation in it right so just consider that.

697
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:23,540
So an easy way to start working on a jig again is just a scrap piece of wood that's as big as the device with holes in it and pegs as you go around you know as you bend it around you slap a peg in there keeps it from unbending in a ravony.

698
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:33,540
Many ways to do it very often people ask me show me how to do it and I'm like I'll introduce you to the person who showed me how to do it how's that.

699
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:52,540
I don't know who I'll introduce you to because I'm on my own so you guys are not on your own I'm here to help you out as much as possible but on an introductory level let's just keep it as such and then we'll continue on the more advanced stuff and I'll be glad to share everything that I've done and have on how to make these as time goes on based on feedback of course.

700
01:29:52,540 --> 01:30:07,540
Years ago when I was a dumber and younger I would have spent a week doing an entire presentation and PowerPoint as show and you know so I don't you know why why it's not necessary right until I see there's an interest.

701
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:15,540
But once I see there's an interest in people are serious I'll jump in and tell you everything I know.

702
01:30:15,540 --> 01:30:24,540
That said I think we've covered everything unless I know there's a couple of people are going to hear this in summer on here right now they're ready to go and some have already done it.

703
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:38,540
Is anything else that tickles you you know about asking in some here because the purpose of this was to give a more advanced expose on how to put these together for someone is going to be trying to put one together this week for the first time.

704
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:44,540
So if there's any questions or any one to chime in or whatever go ahead right now.

705
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:47,540
Yeah that was an accident on the.

706
01:30:47,540 --> 01:31:02,540
Clicked wrong button on the heart but anyways was there for the plug and the Dow around it so you're putting the Dow inside the pipe correct with the with the plug.

707
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:05,540
The mean the magnetic reactor around the.

708
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:11,540
You mean plugging for the sand yeah.

709
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:25,540
Well just imagine you have a straight remember early on we how much pipe 34 inch piece of pipe so you buy your stick or you have a pre cut of 34 inches and you have a straight piece of pipe right.

710
01:31:25,540 --> 01:31:33,540
Go ahead and poor sand in it what happens well Santa come out the other end right gravity.

711
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:39,540
We got to have at least one plug now if you just have one plug keep the sand from falling on the ground.

712
01:31:39,540 --> 01:31:43,540
And if you turn it horizontal start working horizontal what's going to happen on the other end.

713
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:48,540
Can't start pouring on the other end you got plug both ends.

714
01:31:48,540 --> 01:32:03,540
And the plugs basically look like three inch long dowels with a cotton fabric and some tape wrapped around it so that when you push it into the pipe it's got a lot of friction it will not fall out it's pretty tight right.

715
01:32:03,540 --> 01:32:13,540
And it's also the ball the cotton fabric is connected to the Dow so when I pull the dowel out the cotton ball you know the stopper comes with it.

716
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:25,540
Yeah I have an image on it right there yeah it just looks here for watch all movies what have these cannon cleaners guy comes with the stick and it's got a ball on the end of it and they rub it back and forward to clean the barrel gun barrel out.

717
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:36,540
Yeah just like that but a miniature one more evolved one is a pipe it's a tube with a rubber stopper on the end with a shader valve on the end of the pipe.

718
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:48,540
And as you twist it there's a washer on the end of the stopper that expands it into the pipe and then you put when you have both of your stoppers in and your hot sand you put three pounds of pressure in there which is minimal.

719
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:53,540
And the air pressure in the sand keeps the pipe very very round if you look at the.

720
01:32:53,540 --> 01:33:01,540
Scale rate is in the cases in you zoom in and you look at the profile of the pipe no matter where you look it's perfect.

721
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:06,540
Right now I've gotten to the point where I don't need the pressurize air anymore.

722
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:13,540
Because I've made enough of these and I'm paying attention while I'm working on how to avoid that step.

723
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:31,540
And when you have an air valve to pressurize to release the air it'll clog it and you'll throw away the valve so you have to have a very fine brass screen to keep the sand from going into the valve so you know we're talking about stoppers that I made that if you gave them to NASA they would look at it and say this is part of space shuttle right.

724
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:37,540
It's not necessary to build something like that but I did because I can build things like that very quickly.

725
01:33:37,540 --> 01:34:00,540
Here I have the ability to do so but that would be the optimum optimum right so let's say you were to get a corporate higher than pipes for you want to do the compressed air in there so in case he had a bad morning didn't have enough coffee or whatever you argue me out with his wife he'll be consistent on bending these things he doesn't have to pay too much attention right.

726
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:25,540
That's my goal with this is to set up enough systems they I call them corporate hires you know you put an ad in the paper for someone to make something you interview him okay jack you think you can do this fine this much an hour pat him on the back you got to make ten of these and buy into the day okay buy see you unsupervised and when you come back to the end of the day you don't want to fire and you want to come back the next day and keep doing it right because he does good work right.

727
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:31,540
Yeah good.

728
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:35,540
You don't want to get the tails of it right you don't want to get the tails of it.

729
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:41,540
Heat the heat away yeah yeah it makes total sense that the tails are the ends the stubs.

730
01:34:41,540 --> 01:35:00,540
And you want to keep those unaffected by the heat because what is the heat do it deforms and you also want to you don't want them to be deformed or cut or scratched if you're if you're cutting it with a saw you want to make sure it's a nice clean cut and squared off right.

731
01:35:00,540 --> 01:35:15,540
You don't want to you to drop on the corner crack schedule eighty one crack schedule forty will right and when I say schedule eighty it's the gray stuff you know very often I take it so I'm like years ago I would just say you schedule eighty once.

732
01:35:15,540 --> 01:35:21,540
And and then I'll go back and listen to people and said in here that I'm like oh my gosh so I have to keep repeating it.

733
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:38,540
The schedule eighty eight zero the gray stuff is very very durable and a pleasure to work with once you understand that the heavy wall material requires more heat and a little bit more labor but it will retain its shape better stay away from the ends that makes total sense to you now right.

734
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:43,540
You want to keep the hot sand in the pre heating away from that you know.

735
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:48,540
Just for the sake of dimensionality.

736
01:35:48,540 --> 01:36:10,540
So I think we might have different terms in Australia like I haven't heard of schedule eighty but is it used as a conduit yes yes it can be right it's it yeah electrical conduit yeah yeah but it's not for pressure.

737
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:39,540
All right this is for water assignments yeah yeah yeah good one good one because I have schedule eighty outside electrical and that he brought this up I'm glad you brought it up because there could be some confusion so some bloke is going to get I just need some schedule eighty plastic pipe you could walk out with a pistol of schedule eighty plastic pipe all right but it's electrical conduit right that's that's told yeah it's a completely different alloy or a four.

738
01:36:39,540 --> 01:36:49,540
Plastic and it's not for water. Yeah good one yeah good one that saved I think you just saved the entire sonic here with that.

739
01:36:49,540 --> 01:37:00,540
No really because think about it some bloke goes in somewhere Greek says I need to schedule eighty plastic pipe here's just schedule eighty plastic pipe and get what it he handed off what did he just buy.

740
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:05,540
Fucking electrical conduit right you didn't say that Greek thank you.

741
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:27,540
Yeah yeah yeah yeah because I was looking for to change away from the plastic that I was using which it looks it looks fine by the wave did you find out more about it the black one the black top what is it poly poly what polyethylene yeah I think it's polyethylene but

742
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:42,540
here they have what they call it UP VC which pressurized PVC like they use around like spa baths you know that kind of thing and yeah.

743
01:37:42,540 --> 01:37:48,540
So I got a bit of that thinking that might be what you're talking about me.

744
01:37:48,540 --> 01:37:58,540
No it could be I don't know the the the difference is the schedules is the thickness of the internal wall thickness.

745
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:12,540
Yeah that's what I was thinking see if you could you know what a catalog cut is sheet cut sheet in industry it's like if you could find a specification there should be markings on that pipe who makes it go to the fight if they have a website.

746
01:38:12,540 --> 01:38:27,540
If they have technical technical specs and drop that in the send it drop it in here or do it in the chat or somewhere so I could look at it I like to communicate that way I can do that with schedule 80 pipe not necessary other than bringing up that is for water right.

747
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:41,540
Yep yeah yeah if you're not sure I don't eat you that material dot a shape yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah spec cut sheet or the cut sheets they call them here yeah it just basically tells you what it's made of.

748
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:48,540
And what it's for and what's purpose and pressure and all that other good stuff for a part of my potable.

749
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:59,540
I've been having trouble finding PVC pipe for pressure because in Australia most of its it's I think it's all polyethylene the plastic pipe they use.

750
01:38:59,540 --> 01:39:22,540
Yeah or all this still on all this still on copper but yeah they're they do the only pressurized systems that I've seen that use PVC was with like with spa baths so I got a bit of that because it's I'm going to try and I think I want to get a better bend I'm getting spring back when around me around me.

751
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:48,540
I've got a couple of pointers off you today that would probably prevent me spring back anyway because I haven't been I haven't been cooling it as I go as well so yeah yeah and make yourself a fixture you can do a rough one you can overheat it where it deforms it's fine let's see you get it really hot with the sand and an external heat gun and you squeeze it a little too much in one section and she flattens out.

752
01:39:48,540 --> 01:40:02,540
If you have the general deep geometry right this is how I made the first jig I wanted a real tight bend but ended up getting some deformation in the pipe that's okay when I had my general shape.

753
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:17,540
Just right the overall geometry in spangest right but I had flat spots when it cooled down I went and got myself some auto body filler and I filled the flat spots till they got nice and round I made myself a profile jig you know I didn't eyeball it.

754
01:40:17,540 --> 01:40:37,540
So it actually you know ran like a plane over it that showed me exact what the pipe should be and I have now I have this model that is got auto body filler all over the place but it's exactly the shape that I want so when I made my jig I built my jig around that now right.

755
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:49,540
I use that as a model still I could take a picture of it and you'll you'll see just a piece of pie to scale or it and it's got auto body filler patches all over it really nice and smooth that right.

756
01:40:49,540 --> 01:41:06,540
And that's my model for my jig and for my jig model you know the base of it I basically used hydro cow or we call it rock Durham's rock putty here plaster you just pour your plaster it looks like I'm all you push the

757
01:41:06,540 --> 01:41:22,540
scale or make sure you know the your model and you cut away so it doesn't get locked into the plaster you pull it out and you have a negative shape right in plaster so when you go to bend your pipe you're you're bending and fitting it over this plaster mold that is made from your model right.

758
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:27,540
That was my first jig and it works well I still use it it's just ultra modified.

759
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:54,540
Oh yeah yeah I'll drop a drop a couple of pictures of it since I'm talking about it I don't have the latest these are pictures from May or June this is like you know because I got on this when I started making this I got on it right away meaning after the first one came a few days later came the second one few days later came the jig a few days later came that right it was I was on it like you know big time you know I wasn't

760
01:41:54,540 --> 01:42:13,540
90% of everything I've talked about tonight I did within the first week of discovering this this is not 10 this is not 10 months of of development at all it's I basically went over like a first few days of development that's how excited I was about it right.

761
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:20,540
So here is a picture of the jig I don't know if you can get much of it.

762
01:42:20,540 --> 01:42:46,540
I'll drop it in right now this is from May and see if I can get another one here's another picture of the jig also from May this is a week after the first one right so this is not recent doesn't look like this at all now.

763
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:54,540
You could throw them together but you could see on the second one especially let me know if you wish you when you see them those two pictures that is dropped in.

764
01:42:54,540 --> 01:43:00,540
Yep I can say I'm on the second one you see how it's elevated so I get me claps to go underneath it.

765
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:12,540
Yeah yeah right so if you have it flat on a table is it got we got to get a clamp under it right so you see how it's elevated on three dowels you only see one dowel on the foreground.

766
01:43:12,540 --> 01:43:22,540
And the two wood plates are cut the same as he yeah that makes sense to you doesn't it yeah it's elevated so you can get it from three axes xyz.

767
01:43:22,540 --> 01:43:34,540
Yeah it does make sense to me because I started off similar to you I spent my first one around a magnet and then I made a jig flat on the table and had that exact trouble with you know plants.

768
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:54,540
Now I'm onto about jig number three yeah well I never I never did it on the table because I what I did was I sat down I had I just lay down in the afternoon and I said I'm going to go build a jig and when I build the jig I'm going to make my first piece on it and before I build it I'm going to imagine the entire thing.

769
01:43:54,540 --> 01:44:04,540
And as I'm laying down taking an app I'm imagining with the jig I'm like it can't be flat on a table because this clamp has to go under it so I have to build it like this right.

770
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:12,540
You know how like Tesla used to design things in his mind and check up on them a month later check them for where he hasn't built it yet right.

771
01:44:12,540 --> 01:44:18,540
Yeah so in other words it's called thinking it through as much as possible.

772
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:28,540
Yeah you can ask for a workbench with lots of overhang so I can get me clamps in there but it just wasn't quite enough because I had no three six feet.

773
01:44:28,540 --> 01:44:36,540
That's right you can only get it on one you can only get about 180 degrees you can't get the back of the other 180 degrees of it.

774
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:46,540
And if you notice on this really jig on the second one you see there's some little black pieces of plastic with tape on them other pieces of pipe so me the flat clamp doesn't flatten out the pipe right.

775
01:44:46,540 --> 01:44:50,540
Yeah.

776
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:59,540
And this one obviously is just for photograph because this is not an actual bending how can you tell if you look at the end of the pipe it's open there's no plug in it right.

777
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:01,540
Yeah that's a cold piece yeah.

778
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:07,540
I just threw that together for posterity because as I kept developing the jig I said before I.

779
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:15,540
Because in between making the next jig I will just build on this one so while I'm building on it I don't have a jig while I'm working on the jig right.

780
01:45:15,540 --> 01:45:21,540
So I said why don't I just throw it together and take a picture of it right so at least it's preserved.

781
01:45:21,540 --> 01:45:25,540
And so I just went and grabbed a pipe that I had been.

782
01:45:25,540 --> 01:45:33,540
Early on and threw it all back together with the clamps just for the photographs but this is not live because there's no plug and there's no sand in it.

783
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:37,540
That's your first Sherlock Holmes give away right.

784
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:44,540
That this is just this is a staged a staged is a staged is this is not actual.

785
01:45:44,540 --> 01:45:49,540
Actually when your actual it shows everything you know.

786
01:45:49,540 --> 01:46:02,540
It would help if I had the plugs in there because it makes it more realistic because when when she's hot and you're bending that sounds good when she's hot and bending your your adrenaline is rushing right because you don't want to waste the piece right.

787
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:05,540
You don't want to reach for a camera.

788
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:10,540
Yeah you haven't got a time to you haven't got time to take happy snaps.

789
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:15,540
Yeah it's right and if you're not focusing 150% on what you're doing it's not enough right.

790
01:46:15,540 --> 01:46:19,540
Yeah you're not focusing enough.

791
01:46:19,540 --> 01:46:31,540
Yeah see like this one here if you look at the first one if you zoom in real close on the foreground on the right side of the jig you'll notice there's fiberglass on there which is high temperature welding blanket right.

792
01:46:31,540 --> 01:46:54,540
I have if you zoom in on it on the top picture of the jig the welding has all the all the foil sticky all the foil all the tape and fiberglass welding blanket because of the heat so because if you just had the wood and you go there with a 1200 degree Fahrenheit heat gun what do you think your woods going to do.

793
01:46:54,540 --> 01:47:20,540
It's going to start smoking right so I coded the jig with welding blank fiberglass you know it's good for 2000 degrees so I wouldn't get smoking on you notice the plastic of sitting which is an industrial plastic fitting in the middle it's got paper and all around aluminum around it why because if I have to approach it with a heavy duty eat gun what happens to bear plastic right.

794
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:35,540
It starts smoking and melting so the first jig and the second photo it's the same jig first and second one you'll notice that if you look close at the jig there's precautions taken for heating to see aluminum.

795
01:47:35,540 --> 01:47:49,540
Right and fiberglass and again that was done before I so in other words Greek did you throw a jig together and it started smoking no it never did because I thought of it before I even did it you see.

796
01:47:49,540 --> 01:47:59,540
Because I knew that what am I doing I'm making a jig and there's a heat cut involved shit well it better be able to handle 1000 degrees what do I have to make.

797
01:47:59,540 --> 01:48:18,540
Piece of particle board that I threw together handle 1000 degrees well I've got an old welding blanket I could cut up and I've got some heavy duty duct aluminum tape I could put on there with cardboard right as a shield to that before I even started.

798
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:40,540
Anyway that's a rudimentary I'll go through what I need to do if as this progresses and it seems like it will is just go ahead and investigate some other things I'll drop in here photos of helps you know things that I have that will help.

799
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:59,540
Here's one I don't know if I've ever forwarded something like this I have access someone who has a 3d computer real professional and we have covers and stuff like that 3d printed I've never got into that I don't actually see that image there.

800
01:48:59,540 --> 01:49:21,540
I have see that image I have someone that works on pretty high end computer program that is transferred everything into a computer and 3d printed a bunch of stuff and I think you guys remember when I think about 3d printing right I was pretty clear about it.

801
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:34,540
If you want to piss me off tell me you're going to 3d print right here's someone else that has one that has a case on it with.

802
01:49:34,540 --> 01:49:46,540
I'll drop in some random photos with copper built around it and that's going to get filled with about a thousand dollars worth of barium tit night and silver powder.

803
01:49:46,540 --> 01:49:54,540
It looks like a hummingbird house bird house but you could see it right in their office right there.

804
01:49:54,540 --> 01:49:59,540
Get that one.

805
01:49:59,540 --> 01:50:01,540
Yes.

806
01:50:01,540 --> 01:50:04,540
Yeah that helps in here's.

807
01:50:04,540 --> 01:50:12,540
Here's another one of the same person who is building one of going to a technical show in Colorado which was canceled.

808
01:50:12,540 --> 01:50:21,540
Here you'll see the scalerator again this is in process of building it.

809
01:50:21,540 --> 01:50:36,540
You could see there's one on the left a 3d printed the housing and they have the wood ends that go on it gets filled with the barium tit night and silver powder silver powder bag of silver powder is just like it sounds expensive you know.

810
01:50:36,540 --> 01:50:43,540
It does make a difference. Yeah and I'll get more into the history and more of my experiences and I've got photos of.

811
01:50:43,540 --> 01:50:49,540
Labs with it and all this other stuff you know the gears send you another.

812
01:50:49,540 --> 01:50:56,540
This is another company that was doing something else the same guys you'll send you another picture.

813
01:50:56,540 --> 01:51:02,540
Yeah so this is all already been completely computer modeled right.

814
01:51:02,540 --> 01:51:06,540
All the physics the mechanics have been done on it.

815
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:12,540
Various covers various 3d cover for programs have been created and printed.

816
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:22,540
There's more history than I've led on to there's a lot more that's gone on to with this right that I'll get into as if necessary right.

817
01:51:22,540 --> 01:51:28,540
There's no reason to do a 14 hour sonic on this.

818
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:32,540
Did you guys get those last technical ones released you.

819
01:51:32,540 --> 01:51:38,540
Yes yeah okay so in other words there's more history behind this but yeah go ahead.

820
01:51:38,540 --> 01:51:41,540
Where they're going to install.

821
01:51:41,540 --> 01:51:50,540
In a house for this yeah I've got photos of them installed in the field yeah none of them have been done properly though but they are installed and they are working.

822
01:51:50,540 --> 01:51:56,540
In other words none of them have been installed to my standards properly is not freaking amazing.

823
01:51:56,540 --> 01:52:08,540
Think about that yeah there's there's six of them out in the wild right now not one is installed properly but two of them in New Jersey one in Canada one in Ohio.

824
01:52:08,540 --> 01:52:12,540
The other one is I think another one in Jersey.

825
01:52:12,540 --> 01:52:16,540
None are installed properly but the feedback is very positive.

826
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:22,540
So they're at 30 or 40% potential and they're still amazing right.

827
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:26,540
They're not installed to the alignments that you mentioned previously.

828
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:39,540
That's right I could show you a photo right now and I'll drop a photo in in the first one and you guys are pretty sharp right.

829
01:52:39,540 --> 01:52:51,540
I know you're sharp from and you do recall what I recently said about the installation so I'm going to scroll through another file here.

830
01:52:51,540 --> 01:52:56,540
I'm going to send you a picture of one that's installed.

831
01:52:56,540 --> 01:53:00,540
This is an installation in somewhere in the country.

832
01:53:00,540 --> 01:53:04,540
I don't know if it's Connecticut or New Jersey but I'll drop this is number one that went out.

833
01:53:04,540 --> 01:53:10,540
It wasn't supposed to be installed it was supposed to be tested only but they installed it.

834
01:53:10,540 --> 01:53:13,540
Now this is in a utility room.

835
01:53:13,540 --> 01:53:16,540
I just told you if you get that image.

836
01:53:16,540 --> 01:53:23,540
Can you tell you where the 50 feet of runner length is on that one?

837
01:53:23,540 --> 01:53:27,540
There is none. There is no runner length on that one.

838
01:53:27,540 --> 01:53:33,540
The feedback on that was well the other side of the house has about 50 feet away.

839
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:35,540
Oh my gosh.

840
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:38,540
Oh my gosh.

841
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:44,540
It doesn't count the other side of the house is 50 feet.

842
01:53:44,540 --> 01:53:49,540
Okay. That's not per instructions.

843
01:53:49,540 --> 01:53:52,540
Well, you've got a couple of bends in the pipe.

844
01:53:52,540 --> 01:53:55,540
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, but it still works kick ass.

845
01:53:55,540 --> 01:53:57,540
And I said no, it's not working kick ass.

846
01:53:57,540 --> 01:54:01,540
Here's another one. This is one in Canada.

847
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:07,540
I don't want you to show me where the 50 feet is on this one also.

848
01:54:07,540 --> 01:54:10,540
Where's the 50 feet on this one?

849
01:54:10,540 --> 01:54:14,540
This one is working kick ass also back and forth.

850
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:18,540
Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't because the well has got water.

851
01:54:18,540 --> 01:54:25,540
Sometimes it comes up. There's a lake that infiltrates the well and the well gets like really dark tea color water sometimes.

852
01:54:25,540 --> 01:54:30,540
But do you see the second picture I put in with the tank in the background?

853
01:54:30,540 --> 01:54:31,540
Yeah.

854
01:54:31,540 --> 01:54:37,540
Yeah, where's the 50 feet on runner length for gets to the house on that?

855
01:54:37,540 --> 01:54:43,540
Already in the house. And the part of the instructions is it shouldn't even be in the house.

856
01:54:43,540 --> 01:54:48,540
It should be outside of the house and you can test this.

857
01:54:48,540 --> 01:54:52,540
If you, I don't know, I'll drop in a picture of an umbilical. Are you guys?

858
01:54:52,540 --> 01:54:56,540
Do you guys know what I mean by an umbilical?

859
01:54:56,540 --> 01:55:01,540
You know what a water main is? Have you heard of someone like they have a water main break in their house?

860
01:55:01,540 --> 01:55:03,540
Right.

861
01:55:03,540 --> 01:55:08,540
And they shut off the, they shut off the water and guess what the children can't brush their teeth.

862
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:12,540
They can't flush the toilets. There's no water going in the house. What was the way you do?

863
01:55:12,540 --> 01:55:17,540
You go to what usually the water main breaks before the, the main shut off to the house.

864
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:20,540
So you go to the main shut off to the house and you shut it off.

865
01:55:20,540 --> 01:55:25,540
And you go to the street and you shut off the water main to stop the leak. There's no reason to pay for water.

866
01:55:25,540 --> 01:55:30,540
Like you're filling a swimming pool is just going into the ground. Now the house doesn't have any water.

867
01:55:30,540 --> 01:55:37,540
You go next door to the house next door. You go to the next door's hose bib and you attach a hose.

868
01:55:37,540 --> 01:55:45,540
And you bring that hose bib to the house that the water is shut off to and you attach it to their hose bib.

869
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:48,540
And you turn on that water valve, both water.

870
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:55,540
Now one house is hose bib energizes the other house with the shut off water through its hose bib.

871
01:55:55,540 --> 01:56:00,540
And you all have water happily ever after until, well until the water main is repaired.

872
01:56:00,540 --> 01:56:06,540
You see how the umbilical works. It's almost like two cars when someone battery dies.

873
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:10,540
You get a boost right from another car. It's almost the same principle.

874
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:14,540
I call it an umbilical. You follow how that works?

875
01:56:14,540 --> 01:56:19,540
Now here, let's say you got someone with a healthy, malice skepticism.

876
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:23,540
And they're like, well, I don't know if I want to install this right now.

877
01:56:23,540 --> 01:56:26,540
And they're like, well, why don't we give it a try? Why don't we give it a try?

878
01:56:26,540 --> 01:56:32,540
So you go to their house and you shut off the water main, right at the street or wherever.

879
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:38,540
And you go to their neighbor and you know, say, hey, look, I'll give you 20 bucks if you let me borrow an hour's worth of your water.

880
01:56:38,540 --> 01:56:43,540
Or if they're really friendly, or if your mom lives next door, right, I'll give you a real head case.

881
01:56:43,540 --> 01:56:47,540
Their mom lives next door. She's not going to say no.

882
01:56:47,540 --> 01:56:53,540
So I go to extor and I hook up a hose with a short length of six foot length of the hose to the scalerator.

883
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:58,540
And then the 50 foot goes to the house that I just shut the water off and we turn the water on it.

884
01:56:58,540 --> 01:57:05,540
And now they're getting the entire house energized with scalerator water from the house next door.

885
01:57:05,540 --> 01:57:10,540
I could show you a picture of an umbilical setup like that.

886
01:57:10,540 --> 01:57:14,540
But then we're going to populate the entire of anybody comes to this.

887
01:57:14,540 --> 01:57:21,540
I might delete these just to clean up the chat here or not up to you guys.

888
01:57:21,540 --> 01:57:24,540
Grab the pictures if you want.

889
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:26,540
But do you see what I mean by the umbilical?

890
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:30,540
That is very helpful if you want to just someone to try it.

891
01:57:30,540 --> 01:57:36,540
Or if you just want to, if you don't want to cut into your own water main and you're friendly with a neighbor,

892
01:57:36,540 --> 01:57:39,540
it's good to be friendly with the neighbor adjacent to you.

893
01:57:39,540 --> 01:57:46,540
If you're friendly with the not friendly with the neighbors adjacent, but you're friendly with the neighbors down the block, you're going to need a long hose, right?

894
01:57:46,540 --> 01:57:53,540
So if you are friendly with a neighbor or adjacent property and before you cut into your water main, do the umbilical.

895
01:57:53,540 --> 01:57:54,540
And it's the same thing.

896
01:57:54,540 --> 01:57:56,540
Now let me tell you what happens.

897
01:57:56,540 --> 01:58:03,540
Go ahead. Any more any questions on the fab or the fabrication?

898
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:14,540
Creek, I had a question. The inner magnet. I thought I heard you say that it was two and a half inches, but when I look at the inner hole diameter on the other one, it's three and it's three and one eight outer.

899
01:58:14,540 --> 01:58:20,540
Yeah, two and a half inches is the inner hole of the of the large magnet and three.

900
01:58:20,540 --> 01:58:31,540
The large, okay, the large magnet is five and a quarter outer the inner magnet is three and eight outer.

901
01:58:31,540 --> 01:58:43,540
The inner of the larger magnet is two and a half and the inner of the smaller magnet is one and three eights.

902
01:58:43,540 --> 01:58:45,540
So there.

903
01:58:45,540 --> 01:58:51,540
Yeah, I was expecting the smaller magnet diameter to match the whole diameter of the larger magnet.

904
01:58:51,540 --> 01:58:54,540
No, you don't know, no, no, no, avoid that.

905
01:58:54,540 --> 01:59:00,540
It's what it'll have. It'll fall right. It'll fall right into it, right? And then you'll have a big problem.

906
01:59:00,540 --> 01:59:04,540
Actually, as a matter of fact, you know, fields reverse when you do that, right?

907
01:59:04,540 --> 01:59:08,540
You know what a rail gun is? You've heard of a rail gun instead of using gun powder.

908
01:59:08,540 --> 01:59:15,540
You use magnet, a pulse magnetic fields to propel an object.

909
01:59:15,540 --> 01:59:23,540
Okay, yeah. Yeah, you just go out and buy yourself about 30 or 40 of the big magnets and then you get a magnet that's about the size of the inner hole.

910
01:59:23,540 --> 01:59:26,540
And just let it go and watch what happens.

911
01:59:26,540 --> 01:59:33,540
If you know how to do it, the inner magnet will shoot out about the twice the speed of sound and go right through your neighbor's window and house.

912
01:59:33,540 --> 01:59:38,540
Yeah, you may just make a rail gun if you do that.

913
01:59:38,540 --> 01:59:42,540
We're not in the real gun business yet. So hold on.

914
01:59:42,540 --> 01:59:43,540
Okay.

915
01:59:43,540 --> 01:59:47,540
Yeah, no, you want your magnets to stack with overlap.

916
01:59:47,540 --> 01:59:50,540
It's lucky I didn't know that one. I was 15.

917
01:59:50,540 --> 01:59:54,540
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

918
01:59:54,540 --> 01:59:59,540
So, yeah, you want your magnets to stack and overlap.

919
01:59:59,540 --> 02:00:03,540
Okay. That was what I missed. Yeah, I missed it. They were stuck.

920
02:00:03,540 --> 02:00:06,540
Yeah, you want to stack them and you want room for stacking.

921
02:00:06,540 --> 02:00:08,540
Now, how much room for stacking?

922
02:00:08,540 --> 02:00:14,540
Even if it just stacked for a 16th of an inch, it's as long as it doesn't fall through. It's fine.

923
02:00:14,540 --> 02:00:17,540
As long as she doesn't fall through, it's fine.

924
02:00:17,540 --> 02:00:22,540
But I like to have I like to have an overlap for structural reasons.

925
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:29,540
Also, the more magnets you use, what would be optimum for a device would be a spherical magnet.

926
02:00:29,540 --> 02:00:33,540
Imagine stacking enough magnets that you make a cone.

927
02:00:33,540 --> 02:00:35,540
So it looks like two cones.

928
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:43,540
That would be optimal, but you would also increase the diameter. Right? Or you know, you make a very abrupt. It's hyperbolic cone.

929
02:00:43,540 --> 02:00:48,540
So as they as you so the next magnet you stack much would be much smaller in proportion.

930
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:53,540
Because I have kept stacking extra magnets and it doesn't make that much of a difference.

931
02:00:53,540 --> 02:01:03,540
But I believe that if you do them hyperbolicly, where they almost come to a point like a pyramid, a cone, a very sharp cone, but hyperbolic, it will improve it again.

932
02:01:03,540 --> 02:01:09,540
Because not about the magnets is about what kind of a block wall quality are you creating, right?

933
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:17,540
And the more you focus the centrifugal part of the magnet away from the block wall, the better the block wall works.

934
02:01:17,540 --> 02:01:23,540
This is still all theoretical. Remember, I'm the only I've got I get no I'm the only one that's been doing this for 10 months now.

935
02:01:23,540 --> 02:01:31,540
This is a new thing. So one of the things one of the purposes of me reaching out to others is to increase the study. Right.

936
02:01:31,540 --> 02:01:47,540
And also I'm never going to I don't want the rights or patents on them. So whatever. Yes, I am the daddy.

937
02:01:47,540 --> 02:01:50,540
Whatever. So what?

938
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:57,540
And the more people that do it and put it out in public, I'm not afraid of anybody copying it if I just looking at it.

939
02:01:57,540 --> 02:02:04,540
Or getting a patent or claiming it or whatever because at this even at this point, it's almost too late for someone.

940
02:02:04,540 --> 02:02:11,540
A quote unquote steal the idea and go unchallenged because it's already been put out to the public domain as such.

941
02:02:11,540 --> 02:02:13,540
You know what I mean?

942
02:02:13,540 --> 02:02:25,540
But what's beautiful about it is if you really know how to work the business and you could go that route and keep everything proprietary and hidden just like those technical drawings that show covers and stuff built on it.

943
02:02:25,540 --> 02:02:30,540
And be you know the standard, you know, greedy fucker.

944
02:02:30,540 --> 02:02:34,540
If you have a patent and you want to get wealthy off it, you're not necessarily greedy fucker.

945
02:02:34,540 --> 02:02:42,540
But you know, you can take that typical route. You know, it's my idea. My patent. You can't use it. You know, you can go that route with this, by the way.

946
02:02:42,540 --> 02:02:47,540
I don't think it should go that way because this is something that is so unintuitive to most people.

947
02:02:47,540 --> 02:02:53,540
Because you mentioned that there is a magnet there. Of course you get you're using you're not using the right part of the magnet.

948
02:02:53,540 --> 02:02:55,540
Right.

949
02:02:55,540 --> 02:02:58,540
On magnets work Greek.

950
02:02:58,540 --> 02:03:00,540
Yeah.

951
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:10,540
Did you ever try the same test when you're putting a hot sand and the magnet tech together on that other kind of white PVC.

952
02:03:10,540 --> 02:03:14,540
And see if it had the same problem or.

953
02:03:14,540 --> 02:03:19,540
No, no, I didn't know why PVC to me is junk. Yeah, I would never use it. Yeah.

954
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:23,540
I get that. I didn't just know, but I did. I did. I did. I did. I did. I did.

955
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:30,540
But it is on the house. No, I wouldn't improve it enough. No, it's just junk. It's junk plastic and it's still all thickness is too thin.

956
02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:36,540
No, just for me, for me to do in other words, I can't sign my name on it, even though the first one that I did is like that.

957
02:03:36,540 --> 02:03:38,540
Because that's what I had.

958
02:03:38,540 --> 02:03:45,540
When I first got the idea because of the discovery, I have plenty of PVC pipelying around. I got plenty of magnets laying around.

959
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:55,540
So I got up one morning and say, let's put this together. Right. Let's put this together before lunch and get it installed because I was already doing an underpinning on the foundation wall there anyway.

960
02:03:55,540 --> 02:04:02,540
The timing worked out fine. It was already trenched. That area was dug out already as you could see looks like a new concrete step built there.

961
02:04:02,540 --> 02:04:10,540
Well, that goes down another half. Yeah, it goes a foot and a half down and a foot and a half under the house is a huge amount of cement there.

962
02:04:10,540 --> 02:04:23,540
Right. So it was already open and fit for and said, hey, I'm ready to put all the dirt back. Hey, make something on the pot of coffee, get some other pack of cigarettes makes up a, you know, I didn't know what to call it back then.

963
02:04:23,540 --> 02:04:28,540
Scalerator stick it in there, cut the pipe, put it in there real quick.

964
02:04:28,540 --> 02:04:39,540
Still there. But then I was like, this is junk PVC is junk anybody works with this stuff knows that it is, you know, if you were going to it's okay for outdoor use.

965
02:04:39,540 --> 02:04:50,540
It's a lot to use that white stuff indoors. It's too fragile, but you get a pallet of this stuff for a bundle of this deliver they drop it off the pickup truck the bottom two pieces of crack.

966
02:04:50,540 --> 02:04:53,540
Just handling it.

967
02:04:53,540 --> 02:04:59,540
Yeah, I'm against I'm against using it for for something up for an object.

968
02:04:59,540 --> 02:05:09,540
It's like the 3D printed stuff to me. It's junk anything 3D printed is junk if it's worth anything you're not going to 3D print it.

969
02:05:09,540 --> 02:05:20,540
So, you know, I like to show respect to other people who dropping five grand on a scaler that I make. I'm not going to insult you by sending you schedule 40 plastic.

970
02:05:20,540 --> 02:05:23,540
Oh, yeah, right.

971
02:05:23,540 --> 02:05:35,540
So, if anything else I want to get just relay what a typical scalerator install does for someone what what you should expect.

972
02:05:35,540 --> 02:05:48,540
If you if someone finds out about you have something like this and they're not broke, you know, they make a pretty good living they have a you know, half a million three three quarter million dollar house.

973
02:05:48,540 --> 02:06:00,540
And they're like, oh, I hate the water my hair my skin's dry water doesn't taste good even through a filter my dad says I should get a water salt water softener or a row and I'm like, no, I heard about what you got.

974
02:06:00,540 --> 02:06:08,540
It's kind of expensive, but what tell me about it scientifically can you tell me about it scientifically, especially because this person works in the science background.

975
02:06:08,540 --> 02:06:15,540
And I said, well, yeah, there's no such thing as this is us just saying is that there an agreement with me in a to a degree.

976
02:06:15,540 --> 02:06:21,540
And they're kind of healthy healthy dose of skepticism.

977
02:06:21,540 --> 02:06:28,540
And they're like, yeah, okay, let's do it. Let's do it. I'm like, okay, go. So we got a plumber.

978
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:38,540
I'm in a place with an HOA and one of these home associations, I get a license plumber to it. So the installations are duicated. So some of these nosy bastards come around. What are you doing?

979
02:06:38,540 --> 02:06:40,540
It's a license plumber. Oh, it's fine.

980
02:06:40,540 --> 02:06:42,540
If he's license.

981
02:06:42,540 --> 02:06:55,540
So while the installation is going on, they're like, I tell the person go inside before we cut the main and let the water run so you don't get water sitting in the pipes and get fresh water that you normally get fill up a jug with it.

982
02:06:55,540 --> 02:07:02,540
And then we get a taste of this is before we put this in, you know, your control water. This is the water before.

983
02:07:02,540 --> 02:07:12,540
And the plumber start, you know, we do that. Plumber starts cutting away whatever. Okay. So how's the water? How's the tap water? Oh, it tastes like shit. It's crappy tap, you know, two-zontap water is usual.

984
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:13,540
Okay.

985
02:07:13,540 --> 02:07:29,540
And while the scalerator is going, it doesn't take about an half an hour, 45 minutes to get it in there. They're like, oh, you know, I want to also when this gets connected and ready, I want to also I'm getting a sample ready to take to a lab so they could tell me the difference, right?

986
02:07:29,540 --> 02:07:37,540
And I'm like, are you sure? Okay. All right. You go ahead and get your lab sample, whatever we're ready. You know, you measure it and all that. That's fine.

987
02:07:37,540 --> 02:07:45,540
So anyway, we get the scalerator in, turn the water on because there's some copper solder and all get the flux out of the water. Let it run for a few minutes.

988
02:07:45,540 --> 02:07:53,540
Get all the pipes, you know, run all the fixtures in the house. Get it on water, clean water in there. Right away, go get a water sample inside. Let it run.

989
02:07:53,540 --> 02:07:54,540
Get some water.

990
02:07:54,540 --> 02:07:55,540
Get some water.

991
02:07:55,540 --> 02:08:07,540
Oh my gosh, did you still want to take it to a lab, not necessary. It's not necessary at all. The difference is huge. Like you sure you don't want to have it tested, not necessary.

992
02:08:07,540 --> 02:08:08,540
Right.

993
02:08:08,540 --> 02:08:21,540
So here you have someone who's scientific works in a professional field is very skeptical is still skeptical and wants to have the post scalerator water tested so they can quantify.

994
02:08:21,540 --> 02:08:27,540
Scalerator goes in and immediately they're like the lab testing is not necessary. The difference is so big.

995
02:08:27,540 --> 02:08:38,540
It even tastes better than the best bottled water. We have coming straight out of the tap. And then I keep getting consecutive messages day after day after day after day after day after day.

996
02:08:38,540 --> 02:08:46,540
I can't believe how easy it is to clean everything is sparkling. No water stains. My hair is smooth. My skin is not dry anymore.

997
02:08:46,540 --> 02:08:58,540
The water coming through the burky filter is delicious where it tasted like crap before every day, every other day messages. The water is amazing. I just came back from a trip. I missed the water in my house. The water is amazing.

998
02:08:58,540 --> 02:09:02,540
On a few days later, another message. The water is incredible. Thank you.

This is from someone who had a healthy amount of skepticism.

1000
02:09:05,540 --> 02:09:11,540
Who wanted to take it to a lab to see what it really does. And they're like absolutely not necessary.

1001
02:09:11,540 --> 02:09:29,540
Imagine that. This is how big the difference is. When you with municipal water municipal tap water, which is predominates. I think it's 85% of most urban and suburban populations use city water or state water.

1002
02:09:29,540 --> 02:09:31,540
Not a well water.

1003
02:09:31,540 --> 02:09:38,540
So this is a repeated reaction that I get. And this is what you would expect also.

1004
