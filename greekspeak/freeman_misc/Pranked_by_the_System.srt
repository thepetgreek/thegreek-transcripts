00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,720
Hello and welcome to the Free Zone.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,120
Well, it has been one wild ride as we have all been expecting.

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,320
But we need to know, are we communicating?

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,440
I mean, who wrote your operating system?

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,440
Is your head in a vacuum?

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,560
We're going to find out as we speak with a natural philosopher today.

8
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:41,520
I call them that because if I ever felt like I was talking to someone from the future,

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,080
it's while talking with the Greek.

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,760
And so, after all of the shenanigans that we've been witnessing,

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,240
I could think of no one better to come and really give us a heads up view

12
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,640
of our world as it is, as it has been, and what it will be.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,360
So, please welcome to the show The Greek.

14
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,440
It's great to have you here with us.

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,400
Oh, thank you, Freeman. It's, I guess, good to be back.

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,480
Any kind of venue that we could come out and display or do a good public report

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,800
is always advantageous for the audience.

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,520
So, again, thanks for thinking of me.

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,320
Yeah, we are hungry for the knowledge we are.

20
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,320
And we're looking at a world in chaos.

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,360
We're seeing everybody function on the programming inside of their operating system.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,440
They don't even know that it's happening.

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,520
They don't know where this operating system came from.

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,880
Now, in February, nine months ago, we were speaking.

25
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,560
And you said, your vote is your vow to accept the electors' choice.

26
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,360
And I think we should open the show with that in that,

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,520
you know, nine months ago, you said this.

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:57,680
And now here we are with liberals in the streets and bloody, violent riots trying to flip the vote.

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,080
And it's blowing my mind, honestly.

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,360
I didn't think that the Hillary supporters would be out beating up people in the streets.

31
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,600
But what I do know is that what they, the they want is chaos.

32
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,600
And so let's look at the operating system that would develop into this idea that

33
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,920
you would write in the streets over this.

34
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,480
And the legal and lawful ways that this is also wrong.

35
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,040
Take it from whoever you want.

36
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,800
Sure. Let's look at it real simply.

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,920
What is possible, pretty much anything is possible.

38
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,920
And who can ponder all the possibilities?

39
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,640
So you have to be a good observer to see what's happening.

40
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,800
And what is happening is possible because it's happening.

41
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,400
So when you talk about the operating system, let's use the computer as a metaphor.

42
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,440
You have an operating system, then you have programs, then you have files.

43
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,480
Most people are actually trying to process files and programs, and they have no operating system.

44
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,400
And what I mean about that is your operating system, this might sound dogmatic now, comes from your God,

45
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,880
comes from your deity, someone you look up to.

46
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,320
Like if you're three years old and you're formative years, your parents are your God.

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,080
So what I mean by God is a higher authority, not only in concept but in actual power,

48
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,960
like the unseen world, rules, the scene world, you know, shadow government, anyone, anyway.

49
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:26,080
So what we're talking about here is things to come might seem fascinating to people

50
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,320
or how things work because they really just haven't thought it out or they don't have the

51
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,920
convention to access this way of thinking or seeing things because the operating system comes from

52
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:43,680
your deity and they don't acknowledge that. For example, every country has a patron or patron deity

53
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,400
in the Western world. Most of the countries have adopted the revived goddess religion.

54
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,680
And when I say operating system, it's where you get your law, not traffic law or tax law, but

55
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,600
what you eat, what you wear, how you operate in business, how you raise a family, how you keep time,

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:05,680
that comes from your God. And they have the Western world has incorporated the revived goddess

57
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:13,440
religion, aka known as justicia or justice, Statue of a Woman Holding Scales Blindfolded and such.

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:20,640
Right, you'll see statues. She's also known as Columbia, Britannia, you know, a lot of other

59
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,800
aspects of, you know, let's say smaller societies have their different gods, right? They've

60
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,840
revived various different gods and that's where they get their law form from.

61
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,040
Now, the interesting thing about that is if you are atheistic in any capacity,

62
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,240
you still cannot escape this. Like, for example, discussing, you know, having this discussion with an

63
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,520
atheist, they'll say, well, Greek or Freemony, I don't believe in any God. Well, that's really simple.

64
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,080
You just ask them, do you then follow or believe in the laws of the state? And they almost always say,

65
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,960
yes, well, then there's your God in April 1st is your holiday. So you see, this is the operating system

66
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,120
and it's in place and no one is paying attention to it, but it doesn't mean that they're not subject to it,

67
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,040
right? Let's go back to the justice aspect. How many times have you heard in terms of law

68
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,160
form? Let's, in this case, it would be legal form. You'll have to be brought to justice. You serve

69
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,040
justice is a miscarriage of justice, right? And all of these things. So they're using this in front

70
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,920
of you. They have the iconography and statuary to prove it. Now, their agents and the priesthood

71
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,680
and the entitled classes that rule the rest of the people, guess what? They don't even know it

72
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:39,120
in most cases. They are just following along. So tie that into what's going on. I think you mentioned

73
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,120
what the month is called February discussed about what voting actually means. It means to vow that

74
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:52,400
you are supporting the system and whatever electorate body decides to elect, you are all for it.

75
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Like I'm with you guys. And this is what's going on. Let's say regarding the condition of what is

76
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,760
possible. I guess there's a protest against the electorate. But so these are the possibilities

77
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,680
that cannot be thought of but observed and maybe described. So that could tie into the rest of

78
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,120
the discussion because it's not very narrow and linear. So what do you think? Do you want to maybe

79
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,560
perhaps go down the path of the political path or just still maybe the general aspect of

80
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,600
the operating system is? I'm really happy to hear your general views of things because I swear that

81
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:36,480
you are from the future Greek. So I think that you're you are the master of the obvious that no one

82
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:43,680
ever sees. And thank you. I want to share that with with my audience because you point out things that

83
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:51,040
just right in front of our faces and we never stop to think about them. So I really want to follow

84
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:57,840
your lead. Okay well you know I have like a stock way of speaking and typically it's

85
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,960
metaphorically you know the last thing for mankind to discover is what's obvious.

86
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,800
And the obvious is just what's right in front of you. Let's not be hypocritical. I mean people

87
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,720
want to go out and to far away places and far away thinking to discover things but typically

88
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,280
they're shallow thinking gets them diving off into the deep end. So if you're going to be shallow

89
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,280
about things take care of business and what's just five feet around you first.

90
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:34,960
And the stock way of starting off on anything like this is people don't even know what day it is.

91
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,920
Now what I mean by that it sounds kind of bizarre whether you care or not it's the concept of time.

92
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,360
You know you've heard in the new age movement a lot of loosely thinking people say well there's

93
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,240
no such thing as time. Well that's correct in a sense because time is nothing other than the

94
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,440
recordation and memorialization of events. So when you hear about time travel you're not really

95
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,280
traveling in time you're either going to past or future events and time is the recordation of such.

96
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,640
So currently if you ask anyone what day it is they're actually not giving you the day they're

97
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:12,400
giving you the date they're giving you something off of what I loosely call the Pope's work schedule

98
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,000
which is anything between January through December Monday through Friday and they usually have

99
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,760
this thing called hours and minutes which is what I call the wind up toy known as the clock.

100
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,920
So typically you know just to refresh people if you don't even know what day it is how are you going

101
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,640
to navigate because time is important for navigation you know if you're moving 20 miles per hour

102
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,120
for one hour that you've covered 20 miles right anyone that navigates or plots things

103
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,200
understands time is important. How are you going to navigate the waters of the universe

104
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,600
social aspects and even any cosmological aspect if you don't know how to reckon time.

105
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,760
For example if you observe a what's called a birthday or anniversary any year you'll notice that

106
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,000
it's a different day of the year every year right. If you look at what day it is today folks you look

107
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,120
last year and look at next year it's a few days off so what day is it it's none of it it's the Pope's

108
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,160
work schedule meaning it is nothing more than is if you worked at a corporate headquarters and they

109
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,600
gave you a chart with different color days and this is when you work. So no one really knows what

110
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:23,600
day it is and in that day aspect is not about being usurped by a schedule but actually accessing

111
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,960
information that anyone can access without buying anything or having an allegiance or subscribing.

112
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:35,760
So this convention of what's called the Gregorian calendar that's been accepted by all society is

113
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:44,400
very much considered you know the state of society on the planet as being pretty piss poor if you

114
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:50,640
can't navigate using any good timekeeping and let me just throw in a quick thing this is kind of

115
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:58,240
long-winded. See years ago people settled their debts with the full moon which is really the new moon

116
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,120
rises in the east that's why today you still get a moonfully bill don't you don't think give you a

117
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:11,760
moonfully bill it's called moonfully but you see the moon rules the month and the day starts at high

118
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:19,200
noon right not at midnight if you remember banking before the electronic convention if you'd made

119
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:27,520
a deposit afternoon it was considered the next day in the Wild West type of society in the US they

120
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:34,960
had court in the morning and they executed sentence the next day they hung you when high noon so we're

121
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,240
having the day beginning at noon and actually the timekeeping conventions of the world which would

122
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:48,080
be Greenwich and the other one I believe is in Colorado Springs and Naval Observatory if you look

123
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,040
up this was I'm not sure if it's still there but on their website Julian calendar day they clearly

124
00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:01,360
tell you that the day starts at solar noon but for scientific purposes I mean it starts at high

125
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,920
noon for scientific and astronomical purposes but for the people at civil midnight that's like how

126
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,560
it's kind of a put down sort of how like the dictionaries were assembled 200 years ago they weren't

127
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,680
sure how to define words when you looked up the word oats it said what they feed horses in England but

128
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:27,040
the staple of people in Scotland so this is being put in front of you and no one is really noticing

129
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:34,080
that there's a shifting of time meaning the way you record time time doesn't shift because the

130
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,880
events are the events it's just that you cannot record it so now if you don't have a way of memorializing

131
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:46,000
time how are you going to memorialize or record events very loosely so that's why you have a lot of

132
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,400
this false hope in things let's go you know keeping it back to the conversation tying it back to the

133
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:58,640
recent election in the U.S. you have a character now under the covenant that I live by by the way

134
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:05,200
any I don't speak poorly of the leader of any people because they're put there by divine right

135
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:12,720
believe it or not this is where the Asians are correct but you have a character here who is let's say

136
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,760
allegedly the leader of the American society now North American known as the United States of America

137
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,160
what made him so popular is a very very loose statement let's make America great again and that's

138
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,280
all that it took there's no understanding of that what do you mean by that just getting people

139
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,720
rouled up about it you see and if you want to understand that concept a little more even though this

140
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,440
is a perhaps a one hour or a one hour or two hour recording anyone is interested a little bit more

141
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:50,000
on what's called this crowd mentality I recommend them to consider Gustav LeBond the crowd it's

142
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,680
it's on a book form ebook form audio book form and start delving into how the crowd mentality works

143
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,800
and you will see it from a social perspective how this man really compiled something really well

144
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,520
in the 1895 I believe and that will give you an understanding on that but again just to go back to

145
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:16,800
maybe leading this conversation you people still have not realized that they're not able to memorialize

146
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:24,080
timekeeping and will awful timekeeping other things are within their physical reality you know

147
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:29,520
you ever notice how heat rises and cold descends but in all biological systems the cold rises and

148
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:35,680
the heat descends like a cool feet and more cool head and warm feet or when you go up into the sky

149
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,200
it's cold and down in the valley it's hot all biological systems have opposite movement

150
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,480
why aren't people demanding from their technicians and engineers to design artificial heating

151
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,960
equipment to do that so right now they're just passively ignorant of this fact and they have

152
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:58,080
air conditioning and heating in their cars homes and boats and places that give them a hot head

153
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:04,560
and cold feet and no one is paying any attention you see you know the other stock thing is going

154
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,520
back to their deity now most people when you bring that up you know they're God they think of religion

155
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,600
and you have the major religions Islam Christianity Buddhism Hinduism and such and all the spin-offs

156
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,680
do you know that none of those religions know or do anything that's in the text that they alleged to

157
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:30,240
subscribe to yes at all and and I'm not talking about taking it out of context and it's really easy

158
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,720
to start a religion like for example if you look at the a lot of the Catholic Christian memes

159
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,720
you know if you want to start a subgroup in there it's very simple get a chocolate chip recipe

160
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,920
bake a cookie bake a set of cookies and if one of them looks like what's called the queen of heaven

161
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,560
you tell everyone and in about a month you'll have a thousand people following you asking

162
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,320
you about how that cookie crumbled right so this is very very simple I mean people again the

163
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,320
crowd mentality but going back to no one knows or does anything that's in the text that they alleged to

164
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:11,600
subscribe to meaning in context and here's the thing if these texts are divinely inspired

165
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,120
and you are told that no one can understand them or that's your interpretation indirectly what

166
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,400
people are saying is the gods are acting in futility and I'll tell you for sure the gods do not act

167
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,000
in futility they might have an IQ of two million and they're giving you baby talk and you still can

168
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,040
understand it but that message is not futile now here just to lay something out a lot of times I

169
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,440
refer to the what's called the biblical text and that's very difficult to discuss because guess what

170
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,320
all of the versions that you have in all the languages has been translated in based on king James

171
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,720
or other things is not a translation it is a version there's over 27,000 critical mistakes in

172
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,240
that document it's irrelevant in terms of getting the proper message now what you're getting is a

173
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,960
general outline of the story but you will be it is wrought with error so you're going to have to go

174
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:09,200
back to the languages of preservation sorry you know but from that point of view the same goes with

175
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,800
any of the texts in any other language these texts are preserved in their original languages and

176
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,200
you're it's not going to be given to you on a silver platter you're going to have to do the work

177
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:28,480
now when you look at these religions as being the let's say or as I stated earlier your god is your law

178
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:37,760
form and such and you have now debased it and are going by tradition right like you know for example

179
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,000
Christmas and Easter bunny and all these other things are not in the biblical text but the majority

180
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,960
that is what how Christianity is defined public prayer and Islam mosques and other things about

181
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:55,040
women covering their bodies and all that is not in the Quran right but they still do it so these

182
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,920
traditions or let's go back to Buddhism you know they have a little statue or Hinduism you have

183
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,440
certain practices you will not find that in the Rig Vita's or any of the writings either so these

184
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:15,840
cultural traditions behaviors that the people engage in also have a deity or an entity behind them

185
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:23,840
but it is not the one that they think so they've been kind of winked right so again we have many many

186
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:29,920
layers let's go back to the political aspect with this election how many times have you heard of

187
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,320
what's called the shadow government I believe there was even a public speech warning by Kennedy

188
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,160
regarding that right and even right yeah and the WikiLeaks and actually would your willson had

189
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,960
alluded to that about there's a conspiracy so great no man can go against it or something like that

190
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,520
and paraphrasing right there is another entity behind that so we're talking about a world of the unseen

191
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,800
now what I mean by that it just hasn't been properly identified just like years ago if people

192
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,240
used hot coal to cool to heat their house and they close the doors and windows they woke up dead and

193
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,480
they didn't know what killed them it was the ether they called it but later on they discovered

194
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,560
there's something called carbon monoxide and they had a carbon monoxide detector and now you know

195
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,760
not to do that because you can specifically identify the agent that brought that a situation on

196
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,600
currently humanity is in a state where they cannot specifically identify the agents that bring

197
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,760
about their condition aka known as the gods or unseen beings yes and where I'm not really crazy

198
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,560
thinking that I have friends that you can't see this is just based on what has been memorialized now

199
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:40,160
if you memorialized in texts and information we can access meaning if you think like most people

200
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,960
that everything came into creation less than a hundred years ago and everyone that wrote anything prior

201
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,080
to you regarding the gods is an idiot or you don't have to believe in it you are not examining

202
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,560
information that is that is available to you to explain many of the things that are going on

203
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:06,560
without a doubt you know exactly what you're saying it's all social norms and none of it is the

204
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:16,000
documented evidence which again they're only allowed versions and then with this traditional standpoint

205
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,680
and the versions that they're dealing with and I've seen you know Christians that disagree with

206
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:28,320
interpretations and get thrown out of their church or whatever you know back and forth because of

207
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,960
interpretation and we're looking at a situation where they want to rile up the mob and

208
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:43,120
all the fanatics are out there screaming kill all the fanatics so right well here's the thing you brought

209
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:50,320
up church and all of these institutions these temples they are just revived a post flood let's say

210
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,400
paganism like the word church comes from circuit it actually Latin word for circus the three ring

211
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,440
circus or what's called the trinity they won't find that in the text but they memorialize that now

212
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,280
let's just get down and dirty about it which is actually true and clean is the Christianity was started

213
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:14,480
pretty much very much how 9/11 conspiracy movement was started no one really knew how those buildings

214
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,480
came down in public and mass groups so they they have all of these people saying oh it was thermite

215
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,920
oh it was some space weapon or whatever but actually what brought them down is quite simple

216
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,320
device and it's not what people think because they don't understand the structure of the building now

217
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,600
what was going on around the first century there was a lot of incredible events happening and there

218
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:43,600
was a lot of was a rumor mill that was going and the events where you served by the typically a fellow

219
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:50,560
named Simon Magus Simon Simon the magician and he was quite popular and quite wealthy like a

220
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:57,040
Houdini or a David Copperfield with the budget of let's say Bill Gates or George Soros right and he

221
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,840
was at that time period and he didn't know what was going on either but he was able to promote

222
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:09,520
for his advantage the frenzy that was going on about the events in the first century then

223
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:16,800
to focus on what he was saying about it right and he was also a Samaritan descent which the Samaritans

224
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,040
are very interesting if you look them up back in the day they had their pagan gods but they also

225
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,680
invited let's say scriptural law so there were a good mishmash of everything and also when you look

226
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:34,480
at the history of Simon Magus you have the offshoots of what's called nosticism right and all these

227
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,920
other aspects of Christianity but if anyone studies the biblical text you'll see that everything that

228
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,640
they're doing not some of what Christianity is doing but everything Christianity is doing is either

229
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,960
on the abominations list or the don't do list of the biblical text now the problem with discussing

230
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,520
this like this and not making this a quote-unquote religious discussion is I want to just make a

231
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:01,120
comment there's quite a few people unstudied and unfamiliar with the text that come out and say

232
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,920
it was a different god of the New Testament than the Old Testament right many times have you heard

233
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:13,520
that well the thing that they miss out on that the so-called god of the New and Old Testament is

234
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,200
the same one and it's not what people think it is the Christ himself in the text now this is not

235
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,880
nothing to do with what you believe in because the Christ was god himself manifest in according to

236
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,200
the text so one of the main things that they bring up is how in the Old Testament the Israelites were

237
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,080
told to go and kill every man, woman and child in certain cities before they occupied the land

238
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,680
and in the New Testament it's all about love and peace and all this and there couldn't be anything

239
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:47,760
further from the truth they have not studied the text now I tell people in passing and they find

240
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,680
it very shocking but who is the most hateful character in the biblical text pause they can't answer

241
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:59,120
it's the Christ how do you know well you just read the text he'll say things like think not I brought

242
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,640
here to bring peace I came to divide with the sword I will bring terror amongst you oh another thing

243
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,280
that's stated in the in the in the in what's called the New Testament is that you've been better off

244
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,160
been at Sodom and Gomorrah than what's going to come upon your village or city or how about this

245
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:20,000
one why do you speak to the people in parable and riddle it's is the truth is not given to them it's

246
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,760
given to you right so you have many of these aspects now what I mean by hateful meaning that hateful

247
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,000
of the way that man operates at this point right and even at that point now let's just jump back to

248
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,240
the Old Testament remember I just mentioned that they were told to go kill every man, woman,

249
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,120
and child and animals as well so it can't be the same god right because they have this concept and

250
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:47,200
I just showed that he's not about love and peace well why why did they tell the Israelites to go in

251
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,040
and kill everything and everyone that moved you ever wonder why well it's very clear in the text that

252
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,880
they were engaged in pretty abominable acts that are actually represented in parity today hey

253
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,680
Freeman let's go back in time we're gonna walk down an ancient canaanite village you ready I'm gonna

254
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:09,200
let's hold hands and go on a windy walk through let's say ancient canaan right this is we're talking

255
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,160
about the time that the Israelites were told in and go ahead and slaughter everything and everyone so

256
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:20,400
what we're walking down a public square right now and we're looking in one shop and what do we see

257
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,000
well we see a whole bunch of animals tied down donkeys horses sheep chickens and like you're like well

258
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,560
what's that for I said well this is a sex shop you know people like to get off before they go to

259
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,800
you know into the marketplace down the road this is what they do right so you get all these

260
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:40,240
animals possibly knocked up with human sperm oh let's go to the next shop what do you see there oh I

261
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,280
see all these little children in cages with it what's that for oh well you'll see down at the end

262
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:50,400
of the square there you'll see a seated statue it's made of bronze and it's a glowing red hot

263
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:56,160
and people are told to make a wish a prosperity by placing a child in its lap and searing it alive

264
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,800
but it's kind of hard to do business when you hear children being burned alive so they ring bells

265
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,960
you know if you've ever heard of a fat red character where a child is placed on his lap and you have

266
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:15,440
bells involved like jingle bells right that's mullick revived mullick now this is the type of society

267
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:23,040
that was operating out and open out in public back then so that these people were unreabilitable

268
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:30,320
that was so incorporated into their society that they would rather die then let it go and they

269
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,160
were accommodated by that now what you have in this modern society how many times have you said have

270
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:42,400
you heard let's say people saying oh we have to preserve Christmas you know the actual thing right

271
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:49,200
you see you see what's going on it is exactly the same society but it's in parity another thing I

272
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,160
bring up is what do cannibals birthdays and dolls have in common right I think I don't know if

273
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:01,680
we brought this up previously but you see these things all tie in together and we can go into what

274
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,400
cannibals birthdays and dolls maybe have in common in the second hour perhaps because that's a little

275
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:14,560
bit of a litany on its own so perhaps all of these things and these misunderstandings something is

276
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:24,400
minor of what religion is and discounting the facts behind it and then having pseudo academics or

277
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:30,240
academics promoting a dichotomy that doesn't exist for example the Old Testament God is different

278
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,960
than the New Testament God is foolishness right and by the way at this point I'll say this publicly

279
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,640
I am embarrassed to be in a room with anyone who has more than an eighth grade conventional education

280
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,160
you know for example have you ever seen people drive around in the cars of a bumper sticker

281
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:51,600
my child is an honor student at this school or my child goes to that school and they're so proud of

282
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,880
it sure well I want to make a bumper sticker that says that the only reason I'd said my child to

283
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,840
a public school or university is if I knew there were a complete moron so anyway that is a

284
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,920
personal comment on the current system and everyone's the idea that everything is propaganda that

285
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:17,120
this is just a tool of indoctrination and is that what you mean by this?

286
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,160
well yeah it's indoctrination but either accommodating the people like for example there's

287
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:30,080
there's a reason why fast food is so crappy because people want to be accommodated by fast food

288
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,920
but and they don't really care about what the ingredients are so how are you going to make a profit

289
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,720
if you use higher quality ingredients so you keep it at a minimal high profit because the people

290
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,120
don't care it's what you get away with it's with the market will bear you know here there's

291
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,840
something that I've always discussed in the past it's called pranking humankind right now is

292
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:54,240
subject to a cosmic prank and in other words all of your entitled classes your doctors your attorneys

293
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,000
uh your professors your scientists are pranking you now what's a prank look it up it means ludicrous

294
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,160
trick but the primary prankers are your parents in most cases meaning like when you're a child you're

295
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:11,360
told about Santa Claus in the tooth fairy or you told about this or that and um and one of them is

296
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,120
like you can't see ghosts either right there's a boogie man in the closet no you didn't see anything

297
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,120
yes you did okay so you're being pranked by your own parents who take the seat of God at that time

298
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,320
because you're not aware of any higher authority even the state as a child and at some point the

299
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,320
parents told you oh you're you're too old for that right now you can't talk about Santa Claus or

300
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,680
the Easter bunny what's wrong with you right they never apologize see that's why you have a lot of

301
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,160
psychological problems with teenagers in the western world is because the parents never

302
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,600
apologized for all the pranking they did here's another former pranking the parents

303
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,240
yeah they have the steep psychological embedded thing that you'll need to do is apologize for

304
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,360
lying to the child now here's the other yeah i was just gonna say that's how Catholics become

305
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:03,040
Satanus well yeah you can't you can't be a Satanus without being a Christian and uh i see so

306
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:10,640
often that what happens is is that disillusionment when the you know the prank is revealed and they're

307
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,360
like they become the complete opposite of what they were you know their operating system but it's

308
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,880
but again it's not let's let's hold the pranking thought for a moment Satan is a character that anyone

309
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:30,160
can research he is only dealing with major institutions he doesn't deal with each individual at a time

310
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:36,080
he will in the future with one individual aka known as the anti christ he's the only man in history

311
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,840
that Satan will actually possess all of the other ones are demonic possessions there are trillions of

312
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,920
demons you can even have five thousand demons on in in one person in one man or woman right so they're

313
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:53,040
forget about the seven billion people there's trillions upon trillions of these of these entities

314
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:58,240
in the spiritual realm so you absolutely believe in deities and demons well it's not a matter of

315
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:04,000
believing in them as a look that what's been memorialized about them and i found it to be validatable

316
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,160
and sound information and if you want to go that's what belief should be based on if i write you a

317
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:15,440
check for fifty grand and you call the bank and and there's fifty grand in the account to be transferred

318
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,840
to you for example you can go around telling people you just got fifty grand even though you

319
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,720
haven't yet because everything's in place for it to happen believe should be based on things that

320
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:31,120
are in place that will happen not some obscure abstract insanity that most people are operating on

321
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:38,240
but let's go back to the satanism well you hear a lot of people in these small occulted movements

322
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,680
known as satanists they're really not and they will tell you when they set up like a satanic temple

323
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:49,440
that who their entity is like for example the temple of set that is not satan that is an ancient god

324
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:56,800
revived from a jeb for example and there are others various bals or bals or lords satan is in control

325
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:04,640
this this whole entire social construct is his meaning satan doesn't deal with a little satanic

326
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:12,000
temple that is a revived a demon as a minor very very minor impure demon satan is in control of all

327
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,880
the governments of the world all the religions of the world all of your sciences all of your entertainment

328
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:24,720
very very subtly you see so to say that catholics leave that to become satanic well is Catholicism one

329
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,160
of the major religions of the world yes right so it is also under the control of that right it's very

330
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,800
easy now satan just means adversary now i want to just we're going to go back to the pranking

331
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,680
hopefully because that's very important i believe in some of the disclosure that i like to give

332
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:44,000
i didn't mean to derail you because we did cover satan pretty good last time yeah but actually

333
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,520
let's cover one one more thing in there when you read in the book of genesis what would they give you

334
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:58,480
regarding satan and all that is known as a serpent right people they it's been in iconography

335
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:05,280
statuary and in legend even in film shown as as an actual animal a snake right now if you actually

336
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:10,880
go read the text in in context you will see that is the name of an individual that is very

337
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,400
and very anthropomorphic have you ever heard of a man or a woman's name called robin or someone

338
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:22,720
called hawk does that mean that they're a bird no you just have to be their name so when you go and

339
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,200
look at what's in the original language of preservation what is being translated as the serpent is

340
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:36,880
actually someone's name and this is someone that has taken the form anthropomorphically spirit being

341
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:43,600
that is engaging primary man and primary woman let's say right you know so there's a there's an

342
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,960
aspect to that that needs to be looked at and i mean we can do 500 hours and not repeat one thing

343
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,440
and and give an encyclopedia on this that anyone can access the problem is people just don't

344
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,000
care at this point right but we're going to say it anyway now i want to go back to the pranking

345
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:06,560
and um you are all subject to a prank which is eluticrous trick and uh what i mean by that

346
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:13,360
is that if you try to rationalize a prank you cannot it's purely emotional and if you ask the

347
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,120
prankster why are you pranking me they never give a rational answer but the ultimate answer is

348
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,640
because i can and i feel like it that's why i tell people do you know i'd have a false sense of

349
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,080
optimism on this planet if you woke up this morning alive be thankful that you are because the reality

350
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,720
of the violence level of violence spiritual and physical on this earth is not really

351
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,480
comprehended by most people i tell people basically be thankful that while you were sleeping last night

352
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,920
wherever you were that no one came through the door of where you were sleeping and ripped the

353
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,640
liver out of your body be thankful that didn't happen this is the potential level of violence

354
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,160
that everyone is living under right now and if you by the way someone did do that or attempted to do

355
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,160
that to you while you were ripping the liver out of you bought your body if you ask them why are you

356
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:04,640
doing that they say because i feel like it and that is good enough and that's what i mean about the

357
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:10,880
level of pranking on this planet if you talk to any of the entitled classes the doctors the attorneys

358
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:19,440
the leaders of the people the academics and all that they're all working on a particular field of

359
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,840
their specialty but none of them know anything about what's been memorialized about that field in

360
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:29,520
other words there are set memorialized documented rules and how are they or to operate and none of them

361
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,400
know any of these rules are very few and operate along them at all the given example

362
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,880
like what's called law enforcement you know there is no law enforcement that knows any law they're

363
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:45,360
being directed by the attorney general's office to do things right now for example if you get pulled

364
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,360
over what's called pulled over with the flashing lights and they issue you a ticket or whatever

365
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,760
it doesn't matter if they're a sheriff a local police or highway patrol or whatever do you know that

366
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,440
in order for them to properly be able to do that they have to have what's called DOT certification

367
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,200
and they the actual ticket itself has to be signed by the director of the department transportation in

368
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,560
federal office and how many of them do you think have department transportation certification not

369
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:17,120
one and it doesn't matter because the the rest of society will say if you tell an acquaintance a friend

370
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,920
of family member what happens it well you shouldn't have been speeding well you shouldn't have done

371
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,480
that that's what happens here i'm like but it's not according to the rules but does it well let's

372
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,560
that's the society we live in this is how people react right so they're subject to the prank and

373
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,160
also there's a sense of voluntary like is him in it who has to be voluntary but most people don't

374
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,520
know what they're volunteering and like a prankster will say here would you like to sit and you say

375
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,240
yes and now he's placed a thumbtack on the seat you sit on it and you get you know damaged or injured

376
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,880
from it and you jump up and say why did you do that it says well you know you're the one who said yes

377
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,120
like you wanted to sit you know the pranking part well that was you know that's how i have fun

378
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:04,000
you see that's just how i roll that's how i roll and this is how your professors are this is how

379
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,840
your law enforcement is this is how your legal this is how your religious people are confront any

380
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:17,760
imam priest bishop guru regarding what they're doing and they're saying it doesn't matter as just

381
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:24,960
need to believe or leave me alone right they don't want to know anything so we're not saying this

382
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,520
because anything is going to change but we're saying it because this is the rationale behind the

383
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,600
irrational that's going on on this planet right now and what is going on on this planet ultimately

384
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:42,960
in a big sense is that folks time ended almost 18 years ago and you're in the credits part of the movie

385
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,560
right now what i mean by that is if you're going to shoot a two hour movie do you get just exactly two

386
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:53,520
hours of film or do you have to get two hours and ten minutes because you have to roll the credits

387
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:00,320
the credits started rolling around the fall of 1998 and what's in the reason i use that metaphor

388
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,760
is simply this the purpose of the credits is to give credits to the efforts and the people behind it

389
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,040
and also it's to show what you didn't see in the in the main feature and also the order of importance

390
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,520
sometimes is changed but you get to see all the things behind the scenes and the other interesting

391
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,560
thing about using this as a metaphor is you ever notice while the film is running if someone speaks

392
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,400
or stands up you're promptly told to be quiet or sit down but when the credits are rolling the film

393
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,880
is still technically rolling but people are talking people are moving around and there's disturbance

394
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,400
in the theater but it doesn't matter because it's the credits that's why since 1998 when you see all

395
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,800
these things happening it just doesn't matter people don't see it you see so we're talking about all

396
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,320
the corruption the child trafficking even spirit cooking all coming to the surface coming to the light

397
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,280
and who cares right it's the movie is over you know it's they're not going to tell you shut up

398
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:01,840
and sit down and and this is how it's just pretty much you know metaphors are simple and this is not

399
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,080
an oversimplified metaphor it's just another perspective on what is going on here's another

400
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:12,720
perspective on what's going on I like to use architecture as a metaphor meaning a thousand years ago

401
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,360
structures especially public structures were built to last a thousand years I remember growing up

402
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:23,120
at the bicentennial in the us around 1976 speaking to some people in Europe and saying 200

403
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:28,800
year bicentennial you kidding I'm living in a house that's a thousand years old right so a thousand

404
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,680
years ago public structures were built to last a thousand years a hundred years ago public structures

405
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,400
or most structures were last were built to last a hundred years look at the skyscrapers in New York

406
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,520
that were built around the turn of the century or a little after they're still very robust and structurally

407
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:51,120
sound now structures since 1998 structures are being built to last only 20 years go look at those

408
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:58,320
big towers that are built in Asia or in Dubai actually go research it a little bit what is the

409
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:05,680
life expectancy of these large towers 20 years and to put it a little more perspective on the subject

410
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,040
I was conveying down what's called a road one day and I saw what's called a housing subdivision

411
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,520
going up and I took a glance at it and I pointed to someone look the people are so far gone they're

412
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,400
putting they're building their houses out of compressed sawdust think about that for a moment you

413
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:26,080
know what I mean by compressed sawdust you ever see that particle board yeah it's all a facade folks

414
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:31,440
that's very sad it doesn't matter the reason why is why do you why should it be made it doesn't need

415
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:38,160
to be robust because this information is ingrained in everyone just like a plant knows when to come to

416
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,360
seed society is now coming to its point now it doesn't mean doom and gloom because anytime you

417
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,960
preach doom and gloom in human history you will always sound correct but the problem is whenever doom

418
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,560
and gloom is preached they cannot give you specifics what we're trying to do eventually

419
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:01,600
well least we meaning what the Greek is saying is give specifics and one of the specifics here

420
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:08,320
is that what everyone is experiencing right now is the precursor to the precursor of a middle

421
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:14,000
east union that is going to be forming it's a group of ten nations which only nine exist right now

422
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,400
in what's called the middle east area and when this union comes together it's going to be a very

423
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:29,200
loose union not like the European Union all of your government economics judicial recreational

424
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,400
entertainment education religion is going to be based out of there and then coming out of there

425
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,440
you see it's going to be the hub and it's going to be projected from there through the entire world

426
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,960
and if you want to keep it really simple before getting into more specifics or maybe not

427
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:51,600
you ever hear grandma say what goes around comes around you ever look at a racetrack where's the

428
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:58,240
starting line okay look at the starting line now where's the finishing line the same thing even in

429
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:04,000
the rubbish secular education system in academia they tell you that man society started where

430
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,920
messopotamian region well guess where man society is going to end based out of there as well

431
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,800
so it's very very very very simple and by the way this has also been prophesied in many of your ancient

432
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,000
texts but who wants to read the ancient text because those people are just ignorant you know it

433
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:29,520
doesn't matter why i don't believe in that you see so you know we're modern now and by the way if you

434
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,560
study any of the ancient writings do you know like ancient Babylon or ancient Greece or even parts

435
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,520
of Rome before they fell from their prominence in their writings they describe themselves as being

436
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:48,960
modern yes so so you know let's let's tie this back we kind of like got more of a narrow aspect here

437
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,680
but i believe in going deep in certain aspects but just covering broad things because you know

438
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,680
shallow thinking usually gets people diving off something deep so you've got to pin yourself

439
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,200
down into a thought that's what meditation is by the way meditation is like re chewing the

440
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:11,200
cut you have a thought and you you keep processing it just like you ever have a diamond

441
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,520
inspected or they just glance at it and put it back in the but in the sack or do they keep turning

442
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,520
it and look at every facet right and how the light goes through it from every direction

443
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,200
and when you hear about meditation by the way they really screwed up the western world on that

444
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,280
because when the body is active the mind is quiet and when the body is quiet the mind is active so

445
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,040
back i think many people that consider themselves contemplate over meditational are trying to keep

446
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:43,840
their body still and make their mind still that's how you go insane folks meditation happens when

447
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,760
the body is still the mind is fast you know if someone is running a marathon and you want to ask

448
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,080
them technical questions or shoot you to the side they'll say listen let me finish this run and

449
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,960
then we'll talk right because when the body is active the mind is quiet and when the body is quiet

450
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,160
the mind is active so if you're laying down in bed and you find your mind racing that's good you're

451
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,600
probably not used to it and you don't know how to take control of it but once you understand the

452
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:10,960
simple premise that i just shared with you folks you know you'll have fortune in understanding

453
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:19,840
what meditation is so that does help because yeah who can stop that you know he's supposed to stop

454
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:26,160
all the thinking or you know again that is a tradition instead of an actual practice the way that

455
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:34,000
we see things in the way that this is all going what crazy times okay so we're looking at

456
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:43,280
we're in the uncredits we've been the revealing everything going on behind the surface we find that

457
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:50,240
our elite are all bloodline tracking back to ancient lines we find that they are all trafficking

458
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:56,720
in children every single person that has come up in this last election has been accused of rape

459
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:07,120
and then we get a Middle East union where the laws and the you know the the traditions are quite

460
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:15,120
different America has been set up as this role of Satan as the evil overlords of the planet

461
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:22,880
thanks to things like the use of nine eleven truth and all this revelation of how we know try

462
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,280
try and pizza parties and hot dogs and things of that nature that are coming to the surface

463
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:36,160
what happens when as we start to boil into the second hour here we're going to lead into the the

464
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:44,880
process of enacting these stoning laws in in the west and and how this Middle East union will

465
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:51,200
affect us sure sure and now when you when we say stoning laws and you brought up nine eleven you know

466
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:57,200
I've got to say this and and many aspects perhaps people have no comprehension or don't want to

467
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:04,240
have comprehension about the one of the major traditions that goes on is from the secular point of

468
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:11,120
view is the preeminence or predominance of the Christian era all right if from a secular point of

469
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:18,080
view this is known as the Christian era right that's why your your years are numbered as such right

470
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:24,160
and it's all erroneous the the figure of the Christ for example in all that you will not what

471
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:29,600
shown by Christianity the crucifix and all that and the continents of the man with long hair wearing

472
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:35,360
a loincloth and such is not in the biblical text at all and when you say nine eleven

473
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:45,200
that is also a loose reference to when let's say the the birth of this biblical character took place

474
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:51,840
so in essence just to tie it back to what sparked this me to say this is when you said nine eleven

475
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:57,200
two things that are very important folks to consider about nine eleven one is all of the discussion

476
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:03,280
that is out there regarding it no one goes back and discusses the type of construction that was used

477
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,960
for those buildings and people don't know that that type of construction was around for decades before

478
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,280
or a decade before it was actually implemented in the reason these buildings were not implemented

479
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:19,200
because no one knew how to take them down and until the method was developed or procured then they

480
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:24,080
were built and it wasn't just the world trade center it's the UN building dighamershide plaza the

481
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:29,760
sears tower this is a specific type of construction now the reason i'm mentioning this is no one is

482
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:36,000
speaking about it the other thing that almost no one is speaking about is in the in the Christian era

483
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,480
you have something called christmas the birth of what's called the christ and no one discusses

484
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:46,160
the accuracy of the information that is available for that they all take for granted we don't know

485
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:52,160
when it was this is what how we celebrate it but what's interesting in the biblical text it gives you

486
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:57,920
an astronomical alignment when that happened very specifically and if you're going to do a cross

487
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,200
cultural cross-era communication of time you have to use astronomical alignments you can't use

488
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,800
ridiculous calendars right because they change you know so in the biblical text it's very clear a

489
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,440
virgin was giving birth with twelve stars at her head cloaked with the sun in the moon at her feet

490
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:20,800
that is very specific alignment and we know from secular records that during the time of let's say

491
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:27,840
the biblical record when the christ was born there was a census or head counting of the empire

492
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:33,680
by a gustus and also we know that herod had died about two and a half years after that time according

493
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,600
to secular records that puts you between two a.d. or eight b.c. so if you go look for this alignment

494
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,720
that i just mentioned the constellation vergo with the tail of draco at her head with the sun in the

495
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,600
middle and the moon at her feet that is in the late afternoon and if you go to an astronomical

496
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,640
observatory or computer that will show you that happened between two and eight b.c. and that

497
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:00,800
happened on three b.c. on the day of eleven on the month of september around six forty p.m.

498
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:07,280
so what when you say nine eleven that was what's called a birthday party right if you get the

499
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,560
meaning of that we'll talk about what cannibals birthdays and dolls have in common as a metaphor

500
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:16,720
to understand this society so i just wanted to throw that in there as well to give a little more

501
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:24,080
comprehension on what's going on yeah absolutely we are seeing the birth of a new world and folks it

502
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:30,560
is the year five thousand seven hundred and seventy seven in the hebrough calendar or yes the year

503
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:39,120
six thousand sixteen anolusius calendar or you know year two thousand sixteen and yeah well we

504
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:45,680
from memorialization it seems to be there's a new kid on the block known as atom and that was around

505
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:50,720
six thousand eighteen years ago so when you're referencing the biblical text you would probably

506
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:55,360
around be around there now what's interesting about the hebrough calendar by the way the reason it's

507
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:00,160
losing losing out a few hundred years is because they decided to eliminate the years when they didn't

508
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:06,080
have an unrighteous king so for example if you didn't like george bush junior you you reset eight

509
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:11,200
years like never happened right never happened and that's what the and i don't know is that lawful to do

510
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:17,600
that you see the answer would be no it's not lawful it's not a lawful timekeeping well for the pranksters

511
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:23,200
in the historical system it absolutely as they've kept us veiled this whole time hood winked as you

512
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:28,400
had said and now they've got us running in the streets screaming kill all the fanatics

513
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:35,760
yeah and the fanaticism is what you are being shown like for example back to nine eleven for a moment

514
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:41,360
when nine eleven happened and when in thirty seconds they said it was Muslim terrorists it was

515
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:46,320
loosely accepted because since the seventies eighties and nineties hollywood had done a very good job

516
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:53,840
in procuring Muslim terrorists in film right and also news and uh... and also the xenophobia of how

517
00:49:53,840 --> 00:50:00,080
look how different they are kind of thing it's always you know just like with asia in world war two

518
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:05,840
it's very easy to pin out an adversary because they look very different because you have the sports

519
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,240
mentality you know people are into sports you know it's about bunch of people in uniform chasing a ball

520
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,600
and the reason why they're so easy to follow sports is because they look the teams look

521
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,600
very different you don't need to be a genius to figure out what's going on right

522
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:26,240
so without a doubt and we saw that whole sports mentality come out that's exactly what runs these

523
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:32,480
politics and everybody's like my team has to win and and now we see the results of what happens

524
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:39,680
with poor losers uh and and in these in this very thought that you're having here i i made me consider

525
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:47,760
this idea of how many bloody murders would you personally witness without television or hollywood

526
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:55,680
sure uh very few uh but it's kind of difficult to say because without television or hollywood there

527
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:02,160
might be fewer distractions and people might be out actually committing more of them right all right

528
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:11,440
to Shay but so we can see how this has been melded into the system just lowly and subtly that this

529
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:19,040
has been going on forever and ever and and that's the thing is that they have they've spawned these

530
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:27,680
reactions when kathy ol brian who we will be having on the show folks very soon uh you know as

531
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:34,800
been talking about this for 25 years and it's only now because it's a mob rule situation that

532
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:42,800
they're going to react to this knowledge and what we hope the greek and i folks is that we give you

533
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:51,200
data so that the reactions will will you know be tempered by understanding and knowledge that this

534
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,760
is not new it's not time to react they're forcing you to react at this moment

535
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:02,880
sure and you know the reactionaryness of everything you know uh if you were growing up let's say in the

536
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:09,040
50 60 70s or even 80s when world leaders or captains of industry were speaking we're speaking you

537
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:13,520
notice how they spoke about multi-generational terms they wanted to do these big public works projects

538
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:18,320
and social changes you ever notice now how captains of industry and leaders of people only speak

539
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:23,280
from a reactionary point of view when event happens they're taken out of wherever just to make a

540
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:30,160
comment there there is no more discussion about uh you know multi-generation no or long term thinking

541
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:35,840
at all and that is another clue you need to look at folks to see uh how things are falling in place

542
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:41,200
but you have to remember if anyone is familiar with homeopathy uh right which is how little of a

543
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:47,200
substance you can give or the subtle energies it's the subtle energies that actually dictate the

544
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:53,040
things that come later it's the shape of the river uh not the water that dictates the flow you see

545
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:58,640
so what's happening now and it's been happening for a while is a lot of subtleties are being put in place

546
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:03,280
that are allowing people to accept what's happening and we'll probably get into a little bit more

547
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:09,440
on uh the current situation like you brought up you know the pitophilia the human sacrifice let's say

548
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,480
you brought up the murders and uh the stoning and all this how that people are being let's say

549
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,120
indoctrinated or being it's being they're being warmed up to these concepts because these things

550
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:25,280
are going to be very significant in the near future actually in the next decade let's say the secular

551
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:33,440
decade don't be pranked by the systems folks uh mob does not rule the subtleties of your very

552
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:39,280
character will make all the difference necessary don't run around screaming kill all the fanatics

553
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:47,680
because well that makes you a fanatic so what a wonderful understanding to to start to bring about

554
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:55,200
the knowledge necessary to to stand on a firm plane as the world just erupts into chaos around you

555
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:02,480
and know that you're not being pranked by this very same system if you guys prank yeah

556
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:08,880
I'm gonna ludicrous trick yes yeah it is ludicrous it is all ludicrous this whole thing that I'm

557
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:14,960
watching right now is ludicrous folks it's insane I mean uh I mean I wouldn't pick either one of

558
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:24,000
these people to you know take care of my dog uh much less be the ruler of my nation I the the things

559
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,160
that have come out that people just don't care is blowing my mind but I don't want them to really

560
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:36,400
get it all in one punch like they are this idea of child trafficking and MK ultra and all the true

561
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:43,040
things that are going on behind the scenes in the dark dark occulted world of politics and global

562
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:48,800
governance so I don't want you to be reacting to that I want you to be knowing that this information

563
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:56,560
has been here it's it's we've been talking about it and we can change things but homeopathically

564
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:05,200
with subtlety as we interact with one another I want to conclude this by saying you can find the Greek

565
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:15,360
very soon at uncommon radio dot com that is uncommon radio dot com and he he gives you his work in in

566
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:21,520
bits and bites and lets you take that in and I want to announce that next week we will be talking

567
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:28,560
with Fritz spring Meyer on the beast system because we got such a uh wave rave review from last week

568
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:34,000
show we had to we got to get deeper into this so Fritz spring Meyer next week on the beast system

569
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:45,040
and tonight I will be live 8 p.m. pacific that's 11 p.m. Eastern I hope on kb k a b c in loss angeles
