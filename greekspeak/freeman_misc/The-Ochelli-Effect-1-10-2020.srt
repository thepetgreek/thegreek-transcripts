1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
*music*

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,760
Get ready, get ready, go on!

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,600
We are sending a pass!

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,920
Well the big thing is the house, Chaco Jelly!

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,480
And it's been over many years of my PSK research,

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,920
And specializing in PSK and telling me things you didn't see in Bob's Law and the Multilapsa Foundation!

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,600
And Bob will get another global criminal operation in the 20th and 21st century!

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,640
US hazards, streets, courts, and tab!

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,600
Now I know the most decorated place in all of these!

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,880
*music*

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,680
December 10, 2020, allegedly, according to that thing we call a calendar,

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,680
and this indeed is the Ocele Effect!

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,680
So, we are originating from Ocele.com, but uh, you know,

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,040
what does that actually mean?

15
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,440
Who knows and who actually cares?

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,440
Meanwhile it is a friars day night,

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,800
according to that thing we call a calendar once again,

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,640
and we have a guest who is backed by popular demand!

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,920
Four people actually requested this guy out of nowhere,

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,760
I wasn't even talking about him,

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,080
and three of them were named Ed, I kid you not!

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,080
Anyway, the Greek I used to do a radio show with,

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,640
quite often, we called it Ocele in the Greek,

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,640
and uh, it was definitely something of interest for,

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,520
oh, what was it?

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,840
20 something episodes, and then we came back again!

27
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,800
I don't know, you know, we did this a few times,

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,640
anyway, uh, I had to invite him because you requested him,

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,640
you guys know that I will do that,

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,360
and you can request guests at info@ocele.com by email,

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,080
but other people reach me via Facebook and all those other things,

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,160
and who knows, sometimes I catch some messages,

33
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,880
sometimes I don't, this time I did.

34
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,240
So, the Greek is with me, uh, of course,

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,400
if you don't know who he is, settle in,

36
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,320
because uh, you're gonna get shook up, probably a little bit!

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,560
Just want you to know that!

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,520
And, phone lines are open at 319-527-5016,

39
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,760
now I am the only one controlling the board over there,

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,080
so be patient, you'll be put on hold,

41
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,560
and you'll be listening to the show, uh,

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,600
and when it's time for us to integrate another voice

43
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,680
into this sonic event,

44
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,120
we shall do so!

45
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,920
Once again, 319-527-5016,

46
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,640
now I spoke it clearly, slowly, and everything else,

47
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,600
nobody can complain!

48
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,840
Greek! How you doing?

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,480
Hey, everything good?

50
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,560
Uh, Ben, hey Ben, hey, move to Gratzi.

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,480
Hello everyone, it's been a while.

52
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,280
No, it definitely has been, uh, you know,

53
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,600
and I'm not even sure how long it's been.

54
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,440
I know it's been at least a year though, right?

55
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,960
Since you and I actually got together,

56
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,600
I think, last time we got together on

57
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,160
the stream that's being run,

58
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,560
or was being run, kind of just for when you wanted to do radio shows,

59
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,120
what was that called? The, uh, the uncommon radio stream, something?

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,320
Yeah, back in AFR, and then I did a lot of sonic,

61
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,040
we sort of did a, uh, a start-up,

62
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,960
one of these free radio things,

63
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,360
and it's basically just the, uh,

64
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,760
say my piece and then bow out.

65
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,680
I think, uh, you know, you've noticed that, uh,

66
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,880
you know, you tell people, you know, brace yourself in a way, you know,

67
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,000
uh, a lot of stuff we talk about is, uh,

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,800
common, you know, me commonly available or obvious,

69
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,480
but no one really sees.

70
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,720
So you just say it and walk away because, uh,

71
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,200
otherwise if people find out later and it pisses them off,

72
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,880
they'll say, "Wait a second, you knew about this,

73
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,120
and you didn't say anything, right?"

74
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,120
So you have to say something, right?

75
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,760
And then walk away because you evaluate the crowd.

76
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,840
But, you know, by the way, there's,

77
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,520
there's other people out there doing some stuff.

78
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,920
There's someone that did a Greekspeak.com.

79
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,400
He's, uh, uh, once in a while we get together,

80
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,200
there's like 10 episodes rehashing stuff,

81
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,760
and it's kind of a fancier website.

82
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,960
But, uh, I'm pretty much bowed out because, um,

83
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,680
you know, uh, you gotta look at your audience.

84
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,760
So, let's say you're a classical musician, classical cello player,

85
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,240
and everybody's, uh, have you metal headbanger?

86
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,960
The chances of you getting the talk to the crowd

87
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,560
and having any appeal to them is zero to none, right?

88
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,080
So, the thing is, uh, most of the information that I've always put out

89
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,520
is not opinion based.

90
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,600
It's basically all resource based, you know,

91
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,640
anything that I've said to anyone could look up usually.

92
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,040
And if you can't look it up, uh, I'll tell you,

93
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,840
it's not on the stupid rectangle, right?

94
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,520
You know what I mean by the stupid rectangle.

95
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,040
So, which has basically been set up, uh, you know,

96
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,360
people are talking about censorship a while back.

97
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,880
We know what the different private,

98
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,280
let me just stress you, too, is a private platform.

99
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,800
All these things are private.

100
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,640
All the social media, but there's no,

101
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,880
you have no freedom of speech there, right?

102
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,440
Uh, just like the courts are private.

103
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,760
So, make, make a long story short.

104
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,840
You know, the best form of censorship,

105
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,480
in other words, to drown out a particular voice

106
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,000
is to give everybody a voice.

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,160
Right?

108
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,040
Well, that way they drown in the noise, uh,

109
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,040
which is interesting because, you know,

110
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,880
some of the things that you and I talked about

111
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,280
on our shows that ended up on YouTube,

112
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,440
funny thing, I mean, I had my whole channel pulled,

113
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,840
I had to go through a battle with them to get it back.

114
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,120
I mean, it was this whole thing.

115
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,720
Um, you know, I never got in trouble for any of the stuff

116
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,760
that you and I discussed.

117
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,880
You know, politics or something that was alleged to be hate speech,

118
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,360
which was not hate speech, it was just, you know,

119
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,760
reciting facts, I'm sorry.

120
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,840
You know, uh, well, it's because it's where it's coming from.

121
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,800
It's very different.

122
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Yeah, I mean, there's no malice behind it.

123
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,640
It's just stating what humanity should be understanding

124
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,200
and looking at before they act, you know, you know what I mean?

125
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Well, I got to tell you that speaking of humanity and acting and,

126
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,960
you know, me observing these things as you well know,

127
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,440
I do take the time to observe the world around me

128
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,800
and I try and report on it.

129
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,840
But also, I do a lot of deep research.

130
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,440
I mean, last night we had brought new information

131
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,760
into the, uh, the JFK research arena

132
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,440
that has not been out there previously.

133
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,680
You know, and stuff like that,

134
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,200
I'm constantly trying to search for new and different information.

135
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,640
And, and I got to tell you, it's weird

136
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,040
because I saw this whole thing going on with Iran.

137
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,560
And frankly, I had already wanted to have Yon before this,

138
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,240
but when I was observing that circumstance

139
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,720
and thinking about the possibilities,

140
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,000
and quite frankly, I miscalculated what I thought

141
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,760
the American leadership was going to do in the very near future.

142
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,560
Now, we'll see if it pans out over the long term, what I think.

143
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,240
But, um, when I saw all that, you know what I thought of?

144
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,640
Was the discussions with you about a Syria?

145
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,360
Now, somebody will say, well, why would you do that?

146
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,000
Well, Iran is right there.

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,560
Great.

148
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,560
Uh, so, could you try and give people a, uh, a clue

149
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,800
about what I'm referencing number one?

150
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,200
Number two, Kristi Aphrodite was in the chat room.

151
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,560
I just noticed and said that she bets you, you,

152
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,720
you miss calling into her show to complain.

153
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,080
I don't know what that means.

154
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,760
'Cause I wasn't aware you were on Kristi Aphrodite's show.

155
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,520
But I might have called in and she was back in the AFR day,

156
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,440
uh, days perhaps, hello, Kristi.

157
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:15,680
Right.

158
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,720
Right.

159
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,120
No, I remember she was there, but, you know,

160
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,560
I didn't remember that you were on there.

161
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,200
I remember you with, uh, Vinnie Eastwood a little bit,

162
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,520
um, you know, and then, uh, you and I had a conversation,

163
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,760
and that led Danny over there to actually say,

164
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,680
you guys got to do a regular show together,

165
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,480
and that's how the Oceleon, the Greek thing was born.

166
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,320
But either way, um,

167
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,000
I, I, well, actually, without just real quick Vinnie went on vacation,

168
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,800
Danny asked me to,

169
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,040
then a couple of weeks later I said,

170
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:49,440
uh, let me, let me go see who, who, what asshole's taking his place now

171
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,040
for three weeks, you know, and then you're there.

172
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,440
I said, "Well, this guy's got a pretty decent voice."

173
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,000
And, uh, he, you know, in other words,

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,480
you know, when you turn on the radio, it doesn't sound like noise,

175
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,320
and I said, "Okay, let, you know,"

176
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,120
and I got in touch with saying, "Hey, I was supposed to be doing what you're doing."

177
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,720
And by the way, if you need, if you want to hear something, you probably haven't heard before.

178
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,120
And that's how I think the, the, that, that was the germination.

179
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,640
The, uh, enablement was definitely Danny and everyone else, you know,

180
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,400
that said, "Yeah, keep this thing going, right?"

181
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,120
So, yeah, they bonded more of it when we had the conversation.

182
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,320
So, no, I, I thought it was, it was actually, uh,

183
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,960
an interesting time period there where I was doing double duty.

184
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,160
I'd finished my show and then do the show with you afterwards.

185
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,720
Some nights I was tired, Greek.

186
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,760
I got to be honest with you.

187
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:40,640
But, uh, but then again, you know, it was an interesting transition to go from whatever it was I was doing that particular day

188
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,600
to, uh, to really going into some very interesting subjects that probably sound really, uh,

189
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,680
inane to a lot of people like water.

190
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,760
And, you know,

191
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,520
Yeah, right, like what's water, right?

192
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:51,920
Yeah.

193
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,800
Like we're talking about water, not like the politics of water either,

194
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,320
but just like talking about water.

195
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,720
Uh, yeah, they, because people don't absolutely nothing about it other than what they've been told,

196
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
even though it's right in front of them, and they're made of it.

197
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,360
Yeah, exactly.

198
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,720
That's basically the same.

199
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,560
That's the root and the moral of the story of everything we've discussed.

200
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,600
What's right in front of you that you know nothing about?

201
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,360
Exactly.

202
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,040
And you, and you use as well.

203
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,440
But anyway, let's, you, let's just dive in a little bit because, you know, we could go, uh,

204
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,520
really long and deep.

205
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,480
So let's maybe get a few things out of the way if you've ever listened to the stuff we talked about.

206
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,760
It wasn't just a theory.

207
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,960
I'm glad that stuck, you know, stuck in there as you said it,

208
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,400
but that wasn't the, the whole crux of discussing Assyria.

209
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,600
The, the, the, the reason for discussing Assyria,

210
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:45,600
A, SS, Y, R, I, A, not Syria, us, Syria, was because that was something to look for as being,

211
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,440
a precursor to what?

212
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:54,160
When you see a new country being formed in northern Iraq, which is going to take part of Syria,

213
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,120
and part of Turkey, and I kept saying there's going to be conflict with Turkey and Syria and Iraq,

214
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,560
and all that before it started.

215
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,760
I don't know if you remember that.

216
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,080
And, um, because the ancient Assyria,

217
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:12,080
geographic borders, let's say, are political borders within those countries.

218
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,240
The reason of bringing up Assyria in such a manner in repetitive fashion is

219
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,120
that is the precursor to the Middle East Union.

220
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,080
Now, it's not a union as people describe unions of countries today.

221
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,640
For example, the EU is going to be a loose Confederacy,

222
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,680
but it will, it will not be mistaken that the power base, the power brokers,

223
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,400
and all the influential matters of human society will be coming out of there.

224
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,720
That's what I mean by union, right?

225
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,240
So, you have to be that's why.

226
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,480
Yeah, so, one second though, that's why it came up in my mind though, Greek, because

227
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,640
the geopolitical ramifications of a conflict with Iran,

228
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,240
while the US is involved in a conflict with Afghanistan,

229
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,840
while the US is engaged in Iraq, whatever they're calling it,

230
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,480
the US is still present and engaged in Iraq, right?

231
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,200
So, while we're looking at that and the consequences of the moves in Assyria

232
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,800
that affect these people that we call the Kurds,

233
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,120
there's no Kurdistan, but we call them Kurds.

234
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,920
There are all-

235
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,560
Actually, there is a Kurdistan, it's broken up,

236
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,280
and there may be 50 different little loose provinces,

237
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,200
but go ahead, just like you have China towns,

238
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,760
and little Japan's and little Italy's like that.

239
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,720
But it's not like recognized as a nation, there's not a Kurdistan on the map right now.

240
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,280
Right, and the Kurdish people are what?

241
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,400
They're the meads, and the Iranians are who?

242
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,360
The Persians?

243
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,120
Oh, I understand that, but see when-

244
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
So, they're very some good.

245
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,640
Yeah, no, that's the thing, so I was considering all of this,

246
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,640
and somebody stated based on my attitude, because I am not for war in any way, shape or form,

247
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,200
I said, you know, really, it would be great to see the United States and many of these other

248
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,200
interloper countries pull themselves out of the Middle East,

249
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,040
and a lot of people said, well, you know, if that happens,

250
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,320
then there would be great deal of conflict, and I said, yeah, I don't think it would last very long,

251
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,160
because without all of this outside agitation,

252
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,360
I think what would happen is, wait a minute,

253
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,880
what the Greek was talking about regarding a Syria where you would end up with

254
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,320
loose confederation, listen, it's much more beneficial for us to work together,

255
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,840
than it is for us to work against one another.

256
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,760
We no longer have to compete for the Western influence, so on and so forth, so I said to myself,

257
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,760
actually what I'm thinking would be geopolitically beneficial

258
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,200
across a map is exactly the kind of thinking that if somebody comes to it in power at some point,

259
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,760
would lead in a very short period of time, yes, there would be conflict,

260
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,920
there would be issues to begin with, but I think very quickly that would be settled,

261
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,600
pragmatically, and you would be looking at something that I don't know if it would take on the name

262
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,920
of a Syria, but it would certainly resemble exactly what you were talking about if someone were to take up

263
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,840
my particular frame of mind regarding this, so that's why it came up, you understand?

264
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,880
Okay, it wasn't as simple as it was.

265
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,160
Well, that's just, you know, basically.

266
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,920
I wanted that you just said something that's important, which is frame of mind.

267
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,720
When every time you said the U.S., I wanted to interrupt and say, there was no such thing as the U.S.,

268
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,720
but there is such a thing as the Assyrians and the Iranians and the Italians and the

269
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,320
and the English and the Greeks and the Israelis, but there's no such thing as the U.S.,

270
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,440
now the Greek you're speaking in riddles or your absurd or you've gone mad, what are you talking about?

271
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,840
There's no such thing as the U.S., let me tell you.

272
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:39,040
The vein, like when you're mining, you're looking for a vein of gold or precious metal is better

273
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,280
than it being scattered around and sifting it, right? So you could chip at it.

274
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,000
The information attaches to these national veins, these national bloodlines.

275
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,600
The information that I'm getting regarding the future, right?

276
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,200
When you have something like what's called the United States, someone says I'm an American

277
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,000
and he's really dark-skinned and he's wearing a turban and he's speaking with a Bengali's accent,

278
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,160
but he's an American, right? Then I got another guy that has to have pasta fuzzul on New Year's Day,

279
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:14,720
right? And he said, what do you mean? What are you talking about? I'm an American, right?

280
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,880
Another guy, you see, he's out of the Szechuan province, right? He has a restaurant,

281
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,760
bring your own cat and you get a free egg roll. He's an American. Do you get my point?

282
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,360
Yes, I get my point. What's an American? What's an American? There is no such thing. They're all dead.

283
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:39,280
I mean, the indigenous people here that were supplanted before known history were genocide it off,

284
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,760
for the Native Americans. So this is my point. I'm not giving them, I'm not breaking your balls.

285
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:51,120
What I'm trying to tell you is the information of regarding the thing has to correlate,

286
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,800
in other words, if it seems like it's in code, the code has to be broken and the details of that code

287
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,640
have to always be applied to the information otherwise it falls apart. Right?

288
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:06,880
Well, obviously when I'm referencing the U.S., I'm referencing a very real construct, which is the U.S.

289
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,480
military, okay? Right. Which is, which is about what? 60% black in Mexican?

290
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:19,200
Oh, yeah, absolutely, but I'm saying 75%. So that's then you could, in history, this is important because

291
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:25,600
in the future history will not see that army, it will say it is a lot, it was a Mexican and black army.

292
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:32,320
Okay, give you an example. When you read about the Roman conquests in the Middle East, like 2000 years ago,

293
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,960
those were not people from Napoli. Those were people like when they came down through Syria

294
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,680
and other places. Those were Syrians that put on Roman uniforms and run to Rome and hire, but

295
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,080
are they the Roman army? Yeah, they are. Oh, yeah, they are. So the interesting aspect is this old

296
00:15:52,080 --> 00:16:01,040
information that will be repeated in the man's final society, when you see, for example, a country,

297
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,440
like what's called a country like the U.S., that is an ideology. It is an agglomerate. It represents

298
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:14,160
actually the West. Let me just help you put this in more perspective. What most Americans say,

299
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,680
well, we're Christian, we're American, we're whatever, and they're Islamic. They're Muslims, right?

300
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:27,920
What people fail to realize is there is no Islam per se as it's supposed to be according to the

301
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:34,400
Quran and according to even older traditions. What you they call modern day Islam, except for the

302
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:42,640
post dunes in Afghanistan, and a couple of tiny little pockets here and there is formed in the 19th

303
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,640
century by several influences. One of the main ones is what's called the Anglo-Mahamid in Treaty.

304
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:55,040
That you see. So modern day, and I play with this all the time, when I see someone who I know is

305
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,760
Muslim, I'll go to them and I'll put up, I'll have fun with them and you know, they see this guy,

306
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,120
you know, and I say, "Hey, you're Muslim, right? Yeah, okay. Were you alive when your grandfather,

307
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:12,000
your great grandfather was alive?" And he says, "Yeah, I remember. I say, he was not really Muslim. He was

308
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,040
like you are today. He lived his life according to Taurat." And he says, "Yeah, that's right."

309
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,960
Well, Taurat is Arabic for Torah, which is the biblical mosaic law.

310
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,240
Think about that for a moment. And modern day Islam, that's completely been done, right? Because the

311
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,520
Quran doesn't have any law in it. It tells you if you want law, you go do what Moses said. So, so my,

312
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,280
it's just like, for example, when you talk about Christianity, yeah, they say it's pagan. By the way,

313
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:45,600
if you call Christianity pagan, that's an insult to the pagans, by the way. Pagans are far more evolved

314
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,600
spiritually than Christians are, but my point is, you know, because a lot of times you say

315
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,080
Christians pagan has to put down, if it was pagan, it'd be a hundred times better at least, you know? But

316
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:03,280
here's my point. The chief God in Christianity is the Easter Bunny in Santa Claus. Don't say no,

317
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,320
because yes, that's what I see. Thank you, by the way, Greek, because I identify as a pagan myself.

318
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,200
Okay, well, at least you have a conversation with a pagan because they know that there's more than

319
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,600
one deity. They know that you can influence these deities. They know you can do barter with these

320
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,920
deities. They know that there's no difference between science and religion, right? Yes. I mean,

321
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,000
all these things, right? There's the same, right? You manipulation of your environment,

322
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,320
right? Christians are like, you know, they have to, so I'm not harping on the Christians because,

323
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,840
you know, all the religions are fallen apart because they're part of the political system. They're

324
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,240
all basically set up by the intelligence agencies and intelligence agencies have existed for thousands

325
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,000
of years. You've already read the Jesuits, right? So, so my thing here, in order to decode the

326
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,360
information, you don't have any liberty to free, free form the application of the information.

327
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,080
Very often, like, you know, there's a typical saying, like, you have enough information to be

328
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,880
dangerous, but not enough to do the right thing kind of thing. You can't do that. You're, you're not

329
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,760
allowed to do that. So when you look at a body of knowledge and it doesn't quite seem

330
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,840
contemporaneous to the thinking today, in other words, it is written in the language and in the ideology

331
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,880
and the thought forms that people had at a different time, you can't take whatever information you want

332
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,400
and apply it to your modern ideology. You must maintain the ideology of that's held within the text,

333
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:35,840
otherwise it falls apart, right? So you with me? No, no, absolutely. So from there, from that point of

334
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,960
you, there is no such thing as an American bloodline or a United States bloodline. There is no such thing.

335
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,720
That's true. And to even put that even drive it even more home, you know, you hear a lot of these

336
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,200
patriots more on say, Oh, our founding fathers really, if they were so good, how many founding fathers

337
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,840
is more than a handful, Madison, Hancock, Washington, Jefferson, if they were so good, where are their

338
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,680
descendants? How come their descendants are in celebrated, because they did have children? Right.

339
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,080
Where are their descendants now? Huh? Oh, good question.

340
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,720
How come on Presidents day, great, great, great, great, great, grandchild of Washington, all these other people

341
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:22,480
don't come out and say, Hey, let's celebrate these people, this family line or Jefferson's on TV.

342
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,960
But anyway, yeah, well, anyway, Kennedy, you know, Kennedy was the only one, right?

343
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,160
It's weird because his cousins, his second grandchildren, whatever, whatever, they're all spread

344
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,720
out through politics and positions of power. It's very interesting to see what happened there.

345
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,760
And now the modern people in power, what you call politicians, kings, prime ministers, those are

346
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,080
just people that are actors that are going to go along with what's called the sovereign state,

347
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,000
which is neither sovereign, neither a state. It's a private corporation. Well, yes, but

348
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
a hundred years later, you don't see the descendants of the founding fathers really continuing on.

349
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,880
I mean, there was John Quincy Adams, but I mean, outside of that, you don't see successors

350
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:07,600
to presidents and things like that actually showing up again, outside of what? The bushes, you know,

351
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,160
the atoms, like I said, it's very rare. Go ahead. In the modern age, which is when I say

352
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:17,280
modern means past 1950 and 50 and then went to space age, right? And then now it's just the fucked

353
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,640
up age. But anyway, by the way, I want to correct you on one thing. When you talk about the Italian people,

354
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,040
there's a problem there too, because there really isn't a actual Italian people.

355
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:34,160
Yeah, well, you could say the Romans to a certain point and then you're going to have to say a trust

356
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:40,000
ginseng. Well, then you'll have to include the kingdom of Sardinia and Sicily, which Sicily was a

357
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,840
separate kingdom. Of course. Yeah. And if you go to Sicily, it's all the stuff is written in Greek. So

358
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,520
what do you know? Well, it's just like, you know, the Alexander the Great was Greek. No,

359
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,640
really, it's Macedonian. Correct. And Macedonians is very discreetly different. As a matter of

360
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,920
fact, they just resolved the 20 year quarrel with Macedonian Greece regarding language and flags and

361
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,760
all that stuff. So or trying to resolve, I should say. Yeah. No, I'm just saying. So that's an interesting

362
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,920
point. Yeah. So it goes back to familial bloodlines and yes, a family could turn into a nation. Yes,

363
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,240
it can, by the way. Well, that's why city states were battling with one another. And like I said,

364
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,200
if it wasn't for Mussolini and many of the people that were working with him at the turn of the 20th

365
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,920
century, there would be no Italy. So that was, I mean, I'm just, you know, speaking practically, the

366
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,360
Italy. Yeah, but there is a Roman, there is like if you if you, if you, here's one thing, if you lumped

367
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,800
in the Portuguese, the Greeks and the Italian that to one bloodline, you'd be 99% accurate, you know,

368
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,360
that. Yeah. No, I'm aware of that. That's the truth of it. But that's not the way it looks on the

369
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:49,360
map, like I said. Right. Right. So back to the Americans, when you, when you look at the, you know,

370
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,040
what the US is doing, for example, you know, the US is a corporation. I went, I've gone through this

371
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,440
many, many times and you could look all this up. For example, give me a quick brief from down because

372
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,400
this is very important because this is exactly what's going on in every UN country in the world.

373
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,080
The Revolutionary War allegedly happened by a bunch of lawyers you call the founding fathers.

374
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,320
The British king and the reason why they did that is because King George passed the bunch of

375
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,280
laws saying you got to leave the indigenous people alone, their heritage, their land and their

376
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,320
culture. And that means no expansion, right? You can't touch them. And the attorney said, no, we're

377
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,520
going to go after them. They did. Then the European says, okay, we got a revolution in France,

378
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,560
this, that, and the other we got Napoleon coming. We're going to make the Americans pay.

379
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:39,840
They settle in for a little while and they come up to Lincoln in secret. Yes, there are secret

380
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,120
meetings, people all the time. And they say, look, you're the central government, all the other

381
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,200
central governments in the world have access and power and money over their people. You don't.

382
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:55,360
So we'll help you. You just sit back, follow our lead. We'll start creating some sabotage and

383
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,720
propaganda. We'll make a war, get rid of the people that want to keep the country together,

384
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,560
and you'll have more power than imagine. And they also destroyed Lincoln in the process.

385
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,520
Which by the way, let's go back to the founding fathers with the US Constitution. That was a

386
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,120
seditious document, sedition against what's called the Articles of Confederation completely

387
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,880
ignores them from 1774, which there were five presidents before George Washington,

388
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,200
which by the way, George Washington is very likely killed in the battle of Brooklyn.

389
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,160
And they didn't want to report that. This is early on because morality would fall. So they found

390
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,800
a guy that was almost his doppelganger, except he didn't have any teeth in his mouth. That's why

391
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,800
after the battle of Brooklyn or whatever, this big scramble to put teeth in George Washington's

392
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:46,800
mouth, which is still famous today, right? But anyway, let's go back to the Civil War. So Lincoln

393
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,720
they take out Lincoln, they impeach Johnson after Lincoln. And then just like you know, you got

394
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,680
Homeland Security that came in right after 9/11 out of nowhere, this 150,000 armed force that

395
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,440
took over the airports and it's just like how the hell did that happen? Where did it come from, right?

396
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:10,480
Well, right after the Civil War, 1871 or so, they put in the Libra Code and guess what they formed,

397
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,800
just like Homeland Security after 9/11, guess what they formed right after the Civil War. Nobody's

398
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,600
talking about this. You could look this up as a matter of fact, the academics call it an anomaly

399
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,880
in history like no one knows, no academic knows where the hell is thing came from. You know what

400
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,960
that thing is? The DOJ Department of Justice and they strong armed grant and they said, you better

401
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,040
sign an executive order that we're going to represent your legal affairs and all of a sudden they

402
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,320
grew into a monster which formalized the intelligence agencies that you know as the FBI,

403
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,840
Secret Service and all that and none of that came through any kind of an organic movement that a

404
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:53,440
nation would. It was all imposed. Now in 1871 with the DOJ they also have what's called the United

405
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,280
States Corporation Act and they turned into a corporation not to turn into a corporation for corporate

406
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:06,560
sake but so they can bankrupt it later on which FDR did in 1933 and got rid of lawful money and

407
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:11,680
made all the put a lien basically allowed the private bankers to put a lien on everything in the

408
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:19,840
country including you. Okay this process if you condensed that that took about 150 years, condensed

409
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,760
that down to less than 20 years they did that in the Middle East at the turn of the century.

410
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:30,400
The whole thing the whole thing that I mentioned right? Okay and they also influenced their religion.

411
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:37,120
They recreated what's what's called Islam. Okay so this is the mindset that you have to carry through

412
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:45,920
when I say there's going to be a Middle East Union. Right. It's not countries, it's not yeah. No no I

413
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:50,400
understand. A loose confederation as opposed to and that's the interesting thing when you study the

414
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,760
articles of confederation you wouldn't have a lot of the headaches that we have today had they

415
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:04,800
remained valid let's say as usable as usable construct for what we call America now.

416
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:10,720
You know and I just passed you a chat room question I'm sorry if that distracted you. Oh no that's

417
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,040
fine but I figured I'll pass you the text while we're sitting here you can deal with it whenever you

418
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:21,360
like but I thought it was an interesting question so I gave it to you. You know it's just it's rather

419
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:29,120
fascinating to go through all this because I keep looking for the precise act and the record

420
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,080
does not reveal where the corporation was formed you know what I mean that's not.

421
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,400
You all this religious that's like the question I could read it real quick why is that there's

422
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,480
no country that the age of majority provide their citizens or subjects with a document to legally

423
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,200
be in agreement with their respective constitution and quotes by becoming a co-signer to the

424
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,080
compact I know no nation that does this unless a national idea or SSN is considered to be such an

425
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,400
agreement. Well the social security number is private government agencies don't use it so if

426
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,160
you're ever asked for a social security number that's not government that's an agency.

427
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:05,680
FDR told you under the administrative procedures act the government shut down but don't worry

428
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:11,040
we'll be running everything through agency right. So well the reason why they don't do that well

429
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:16,320
the Constitution is a vicious document and I'm not anti-constitution for I'm just stating

430
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,080
what it is if you want to be pro-antiate that means you have to act on some kind of ideology that you

431
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,600
comprehend out of it and I want none of it just you know now the the reason why they don't have

432
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:34,080
you do anything is they don't have to because you're talking about the the key word they're a subject

433
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:44,320
it's a fiefdom feudalism. But part of that process I think begins a birth where

434
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:52,480
you're reported to be born you're reported to the agencies by your parents that's what when

435
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,600
they fill out your birth certificate that's what they do that's when you get a number right that's

436
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,880
when the agent is in the lead into the history of policing the reason why they do that is because

437
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,280
the agreement that the government has with the the private financing cartel is that they have a

438
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:12,320
presumed lien on everything in the country the squirrels the cats the dogs the land the water the

439
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,480
people the people's labor all the ideas the patents houses everything has a presumed lien on it

440
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,960
and see that's where policing comes from when you look at all the problems with the police and

441
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,880
you know people don't know why well the police in in this country started in Boston and in

442
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:34,800
New York when the bankers had notes on pretty much about half the town including the government

443
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:40,000
buildings they went to the government said look we we got everybody everybody at half the people

444
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,040
here oh yes so we need our own police force to protect our stuff because if there's destruction

445
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:52,240
or damage to property how they're not going to want to pay the note on it right so we have to

446
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,280
protect our property and manage the piece so they brought in what's called police right so that's

447
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:02,000
the history of the police has nothing to do with the reason the police keep law in order is so you

448
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,880
don't damage the property that you owe the bank which is pretty much half the town they're the

449
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,080
policy enforcers which is why it sounds like police yeah well you could say that but you have to

450
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,280
understand again the history of it you know so and move forward but but again let's we've gotten

451
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:23,360
off topic because here's the thing the ideology is very important you know like what how people think

452
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,160
there's frame of reference what you know when you say something where does their mind go like for

453
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,640
example you and I brought this up many times and managed to skirt around what the word using the

454
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,680
word unless you use it properly the word nice when you say nice and most people's ideology you

455
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:44,800
mean something pleasant likeable or good but we know when I say we whoever we is that it doesn't

456
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:51,280
mean that at all so when we discuss things about the possibility of war what's going on the middle

457
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:56,480
east what's the US doing where you know politically let's you know let's maybe not be so political or

458
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:03,120
maybe let's talk about this that none of that means anything unless it's custom tailored to fit into

459
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:11,520
the ideology of the listener right so with that said let's just very often let's use the ideology

460
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,960
that we are aware of like you and I might have a conversation with some other people and we might

461
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,000
stream along in the conversation and we're using accurate you know terms accurately and we're

462
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,400
very careful to convey a thought through accuracy most people listening are not have not been that's

463
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:37,360
beyond their ability because they've decided it what things are versus what things are okay

464
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:46,640
you see so so from that point of view from like if we were to go on air this on Fox News we basically

465
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:55,360
have to say the two this is an easy way to distill it down each region has a concept of superpowers

466
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:03,040
right so some people will say well the Soviet Union or Russia in the US are the two great superpowers

467
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:09,440
and maybe it's just the US now okay well in the Middle East proper which in military and government

468
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:17,040
circles they reference it as southwest Asia okay they don't use the term Middle East that's a proxy

469
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:25,840
term for the media okay so the two superpowers there in that southwest Asian region are Israel and Iran

470
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:35,200
okay so if anything is going to mallow out or turn over meaning become violent it has to be between

471
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:42,640
the be either the support or the antithesis you know non-support of those two powers now we know

472
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:49,840
obviously that those two powers are both manipulated and manipulative in other words you hear about

473
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,800
the quote unquote Israeli lobby influencing the US and like half the people in important political

474
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:03,360
positions are dual citizenship with Israel okay now where is the Iranian influence in the US well

475
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,360
maybe not so much overtly and if we're on Fox News I can't say but since we're not I'll tell you

476
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:14,560
it's with the underworld where what do I mean by that if you go to Tokyo right now the underworld

477
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:23,040
there is well you have the the the Yakuza or the Japanese underworld but the Yakuza can't do anything

478
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:29,440
without who the Israeli underworld and the Persian or the Iranian underworld anything and everything

479
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:37,760
that goes through Tokyo goes through Israeli and Iranian hands as well as the Yakuza well that that's

480
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,800
actually why is that the well I'll tell you why it's important right away that's actually how the

481
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:48,800
Israeli underworld was built that's how what you know people commonly refer to as the Jewish mafia is

482
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:56,080
actually a reality they wouldn't even exist without the well the Jewish mafia set up the FBI well

483
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:02,000
okay I mean that's okay I don't sounds kind of crazy but I just put that out there to let you know

484
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,800
it's no small thing well it does because Jay Agruhubar I mean really did a lot of work there turning the

485
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:12,000
Bureau of Investigations into the Federal Bureau of Investigations so I mean I'm just saying there

486
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,640
was there was a lot going on there but in underworld terms though you know just like the the Italians

487
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:27,280
don't function without certain go-between certain conduits guess what the the Yakuza has no reach

488
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:34,400
outside of its region without what people call the Middle East and that's why they that's why they

489
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:41,440
they they feather their nest so well together exactly and the thing is I understand this and the

490
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,360
reason why I use the word Middle East by the way is because that's the most relatable term if

491
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:50,160
you start talking about Asia nobody thinks you're talking about the Middle East region at all yeah

492
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:55,040
but when Japan is just the top top right corner oh I know it but that's the thing you say

493
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,960
and all the actions on the bottom left so people don't you know they'll have that but but here's

494
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:08,240
the here's the continuation of this with Israel and in Persia being the two superpowers they also

495
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,880
have the what's called a super history for example all of the what they call accepted religions

496
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,400
Judaism Islam and Christianity are based on the same book essentially what you might say the

497
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,360
Quran also but the Quran has 20 references to reading the bible and doing what the bible says

498
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,320
the Old Testament right most people are not aware of that but go look it up you'll see

499
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:38,480
and that's the all based out of Abraham or Israel right well on the other hand right

500
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:46,400
Persia most of your sciences that are attributed to Arab culture like mathematics certain types

501
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,520
of medical things are didn't really come out of the Arab culture per se they came out of the Persian

502
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,960
or Farsi or Iranian culture you see now yeah they had spread prior to Alexander the great they

503
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:05,040
had spread their culture throughout the known world and when I say culture I mean that in its

504
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:12,480
true a sense meaning music art as in sculpture and painting poetry various forms of esoteric

505
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,160
education and religion well this is why I thought that even ended up on the continent of Africa

506
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,040
and why some people in Africa speaks for a farce which is you know not well advertised but it does

507
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:30,560
happen right they are the farce people and in the the empire that ruled that part of the world

508
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,200
which the Romans only could go to the Jordan River they could not go more east than that they

509
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:41,760
they you right everyone talks about the Roman Empire well it was not there there was another empire

510
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:52,640
there that that ruled and it was not centered in Iran and anyway the ancient the concept of ancient

511
00:36:52,640 --> 00:37:00,640
empire and Persia go hand in hand and they have been let's say on the sideline business and they're

512
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,320
not Arabic by the way they're not Arabs right they're just like Afghans are not Arabs they are

513
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:14,400
Farsi of the they're a different line completely and when you compare their influence in history

514
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,200
with Israel's influence in history especially in the religious circles they're pretty much equal

515
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,520
you know in terms of what they've affected like for example first century up until the fourth century

516
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:36,320
the formal religion of Rome over the Romans was mythreism right and so they just switch the name

517
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:43,360
to Christianity later on or whatever but it's still the same so you know when they tell you about

518
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:50,960
Christian catacombs underground those are mythreiums well you know whatever so you're looking at

519
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:58,320
these two very deep culturally based power based cultures let's say that everything comes out of

520
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,720
what it's military political scientific artistic or whatever it comes out of those two countries so

521
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:13,840
basically you watch those two countries so you the the effort to to let's talk about what's going

522
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:22,080
on because of Iran in the US is notable but you also have to see I would say if the current events

523
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:29,280
involved Israel and the US or Israel and Iran directly it would be something to watch otherwise

524
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,600
it's not it's this is a precursor to the precursor and that's pretty much the whole thing

525
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,640
why we said a lot without saying much really but no I understand that but I mean it's just that when

526
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,360
I thought about the logical conclusion that somebody would have to come to eventually is that

527
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:52,000
it would be untenable to continue this program of intervention and interference from what we do

528
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,880
refer to as the US army and if that you know pin was pulled out of that particular grenade to use

529
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,960
a euphemism here I believe that many other countries would also maneuver themselves out of the

530
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:13,120
theater and you would find a region that would as I said before pragmatically begin to cooperate

531
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:18,240
and would lead directly to that loose confederation of states that we were talking about earlier

532
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,240
not necessarily states you know well you know here's the secret with the US military

533
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
and then most people are not going to like this but it has to be said because it's so freaking obvious

534
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,520
the US military is the worst army in the history of the world to confront another army

535
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,880
the majority of confrontations that the US military has is with the civilian population

536
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,880
they always avoid the military of that country and if you don't believe that and you don't know

537
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,920
it well you better look into it because throughout history they were known as terrorists

538
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,840
not in other words when you have an army in the US as we're going to war with you expect them to

539
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:59,120
attack your army but what do they do they go around the back and they kill all the women and

540
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:09,520
children right so the way you assess if the US has a military threat against a country the way

541
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:16,560
you assess the outcome of that accurately with an accuracy of 99% by the way is how well is that

542
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:23,520
a country that the US is opposing protecting their civilian population in other words if they have

543
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:30,080
sams you know surface-to-air missiles and police armed with M50 machine guns in the in the public

544
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:36,560
parks and on top of apartment buildings all that the US is not going to attack you see like if you

545
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,760
look at what they did to Iraq Iraq was not set up to protect the civilian population they basically

546
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,680
had a couple of army bases and they protected their airport to a minimal degree and that's it

547
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,800
Iran is set up to protect itself Japan is set up to protect itself that way many countries are

548
00:40:52,800 --> 00:41:00,560
set up so there's no way the US can attack Iran on a full scale and succeed right as you see

549
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,960
in other things done in through history yeah that's why the ugly truth about Iraq is that uh you

550
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,160
know it the entire nation was absolutely devastated because it was in shambles you know what

551
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,320
what they started to do is systematically round up the citizens and uh you know suck them into

552
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:22,000
facilities and torture them i mean that's the truth of it uh trying to get information about where

553
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,000
allegedly these things were hidden because they were looking for you know where where is the setup

554
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,840
and there was none this was the problem you know well there was but it was an occulted setup that if

555
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:38,240
they told the public what was so dangerous no one would believe it anyway let's just say that

556
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,040
yeah but that's the thing is that the the population did not have the knowledge that they were trying

557
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,080
to squeeze out of them in these you know torture sites that's that's what really went down and then

558
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:53,520
what they did is succeed in angering the uh the civilians who by the way are better armed than

559
00:41:53,520 --> 00:42:00,160
they are here i mean you know uh uh uh uh an a k is common in the household over there at least was

560
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,840
you know at that time so you know you're stealing our people we're gonna eventually strike back

561
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:10,880
and this became what they called an insurgents right wasn't even necessarily organized it was a natural

562
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,520
reaction uh and that's exactly how that went and still uh i i want answers as to how it is we get

563
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:24,640
you know the the u.s military as it is uh you know going in and destroying a a subordination under false

564
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,840
pre-tenses uh you know and and never actually being held accountable for it thank you very much but

565
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:35,440
back to a ron who is in time but i have to talk about that before it happened again

566
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,440
anyway because it has nothing to do with the there's a divine reason for all of this stuff and the divine

567
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:48,400
reason is that when you leave a place you you come back and you want it to see it like it was before

568
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,280
when you left it right that's like a very cliché term right sure what i leave here and i come back

569
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,560
next week i want to see it just like i left it right kind of thing right right let's take that all

570
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:05,760
the way to man's society where no matter whether you're secular religious uh occulted pagan or whatever

571
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,920
most people what comes out of their mouth when you say where did man start well they're going to point

572
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,880
to that part of the world where how is man's society going to end that part of the world right and

573
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,160
and very often today for the past well since the cold war what they call the cold war will sit for

574
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:29,280
the past thirty five years or so everyone uh if you ask anyone where if world war three were to

575
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,320
happen again where would it start well after the cold war everyone would clearly say would have to

576
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:38,480
start in the middle east you see my point right and people that think so intelligent would say

577
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:44,240
magito but yeah go ahead which is just the mountain air that but that's here's the thing too i

578
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,360
try to keep away from biblical references for several reason one is you get tagged as a bible

579
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:54,880
bumper religious nut which i'm not and the second thing is if you start giving biblical references

580
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,320
directly you're deluding yourself first before deluding the audience because the reason why you're

581
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:05,440
deluding yourself you're delusional is because you're presuming that the audience knows what's written

582
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,800
in the biblical text and how the hell could they know what's in the biblical text if they don't have

583
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,760
any they don't have the biblical texts sorry to tell you but all those bibles that are printed are

584
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:22,480
not the scriptures those are king james bible is not the not what's in the ancient scrolls anything

585
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,000
that you have is not in there if the best you the best chance you have a figuring out was in there

586
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,680
is you better break down and start looking at what's called an interlinear and to make things even worse

587
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,120
you'll find out what they call the new testament which i don't know why they call it the new

588
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:42,080
testament is written in greek well those guys were not greek that was written much much later

589
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:48,160
and put and piecemeal out of the aramaic so if you don't know how to translate an aramaic word one

590
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,440
where you're going to translate it another and that changes the meaning so don't even bother

591
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:57,520
that's why chuck you've known me for quite a few years now how many times i ever tell them when

592
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:05,360
to go read their bible i do the opposite never put it away go away from it unless you're going to

593
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:10,000
dedicate you know it's kind of like telling someone yeah you need furniture go to the lumberyard

594
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,200
what do you mean go you don't they don't sell furniture at the lumberyard yes they do it's just not in

595
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,000
the state that you want it in yeah you're gonna have to put in the work to put that together exactly

596
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,240
that's right that's exactly how it is and you know and people are so still i mean you might as well

597
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,160
just tell people go like there's a piece of furniture called an electric chair once you buy one sit down

598
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:38,640
and plug it in anyway so the the the the whole idea is that how do you convey ideas you know the

599
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:44,800
software that people are running is crap there it's not it's you know like you look at windows it's just

600
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,760
a there's still running windows 95 you know in the background of windows 10 you know it's just a

601
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:55,440
cumbersome you know one thing one layer over another but but here's the thing let go back to the

602
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:01,840
middle east union there are so many details to give there and instead of telling people hey this

603
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:06,320
is where i got it just break it down and give them a summary so you i don't know you sound like a

604
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:12,720
fortune teller to them because of course it's going to come true obviously if you if you got it if

605
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:21,520
you got the information right but the thing is the the the jumping to conclusions idea every time

606
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,120
there's a hiccup in the middle east it doesn't mean these things that i talk about are going to

607
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:30,400
come together oh no i understand there's a timeline no please understand that i don't think that

608
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:37,200
way at all but i know you don't but when i thought this and i thought of what would be the logical solution

609
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:43,440
okay i'll tell you that too yeah the solution yeah to that is what you see happening no

610
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:51,440
no that's but but eventually see i i carry things on and where it is you can go you know you

611
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,240
if you're going to play chess Greek you don't think about just the move you're making you think about

612
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:01,600
the potential for the other moves and you think about every other pieces movement that could come next

613
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,880
if you're playing the game properly right so well it also chess would be in the middle it's more like

614
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:13,440
bridge and more like checkers okay checkers because the mentality is really low and bridge because you

615
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,520
don't play alone you play with partners no fair enough but i i go with chess because i'm the only

616
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:25,360
individual speaker and yeah and it's the me it's the medium point uh so the idea is though that i

617
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:32,240
think to myself many moves ahead so i imagine that if someone decides to come to their senses and you

618
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:39,040
know not act as though we need to uh do the proverbial saber rattling in order to accomplish goals

619
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:45,520
somebody might eventually come to a conclusion that would lead directly to a circumstance by which

620
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:53,280
the middle eastern union concept would not only be logical but would seem to be beneficial for

621
00:47:53,280 --> 00:48:00,880
everyone who's concerned if they actually went through with it um you know so therefore i see

622
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,000
it getting closer to a time when it'll just be well of course we're going to do this you know the

623
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:12,960
thing is well well they just uh just to consider also uh what do what which culture really which you

624
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:17,920
might be pressed to figure out that there are no cultures that have not had a uh influence from

625
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,960
that part of the world in their past even the asian cultures you know which tend to hide that fact

626
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:30,800
um so the the danger of the middle east union well let me just say this one thing the the events

627
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:36,240
that are going to lead to the middle east union are going to be so brutal that while they're happening

628
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:41,200
and through their aftermath no one is really going to be thinking about the possibility of a middle

629
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,400
east union because of the brutality that's taking place and we're talking about like in for example

630
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:52,880
i've mentioned in israel the there is going to be a Palestinian state but no one in no Palestinian

631
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,760
in the west bank that means they're all going to be moved out of there and we're probably looking at

632
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,280
fatalities up to a hundred thousand put modern day Palestinians in a very short period of time which

633
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:09,920
will cost that prime minister his the israeli prime minister his life and also israel is going to lose

634
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:17,920
the capital city of Tel Aviv or why because it's the ancient city of yafa which was the capital of the

635
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:25,840
see the palestines so basically you're talking about major people it's going to be very rapid fire though

636
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,400
like it'll seem like the world is ending but it goes you know one day and then in a week it all goes

637
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:37,600
back to normal you see the other thing you're going to look for is a political rise of a new a

638
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,560
country called the new assyria right because when you bring back a country that didn't exist and

639
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:47,600
you maintain its old name you tend to put new in front of it like new york new jersey right

640
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:56,320
it right those are those are english places right you see and so new amster dem right so be the new assyria

641
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:03,600
the okay so these things are what you'll look for you're also look for a civil war type situation

642
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:09,440
in modern day aran where they're going to unify there isn't going to be a secular and religious

643
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,360
government because people don't know that there are two governments just like for example in the

644
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:18,000
u_s_ you have the head the house in the senate well in aran they have the religious government and

645
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,320
the secular government that's going to go it's going to be one well see that's it what's weird

646
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:28,960
about that greek is if you read the aranian constitution uh all aspects of aranian government

647
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:35,200
are already supervised and require the approval of islamic councils well that's what i mean yeah

648
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,680
that's going to be one there in other words you won't be neat supervision of a council because

649
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:44,880
it'll be the same it'll just be in other words no one you okay all right well be a bipartisan

650
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:52,240
don't be a bipartisan uh administration okay so okay so so these things are going to be very radical

651
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:57,600
and also you have to remember this is being influenced what i call the gods with plural right

652
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:03,440
and when they play around just like i mean you were saying chest earlier if if you happen to buy

653
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:09,280
you know a modestly priced chest set and you know you we take a break and we come back and the

654
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,160
dog peed and set the chest set on fire i mean you're not going to die over it you'll say we'll have to

655
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:19,600
get another one here in the closet it's no big deal right so to the gods hundreds of thousands of

656
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:26,560
people dying is nothing to them by the way if you know what i mean well why would it be quite honestly

657
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:33,600
i mean from the right perspective of a god per se again small g but uh you know it doesn't matter

658
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:38,320
how you say there's got plural and they're like they have a society and at the top they have one

659
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:42,480
and we're not talking about him he's the director but i'm saying that the gods that are going to put

660
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:48,160
this in in effect uh not talking about big deal here it even but here here let's be frank right

661
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:54,240
where these hopefully the audience is mature even the top uh g with a capital g like the christian

662
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:59,200
say doesn't care about most people he cares about his own people and he cares about people of his

663
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,080
choosing and who they are he knows right and how do i know that well i don't have to make this

664
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:08,240
self up you know if you want to scrap everything that's written about it in the past is fiction

665
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:14,320
that's fine but do you know it you know it's just like when you did your uh uh and probably still

666
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:21,200
our research on jfk stuff you have to look at everything and discern it everything even if 99%

667
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:26,880
of it comes out to be bs you you still looked at everything you see you have to look at everything right

668
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:32,160
oh yeah listen i mean i you know searching through hundreds of thousands of documents right uh you

669
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:38,000
you're looking for just one useful thing you know what i mean some time right so yeah so if you

670
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,040
look at anything and everything that's ever written about the gods even by these these insane people

671
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,080
known as religious people christians mausoleums ujans or whatever they all earn agreement all of

672
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:52,080
it and i've said this before anyone who looks at any ancient rits of all the ancient rits are

673
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:57,760
in agreement completely even if you look at the creation stories found in the bible or to the

674
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,880
accadian of the samaritan they're all in agreement all in agreement slightly different accounts

675
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:10,000
but in essence the crux is the same so uh if you to keep going back you know we're almost like of having

676
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:15,600
a semi-philosophical discussion because uh the ideology of just telling people there's going to be a

677
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:21,840
middle east union is not enough what people need to comprehend is this is not a political issue this

678
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:28,640
is a cosmic issue dare i say okay and would right you see what i mean by cosmic uh in other words

679
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:35,200
are influenced by uh forces that are beyond the surface and if you want to for example look at

680
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:42,400
how contrived the society is now whether because pretty much everyone has the same school system

681
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:48,400
medical system scientific system and all that right and money system this this the medical

682
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,720
system education system the religious system financial system is so evil and so deceptive it's

683
00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:00,800
based on deception and the people that run it are so evil at heart and i'm talking about people

684
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:06,000
down the street maybe family members that work in it as well that you might have or know or friends

685
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,480
that is no way that such a plot such a social mechanism could have been hatched by human by humans

686
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:19,440
themselves right right so you know this is a something that's also been discussed through the ages

687
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:27,280
i think the only ones that have gone too far by trying to pinpoint a character scheme are the

688
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:32,880
the uh what they call the nostics right they've categorized they've put everything into these neat

689
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:39,760
little packages which just doesn't seem so right but even what they say you know that the one

690
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:45,040
that is activating and keeping things going is evil is correct as well but here here's the

691
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:50,880
to again go back to the middle east the reason why you're going to have the middle east is very

692
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,680
simple what goes around comes around basically what you're going to see is the revival of things

693
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:01,200
that are old you're going to see there and also being coined as new if you know what i mean

694
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:07,200
things that are that are so old and forgotten that when they reemerge they will they will seem

695
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:14,640
like they're newly discovered okay if that makes any sense so that seems to be a common theme in

696
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:19,680
recent history to me great so go ahead well if you need if you want to learn something new read a

697
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:26,560
really old book that you know it's very simple um i think we've discussed the reemergent goddess

698
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:31,520
religion which was one of the reasons of the department of justice by the way because when you say

699
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:36,160
when you say instead of saying the department of justice say the department of diana or the

700
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:45,920
department of marian or the department of carolina or the department of susan does that does that

701
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,960
what did i just give you all female names woman's names i said female because they could be names

702
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:57,040
of objects like ships right do you see my point so it's the revival of this goddess religion and the

703
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:02,080
goddess religion teaches that humans were at one point in a godlike state and when they were in that

704
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:09,120
godlike state they were either asexual or hermaphroditic so the way you promote humans to go back

705
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:15,360
to a godlike state is you promote male with male union and when the males unite they become infertile

706
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:21,120
and you promote female and female union the females unite and maintain their fertility and

707
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:26,560
procreate without the men on their own well and we listen to this and then that's how they're going to

708
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:31,520
that's how you're going to have a godlike being and this is an ancient ancient teaching if you go

709
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:36,160
into very ancient teachings you'll see this is not a cult of stuff this is this stuff that historians

710
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:42,480
have written about well right and that's why we've also discussed the mutilation of the male as well

711
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:50,320
which has become popularized in in recent years the transgendarism where you know it the encouragement

712
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:56,560
usually is the the male to female but of course they goes the other way either the mutilation

713
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:01,520
in the medical system well you're genetically prone to cancer so cut your breasts off right now

714
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:08,800
that too and anything that defaminizes over feminizes removes the male organ from the equation i

715
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:14,400
mean this is all what's being promoted but of course of course we're coming up to a break time here

716
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,440
and i want to go further on these subjects but we're going to take a couple of minutes

717
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:26,080
just to kind of reset and plus i got a bunch of questions from the chat room and we do have open

A sun that has fく, once upon a time in a world

746
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:23,560
A sun that has fく, once upon a time in a world

747
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:48,520
A sun that has fく, once upon a time in a world

748
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:54,360
A sun that has fく, once upon a time in a world

749
01:01:54,360 --> 01:02:00,600
A sun that has fく, once upon a time in a world

750
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:06,640
A sun that has fく, once upon a time in a world

751
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:20,560
A sun that has fく, once upon a time in a world

752
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:43,480
A sun that has fく, once upon a time in a world

753
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:57,960
Now your head turns out of air and seems to land

754
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:02,600
And as the sun has fく, once upon a time in a world

755
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:03,600
Go ahead, Colin!

756
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,400
Yeah, this is sitting the truth about today's Aeophae Association

757
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,640
Right, well, what do you want to know?

758
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,120
Beauty Baker's wild claim, Oswald Girlfriend,

759
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:21,440
New Ruby and Barry, Cancer Reppens, Billy?

760
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,760
I imagine I could claim I have four wheels, it doesn't make me a wagon, but okay.

761
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,880
Oswald was on the kill team and I'm trying to present the motor of John Kennedy.

762
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,880
Come on now, has it wheel-eckerd on the day of Aeophae Association?

763
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:38,320
Go to amazon.com, Entert Judith Baker in her own words, you'll get the results for a digital copy of a book where Walt Brown utilizes her own words and the known evidence in the case to get at, well,

764
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,760
A different perspective, let's say.

765
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:52,160
You can get Judith Berry Baker in her own words from the author himself signed if you request it by contacting Dr. Brown at k-i-a-s-j-f-k at-a-o-l.com.

766
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:57,280
It's a fun book and it actually dissects the many, many fantastic claims.

767
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,520
Judith Berry Baker in her own words.

768
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,520
Thank you for all the great information.

769
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:28,160
[Music]

770
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:38,960
So we do return with the second hour of the O'Challee effect. I know there was a slight pause. Of course you're hearing this on podcast, you didn't hear that, but on the livestream you did.

771
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:45,800
I was talking to the Greek off the air and just, you know, a couple of seconds off on my intro, sorry.

772
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:55,360
Anyhow, back to it, we do have the Greek with us, which is a rather unusual circumstance, kind of uncommon, so to speak, for him to be on the show anymore.

773
01:04:55,360 --> 01:05:05,200
But you guys requested, and I'm always happy to talk with him. I mean, I enjoyed doing the O'Challee and the Greek thing and all of it. I learned a lot.

774
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:14,880
And I felt as though it was, you know, something of interest. I know a lot of people did enjoy it, so I'm more than happy to have a conversation with the Greek anyway.

775
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:20,080
And actually, it's been a lot of time talking you off the air years ago.

776
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:33,120
And, you know, through different circumstances. But that's a story for another day. Greek, you got a bunch of questions that were asked from the chat room, which I copied and pasted to you, because you're not in the chat room.

777
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:40,880
And I think there's one more hang in there that's kind of a longer question, but I wonder if you wouldn't address the couple of those.

778
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:46,640
Who are the brothmins? Bronfmins? Okay, let's just put it this way.

779
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:57,680
If you're asking who someone is, before you do, figure this out and you're going to have to replay this, figure out where the time marker is and listen to this about 10 times what I'm going to say.

780
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:03,920
If you've heard of them or seen them, they have no power. Let me say it again.

781
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:09,360
If you've heard of them or seen them, they have no power.

782
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:25,080
The Clintons, the Kissinger, the Putin, the Hitler, the Stalin's, those are all actors. Anybody in anything you've ever heard of after Napoleon is all someone who said, yes, I will do the script.

783
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:35,320
Tell me what or whatever. And also, they know that if they deviate, they get a slap on the wrist. And if they deviate again, they die of lead poisoning usually.

784
01:06:35,320 --> 01:06:51,800
Like JFK, right? Hot lead poisoning. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's basically the game that you play. And so you hear any of the Koch brothers, Rockefeller, the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds are the banking clerks for the owners of the planet.

785
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:58,000
Let me say that again. You know what a banking clerk is? If you don't know, figure it out.

786
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:11,280
The Rothschilds, the Rockefeller is all the zeeps, the Goldman Sachs, the JP Morgan's, those guys are clerks, clerks for the owners of the planet.

787
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:20,200
You will never find out. And never would the capital V who the owners of the planet are in this incarnation, at least.

788
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:35,960
They are very, very smart about keeping them self-secret because they stay there. The closest you're going to get to viewing anybody of what they look like is the next time you get an Alex Jones type video of who's going to the builder, burgs.

789
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:47,640
Look at the limousine driver, not who's in the back seat because every time you see a photo who's going to the builder, burgers, you have Kissinger and who's the Bozo that owns Amazon.

790
01:07:47,640 --> 01:08:00,600
Whatever, in the back seat, look at their faces. They're definitely afraid of looking forward because the real guy in power is the guy who's the show for the janitor.

791
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:07,720
The guy who dresses up like the janitor at the builder, burgs is one of the owners of the world. This is how it works.

792
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:14,200
And you don't have to have more than a fifth grade mentality to understand this. You always hide.

793
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:23,480
Especially since Napoleon, because Napoleon decided to kick all the oligarchs in the shins and he woke them up the moment he did a self-portrait of himself as the emperor of Europe.

794
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:33,160
Because yes, Europe had emperors up until the 19th century. And the moment he did that, they all said, okay, that's it. We're going to go in hiding.

795
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:42,120
And that's it. And it's been that way. And the way that you see what they are doing is through the what they call the intelligence agencies.

796
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:49,320
Like for example, you want to consider it. Let me just put it out this way from a good source. The Bozo who owns Amazon.

797
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:57,880
All right. Okay. He gets a suggestion to do something with the way the company is going to go. And he doesn't like it.

798
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:04,680
And they get back to him and he still doesn't comply. Well, that Bozo is going to go look at his bank account one day.

799
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:16,680
And guess what he's going to see 0.00. And then he gets a phone call after he checks his bank account. Do you want to reconsider what we suggested? And he says yes, sir.

800
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:23,640
And then his bank account goes up to, you know, whatever, 100 billion. It doesn't matter. Be those bucks. Yeah.

801
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:36,120
And other, it doesn't matter who it is. That's exactly how they work it. And that's exactly how it's done. And the people who push the bubbeliever not the people push the button on that one was a woman that's in her 40s.

802
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:43,160
It's about five foot zero. A little tiny lady. It wouldn't even suspect her of being anything like that. So make a long story short.

803
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:50,280
Greek, are you saying that they took Bezos money away? No, there was never any money there. It just digits anyway. Right.

804
01:09:50,280 --> 01:10:04,280
It's access to it. And every Trump is like that, too. They're all like that. They're all actors. The next. My favorite is the Ukrainian guy. They have. He was a comedian. And they wanted to put a porn actress in Italy. Remember. Oh, yeah.

805
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:15,720
I do remember perfect. Perfect. Remember back to the future. Who's the president future? All Reagan. The actor. You know, like Donald Trump, the president. You mean the TV reality show?

806
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:29,720
Guy, I mean, come on, guys. If you know them or you heard them, they have no power. They are an actor of power. It doesn't mean that they don't have any power to you because they're acting as the official. Right.

807
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:40,680
Well, that's the interesting thing that Ukrainian guy that my favorite clip of him is playing the piano with his penis, actually. That's that's my favorite clip of him. Just just say no.

808
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:54,680
You don't think they can go different ways. You know, you know, it's a. Again, if you go back to the policing and all that, not a very short lady. She, you know, one day I heard, you know, this is an neighborhood in this little. Another short lady.

809
01:10:54,680 --> 01:11:02,680
He goes, I got a rooster here down the street because yeah, I keep calling the cops on them because I don't like that grew up on a forum and I hated the way they sounded.

810
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:12,680
You know, so basically, all right. So basically you're calling the cops on the guy because you don't like his cock. Okay. So anyway, yeah.

811
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:16,680
Next question. Sure.

812
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:28,680
Let's see. Okay. Where does the Prince of Israel come? Okay. Well, that's that's another discussion. The Prince of Israel. You know, depends on who the Prince of Israel is in his equal 46. That's a ladder prophecy thing.

813
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:42,680
Let's just skim on this for a while because they're not good. Deep at all. I mean, skim like even night and touch the surface. When people look at the biblical text, that has to do with the chief God of all the gods.

814
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:54,680
And it has to do with him creating a people through Abraham and the Christ that came was through Abraham for the Abraham's descendants and those who want to go into covenant.

815
01:11:54,680 --> 01:12:04,680
Now, what the hell does that have to do with you? And if you say of nothing, you're probably correct. Has nothing to do with you at this point. And how do I know that's true?

816
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:15,680
Because that's why they put all the ridiculous Christian religions is like one or 150 different formal Christian religions. And then there's another 20,000 sects in Christianity.

817
01:12:15,680 --> 01:12:18,680
I know it sounds kind of crazy, right?

818
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:28,680
And then they have Judaism, which is straight out of Babylon and then Islam is supposed to be based on the stuff that everyone else is supposed to be based on.

819
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:39,680
It's a big radical mess. What the gods are telling you is the promises that we made to the ancient forefathers and the Christ and the people and the prophets that's not for you.

820
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:49,680
But how do I know because the people don't have it? They have these ridiculous religions led by Peter files and Peter Fogos. You know, Fogos means to eat, right?

821
01:12:49,680 --> 01:13:02,680
So I mean, it's, but it will be for everyone on the planet later when the planets redone when it's more a little more obvious because people don't quite get the point.

822
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:16,680
So let's go to the next one. Opinion on Zaroastrianism. I don't have an opinion on it, but it is a legitimate deity because you have to understand there is a cosmic or divine geography.

823
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:30,680
I think you and I chuck went over it many, many times. The gods, there are, there are at least 70 major gods. We're not talking about the head one now. And then countless, literally countless minor ones. And they take have geographic influence.

824
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:41,680
That's why when you look at Christianity in Europe, it's different than Christianity in Eastern Europe. It's different than Christianity in South America, right? Because it has nothing to do with Christianity to do with those of those gods operate.

825
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:52,680
Right. Mr. Zaroastrianism is all confused with some of the geographically aligned elemental entities, which are not gods, but are a higher order.

826
01:13:52,680 --> 01:14:01,680
Well, the elemental entity would be like the street sweeper in your neighborhood. The gods that the people deal with would be like the mayor. Right.

827
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:09,680
The demons and the angels of that God would be like the police and that what you see on main street. You know, because you are a good way to organize it, sure.

828
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:18,680
Yeah. And the president is off plan is a way from all of it because he doesn't have to be here. They already have been given instructions and said they understood it.

829
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:31,680
Exactly. Okay. So that's basically how it is in all of its legit. But when you're told about leprechauns and fairies and all that stuff, they do exist, but not in the way that, you know, they're not on cereal boxes.

830
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,680
Right.

831
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:40,680
Okay. All these things do exist. And the beauty of living now is that you're going to see evidence of all these things coming up for those who can discern it. Right.

832
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:52,680
So when you see, you know, someone in Germany going for a walk in the black forest and he with his iPhone takes a picture of this little creature that doesn't come above his knee.

833
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:59,680
You know, that's a leprechaun, but it doesn't look anything like you've been shown on the cereal boxes, right. Right. So. Okay.

834
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:10,680
So all these things, I don't have an opinion on them. I know of them and the question is, do you know of them? And what do you know of them? Right. And that's the point. So go tell other people like we were talking about having conversations earlier.

835
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:24,680
Hey, I said my piece. What am I going to go? I can't go further. Right. Because the response is minimal. In other words, right. You know, you know, there's a, there's a level to where you put out information and people say they want more, but if they can't handle it.

836
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:34,680
And they don't know they can't handle it, but you know, they can't handle it. Why say it? You see. So I've said my piece. There's going to be a time in the future to start talking again.

837
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:43,680
But I think you and I both agree and others have agreed that the stuff that we even put out on a cell in a Greek is more than some put out in the past couple of thousand years.

838
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:47,680
All organized and easy for people and the truth of the matter.

839
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:59,680
You know, and you know, recently someone says, well, great. Who do you think you are? You're the only one that has the truth. And I said, well, did you listen to it? Yeah. Did you understood? Did you get what I said? Yeah. Well, now I'm not the only one that's right now. You have it because you heard it.

840
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:14,680
You see. So get it. The ego's got to go away. And if people can't see through the arrogance and the ego and all that other stuff that they want to formulate, then you have to go away because they're not getting it. And there's not you know.

841
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:36,680
Well, see that that's the thing is that actually I I used to object to one of the things that you said quite often, which was that, you know, it's not time to discuss certain things. And, you know, in different areas of interest, I have found that to actually be very sadly true.

842
01:16:36,680 --> 01:17:00,680
And why do I say that because I've tried to disseminate certain pieces of information and it went really unheated and misunderstood by people. And then they came back to it a couple of years later and said, oh, now that makes sense. And I said, no, it made sense. Then just you weren't ready to hear it.

843
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:20,680
And it's funny because I mean, it's not about cosmic topics that that that I've done this, but about some very real things. And I found that yes, there is a lack of audience for some things that I could present.

844
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:30,680
Yeah, welcome to Planet Earth. Yeah, welcome to Planet Earth exactly. I know, but look, I had to learn it my way.

845
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:44,680
It was sort of like talking about the Samarian organization of spirituality and they go, well, Sitchon and it's like, oh, God, look.

846
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:57,680
You know, he gave you the problem with Sitchon also is the reason, okay, let me just say this. I never say more than 11% or 10%. Here's the 12% or 11% one more percentage.

847
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:10,680
When you start figuring out that everything that determines what everything is happens between the ears, it's not about flesh and blood and it's not about nuts and bolts. Like with the UFO people, they're looking for nuts and bolts. It's not about that.

848
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:23,680
The people that are looking for spirituality, they want to go out of their body. Well, you can't do it inside your body. What do you think you're your body? You're just just a container. You could, you don't have to leave it. You could do exactly what you can do leaving it in still in your body.

849
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:35,680
You see, everyone's attached to this material stuff. Right. They don't understand it. And you're being shown all around you that that's been done away with. Like, you know, there's no money, right. There is no money at all. It's all credit, right.

850
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:47,680
You have no medicine at all. Band-aids, pain killers and aspirin and antibiotics is not medicine. Sorry, guys. That's all you got, right.

851
01:18:47,680 --> 01:19:01,680
You know, you have to, the religion, I mean, come on, Santa Claus and Easter Bunny is saying no more. Right. So, you know, I mean, the thing is, it's not about, it's not about what you've been told at all.

852
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:12,680
And to get to that level, here, here's one example. If you want, you know, the brainwashing they give you to change the path, the present with time machines and all that, right.

853
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:19,680
You have to go to the past, right. And you know, you change it in the past. No, it's not. You go to the future. You always go to the future. I don't want to get in trouble.

854
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:32,680
But I don't want to let's, I don't want the Skype call being cut down, but the way time travel works to influence the timeline is you go to the future. You never go to the past to change the present.

855
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:44,680
And they're like, wow, Greek, that doesn't make any sense. Good. Perfect. That means now you can get rid of the old mindset. The reason why you say it doesn't make any sense is because you're relying on all the bullshit you've been taught, right. The same with everything.

856
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:54,680
So basically you go in the future and you send the information back to yourself in the present, which is in the past. And you can do that all between the years also.

857
01:19:54,680 --> 01:20:03,680
And the gods have been trying to tell you this for all their ancient texts. That's why all the most pertinent ancient texts have what in there. It starts with the p and ends with a y.

858
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:17,680
Prophecy. Why are all the substantiated ancient texts, whether of any culture, what is the most significant part of their eschatological meaning is what happens in their what in their prophecies. Why are they always telling you the future?

859
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:31,680
Because that's how you change the now. So you see, how can I get into a discussion like this when I still see people wondering about blood pressure and they don't know how to keep time because they're on the Pope's work schedule.

860
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:43,680
There's no meaning to it. So next question. How can you tell if you're favored by the gods are making your life miserable and you know why your life is miserable.

861
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:57,680
There's lots of people who know, I mean, there's lots of people who say their lives are miserable, but they don't know why. If your life is miserable and you know why you're being favored by the gods, what?

862
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:10,680
Right? Okay. And it's not because I'm says on my opinion, that's the fact. At least I know I go in and out of favor with the gods. Thank you very much because it's going to.

863
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:20,680
It's going to be the female feminized the male. This seems to be the agenda of a softer kind of population control, global population need to decrease or natural resource need to decrease. You pick.

864
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:31,680
Yeah, there's plenty of people like for example, there's plenty of room for billions and hundreds of billions of people. For example, there's over a billion combustion motors on the earth right now.

865
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:48,680
And one combustion engine uses in eight hours more air that you use in a year. So if you do the math eight hours times three is a day times 365 in a year right now just based on how many combustion engines are on the planet.

866
01:21:48,680 --> 01:22:05,680
And it's like having over a trillion people breathing air on the planet. Well, and so you got plenty of resources. Yeah, the people are going to go. Yeah, but real quickly I got to ask you something here because I am stymied by this every time I see it where there's not enough resources on the planet. So this is what.

867
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:22,680
If you scientifically allocated resources based on what is necessary. Okay, like in other words, if I were the deity and could simply allocate resources all over the planet it will. There's no issue here.

868
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:30,680
There is no. It takes more than enough resources. In fact, to sustain three times the population on the planet.

869
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:40,680
It takes, yeah, take the architecture and the way you call the infrastructure of a city like what would you say major city New York Tokyo, you know, places like that.

870
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:48,680
What the cities look like where people live comfortably. If you built all of Texas like that you could house everyone on the planet just in Texas.

871
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:54,680
Yeah, if you built an infrastructure that looked like, you know, apartments and high rises and you say and they would live comfortably.

872
01:22:54,680 --> 01:23:04,680
It wouldn't be a despotic nightmare, you know, tripping over people would be plenty of room for everybody on the planet just on Texas if you developed it properly.

873
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:23,680
Well, and you would have to consolidate in that way you could actually allocate a fair amount of land, you know, arable land even to the existing population and distributed it if it was just simply done in a scientific consideration as opposed to, you know, who's got advantage who has the digits in the bank account or who's in the right.

874
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:33,680
Geographical location, all that stuff. If you re aligned at all, it's easily sustainable. There is no issue of resources here.

875
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:46,680
Well, the problem is the distribution and the where to. Okay, I'm just I'm just staying the type of technology using also. Why do you, you know, if you breathe what comes out of a car engine, you're going to die. Why aren't you.

876
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:54,680
There's hundreds of pans on how to run cars on a water vapor. I'm not talking about oxygen and hydrogen, just water vapor. There's a guy right now pedaling.

877
01:23:54,680 --> 01:24:02,680
He wants to go cross country in a bus that sucks moisture out of the air with condensers and he drives the bus cross country just with air based on that.

878
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:12,680
So so the point here is those things like global warming is a message, you know, it's it's a cosmically caused global warming. They're telling you.

879
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:18,680
Too many people, they're telling you only one out of 10 people is going to be here in about a dozen years.

880
01:24:18,680 --> 01:24:31,680
And the thing is it's not the numbers of people. It's the quality of the people. If you reduce the earth's population down to 100 people only and you put a rabbi, a priest, a minister, a doctor, and a lawyer in that mix.

881
01:24:31,680 --> 01:24:38,680
And 40 years are going to be just as bad of a ship poor society, piss poor society as you are right now.

882
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:48,680
So in the future, you're not going to have doctors and lawyers and ministers and those kinds of basically demonic personages as you see today.

883
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:53,680
Those those box patients will not exist.

884
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:59,680
Everyone, you know, if you have a body, you know how to fix it. If you if you live in a society, there's law. Everyone's going to know these things.

885
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:13,680
But I assure you you could take this to the bank. If you put 10 people in a room right now, only one of you will be alive in 12 or 13 years. Max only one of you will walk out of there and that has to be done out of necessity.

886
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:22,680
And what I've cleaned from the information is that they're not going to pick the best of the best. They're going to take a representative sample.

887
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:31,680
So the one that walks out of the room is still going to be a typical human scumbag, you know, that you see today down the street or wherever you go in the country or whatever.

888
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:37,680
There's still going to be typical in that the people that are going to rule over them are going to be a different type of people.

889
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:41,680
And that's for another discussion, which I think we've broached on you and I years ago.

890
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:47,680
Yes, we did. It's going to be a cross section is what you're saying. And that actually makes sense.

891
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:52,680
The survivors are going to be the typical human scumbag that you see today on the planet pretty much.

892
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:57,680
Yeah, but they're not going to be ruled by the scumbags you see being ruled today.

893
01:25:57,680 --> 01:26:00,680
Got you. OK. Fair enough.

894
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:06,680
So and it's going to be quite interesting, but you know, and I have more detail on that, which we've gone over, you know, one of these things go down.

895
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:13,680
You're going to have about a 40 year period of before the dust settles and retraining and all that.

896
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:19,680
And the cosmic realm will be more open. You know, when you look out at the night sky, it's not going to look anything like it does now.

897
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:24,680
And you look out in the day sky, it's not going to look anything like it does now either.

898
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:27,680
Well, that would make sense too. Yeah. So.

899
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:35,680
All right. Greek thoughts on capitalism, socialism, communism, how credit is seems to be supporting infrastructure of all these.

900
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:39,680
Well, it doesn't well, all those are.

901
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:46,680
You could go down socialism. I don't even know what those things mean based on their definitions that they give.

902
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:52,680
A capitalism can be defined as when you're done using something, you destroy it. So no one else can use it.

903
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:57,680
Right. You over here of like the US pulling out of a military base and they destroy everything right.

904
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:03,680
They tell you to do that. Destroy all your weapons in the army before if you know you're going to be captured, right?

905
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:07,680
Well, that's why they oftentimes sinking trucks and Vietnam before they left.

906
01:27:07,680 --> 01:27:12,680
Yeah, dumping things after rivers and whatever. Yeah. No, that's true.

907
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,680
And you know, it's fun about that. Yeah.

908
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:21,680
Is before you even answer the rest of it quite frankly, the things that are defined, people start to point to examples of,

909
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:25,680
well, here was when socialism ran something. Here's when communism ran something.

910
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:33,680
Here's what a capitalism, you know, a capitalism based society looks like every last one of those statements is a lie.

911
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:40,680
Because if you have a religion that the state supports, in other words, if you put up a religious building organization,

912
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:45,680
state doesn't run it over with a tank in three days, that state approved.

913
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:52,680
So if you're going to a state approved religion and you have an identification number and policing, you're under feudalism.

914
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:59,680
You're living, okay, I dare anyone to do this. Start researching what a sovereign state is.

915
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:03,680
It's not what you think it is. And I'm not talking about just the legal meaning.

916
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:07,680
On YouTube, they got a couple of these academic assholes, you know, professors.

917
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:13,680
And the one guy's interviewing, could you define a sovereign state and he's like, oops, I wish you wouldn't have answered me that question.

918
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:21,680
Right. And the definition of a sovereign state is an entity. It's a juridical person. It's a fictional corporate entity.

919
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:28,680
That does three things. It has, first thing is it has absolute control over the territory that it's marked, you know, incorporated.

920
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:35,680
The second thing is it provides military protection for that territory. And the third thing is it offers services.

921
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:42,680
I didn't hear anything about communism, socialism, rights, voting, freedom or anything. It has nothing to do with that.

922
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:48,680
Anyone that's in the United Nations is a sovereign state, which is a fictional juridical person.

923
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:56,680
It is the corporate moniker that the owners of the planet have divided amongst themselves all of the countries.

924
01:28:56,680 --> 01:29:09,680
That's why, for example, when you see, like, maybe was the impetus of having the sonic, the stuff going on between the US and Iran and near Iraq and all that, well, guess what?

925
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:17,680
If you look at the UN Council, is any Iran a member of the UN Council? Isn't the US a member of the UN Council? Isn't the UN Council a club for the sovereign states?

926
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:32,680
It's supposed to be-- nothing going on. Yeah, those are state problems. Like, for example, in the football leagues, right? You could have one team playing another. They're part of the same league. No matter how much they beat each other up on the field.

927
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:41,680
At the end of the day when it comes down to business, the owners of those teams are part of a group. And those are the ones that make the decisions.

928
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:59,680
So what I'm talking about when we bring up the Middle East Union, the UN will not have the organizational power and the kings of the world, the ones that own that you read about, the kings that I can't tell people go read it, but it's in the text, talks about the kings of the world.

929
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:10,680
It doesn't give any names, anything specific. Those owners are kings of the world that you don't know and probably will never know who they are, are the ones that it's talking about are going to be influenced.

930
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:21,680
So, well fair enough. I mean, I always like to go to the much simpler, easier, relatable kind of thing where you're talking about the football teams there. I say, look, there used to be this thing called the WWF.

931
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:32,680
And there was a guy named the Iron Sheik and he would battle a guy named Sergeant Slotter. And the two of them were supposed to represent Iran. And of course, Iran would be the Iron Sheik.

932
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:43,680
And Sergeant Slotter, everybody attended USA, USA. I mean, at the end of the day, they're both paid by the same corporate master and they are both there to promote the same company.

933
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:53,680
And as for who their managers are, their actual managers, not the guy showing up acting like a manager, but as for who their actual managers are, you don't know.

934
01:30:53,680 --> 01:31:16,680
So, well, at the end of the day, it's the bean counter reporting to the real owner. I mean, bring up WWF when you say that. I remember as a child, WWF. I stopped watching it when Bruno Sarmartino broke his back and you had George the animal steal Andre the giant and the crazy manager, Lual Bano.

935
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:33,680
And Bob Backlin was the champion forever, right? Yeah, that's right. I really had some guy. Yeah. And that's that's my WWF now because I'm in my sixth decade. I'm my 50, 50 year, which my sixth decade, right? I'm going to six decade. I think you're 60. They're not listening. Right?

936
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:45,680
Just like all the morons think, you know, we end to a new decade. No, you don't go into a new decade and the Pope's work scheduled to hit 2021. Just like you don't go into a new century until you hit 2001, for example, right?

937
01:31:45,680 --> 01:32:00,680
But anyway, who's counting, right? Yeah, who's counting exactly? I mean, you know, I'm 47 years old by most conventions. That would put me in my fifth decade, though, because you're in your fifth decade. That's right. When you're born, you're in your first decade.

938
01:32:00,680 --> 01:32:15,680
Of course, yeah, however, you and yeah, and we're all in our first century, still. If we are 101, you're in your second century now. So this is the way, you know, you know, this is what we call dimension or the concept of measurement.

939
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:28,680
And there's nothing worse than surprises. You know, there really are no surprises because if you have an omnipotent being, how are you going to do a surprise when they know?

940
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:37,680
Right, but you know, I was talking to someone recently, there's an ET race, an alien race, and they will never be attacked because they're precox.

941
01:32:37,680 --> 01:32:44,680
They know everything before it happens. So you can't attack them, right? So if you plan on attacking them tomorrow, they already know that, right?

942
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:45,680
Okay.

943
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:56,680
So in other words, they'll never be surprised. And we never have surprises with these things because the ancients knew about certain things that were so important to write down and make sure that we get.

944
01:32:56,680 --> 01:33:06,680
And it doesn't, you know, check your familiar with the prophecies you've heard of whether you've studied them or not, at least you've heard of this every culture has an end times prophecy, right?

945
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:16,680
Nearly every culture. Yeah. Nearly every culture has some concept of either a reset or an end of the world scenario or, yeah, absolutely.

946
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:29,680
And it's not a happy ending and they don't give you much about after that. It's all you'll be better after, but it's never a happy ending, right? Like the massage bar, there's a used to have back then, but even now, but here's the thing.

947
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:31,680
I think they still exist, Greek.

948
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:36,680
They still exist, I know. But not that I know firsthand anymore, but anyway.

949
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:39,680
Yeah, I understand. First hand, that's, that's funny.

950
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:40,680
Yeah, go ahead, yeah.

951
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:52,680
If you're right, use your left, you think it's somebody else. So stranger danger. Go ahead. That's right. So, so the thing is, okay, what happens after is not important because we're not that after point right now.

952
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:55,680
We're still at the before point, before the end.

953
01:33:55,680 --> 01:34:01,680
And it's not the end. It's just like the reset. I like calling it the reset because what is a reset?

954
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:07,680
You know, you're still playing the same game. You just wiped out all the current, the previous score.

955
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:21,680
Okay, like if you look at a video game or something like that, but you will let's go. There's a lot of fat to chew and yarn to weave when you talk about, we'd bring up the Middle East Union.

956
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:28,680
So we're not going to be on here indefinitely. You probably got to be eaten up the better part of the second half hour. I'm sure by now.

957
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:41,680
But what I want to say is this, there are specifics regarding all of this and you could get the short of it, you know, the summary, the quick summary or the details. I can do both.

958
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:49,680
So the, but the most thing because I know how people think is what happened yesterday in a few days. They won't even know.

959
01:34:49,680 --> 01:35:00,680
So they want to know the immediacy of things, right? So what you're going to be watching and looking for. Yes. This whole thing with Iran just happened and all that.

960
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:07,680
But it means absolutely nothing in the big scheme other than one little brick in the wall more, you see.

961
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:15,680
One more event to change the ideology. These are what you're seeing that what just happened with Iran before we get into the next thing to watch out for.

962
01:35:15,680 --> 01:35:26,680
I have not mentioned specifically because it's an ideology changer is to start making you or maintain your focus on that part of the world and your ideology.

963
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:32,680
And the ideology changer for some people who don't get the hint if they haven't studied the events.

964
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:43,680
A recap would be that the salamony that general was killed on his way to do a piece negotiations about the situation in Iraq. He gets killed by the Americans.

965
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:52,680
It is what they're with being put out. So he's not really the bad guy. He was actually trying to do good and the Americans are trying to look like the good guys, but they're not just the bad guys.

966
01:35:52,680 --> 01:36:07,680
The Americans are the super bad guys because they're killing people for doing trying to do good. Not one bad guy versus another bad guy. You see I'm not demonizing the Americans here because they've done enough to demonize themselves for the past 300 years.

967
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:20,680
But here's the interesting part about it is that little bit that came out that the Iranians are trying to do good and they're slaughtered by the Americans puts even more what.

968
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:40,680
The negative sympathy towards the Americans. Why? Because the possibility and the of the whole world focusing on the Middle East as something good is based on say the Middle East Union and the Americans means no Americans in this you see.

969
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:54,680
So the more that the Americans become demonized the closer you're going to get this is not really an event that was really about us in Iran more than it was about the US if you know what I mean.

970
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:58,680
Well right. And he said it's the precursor to the precursor because yeah.

971
01:36:58,680 --> 01:37:09,680
Yeah. And also to get the West. Now the problem you're good. I've mentioned this before you're going to have more people pulling out of mainstream religions, but they're going to be in no man's land because.

972
01:37:09,680 --> 01:37:17,680
No one is presenting in a conventional sense what really these religions are supposed to be based on our people's faith.

973
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:22,680
It should be based on if they're going towards that you know the Christian or Judea or islam.

974
01:37:22,680 --> 01:37:28,680
You know there is no one that's coming out and saying look you're all based on the promises given to Abraham.

975
01:37:28,680 --> 01:37:36,680
And this is really what happened. No one is doing that at this point, but the vacuum is happening people are going away from mainstream religions.

976
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:48,680
And the problem is when people start explaining what is in the ancient texts and historically what really happened from Abraham to the Christ it's going to completely destroy Christianity islam and Judaism completely destroy it.

977
01:37:48,680 --> 01:38:00,680
And that's why you keep hearing over and over and over decisions are made by governments because by the way it used to be the president got the football.

978
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:24,680
You know the atomic football when you become president right for the nukes well now what you get is you do have access to that as well, but you get a second suitcase and the second suitcase you get as a video file something looks like an iPad and written files on what happens if the E.T.s decide to make themselves known when you get what is your statement going to be to the world to explain it you see.

979
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:31,680
So and the reason why they don't come out and say this one of the main reasons is because it's going to disturb people's religions.

980
01:38:31,680 --> 01:38:46,680
So you see what I mean so this is all tied in together the fake E.T. invasion and all that you know just like they had the fake terrorism you know there is no Muslims and right unless there were Muslims working in the CIA you know it's a different story but you know.

981
01:38:46,680 --> 01:39:00,680
So that you see all of these agendas so what you're going to be seeing is agendas to get you to focus on the sky E.T. or something right UFOs tick-tack Navy Nimitz bullshit right.

982
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:10,680
And from speaking to an older person recently not real but some less almost a year now the point is retired spook.

983
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:18,680
So the H bomb was declat was not declassable kind of is you got a lost alamos in certain libraries you get blueprints for the H bomb it's no big not a secret really.

984
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:20,680
Not anymore.

985
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:32,680
Not anymore no but the biggest priority see the atomic warfare was a priority but by the mid to late 80s especially with Reagan making all of his hints the biggest priorities the E.T. agenda right now.

986
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:42,680
So if you for example are abducted by aliens and you start flapping your gums on the internet and it seems credible you're going to get my lab they're going to send military.

987
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:52,680
Rangers through your neighborhood at night with gas they're going to put the whole neighborhood to sleep they're going to come in and take you out of your bed and question you with sodium panthenol you know truth share.

988
01:39:52,680 --> 01:40:01,680
And if you're lying you're in big shit but they know if you're lying or not by your story and they want to know what did they look like the what did they tell you you know what they're you know whatever right.

989
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:06,680
So this is serious business I'm not this is not conspiracy this is fact what I'm telling you.

990
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:30,680
So this all ties into the Middle East Union because how many times the people that look at the Zacharias such and stuff well they say out of an unarchy or all this stuff it's basically ancient aliens if you want to get into it right yes that they do exist but they're part of the ecology and it's not like the Christians say they're all demons no they're not demonic beings are different than cosmic ecology because right.

991
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:53,680
So all of this stuff is going to start coming to ahead in other words people are going to be looking more to the skies but not you know for time keeping or worthwhile things but for these things and there'll be signs in the skies regarding this you know you've had the phoenix lights and other places in New Mexico City or 20,000 people saw you have full hovering for eight hours right.

992
01:40:53,680 --> 01:41:22,680
You're going to see more and more and more of that you're going to also have to learn how to keep time because time doesn't work the way CNN or the government or the church tells you all major events happen in the spring summer and fall in the spring when something major happens it's a building a period when the summer happens it happens in the summer it's a growing period and in the fall it's a breaking down period.

993
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:51,680
Like for example 9/11 happens in the fall it's a breakdown the idea that you live in a free country and everything that was in the past no longer exists now you're in danger right from an unknown enemy that doesn't really exist right what happens then they went to Iraq and started the war they went to Afghanistan sooner but in the spring time was shocking off you see and that started that whole thing now for 20 years so again and I think the first Iraq war they did it.

994
01:41:51,680 --> 01:42:20,680
The first Iraq war they did in January February something the winter time is a transition time okay so basically right now it's winter you see this thing with Iraq in the US I mean the event in Iraq with Iran in the US and it's the middle of winter now it's not a big event if it happened in the spring it would have escalated if it happened in the fall it would have really escalated to the point where the US but here's one way to analyze this Chuck and why I'm not impressed by what is in the news.

995
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:49,680
This is the base that I use let's say you saw the news from the past month and it was what they call August September right they killed everything that just went on the in other words the protests in the Iraq in Iraq at the US embassy is really when all I started right you're aware of that about a more than a month or two now right some more day yeah and it led to this what we see now including a remember even after 9/11

996
01:42:49,680 --> 01:43:18,680
a week or two later they shot down two liners airliners again right you know you remember that I think there was a couple of different problems where they crashed one of them crashed right in New York I think I'll go away peach yeah okay yeah I was going to I was going to go back that days that's the exact spot almost like maybe like a mile from where it crashed to visit but but they said it wasn't a missile and then a token booth camera you know

997
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:32,680
you have a token when you press the marine marine marine park parkway they said oh that token booth had a little black and white camera that had the missile being shot and hitting the airplane by the way that's used to be on the Internet I don't know if it's on anymore so

998
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:46,680
the strange thing that happened the next day in New Jersey is that the lottery number came out for the pick three for both the night and the day exactly the flight number of that plane which was really kind of odd because people that normally would win you know 50,

999
01:43:46,680 --> 01:43:55,680
$60, $100 on a box bet we're getting like two bucks because so many people played the number it was hilarious to watch people get angry about it but go ahead.

1000
01:43:55,680 --> 01:44:05,680
That's that's that stuff that's very makes for good son X maybe in the few years maybe for still around I'll do something about how all that stuff works right.

1001
01:44:05,680 --> 01:44:24,680
And how to manipulate it in your favor or your friends favor your family's favor but okay so they commemorated this event with an airplane crash if you noticed right also so my point here is this if all this would have happened in what they call September right now you wouldn't be we wouldn't be

1002
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:41,680
we wouldn't be having this conversation it would be escalating and escalating it would be in the news five times a day and there'd be major major international movements because it would be breaking down the entire presence of the US in the Middle East but because it happened in the winter which is transition it's just transition it makes sense.

1003
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:51,680
What I mean by all this time so in other words you notice how I look at when things are happening overrides what is happening you notice.

1004
01:44:51,680 --> 01:45:17,680
So what I'm trying to say is if the same chain of events from the Iraq embassy protest to the murder you know the all the way to the plain being shot on happen in September the shit would have really hit the fan to the point word of broken one or two of the blades off right right but the same exact stuff but because it happened now cosmically it's not that important but it is part of the transition and which reminds me.

1005
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:36,680
Humans are agriculture I've told us the people professors and they say no I techies know I said look okay you don't think we're agriculture lock you in this office in your cubicle and give me your cotton blue jeans because they're cotton agriculture and give me your wool sweater and you're going to get no food no grain products no meat products.

1006
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:46,680
How long are you going to be in your office be as a programmer three days before you start crying your agriculture like it or not an agriculture what are you doing the spring.

1007
01:45:46,680 --> 01:46:08,680
You plan what you do in the summer what you have summer harvest and you it's your main growth you hoping for rains you don't you right you your main growth takes place in the summer what happens in the fall your harvest harvest again you go out and take everything right what happens in the winter well you have your winter rye have a couple of minor winter crops you have root vegetables

1008
01:46:08,680 --> 01:46:37,680
vegetables things like that when the winter is when you put a new roof on you you you go travel you can travel because you don't have to be on the farm right well and you should have had your food stored up during your story up right you in other words you're not planting on story you've actually stored right you see so okay and now here comes spring spring also is you're going to plow you're going to prepare right and you have to plant just at the right time because if you plant too soon it won't grow if you plant too late it'll be too young.

1009
01:46:37,680 --> 01:47:06,680
It'll be too young and tender for the hot summer sun you lose your crop so simmer spring is very critical what happens in the spring the fall is your harvest it's what you take in it's a breaking down period you know you drive through the country right before like the end of summer you see all the grass all the corn is up in the everything the forms of people what happens when you drive through farmland at the end of September October everything looks like ripped to shreds right right real ugly means torn down and gone so this is how I see it and

1010
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:35,680
and link let's just go back and just do a thought experiment for a while like when the twin towers came down if that happened in the mid summer or in the winter would have been no big deal okay you know buildings fell down we'll get these terrorists but because it happened in the fall it aligns with the tearing down period of all social you see I wouldn't say would it be no big deal at all but it would not have had the cosmic effect that it did at the time that it did

1011
01:47:35,680 --> 01:48:03,680
well I literally feel as though because it happened when it did it it it shifted the reality a bit I I literally discern a marker there in time that there is a post and pre-9/11 reality because it affected the whole world you know everyone went into the security thing and here's the thing you have to be vigilant and discerning back in the eighties I did some technical work and there was an engineering firm

1012
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:14,100
and I told them that I ride my bicycle at the World Trade Center at night because I like jumping the park benches and all this other stuff that they have there in the center and he said to me don't go near the World

1013
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:26,880
Trend said trade center they have nukes there this is back in 86 87 and like this crazy old man maybe the new cuz the cuz he told you the nuclear core looks like a bowling ball they had this big round bronze I was like oh maybe that's where the

1014
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:35,720
new cuz I didn't know right so and then in the late 90s I read in some people say hey Greek has your credit score I'm like what do you mean what is

1015
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:42,880
what I care about my credit score it's bullshit and he says well because you have to have a good credit score we're gonna have a security based economy

1016
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:50,880
and in order to do well in it you have to have a good credit score a couple people told me that I'm like what the hell is he talking about

1017
01:48:50,880 --> 01:49:03,880
and then later on after you like holy shit I was told about everything in the coming world you see what I'm saying yeah but I didn't know what it meant you know I remember the only rich guy I encountered really in the 90s kind of told me this

1018
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:15,880
about credit scores and I just kind of you know fluffed it off because it wasn't you know yeah there was some places where you could find something reminiscent of it but it's not like it is now

1019
01:49:15,880 --> 01:49:27,880
right because they want to do well here's a thing years ago you're able to get a checking account closed take all the money out of the bank right a check for 50 grand and go buy a warehouse of tires and you get it yeah

1020
01:49:27,880 --> 01:49:37,880
and then like a month later the attorney says well you know is a bad check oh I'm sorry that was a bad check give me back the checks I could write you a good one they can't because they already monetize your signature

1021
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:47,880
see now you can't do that anymore because you know there is no money when you write a check for me checking account and you see the money let's say you write a hundred bucks and the hundred bucks is

1022
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:57,880
debited from your account it didn't that hundred bucks ever if you got didn't go to pay for anything it was the signature on the other end that paid for it your own bank takes the hundred dollars on keeps it for themselves

1023
01:49:57,880 --> 01:50:06,880
I mean the level of fraud and theft that is going on in just every day banking is so beyond people's imagination because they can't don't want to think about it so horrific that it is

1024
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:35,880
if they look at the fraud that's going even if you got two hundred bucks in the bank account you're being defrauded when you see it being lowered your own bank is taking it it's happening everywhere on the world with such prolific so prolific that people cannot imagine that everyone they're getting away with it with nearly everyone right you see so now with digital money by the way if you go on the cell phone and you want you can't do that you want to go buy 50 thousand you know worth the tires you punch in sorry you can't do it you see

1025
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:41,120
You see, so the digital stuff has nothing to do, electronic

1026
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:42,700
was nothing to do with convenience.

1027
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:46,120
It has to do with boxing you in between the years.

1028
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:50,000
Well, see, these are the greater limitations that are brought about.

1029
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,480
And, you know those that think Bitcoin is some sort of savior, it's like, what is

1030
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:57,640
the difference, it's another digital representation of value?

1031
01:50:57,640 --> 01:50:59,700
It's, it's not lawful money.

1032
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:02,880
Yeah, right, well it's not even a lawful representation.

1033
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:04,240
No, not even remotely.

1034
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:10,440
So anyway, you know what we're coming close to the end here and unfortunately, I mean like I love talking you over time

1035
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:11,620
But I got a producer

1036
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:15,600
That's no right after that. Let's let's do it. And thanks for having me on us

1037
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:17,120
See again, I wish I had a

1038
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:23,320
Lissipius joke to tell you but we're at a time so well quality not entirely. We got a couple of minutes

1039
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:31,000
I was just warning you then you know, you know me. I do things gradually man. Yeah, that's right

1040
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
I don't just to put like aren't you done?

1041
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:43,840
So anyway, I hope people got something out of ideology more than anything else in other words be why do you think what you think?

1042
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:48,720
Why you see not that you whether you can think or not which is rare anyway

1043
01:51:48,720 --> 01:51:50,960
It's why do you think what you think?

1044
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:57,360
Well, see that's what I want people to do more than anything is understand why it is they are

1045
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:04,520
Faulting to their positions why it is they have these belief systems not necessarily question their belief systems

1046
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:08,160
But question why it is they have them in the first place?

1047
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:11,760
because they are usually foundationally

1048
01:52:11,760 --> 01:52:14,440
corrupt such a degree

1049
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:19,000
That if they understood actually what their beliefs are based on

1050
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:24,480
You know, they wake up tomorrow and just decide they don't believe anything at all

1051
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:28,920
You know, well, you know what what they they don't believe in it what they okay?

1052
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:34,720
What they think believe they believe in whether it's religious medical scientific doesn't exist. It's all fiction

1053
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:40,680
Yeah, it's all fiction. That's why I say when I die I want this body that donated to science fiction

1054
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:45,040
So anyway, no fair enough look

1055
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:49,840
I'm not concerned with where it goes because it is just a container and do we think about you know

1056
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:54,000
The container we got our salad in from Walmart probably not you know

1057
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:59,040
Just a whole here's here's the thing and it's it's it's it's be wasteful

1058
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:04,220
It's gonna be converted to food because let me just before we go off throw this out there

1059
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:08,960
Chuck you didn't know me before I you know, I was tell years ago

1060
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:12,920
I was talking about what they call the gay or transgender way before it started

1061
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:18,600
I talked before about the tattoos being normalized in society and if you've heard me also talk about

1062
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:23,960
Cannibalism being normalized in society. I think you've right be aware of that because when the

1063
01:53:23,960 --> 01:53:28,840
next few years the next thing they're gonna put on society is you have the right and free will and

1064
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:32,120
environmentally conscious to eat human flesh and

1065
01:53:32,120 --> 01:53:37,720
It's going and you know Greek that's never gonna happen just like transgender bathrooms never gonna happen

1066
01:53:37,720 --> 01:53:43,960
Yeah, right you're gonna be right now Pepsi Cola, Frito, Lay and a handful of companies are using what's called fetal

1067
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:48,640
fetal liver tissue that they get from abortions in their food flavoring and

1068
01:53:50,200 --> 01:53:56,820
There's been more than one occurrence where people have sampled meats from various fast fast food restaurants and found human

1069
01:53:56,820 --> 01:54:00,000
Flesh in there and if you have a taste for pork

1070
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:05,000
You have a taste for human flesh and you're probably being fed homeless people at Walmart anyway

1071
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,860
Well, and the other thing is look for that agenda if you're going vegan

1072
01:54:08,860 --> 01:54:11,520
You better stay away from corn because you know

1073
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:17,240
We already have seen the patents for them introducing human genetic material into corn

1074
01:54:17,520 --> 01:54:23,960
Thank you very much. Oh, but the cannibalism talking about direct cannibalism. Oh, I know what you're talking about

1075
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:31,520
But kind that they have at Hollywood parties and political parties see but but aren't we already talking about the precursor to the precursor again?

1076
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:35,000
Right, but again and to finish up to finish up

1077
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:40,880
I have some of these code and co-conservative patriotist and types of Greek man. Aren't you outraged?

1078
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:46,480
With all these you know almost sexuals and gaze and all that being you know and let it society now they have privileges

1079
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:48,480
is it no no no

1080
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:56,120
People are too trusting when the state you know the sovereign state which is a corporation says you have rights and they start bringing in all this stuff with a

1081
01:54:56,120 --> 01:55:03,840
transgender and the gaze and all that and eventually the cannibalism people think this is going to change the future society forever nope

1082
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:12,240
Because what one thing that I've discussed with you also chuck of people go back to the archives is the whole society after 2025 is going to go

1083
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:17,880
Under a very strict political and judicial flip meaning

1084
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:23,520
In short, I'm not upset at all the you know, I'm an old testament kind of guy

1085
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:27,520
So all the gender bending and all the stuff that they're putting out there. I'm not upset that you know why?

1086
01:55:27,520 --> 01:55:34,720
Because all those people that are coming out are being put on lists. You don't think so of course they are they got your picture and

1087
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:45,480
And when this thing flips and now it's unlawful to do that and you get the the chop you know above the neck for it or whatever

1088
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:51,020
Guess what it's not going to be hard to find these people and we're talking a very big chunk of the population

1089
01:55:51,020 --> 01:55:57,920
You know comparatively is going to be overtly known and this is and I'm not saying I'm gonna do this or anyone

1090
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:01,200
This is how the system is going to go no you're right and

1091
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:07,520
Unfortunately, that's going to be the last word on this but again, yeah if you go to a celly in the Greek on YouTube

1092
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:15,760
It's still there and also on my website the section called a celly in the Greek but you can hear a lot of this stuff that

1093
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:17,840
Greek was mentioning

1094
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:22,320
During the show that we discussed at length years ago already

1095
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:23,840
but

1096
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:30,280
Anyway, man, thanks a lot for doing this with me. I really appreciate it and we're gonna have to make it a little sooner when you come back again

1097
01:56:30,280 --> 01:56:36,140
Okay, all right no problem take care man. Absolutely anyway no matter who you are where you are remember this

1098
01:56:36,140 --> 01:56:40,960
