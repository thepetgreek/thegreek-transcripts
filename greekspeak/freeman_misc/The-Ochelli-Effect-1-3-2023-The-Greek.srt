Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss Miss

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And now, the most integrated voice is on media check or Shelley.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
January 3, 2023, allegedly.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
According to that thing, we call a calendar and this indeed is the show you were looking

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
for.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
How do I know this?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Because you're hearing me say what I'm saying.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to be testing out my audio here as I go live, my mic is a little hot, so I'm going to bring it down a touch.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
See what we can do there.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But this is an interesting tears day or Tuesday and the first broadcast of the alleged year.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Although, again, alleged is it actually the year?

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Does anybody know how to tell time?

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Does this sound familiar to you?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If it does, you might have heard a show called Ocele in the Greek.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You might have heard Greek speak before in other places.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And you might say to yourself, "What is he talking about if you haven't?"

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I got the Greek with me tonight and I'll tell you, we did this little thing called Ocele in the Greek.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And recently, I've had a bunch of people looking for it because I had my YouTube channel taken away.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And somebody else who is posting and reposting some of those old shows apparently had their YouTube channel taken away.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And I don't think it's because of the Greek, but just so happens if you're trying to speak anything outside of the normal gibberish.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And you're going to try and communicate something that might be meaningful.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Tens to not make you very popular on the popular platforms.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Just saying.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But anyway, the Greek is with me and when we started Ocele in the Greek, I got to say,

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
"I started on the premise of, you know, Greek?"

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There was this issue I have where communication has gone bad.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And immediately what did we have to talk about? Well, cosmic censorship.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What does that mean?

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And by the way, I do have all the Ocele in the Greek stuff in the archive@ocele.com.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But it used to be out there in a lot of places that, "Well, it's kind of disappeared."

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So we're going to get it back out there somewhere sometime.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And I might make my entire archive available for sale at some point.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But until then, guess what? Let's get an update because that was, let me think now, almost eight years ago,

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:37,000
when you and I did that for the first time, because somebody made a suggestion that it might be a good idea for you and I to talk.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That was Danny Romero, credit where credit is deserved.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh really? When did you speak to Danny last? Tell him to say hello?

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh, I haven't spoken to Danny in years, but back in 2015, I think it was.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He said, "You know, there's this guy, and I'd not heard you before."

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And he said, "There's this guy, and he's starting to tell me some of the things you said."

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And I said, "Oh, that sounds like interesting, new, and relevant information. Let's get to it."

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I mean, that's usually my attitude. But anyway.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Well, Danny just a little blast from the past. Hello, hello everyone, by the way.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Rainy Eastwood was going on, he was, I still around, I think, somehow, around or whatever shape you want to call him.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
And he was going on a one month hiatus, and Danny said that I want to do it for a month.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They said, "Oh, no, it's no reason. I don't even mention it."

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And I just didn't basically talk in politics and things like that.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So, a couple of weeks went by, and I said, "Wait a second. Let me see what asshole took over that role."

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So, I checked it, and I hear you, and I said, "Wow, this guy's got a pretty good voice, more of a dominant tone that you normally hear on the alternative scene."

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So, I reached out to you, and I said, "Hey, you know, I was supposed to do that job."

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And then we got the talking, and Danny said, "Well, you two guys do something, and there we are.

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And here we are."

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Right, and then after that, you had an uncommon radio with Seth, and you know, a complaint came to me recently that there was an archive that contained Oceleon the Greek, uncommon radio, and some other show, I guess you were doing, where you were putting out, you know, effectively.

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
No shows, totally, hold on, I don't do shows.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Excuse me, that's for other people. Yeah, do sonic events.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Sonic events, thank you.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I forget my Greek speak a little bit, because you were... That's fine, that's fine. There's a clear distinction, it's beyond definition.

58
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You know, definitions in the way we use words has an effect on the mind, right?

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's also like a filter.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's also a form of coding.

61
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's a form of basic overall criteria under the category you mentioned earlier, communication.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I want to get in all that, maybe, when we start rolling into this, because I don't think I've explained the filter and other things and the effects on the mind, but it's in the code.

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So maybe get into it.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No, no.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Go ahead, you're giving a little history there, which is good.

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And you know, this is planet Earth, right?

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So if you've been here for more than 15 minutes, you should know what's going on, it's not that complicated, right?

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No, absolutely true. And I think we started to disturb people with terms like the dummy load and stuff like that, but again, people...

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, disturbing the disturbed, you mean?

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Of course.

71
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Anyway, go ahead.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Well, you would take that term, and they would take it to be offensive immediately without actually listening to what it is you were talking about, which is what?

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Part of the course, normal, I guess, here on planet Earth, because no matter what you communicate and sadly, I'm coming to this conclusion lately, and I've been related to you that after, you know, a decade, basically of doing this, pretty much nonstop, I'm starting to feel like, you know, I'm not reaching those that I use to reach.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You're giving it away. In other words, I would take any criticism on this comment I'm about to make, but in other words, this is the criticism that we might get.

75
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Every O-chelly, O-N-G, let's call it O-N-G, episode that we did, every Sonic event about two hours, was sort of topical, not really, you know, but yeah, I had a topic.

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:41,000
And whatever topic we covered in those two hours gave you more usable information than a four-year college degree on that subject.

77
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
So if you're dropping, you know, all college degrees are BS, by the way.

78
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Get it?

79
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Of course.

80
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So, you know, you're giving it away and it can't be worth much, but those, look, 1,000th of 1% of the people out there are really people.

81
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I think we talked about it.

82
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The rest of them are products of each age that they're living in, you know, like, well, we went through the industrial age, space age, technology, information age.

83
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's what I mean by age, each generation.

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And when you take into account that most people are basically as seen on TV people, if in other words, when you, when they engage with others or socially, their responses and the thought patterns are based on what they've seen on television, right?

85
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Okay.

86
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So you're looking at this particular slice of humanity that's been affected, corrupted, however you want to say, each generation.

87
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And by the way, you can have someone who's 50 or 60 years old that's got two or three of those, you know, grew up with TV in the 60s, then the 70s, 80s, 90s.

88
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And then now, and it's got four slices in there.

89
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But, you know, so it's, it's pretty, it's not very good.

90
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But we do have a lot more freedom.

91
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The one thing that I wanted to also impart with, without saying it, and they'll say it now is that we are a hell of a lot more free than we're told that we are.

92
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Right? And one of the, one of the proofs of that is the O&G episodes and how long they'll erupt on that disgusting YouTube platform.

93
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And I've said earlier, by the way, years ago, I will never do a YouTube.

94
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Or, you know, so if it's, many of my stuff, the sonic event shows up on YouTube, it's not because I put it up, right?

95
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Right.

96
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And I've kept to its all this day.

97
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And I've seen a lot of people prosper financially and popularity with it and more power to them.

98
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No, look, and I never prospered from it financially because I just put it out there, right?

99
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You got to run with the scissors.

100
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah, I mean, I may have run with the scissors.

101
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You got to be reckless in other words, you know, you're not going to do well in these plot, in these mainstream platforms.

102
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You know what I mean?

103
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We'll talk about that, maybe some other time.

104
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But, recklessness, reckless, but not abandoned.

105
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
So, abandonment with the, recklessness without abandonment.

106
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
In other words, you have to take responsibility for your recklessness.

107
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Kind of like the Alex Jones guy.

108
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah, and you also got to make sure that, look, you're actually paid and protected by somebody whose interests are met by you doing what you do.

109
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's always helpful.

110
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
And unfortunately, I'm independent, so.

111
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah, but we all are protected.

112
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's the other thing.

113
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
We all operate, I mean, non-material.

114
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
See, now we're getting deep already.

115
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And by the way, just in my chat room, they have asked actually what day it is.

116
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And it's funny because I answered a chatter answered.

117
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And meanwhile, we didn't answer with the correct day.

118
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So, well, it's not, look, there's no look.

119
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Here's the thing, there is no truth.

120
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's all subjective because when you're dead, what's true and that doesn't matter, right?

121
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So, when you're alive, you can't prove that you're alive other than moving around like a fish and whatever out of water sometimes.

122
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But it's a matter of, if everything is subjective and there is no truth as one would say, right?

123
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Because people lay down their lives for going to war thinking that why they're going to war is the truth and it's obviously false, right?

124
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So, if you have people laying their lives down for lies, what would someone do for the truth?

125
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So, you know, anyway, what I'm trying to say here is very simple.

126
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And we can't prove objectively what's absolutely true or real.

127
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But we can actually approach more than subjective and mostly objective show qualitative differences.

128
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This is a higher quality than this is, right?

129
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So, you know, even people who are not well cultured or exposed to much, you give them something that's a piece of junk and the same thing that's a fine manufacturer they could tell the difference, right?

130
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Even the most dim, dim width, half, you know, half width.

131
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So, would notice that. So, what the Greek speak, Sonic events are about, is a qualitative influence, giving the people listening the perceptible choice to make a better quality decisions.

132
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So, in terms of time, okay, if you're on the Pope's work schedule and the wind up to, well, known as the clock or digital part, whatever, however you want to express that,

133
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:59,000
nothing else in your reality other than some loose social format of, you know, the Pope's work schedule, like when you go to work and when you do certain things and meetings, nothing works on that, nothing in nature, not even the weather, the bugs, the bees, the animals, nothing works on that at all, right?

134
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So, if nothing in the natural world that pertains to your well-being, by the way, works on that, wouldn't you want to find out what does, and that's why you would probably consider what I call lawful timekeeping, and that's what lawful just means.

135
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Well, lawful also has a little something to do with logic, because let's just objectively face this fact, your day according to the normal convention, right, about when the day begins and ends, wherever you are, it begins in the midst of the darkest time of the day.

136
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So, your day doesn't begin with a marker like say when the light arrives, right? Well, it's just, okay, hold on, this is, this is again going to what we were saying earlier, going deep.

137
00:12:47,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You hear about ancient texts speak, I'm not just the Buddhist Daku or anything like that, you know, meaning the despair, not just that, but ancient texts talking about being in the light and being in the dark, right?

138
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay, that's not physical, just physical, it's also where things are sourced from. So, you know, you've heard me say this before, I'll recap real quick. In ancient societies, most ancient societies, everything that you did used and based your life on was sourced in the light.

139
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:31,000
All the materials you're used were garnered from plants, plant dies, resins, things that grew in the light, you know, animal skins, right?

140
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If you did any mining, it was usually surface stuff or on a natural cave, you didn't blast the side of a mountain in half, right?

141
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Okay, your oil was gotten from things formed in the light. Your timekeeping was in the light. So, the day started at high noon, the new moon was the full moon, right?

142
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The beginning of the year is when the, you know, everything equalized in the end of the year is when everything equalized again, kind of like a racetrack.

143
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So, if you look at what's going on now with this society, everything that you've come in touch with materially has some form of petroleum product in it, right?

144
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Think about it. No, pretty much everything around you, if you just, even if you ran out into the street naked, guess what you're standing on? Ass fault, right?

145
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Okay, so where's petroleum formed, right? In the dark and the light destroys it, right?

146
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:42,000
True enough. Breaks it down. When do you start your day in the dark? When do you start your year in the dark, very dark society?

147
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Right. See? So, no, I'm not going to give what day it is. No, I'm not, because that should have been established already by more than just me on even the ones listening here. I'm not trying to be an ass here.

148
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Maybe it should be researched a little bit further and find out what you think should be not you chucked, but whoever is asking or listening to this, what is lawful timekeeping?

149
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And by the way, what I just mentioned lawful timekeeping is mentioned in every astronomy 101 class in college, by the way. They do go, they do go into that.

150
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's only five minutes for the entire four years of college, but it's, you know, how much time does it, right? You don't need to, right?

151
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So, spend much time on it, because it's not important. And as usual, it's, you know, what do they spend time with? Usually what is legal as opposed to what is lawful?

152
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Right. That's what is commercial. Yes. Legal is commercial. Right. Like I always, I've been speaking well, when I ran into people out in public and I know a conversation is going to ensue.

153
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I say, well, how long have been on earth for? And if they don't understand the question or don't give me a positive response, I know I'm dealing with a moron, which is, I'm saying that affectionately. Right.

154
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So, if you, you're right. So, so now you have to go into that mode, which is different than a mode when you're teaching a child. Right.

155
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's, it's a, in other words, it's kind of like when you open a toolbox and, and you see there's only a screwdriver there.

156
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Well, it's going, that screwdriver is going to have to become multi-use now, right?

157
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:34,000
No, right. You'll have to want it. Because you only have one tool. You can't, now if you open the toolbox and there's a hundred tools in there, well, you'll see you've got a big screwdriver, a small screwdriver, you know, for a big screw, a small screw, you got to, right?

158
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But if you only have a butter knife or a screwdriver, well, you're going to have to use that for everything, you know, you could use the back of a screwdriver to make a small hammer, right? To tap something down.

159
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yeah, where if you had a hammer, you wouldn't do that. So, so, you know, once you start dealing with these typical surface dwelling earth and habitat, by the way, that's another part of Greek speak, right?

160
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yes. Well, so, calling them people is actually more than most deserved. But anyway, and I'm saying all these things affectionately.

161
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And from a higher perspective, not that I'm higher, but from a higher vantage point, right? So, you know, I've given that idea of wasting time, you know, when you're on the ground, and a four hour parade is passing by, you have to spend four hours looking at it to figure out, you know, jot down what everything you saw.

162
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:38,000
But if you're in a helicopter, you know, a thousand feet up, you could see the whole parade, and you could quickly write down everything that's down there, come back down, right?

163
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:47,000
And spend the other three and a half, three hours and 50 minutes doing something else. That's also the purpose of Greek speak to give a higher vantage point.

164
00:17:47,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It saves a lot of time. So, anyway, back to the meeting people, how long have you been on earth? Because I just mentioned earlier, you've been on earth more than 15 minutes, you know what's going on here, right?

165
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I mean, that's kind of facetious, but typically, you know, if you're talking to a species where their eight-year-olds are exceed the educational capacity of someone with five PhDs on earth, they would get it right away.

166
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:36,000
In other words, they would know based on what's called a travel guide, or in the military it's called a, it's called a, not a yellow book, it's called a, there's a book for it. In other words, when they're sending someone in the military to a foreign country, they give them a book with all the cultures and laws.

167
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So, when they go there, they don't create an offense, right? International incident or something, an area book, it's called.

168
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So, the other book for the earth and the travel guide is very, very simple. Don't talk to any of the surface-twelling earth inhabitants simply because anything you say will confuse the shit out of them.

169
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Right? And that's from a higher quality perspective, you know, if you're a quality, you know, based-minded being.

170
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So, it's pretty sad, but then again, you only got to put up with it for what? 50 years, 60, 70, 80, 90, well, you're thinking, you're going to live to 120 more power to you.

171
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That's all you got. You don't have to put up with it for too long.

172
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:31,000
No, fair enough. And I mean, look, I try to do certain things regarding this. And the communication issue that, again, I started with was,

173
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:43,000
well, it's interesting because you attempt to adapt to the language of the natives, which is a fair and good thing to do so that you might be able to communicate with them, right?

174
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Stop me where I'm wrong. But when you do that, it's fascinating to me that even when you make the best effort to comprehend their language and use it so that you can communicate ideas to them.

175
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Quite often, it becomes a fruitless thing because even though you properly communicated an idea, it simply doesn't seem to be received.

176
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:18,000
They can't handle that. They're bread, they're bread on ideologies, narratives, and opinion.

177
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Right. Ideas don't work with these beings here. Very rare. And here's, okay, I mean, some people might be scratching their heads. Why is this guy so bitter about this?

178
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Okay. Look, if you feel like you've partitioned yourself enough to go along with what I'm saying, you're not going to meet anyone else like yourself.

179
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You're spread out. Right. The reason why this is done cosmically is because if you get like five or six or ten people that are mostly on the ball, the what's going on and how to operate lawfully, you know what's going to happen, right?

180
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's it's going to create a rupt, you know, too much of a focus. It'd be no different than if you know a 300 foot diameter shiny mirror finished UFO landed in Walmart parking lot.

181
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Right. It'd be no different than this. Like if you had a spiritually evolved being, I'm not saying I'm spiritually evolved, but I'm saying if my pursuits tend to be spiritually involved, I pursue those things evolved.

182
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:38,000
If you had a spiritually evolved being and you put him in the middle of the super bowl half time field, I assure you about one third to one half of the people would want to come down off the stands and beat that person to a pulp.

183
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And if you ask them, why do you want to do that? They say, I don't know. I just feed. I just I hate this guy. I don't kind of, you know, I just got to do it. You see.

184
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:58,000
So here they tell you go to college and get an educate. There's no education in college zero at all. And if you think there is you need to do a little mental floss will clean up and wash your brain a little bit.

185
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I know. Yeah. At all. There's no educate whatsoever. Very easy. Just look at their curriculums and textbooks.

186
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What they're doing there is it's a right of passage just just as for example, certain countries, it's the mandatory military right you're 18, whatever you got to do a year and a half right in the military or whatever.

187
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's a right of passage in certain tribal cultures. You had to go out and slay your first, you know, whatever animal, right.

188
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Not until you did that, you were not considered a man or a viable member of society. That's all it is. And to prove that is whenever you have any kind of a cultural medium film TV books stories put out.

189
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The intellectuals are always shunned. They're called eggheads and the eggheads came from Germany in the 1930s when they were going after the intellectuals and they would go beat them up and the guys of the fucks would come back.

190
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,000
They had to go. I said, oh, they're like eggheads when you throw them on the sidewalk. Their head cracks open like an egg, right. That's where it comes from.

191
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Well, you had revenge of the nerds, right. They always portrayed as a nerd even today. A geek or a nerd, right. Bad, you know, that never gets the girl always gets beat up doesn't do anything, right.

192
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So they're all so the intellectuals, by the way. Again, I'm not saying that I'm part of that is just a, you know, observation.

193
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You live in a society where people who want to advance themselves cognitively mentally and selectively are shunned and viewed as negative.

194
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:39,000
But on the other hand, you have higher learning institutions. Yeah, right. Sure you do. You see how it works. It's very, very simple.

195
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So anyway, let's let's go on. What the communication part? Well, you don't mind. I find that part fascinating because, right, I do not possess any of these degrees.

196
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And on occasion, I attempt and I must say attempt because it has varying degrees of success.

197
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I attempt to communicate certain things, which are scientific, which are about, you know, the preservation of actual pieces of history.

198
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,000
And I communicate these things and quite often, regardless of the quality of the presentation, the information, it's got nothing to do with me.

199
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:28,000
But I mean, the actual information, the documentation, whatever, it becomes irrelevant because why I don't have one of these degrees.

200
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I don't have the permission slip from the degree. It's more of a right of passage like someone who killed the biggest lion.

201
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:50,000
He could be a total, you know, whatever halfway, right? And he's regarded for the rest of his life as, you know, the lion slayer, right, because he slayed the biggest lion or whatever, the giant slayer or whatever, right, caught the biggest bug.

202
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Right? So it's just a right of passage. That's all. But anyway, maybe I lean too heavy on the higher education part, but it says nothing that there is no, you live in a society. This society is completely fake, meaning that people have no sense of origin.

203
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Their history is completely fake. Their money is fake. You know, it's based on credit, which is not money.

204
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Their religions are all fake. Their philosophies are twisted and turned. Most of the medical technologies and medical industry is fake.

205
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I think we've gone over that. And by the way, I think we did the second one we did was called a container. And then I included in many other sonic events.

206
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:59,000
If you've listened to a cell in the Greek, you've been forewarned about what's been going on for the past two years and what's really going on. And by the way, what, even though it didn't maybe seem like it was relevant, what's going to be, what's starting to happen in the past, let's say, month or two and going to continue for the next year is really going to validate it even more, meaning all the fakery, right?

207
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:13,000
But it's not going to be enough because there is no blood pressure. The pump doesn't, the blood, the heart is not a pump, right? You don't absorb anything through your intestines or your skin, the way that you, the brain, all these things.

208
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:28,000
So that won't happen until the next society is formed, which is not going to be for a while because when the mop-up crew comes here, you're going to have anywhere between four, well, it's going to be a 40-year period, a 70-year period, a 100-year period.

209
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:38,000
A 70-year period, a 120-year period of dark ages kind of thing. So enjoy yourself right now while you still got it.

210
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And what's interesting about time and the time in which we find ourselves currently is that it is a bit different from that, you know, again, using the conveyance of the, you know, the communicate, the communicative tool of the calendar, right?

211
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:07,000
In the 2015 time period is different than it is now. And I note the change in communication where it's become in some ways, it's become a little easier to communicate.

212
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:14,000
And in other ways, it's become even more difficult, even more distortion, even more of a disconnect.

213
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And it's more of a lot of the attempts, as I said before, to try and utilize the language of the natives, right? Their, you know, conventions even, you try and communicate. And it is still a problem.

214
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Well, it's a different way.

215
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I see it that way, sorry, because when you're dealing with the natives, it should have purpose.

216
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Even if you're going out there to find a wife or a husband or something intimate, it still should have purpose to it.

217
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:50,000
And I've given this before example. I'm going to acquaintance somebody that considers himself a friend to the Greek calls and he says, "Oh, I want to come by."

218
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:57,000
He's on a cell phone driving around. And it's not too far away from you. I said, "Why do you want to come by?" He goes, "I want to say hello."

219
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I said, "Well, you just did on the phone."

220
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Right.

221
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So let's have some more purpose. Here's an example. If you say, "I already, yes, I already did say hello, but I want to come by and give you a hug so you feel loved."

222
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Yeah, I'll take that. I'll take that. There's no substitute for that.

223
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And there's a purpose which actually requires physical presence as opposed to what they just did, which is like just said a little.

224
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Over the bone.

225
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Right. So in other words, develop the purpose first, right?

226
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And then execute it. And it's like that with anything. And once you understand this, you can pretty much do anything here, but then you have to again do it with purpose.

227
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Anything can be accomplished to a certain degree.

228
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I always have discussions with people regarding business models. When they look at these billionaires or millionaires, I've met quite a few of the billionaires.

229
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:55,000
It would be, and they don't even know how they got there. Don't believe any of their stories. All that was predetermined.

230
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It is, it is a big conspiracy. Cosmic one and Earth-based one, but not on the surface, but what you see on the surface is all strings being pulled.

231
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Go ahead and try to start an Amazon or a Twitter or one of these cryptocurrencies, kleptocurrencies, I call them or whatever. It's not going to happen. All these stories are fake.

232
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Every single, there are no self-made people. It is all predetermined before birth, even both cosmically and physically.

233
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I can give many examples where people wanted to start a little UPS store or whatever. By the time they got up to their second or third business, the FBI crashed them.

234
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And after they crashed their business, they apologized. It's like, no, you're not allowed to do that. Go ahead and try to start an electric motor company on your own.

235
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:56,000
What is going to happen? All that stuff is all predetermined. It's already scripted. They just put whatever character up there.

236
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Cutting to a strange chase on that, one could say that what you're telling me is that the Calvinistic concept, that the only people that are successful have already been, now this gets a little touchy, but have already been determined by God to be blessed with that.

237
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:28,000
More than that. More meaning physical here. It's already been planned here by people that have been executing stuff on the planet. It is a conspiracy, but it's so big you can't see it.

238
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It's kind of like the flatter thing you live under a dome. Yeah, that's possible. If the dome is so big, you don't notice it, right?

239
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:50,000
The whole solar system could be inside of one of those little snow globes and you know, it's so big, right? It's beyond your ability to first of all cognitively grasp it. Second of all perceive it. Third of all, why does it matter?

240
00:30:50,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Like these things are all very, look, look, here's it's very much within that. There's no script. Like, you know, the little was a 13 year old high school girl more than a decade ago that showed all the presidents are related somehow.

241
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Right. Even though it's whatever, it's if even if it's not you see, so you see it's all related. All these figures and people. So when I say you can do pretty much anything, it's within the context of what we've laid out in the past 20 minutes.

242
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Well, right. And here's the thing. Like I was trying to get at the the African proverb with the elephant, I think is very, very relevant. And I bought this up to you before that, you know, if you're standing right on top of this thing, what is the elephant?

243
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:41,000
The elephant is this giant gray mass that really, you know, if you're right up against it, you're perceiving just the gray skin of said elephant. That's all it is.

244
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Well, you're the other thing. If you respectfully the more the better you get to know that elephant, he doesn't seem so big anymore. Well, that's the other thing is because you finesse that, you know, just like, for example, if you've ever gotten behind the wheel of a semi truck with a trailer fully loaded.

245
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:10,000
And, you know, but they're out there, you know, and try to drive around the block, you know, someone who's familiar with it, it's no big deal. But you have to do it respectfully. You know, you can't make a right hand turn on a single side street.

246
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:19,000
You'll take out the front fenders of two cars, right? So I've just tried to move one of those around on a lot and it's not not easy.

247
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:31,000
I mean, because I'm not accustomed to it at all. Right. So you get accustomed to these things and also you get accustomed to the madness, you know, once you understand it, but you cannot approach things. You have to do it respectfully.

248
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Same when you're dealing with the morns on this planet, the surface to all the earth and habits. You when you have a pretty good comprehension of them, you still have to respect it because they, you know, they're stupid people are dangerous, right?

249
00:32:45,000 --> 00:33:02,000
So they certainly are. Yeah. So again, it does, it goes by really, really as you get older, your perception of time goes by faster. I believe it actually does. It's kind of like a spiral, you know, when something's going down the drain as it gets towards the center, it goes faster and faster, right?

250
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So, you know, I'm in, I'm in my sixth decade, right? So I'm like, yeah, it's, I'm getting kind of tired of this stuff here, you know, this stupidity.

251
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And, but it doesn't stop me from still existing, you know, so, but I know that it's not going to be, you know, I'm not going to be around that long.

252
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Well, relatively speaking, a lot less time ahead of you than in front, you know, than, than behind you, so to speak, I'm, I hopefully, I'm more than three quarters of the way done with this, it is.

253
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Well, that's what I'm going to. I mean, I've completed five decades according to their regular reckoning on the calendar, but yeah, I'm in my sixth decade as well. You, you and I are pretty close in age.

254
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Yeah, so what I'm saying is it's, it just put up with it. It's not, it's not that bad, but it's, it's not good either. Like a lot of people always say to me, Greek, am I wrong?

255
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,000
I say, well, I don't think you're wrong, but you're definitely not right. Right? So that leaves it open.

256
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Well, that's another thing again, back to that elephant. Now somebody who says this thing is a giant gray thing. They're not wrong, but they're also not right because it's not just giant and gray.

257
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:19,000
There's a lot of things to do. If you give it a name and you know, it has its own personality, there you have one of it's just another surface throwing earth and happy.

258
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Well, true, but it's not, I mean, why do you think people love their pets so much? They call them their family when you get to know animals?

259
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:34,000
You know, it's like you might like to eat chicken, but if you're sort of like a heartfelt human and you raise chickens, they, you give them names. They come, they answer to their names.

260
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:41,000
They each have different personalities and you say, you know, after six months of raising chickens, you still want to eat chicken? They're like, "Oh, yeah, but not these guys."

261
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Well, I've got to handful of dogs, you know, in the house right now, right? And in some cultures, they'd certainly eat them.

262
00:34:49,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Yeah, when I see Vietnamese here, I ask them in Vietnamese, they say, "Uncomtac chau." Which means, "Do you eat dog meat?"

263
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And most of them, well, I had one of them, my wife being witnessed, she says, "Not here." So he didn't say no.

264
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
He just means not an American.

265
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Anybody get angry with that or?

266
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
A couple of times people just start laughing and they go, "No!" You know, especially the younger ones.

267
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
But I've said, "Uncomtac chau." And they say, "Not here."

268
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Well, say there you go, respecting the custom of the locals, right?

269
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I don't know if we have any Vietnamese speakers in the chat, but...

270
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I do not know. I don't think so, but either way.

271
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Well, let's just assume...

272
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Yeah, I tend to allow the Greek.

273
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
But anyway, the whole thing about communication is this, "Yeah, I'll give you a personal story."

274
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I was doing Skype groups anywhere from 30 to 40 people, after a couple of like two private calls.

275
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,000
And after about a couple of years, like, "You know, I'm not promoting this, I'm not doing a Patreon, I'm not..."

276
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
You know, I'm doing all this and like...

277
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I know all these people that I'm talking to, none of them can communicate.

278
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
It just got stagnant. I was like, and I started evaluating.

279
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And I was like, "Oh, the people that I'm attracting can't communicate this."

280
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
So it's kind of like pissing in a bucket or trying to lift yourself up and nothing it's not going to go anywhere.

281
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
You have to commercialize it based on the venue, right?

282
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
You get subscribers, you do membership, right?

283
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:30,000
So then you have something coming in, coming in, like what they call, you know, some intake every month on a regular basis that you could assign.

284
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So you could say, "Look, I got all these subscribers in Patreon, people signed up, getting so much every month, hey, you know, every month, I'm talking donations, donations don't work."

285
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,000
You know, on a format, a membership or whatever, and this can be assigned.

286
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:55,000
This could be assigned to a publisher, you know, where you have to compensate someone to do graphics, to buy equipment, to further this on, right?

287
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
And I didn't see anything going on, on its own, organically, naturally, right?

288
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
So I said, "All right, I'm stopping everything."

289
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,000
So I don't do any, you know, try to stay more like in a recluse type of thing.

290
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I don't... people... I still get emails you want to do an interview like, "No."

291
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
I said, "Why not?" I said, "You asked me if I want to." I said, "No, I don't."

292
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Well, what's the purpose of the interview, right? What's the... And not being a jerk, you know, I'll engage them, but I'll say, "No, I'm not going to go out and speak in public."

293
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I mean, that's why, you know, when we did the thing here, look, this is more like a loyal and hearty, abbot, and Castello thing, in a way, because we kept it light, right?

294
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
And it's kind of like an unlikely pair.

295
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You know, well, I'm likely, because I looked at your archives, and I don't mean to be pejorator or anything, but it's not anything, and nothing, none of the hosts, and none of the topics, or anything, I would ever click on.

296
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
The only, you know, but I have a history with you when we work all together.

297
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:04,000
So I wouldn't go around like, you know, when people ask me if you want to do an interview, I look at what hosts they've had, and what topics, and I'm like, "You got to be kidding me."

298
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:21,000
No, this is completely different. This is something that is on a different, it's, first of all, the Greek-speak stuff is extremely rarefied, but on the other hand, it's a pair, it's an anomaly, because I never speak on anything that's more than five feet beyond your reach.

299
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:30,000
In other words, you stick out your arm, that's like two and a half feet, or so two feet, depends if your knuckles drag on the ground, whatever, and how tall you are.

300
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Just a little bit beyond your reach, just half a step forward. You could probably grab a book, or a magazine, or see something, pull something out of your wallet, or look in the mirror, and everything that's encompassed in Greek-speak, from the dummy load all the way to the human body, and banking, and everything, but the gods, and the ancient text, is all, either you know something about it already, or slightly familiar, or have access to it without any specialized, doing any kind of specialized, let's just say, endeavor.

301
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:09,000
We have to buy anything, or seek something else. It's always about things that are in your reach, or you are, have been made aware of.

302
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:28,000
You've got to start there. And here's the other thing. All of these things that people talk about politically, with the medical stuff past few years, with the money stuff, or whatever, I've had the opportunity, one thing the gods have given me is a lot of access to people.

303
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:45,000
So when I want to study, let's say for example, the legal system, believe it or not, within a year and a half, I'm having that one lunch, or two lunches, with Supreme Court justices. I'm like, how the hell is this happen? How does this even happen?

304
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:59,000
John Fitzgerald Maloy, he's the guy who penned the Miranda rights. You know, you have the right to remain silent. That guy. He doesn't know anything about law. I'm serious.

305
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:14,000
So I'm studying how the police work. Before you know it, I got like five of them in my backyard because some of the incidents happen across the street, and they come over here to set up, and I make blueberry pancakes and cowboy coffee for them.

306
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And I'm just, they don't know anything about their job at all. So, and then the same with doctors. I'm like, I show them, hey, there's no blood pressure.

307
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:31,000
You know, there's no absorption. Look at this. Look at this. Yeah, I know, but you know, they don't acknowledge that. It's, I just do what they tell me to do.

308
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Right.

309
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,000
It's like, what the hell is going on? No one knows what the hell they're doing and why they're doing it.

310
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:52,000
So, so to me, those people that have taken the professional situations that I just mentioned are sellouts because any reasonable human will say,

311
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:01,000
well, I aspire to be a doctor and I go there and I don't learn anything about, you know, really what health is about. I think I should not, I should quit.

312
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And you know why? I'm saying this because there is a very high dropout rate and they say the high dropout rate in medical, education, let's say, for example, is a sign of how good or difficult it is. No.

313
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's a sign of only the same dropout and the insane and the idiots go in. Right. The same with the law, the same with all the fields. Right. Okay. So the religious especially.

314
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Okay. Political. There's no nutty of, that's just a show. Right.

315
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:39,000
So, it's all commercial, by the way. So, so I started thinking I said, look, we have a lot more freedom than we're told that we have.

316
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Serious. And you are free to do as long as, you know, you don't agitate the people around you pretty much, you know, I'm saying this in a positive way to improve as much as you'd like or can afford to or want to afford to.

317
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:06,000
And that is the purpose of saying what I'm saying here, given I'm bouncing all over the place here like a banana and a monkey grove.

318
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:21,000
The other day I was, I cook with firewood outside, right. I just like the way it tastes and I'm very serious about cooking. I mean, people driven hundreds and hundreds of miles so I can make them dinner. But anyway, I'm cleaning small branches off of a log.

319
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:34,000
So imagine a log about, you know, however, thick and it's leaning down on the ground and I'm shaving the brand. I'm holding it down on my left hand and I'm cutting the twigs off of it, right, with an axe. Very sharp axe.

320
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Well, the axe slides a little bit too far and goes into my left hand and slices my left thumb in a third almost in half from the bottom of the cuticle down to the palm split open.

321
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I'm like, oh, wow, look, I just split my thumb and it was kind of serious because my heart rate went up really. You know, almost like a slight shock.

322
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:09,000
I did the Greek speak thing which I've talked about and what to do, right. And this is about a week ago. It's still the muscles trying to grow back and all this up. But if I take the bandage off and send a photo, you'll say I barely see anything there.

323
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Barely, right. So most people, what would they do? I got to go to the emergency room.

324
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Stitches, neurosurgery, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, if you want use of your thumb, right. So you do the Greek speak thing in three days. It's pretty much healed.

325
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:35,000
And then about anywhere between 10 to 14 days, the muscle to shoot and all that will grow back. What is that worth?

326
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Right. By the way, I do have quite a catalog of people emailing, you know, my nine year old daughter, you know, the security doors. It's like, you know, this like a screen door, but it's made out of raw iron with a metal screen on the bottom. Sometimes they don't finish them. They're very sharp.

327
00:43:52,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Of nine year old girl closes it on her toe, cuts her big toe open. They did the same thing three days later. It's almost completely healed. No stitches. Right. So this is a concept of becoming self-sufficient, you know, how the body really works. You know, we're in a biological vacuum, right.

328
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:22,000
There's no absorption. There's no none of the stuff that they're talking about, right. You can it's we've proven that very easily just using their own stuff. So.

329
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So that's just an example and it goes on and on and on and on and on. Right. All the stuff you have access to. So the communication.

330
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:41,000
First of all, if you are highly skilled in these things that I that you hear on Greek speak, you're not going to meet either physically or sonically someone else who is also right.

331
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:49,000
That's that's that's a that's a promise actually written in an ancient ritz. You're spread like salt. He says.

332
00:44:49,000 --> 00:45:06,000
And let's say in the western scriptures, right says I spread you like salt. What does that mean? Well, what is salt used for flavor and we know it's in the context of flavor because you says if salt loses its flavor, it has no use. You throw it on the downhill, right. Right.

333
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So how do you salt your food? Do you spread it very thinly over so when you every bite you have one little grain or do you put a big lump in the middle and then when you put that lump in your mouth, what do you do?

334
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Oh, you're going to spit it out. Yeah. Right. So you're going to be spit out. So one aspect for this is this is extremely rare, if I had information because it's so practical and true.

335
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,000
The true to the individuals that know how to use it. It's not true if you don't know how to use it.

336
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Like for the longest time as a child walking around in an urban environment, I saw fire extinguishers. Right.

337
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Yeah, you know, you know, from a young child to, you know, young adult, never saw one being used. So whenever I saw fire extinguisher, I always wondered, okay, there's not much to wonder about.

338
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:03,000
It's a canister. You know, when there's a fire, you grab that thing and you aim it towards the fire puts the fire out, right. Real simple, right.

339
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:18,000
So I had to believe what they told me about fire extinguishers, not until like in our early 20s, I saw one in use. Now I didn't have to believe in it anymore. I saw it in action.

340
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:27,000
You see the difference? No, true. I recall not not seeing one in use till I was about 30 and I had to use it.

341
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:45,000
But you had to believe that it worked before it was a belief. Well, that was the thing is I had to literally respond to a situation where it was like, this is the thing I go to, I went and got it and used it and had to look at it and think about how it works before I utilized it, even though I was told previous how to use it.

342
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I had to think about it for a moment and make sure, okay, what do I do? I pull this pin out, et cetera, et cetera, right. And then you point the hose and you actually direct this stuff, you know.

343
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:13,000
So on and so forth. And then I also had to deal with the reality of recharge and get refilling it, but it's the belief if you eliminate. Look, if you want to put this society or any society to complete chaos, eliminate their beliefs and have them rely on what they know because they know nothing.

344
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:27,000
So, I know, I know, Al-Qaeda and ISIS definitely got the stimulus checks, the $600, $1,200 checks from the treasury. Oh, sure. So they stopped. Yeah.

345
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
So, so did you have a joke? Yeah.

346
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I'm not joking, by the way, there were that. So, giving example on the idiocy here. So, okay, Chuck, I'm minus a foul.

347
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I'm going to use regular people surface talk here, okay. This is not me speaking, but giving a analogy, very strong analogy that should make people really see how simple things are regarding money because most people do things for money and they think things are done for money. And I'll show you how ridiculous.

348
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Not the system is because the system has a set of rules. You could look them up, but how ridiculous the population is. Okay. So, here's the analogy. Chuck, I have a bank account and it's minus a thousand dollars. Can I write you a check for a hundred? No.

349
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I certainly don't want it. No, okay. Now, if you gave some, if I put a thousand dollars in there, can I write a check for a hundred? No, because it's a zero.

350
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Yeah, forget about the fees and all the insulia rary things that they do. Okay. Alright, so, if, alright, so, so I'm at the minus. So, if you're right, go to the Treasury website. There are like 23 trillion minus.

351
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Can they write a check for a hundred dollars? Well, they shouldn't be able to. No, no, no, hold on. No. This is based on the math and what the attorney general says in the school economics say and all this.

352
00:48:51,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I'm using the analogy how they're all fraudulent. No, they're still constantly writing the checks. Right. So, if you gave the US Treasury 23 trillion dollars, can they write a check for a hundred dollars? No.

353
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Not if there were 23 trillion in the exactly. Okay. So, what's going on? What happens is this is the magic part. This is, they, they do this because the people allow it. They tell you it's all based of faith-based money system. That means it's a religion.

354
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Well, in a way, that's accurate because the fact is that people that have no idea how it works at all. That's very simple. This is how it works. When they cut you a check, which is just an instrument. It's a piece of paper. Let's say you go to the mailbox and it's let's say thousand bucks, right?

355
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:47,000
So, you get the thousand dollar check and you go to the bank, do I'm going to give the bank a can I deposit this and they're going to look at it and they can see no.

356
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Because you have to sign the back first, right? Because there's a signature issuing signature on the front. They need an endorsing signature. Actually in bonds, you can either endorse a both signatures on the front.

357
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Anyway, so the moment you sign that, the teller puts that in and with the comptroller part of the bank, it's, it's 10 to one. Let's say you make it easy. It's not, it's 10 to one becomes 10 thousand. That instrument becomes 10 thousand dollars.

358
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:23,000
You just create a 10 thousand dollars. You don't know that. So the third of that, well, they give you the thousand. Let's say you want to cash it, right?

359
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I've done this before. Go to the, not with whether official check and I go to the bank, though, is this good? Can you cash this and they're like, oh, yeah, says yours treasure. Yeah, of course. There's nothing there. But anyway.

360
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:57,000
So it creates 10, it's 10 to one fractional banking. So they give you the thousand dollars, right? And a kick in the ass if you spend too much time there. So the 9,000 that's left over a third of it goes to the bank, a third of it goes to the government 3000. Remember, they just the cost of, you know, right of the paper.

361
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Right. And the other third, whatever you want to figure it out, it goes to the federal reserve or whatever trust. So this is how they're funding their stuff by sending us. It's, it's most people. Right. They know if they don't have that, they, you see, that's why they give you utility bill to make you feel like your paycheck is worth something.

362
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:32,000
If you don't pay the utility bill, you're going to get your water, gas and electric cutoff. That's bullshit. It's all paid for. The reason they're doing this make you feel like what you're working for is worth something. You see, it's all a mind, you know, so anyway, here's the thing.

363
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:43,000
When they want to, when the government wants to fund something, it's so loose government, you know, it's kind of like, you know, when, anyway, you know what a franchise is.

364
00:51:43,000 --> 00:52:00,000
You know, people say I went to Kentucky fried chicken, like, no, he didn't. And people say I went to Taco Bell. I said, no, he didn't. I went to such an a no you didn't. And so what do you mean what do you keep saying now? Let's hold these different places. Why do you say no? You didn't. I said, because they're all PepsiCo. Right. Yeah.

365
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Yeah. The US government doesn't exist. It's so it's part of the, anyway, world economic, whatever. It's a franchise of the IMF. So here's the interesting thing. Whenever they want to fund something, they send checks out to people.

366
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:28,000
And you think you're getting a thousand dollars. That's why they keep it so low. A thousand, not useful. Like, for example, if you know anyone that lives in Germany, they were, or even Canada, they were getting two or three thousand a month. Right. Right. Right. So anyway.

367
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:49,000
So when they want to fund something, they send the their subjects checks and because they need their signatures, they can't create the need to have the the chattel agree to it. Right. So like if you have a ranch, you can even want to sell the ranch or sell the cows. You have to be able to put your hands on them. Like you say a thousand cattle and someone buys it.

368
00:52:49,000 --> 00:53:03,000
They bet when they come to your ranch, they better be able to put their hands on a thousand cattle. You can't can't have ten cattle and say a thousand, right. It's not the deal won't go through. That's just how that works. The same thing with this financial stuff. You need signatures.

369
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:24,000
So this is the system that people endorse and by the way, I usually stop when I with the analogy of a minus a thousand in my bank account. Can I write you a check for a hundred. Right. If you give me a thousand, if I put a thousand, can I write you a check for a thousand. The answer most people say no.

370
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:34,000
So how the hell they gave you stimulus checks when there are trillions in debt and then the mind stops because it reaches the end of the road that they've ever been shown. Right. Right.

371
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:48,000
It seems like the rest of the road is an invisible paint and everything that I've told you you can look up in their own documentation. Right. A modern money mechanics federal reserve bag of Chicago. Right. Look it up.

372
00:53:48,000 --> 00:54:03,000
So here's the interesting part. The way you make change. Okay. Okay. The way you make change. You see a lot of social leaders, right. And they usually get dialed lead poisoning. You know what I mean? You know lead poisoning right.

373
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Of course. Okay. So the reason why they're not successful. The leaders that you've seen through history, civil rights, whatever is because they're trying to lead a bunch of idiots or morons. And you have to tell them like if you give them a broom, they don't know how to sweep. And even if you tell them how to sweep, you have to show. Right.

374
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:39,000
That's what gets the leaders in trouble. So true leadership. If you had a viable society. With just hint on what to do and the people would get it and do it without another. It would be a leaderless movement.

375
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:52,000
So then who are they going to shoot in the head or strangle or poison? No one. Right. They'd have to do. Okay. So worldwide strike situation. Right. And you know what fast trading is like.

376
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:59,000
They could do what? Thousand trades a second. Right. You've heard that with this been going on a Wall Street for a long time. Right. Micro trading or whatever.

377
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Okay. The system right now is so reliant on what you do every minute while you're awake. That if you had, let's say, a third of the people on the planet just stop using banking. Stop using the utilities. Don't go to work. Don't buy anything. Just for three days.

378
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:36,000
That would bring this is most of this system, the middle part of the system to its knees. Right. Not protesting. You see. This is very simple to do. But by the time you get the information to the people, it's like pissing in a bucket. They don't get it. Right.

379
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:49,000
This is really relevant because there are a couple of situations here where we do have organizations that have created circumstances where there is no leadership.

380
00:55:49,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And they're really seen as dangerous, seemingly to everybody. One. No. You can't organize it either. You just put out a public message. In other words, if, if the weather, which is total, baloney, by the way, because there are weather stations five miles apart.

381
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Why do you have to predict that you could just give a real time every every five minutes, right? But anyway, what I mean here is you just put out the information in no organization and people will do it.

382
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:48,000
For example, bring up, you know, I brought up the Super Bowl Stadium. Have you ever seen the wave done in the stadium where the people do the wave? You know, it goes around. Okay. Where's the, you know, it's almost like a self organizing flow. Right. Because they're aware of it. And in the beginning, it's kind of rough. But then they kind of get it and they fall into it because there's no filtering. There's no blocks that have been put in place.

383
00:56:48,000 --> 00:57:02,000
The thing that really kills it is fear. Oh, you know, it like, for example, I remember about decade ago or less, even maybe the time we were doing, oh, and G, the proper movement was reaching its peak.

384
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:11,000
You know, store rice and beans. And so I ran to some people as I said, oh, rice and me. I said, how? I see go to his living room. And he's got a 50 pound bag of rice and beans. I'm like, do you?

385
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Do you write some beans? Well, I go, no, I said, well, if you had to, if you were in a situation where you really had to eat that, you wish you would wish you were dead. You wouldn't be able to digest it. You don't know how to cook it. Right.

386
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:31,000
And they would say to me, oh, when it time comes, then don't, don't come here. I was like, okay, sure.

387
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:43,000
But, okay, if you really want to be a hardcore prepper, you run a rehearsal. So what I suggest people do is if you're afraid that you're, you know, you're going to be in a situation.

388
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Do me a favor. Do a rehearsal. Go out to the breaker box right now. Pull the power down. Turn it off. Shut off your water. Shut off your gas or whatever like that. And call me back in three days. Let me know how it went.

389
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Right. How many do that? Well, not too many of them. Not too many. There was a small segment of the population that was actively trying to encourage people to do stuff like that.

390
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:26,000
At the time that we were doing the own G stuff. And it was very interesting to me because you, you, you had two sides of it and you had the very rare group that would say, look, you know, we do is we actually run this like a drill.

391
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Yeah, but there should be no, see, there should be no group. There should be no, it should be innate and it will be in the future. Not this society. Not that this one.

392
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:52,000
You know, it's kind of okay. Let's say you have someone who's really tech savvy and they go back a few hundred years. It's not going to, there skills mean nothing. It's absolutely useless. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Oh, I know how to compute.

393
00:58:52,000 --> 00:59:10,000
So the one I'm saying 99% of Greek speak is absolutely useless to your typical earthen habitant, you know, because they're, they're, first of all, I've been doing a study like I said earlier about the IC None TV for about two years now. I listen very carefully to people.

394
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:22,000
And the everything they say most of the majority of things that they say and the way they think is based on what, what form of television they were raised with the ones that were very heavily.

395
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:28,000
So and I would make a job every time you hear someone speak of say, oh, that's, they got that from television.

396
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I'm waiting for them to say something that they haven't said, oh, we're done television. And that's just how we are. Right.

397
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:56,000
So you have to be very careful what you expose yourself to. No, certainly. And the thing is that by the time you realize what it is, you're being exposed to quite often. It's too late because your entire call and response reflexes are all based on this stuff.

398
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Well, that's why I used to have a joke. What does heavy artillery and Greek speak have in common is to be the joke was what does banjo music and heavy artillery have in common. And it's once you hear it, it's too late.

399
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Yeah, right. Right. In other words, because artillery, you know, if the shells coming in faster than speed of sound, it'll hit, it's not like the movies where you hear when the explosion happens. And then you hear the, the, the, whoosh sound, right?

400
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:35,000
No, but that that is. Yeah, the speed of sound is behind the speed of the, it's just the physical projectile will make us landing before you hear it. Yeah. It's just like a bullet. I've described this. I've been shot before, right?

401
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:46,000
And I did not hear that until after I was already shot. And quite honestly, I had to put it together because I don't know when getting shot.

402
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:59,000
The first thing, well, anyone has been shot and not going to queer you on it is the first complaint is it burns burns like hell. Well, my first complaint actually was that my leg was wet. Then it burned. Right.

403
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Then it registered. I've been shot. You see, I wasn't even aware that that's what it was.

404
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Right. It's not just like when I almost nearly chopped the finger off. I wasn't aware until I looked at it. So, anyway, where do you want to go with this? I kind of laid out a little mixed bag of a fave of what we spoke on. Yeah.

405
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:36,000
No, no, look, I appreciate it. And this, this makes perfect sense to me so far. I do want to talk a little more about the different organizational principles that I've seen. Now, you, you kind of objected to the idea that an organization and things would come about in an, in an organization.

406
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I'm about in an eight way or, you know, in a reflexive way as opposed to somebody saying, OK, I've determined this is what I'm going to do and they, they actually do it.

407
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I do want to talk about that a little more and take a little break here because we're at about the one hour mark, believe it or not. So before I will keep going.

408
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Yeah, we'll keep going, but we'll take a little breather. All right.

409
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Let people try to absorb what has been laid out so far, but there's a lot more. The Greek is with me here on a, well, on an alleged tears day or Tuesday.

410
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Right. So anyway, and he didn't even tell you what day it was this time. So stick around. The Ocelli effect of return.

417
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:55,000
President Kennedy would not have been assassinated if he had been president 200 years ago. His assassination took place in the context of the Cold War and the rise of the national security state.

418
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Before World War II, the United States was a continental republic. In the decade that followed, it became an imperial superpower.

419
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Generals such as Curtis LaMais not only wanted to invade Cuba, but knew that there were short-range missiles on the island armed with nuclear warheads that they could not destroy because they were on mobile launchers.

420
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:19,000
Their invasion could have led to a third world war and they wanted to go to war anyway.

Secret wars became a staple of US covert operations that are still happening today. Larry Hancock's book in denial rips the cover off many of them.

428
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Using new files it exposes things about the Bay of Pigs that no one has ever written about before. It shows why it really bailed and why the United States did not learn from it.

>> The second segment of the Ochelly effect here on a Tears Day allegedly and all that good

470
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:58,440
stuff. And I have the Greek with me and he is definitely giving us the clinic in Greek

471
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:03,700
speak. Reminisce and quite a bit of the Ochelly and the Greek stuff which I think at this point

472
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:10,240
only resides in my archive. I could lock. They took it down other places. I'm very certain

473
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:16,440
I'll be able to put it back out and all of that at some point. And who knows maybe we'll

474
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:24,340
just make the archive available to people that actually value it. More about that in the

475
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:30,340
future and what's going to go on in the alleged year 2023. >> Well, let me interrupt for a moment.

476
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:36,340
We secretly discuss possibly doing a reboot but not like before. So I'm putting that out

477
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:42,340
publicly. I don't know if you get any feedback on that. Maybe it's worth considering.

478
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:49,340
>> Well, I absolutely know that we would have people that would be very pleased. I get, as

479
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:54,340
I've told you many times, I get messages in between the time that you're on the show and you're

480
01:11:54,340 --> 01:12:02,840
not. And often I have, well, you know, one friend from New Jersey, often requests you. So one

481
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:07,340
guy has been requesting ever since I had him on the first time just on my show. >> Sounds

482
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:15,340
like a stalker. >> Yeah, almost. You know Eddie. Anyway, you did know Eddie at one point anyway.

483
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:21,340
Maybe you don't know now. >> Yeah, there's plenty of Eddie's around but yeah, I think so. >> Yeah, good

484
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:28,340
eye from the same town in which I was allegedly born. Got it. >> Well, no, that's, yeah,

485
01:12:28,340 --> 01:12:32,340
it's placed on the earth. You know, but there's a lot to say about geography and I used to

486
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:38,340
blame geography for a lot of the lack of sense that I saw around myself. But it's not geographical.

487
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:43,340
It's the entire world. So it's just slightly variation of flavor. >> Yeah, you know,

488
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:48,340
what it is, a different flavor depending on the region you're in. I mean, obviously stupid in New

489
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:55,340
York City is just as stupid in Atlanta, but it does have a different accent. >> Right.

490
01:12:55,340 --> 01:13:02,340
>> So by the way, looking at the, just, this is like a loose conversation. So I'm looking at the

491
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:08,340
Chitango and some about the day here. Yeah, it's pretty close to the last one. Yeah, it's,

492
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:15,340
it's, I'm reckoning around the 28th of the 10th month, right? So it'll be the 11th month,

493
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:21,340
usually for the bulk of January, then 12th month and bulk of February and March,

494
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:27,340
around the first week of March will be the, the first day of the first month. So it also

495
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:32,340
about here, at least the CIA gave us LSD when they just say dropout. No, it's not about

496
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:36,340
dropping out. That's the whole thing. At least they brought it out. They, so one of the

497
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:42,340
comments here is basically to drop out the decks or stack, blah, blah, blah. Well, that's,

498
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:47,340
that's the initial, the initial flavor of it, but let me just interject something if you will

499
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:53,340
chuck, you don't want to drop out. There's something called administrative duties, right?

500
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:59,340
Like if you're around people that do business, run their own businesses, you know, I call

501
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:04,340
them, say we're going to go play some basketball. No, I got to do admin work tonight. Admin

502
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:08,340
means you're, you know, you're going to have to sit down, get all the bills for the month

503
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:13,340
together, you know, send them out, right? So they don't cut off your power or whatever to do pay

504
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:17,340
or whatever, right? Admin work, right? Because a lot of people run small businesses,

505
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:23,340
they wear many hats, right? That's true. Okay. So as I've told you before, right? I've worked

506
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:28,340
with everything from this independent circumstance that I'm in now, where I do not have a boss,

507
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:33,340
right? I don't believe I own a business. This is not a business necessarily, but anyway,

508
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:38,340
I don't have a boss, and this is all I do. Sure, but a little bit back to the thing here about

509
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:44,340
dropping out, I thought about dropping out at all. It's about finding people that will fill those spots

510
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:49,340
the best they can. Like for example, you don't want to do any banking. There's plenty of people

511
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:53,340
out there that will. Well, no, true. And that's the thing is that you're in a straightaway.

512
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:58,340
And in a straightaway, I used to work with people who wanted to get into flipping houses and, you know,

513
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:05,340
I'm like, do you want me to tell you how that's going to work out for you or do you want to revisit

514
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:09,340
this in a couple of years? And I'm like, oh, tell me how that's going to work out. All right.

515
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:16,340
You don't want to, whenever you're doing a landlord thing, and you're going to, especially multiple units,

516
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:22,340
no matter how good they look on paper, you're going to have problem tenant, right? One or many or whatever.

517
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:29,340
You get a management agency, you give them 5%, 10% wherever they want, and they handle it for you, right?

518
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:35,340
You don't want to be there beating the guy up for trashing the apartment or calling the cops.

519
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:39,340
You want the management agency to do it, right? So you get an admin to do it.

520
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:43,340
So, if you don't want to deal with the banking, there's someone that does.

521
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:50,340
Look, back in the days, the mob set up, they got into administrative stuff and took a smaller mob.

522
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:53,340
And, you know, like, Irish mob and all that. Right.

523
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:59,340
So they would start up these little front companies. The word got out that you can't do business the way you've been doing it.

524
01:15:59,340 --> 01:16:03,340
You got to start a front company, you load up the front company, and then you crash it.

525
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:08,340
But the problem with doing it, they got into all the LLC stuff, so you needed, you couldn't just file paperwork.

526
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:13,340
They wanted like a person's social security, they want, you know, all this stuff.

527
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:19,340
So I said, where do we get? Who's going to take the fall? I said, look, you see the homeless guy here on the corner?

528
01:16:19,340 --> 01:16:25,340
Right? He'll be so glad if you gave him a thousand bucks or two thousand bucks in a new suit and a shower to show up

529
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:28,340
wherever and sign all the papers. You know that, right?

530
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:31,340
Well, a hundred bucks in a bag of McDonald's, believe me, you can get a guy to get the money.

531
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:34,340
Oh, no, he got a huge amount. He's glad to look a lot, but he can't look too rough.

532
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,340
No, no, no, but I'm just saying. A hundred bucks.

533
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:41,340
I want to get somebody who's slightly not too insane and doesn't look too rough.

534
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:45,340
They've been out only for a few weeks or a month because if you've been out for years, you look too rough.

535
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:51,340
Have them do all the paperwork and, you know, whatever. You see, so there's always a fall guy.

536
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:55,340
There's always an upright, upstanding, administrative manager.

537
01:16:55,340 --> 01:17:00,340
There's always a thief. There's always a liar. There's always a trustworthy people.

538
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:09,340
I've always said this before. You might trust someone and not like them or you can like someone and not trust them.

539
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:16,340
For example, you might like having drinks with somebody, but you wouldn't give them your car keys or your house keys.

540
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:22,340
There's other people that you wouldn't invite to have a drink with, but you would definitely trust them with your house keys or your car keys, right?

541
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:30,340
Well, see now, I've known plenty of people like that where it's like, look, they're fun to drink with. They're fun to go out to eat with, but I don't want to bring them anywhere near my family.

542
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:32,340
Well, whatever. You know, okay.

543
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:52,340
So you've got to be a good admin and you've got to understand socially. Most of the Greeks speak does seem reclusive and dropping out to the simple-minded, because when someone takes things too simply, there's nothing that's simple.

544
01:17:52,340 --> 01:18:04,340
Right? In one sense, the overall scope of the matter is simple. Let me just rephrase that. It's not easy. Everything is simple, but it's not easy.

545
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:15,340
And when you see that what is making something not so easy, it's because it's simplicity run awry, meaning it's a lot of little simple things to be put together to make up that big, simple thing.

546
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:29,340
Well, good example. There's always people is about the quality of food, right? We talked about this many times, the quality of food, where it's very simple to say, look, avoid the GMO and the high-priced corn syrup, right?

547
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:35,340
Avoid that and you'll be a lot healthier. Now that's a very simple statement. Sounds pretty good.

548
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:36,340
Well, this more important.

549
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:48,340
Well, a little more to that, because you've got to live with the seasons and that's one thing. Well, I'm oversimplifying you. I'm just saying that you say that to somebody and they go, well, that's a pretty simple statement.

550
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:55,340
And then even you say, okay, eat seasonally. So know what's in season and eat according to that and also eat the things that are local to you.

551
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:59,340
Well, here's the thing. Within the season, you have monthly.

552
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:10,340
So for example, you know, as the moon is full and it goes up, you want to eat lighter foods, leafy greens. That's your time to have your sweets or whatever.

553
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:11,340
Sure.

554
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:19,340
When you get the dark moon, the energy on its way to the dark moon, right? It starts to go down. That's when you eat more root vegetable avoid sweets.

555
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:22,340
And then when it starts going up again, you lift up, right?

556
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:34,340
So when women are having a bad menstrual cycle, which is usually in the middle of the month, they need to avoid sweets and eat more root vegetable and they won't have such a bad cycle, right?

557
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:38,340
That's I'm using the menstrual cycle because of the cramping and all that, right?

558
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:50,340
So in the full moon comes around again. See so the so you've got the monthly, like for example, all of the really good farmers, all maniacs talked about planting what when and it went by what?

559
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:52,340
The moon.

560
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:55,340
Because of it, but they don't explain it.

561
01:19:55,340 --> 01:20:00,340
You see, so you got to explain man, you got to explain.

562
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:02,340
No, I understand.

563
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:09,340
But I'm just saying that when you present a simple idea like that, it sounds very simple, but that requires a bunch of education, doesn't it?

564
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:21,340
But it's all within it's already it's already in front. It's already there. There's no sense in look, I knew this guy while back he was an IP guy intellectual property, right?

565
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:29,340
So you get on the call, Skype call, bunch of people talking about some material that you know, you need like $20 million lab to make.

566
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:42,340
And I'm like, this isn't going to help anyone here. We need to know about stuff we can go to the hardware store or find laying around that we could rework and that is usable and improve that this stuff you're bringing is doesn't work.

567
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:44,340
You need to have you see?

568
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:51,340
That's why I like you know, usually on Tuesdays, by the way, and Christie after Didey went in the chat room and she's usually on here on Tuesdays.

569
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:53,340
Oh good teller said hello.

570
01:20:53,340 --> 01:21:04,340
I'm sure she just heard you, but the thing is that she talks about look, you know what? There is food all around you. There's plenty of things that are medicines and some of them grow right in your front yard.

571
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:05,340
Oh yeah.

572
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:16,340
Look, years ago, but then who are you going to talk to? And I say, look, this is what I mean. Years ago, I was trafficking high end water. We were making built a Victor Shaw burger device.

573
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:31,340
And we're trafficking water in California and LA under spring, two oh one of the places we're selling it at is a place called Rossum. They got busted by the feds for selling raw milk and all this other stuff. They're 10 years ago more. This is 2010, 1112.

574
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:36,340
So we're selling water out of there at 10 bucks or three quarters of a court, you know, a leader.

575
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:37,340
Let's say.

576
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:46,340
And people were loving it getting high off the water. It was really super high quality water. We were just taking top water and transmuting it to high quality spring water.

577
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:52,340
Well, the stuff that we covered actually in a private thing that's only in the member section of Shelley not coming back.

578
01:21:52,340 --> 01:22:04,340
Sure, but the device I'm talking about is if you want one, you transfer 30 grand into a bank account. And by the time it's ready to be delivered, you got to give me another 30 grand.

579
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:12,340
It's kind of like getting a new like a used Mercedes or whatever. It's not another thing, but we don't take a very long time to build a very expensive.

580
01:22:12,340 --> 01:22:18,340
But, but okay, so, but here's the thing. So these people are into the health and all this stuff. They know all this stuff, right?

581
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:24,340
So we're walking one day. This is in Venice Beach. I'm walking to the beach because it was just a few blocks from there.

582
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:31,340
And the leader of the group, you know, the store and all these other health freaks in a real earthy crunchy granola type people, you know.

583
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:38,340
Oh, you can't cook food. You got to eat it, Rollas. Sorry, we're crossing the median and talk about food all around you, right?

584
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:46,340
And in the median, I point down and I say, hey, look, and they're like, what? I said, what's that? And none of them knew what it was.

585
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:54,340
And I started pulling it up. So this is Birdock root. It's really good for you. And they didn't even recognize it, right?

586
01:22:54,340 --> 01:23:05,340
And then we're crossing the median again. This is between the median, right? In the street. As a look at that, what's that? I don't know. It's Amaranth, man. You could eat the greens, the seeds.

587
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:13,340
So, so, so, another is be careful who you go. So, so here you have one of the most prestigious organizations teaching people how to eat well.

588
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:20,340
And they didn't recognize the wonderful vegetables that were growing in front of the sidewalk in the median on the way to the beach.

589
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:27,340
So, who are you going to, so in other words, you got to, like, for example, if you want to learn about the legal system, you can't go to an attorney.

590
01:23:27,340 --> 01:23:34,340
No, no way. You want to know about the human body. You can't go to a medical doctor. No, F in way.

591
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:43,340
Right. Yeah. That's the point about the police, too, is that you want to learn about spirituality. You can't go to a priest or rabbi or a mom. No way. It's the wrong direction.

592
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:52,340
So, who are you going to go to? Right? Go to yourself. Crack it open, man. It's like, it's, it's, okay, here's the other thing.

593
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:59,340
A lot of people say that, you know, the GOD is within you. It's not. There's no text that says that, by the way. That's a translation in the King Jimmy, right?

594
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:09,340
What he actually said was the kingdom of heaven is beside you, but they put it within you, right? So, anyway, so everything that's, you get it?

595
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:16,340
If everything is beside you, right? You see, it shouldn't be more than what? Five feet apart. Like you could reach out two feet when you hold up your arm.

596
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:25,340
Just a little bit more. If you reach it, five feet is basically standing up, sticking your arm out and taking what? One step and you got it.

597
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:38,340
You see? That's it. What? Communication. Yeah. Communication. See, now, here we go into a strange area and we're probably going to take up the rest of the time that we're going to spend presenting this son of God.

598
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:48,340
And presenting this sonic event on this because as I mentioned to you during the break, and I always disclose this stuff, by the way.

599
01:24:48,340 --> 01:24:55,340
You know, I talked about Antifa a bunch and I stopped talking about it. I've had people write to me, how can I not talking about it anymore?

600
01:24:55,340 --> 01:25:07,340
Because nobody understood what it was. I was trying to explain, which is that there is this mechanism that is presented to you, you know, by the people that present entertainment.

601
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:19,340
And politics and all of it together because they're all the same media company, right? So, you know, your Fox Broadcasting, Fox News will also give you the Simpsons. So keep it in mind, right?

602
01:25:19,340 --> 01:25:31,340
It's just it is the way of things. They're talking about this organization. Antifa does this and that and the third thing. And they kept saying that, you know, they're the anti organization to this or that or whatever.

603
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:44,340
Meanwhile, they're talking about a fabrication that is created. I mean, anarchists wearing uniforms. I mean, where do you want the contradictions to begin and end? Okay. Really.

604
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:55,340
And I tried to talk about what's really happening regarding this, which is there is a communication hub, so to speak, that exists. And that is actually what it is.

605
01:25:55,340 --> 01:26:08,340
Not this thing that they keep telling you about on TV, because as seen on TV, I mean, even those products that are as seen on TV, Greek, right? Most of the time, they're not quite as good when you get them in your hands, are they?

606
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:15,340
They're not quite as miraculous. And, you know, the flashlight is not quite as bright, right?

607
01:26:15,340 --> 01:26:26,340
But life is not really indestructible. You know what I'm saying? So it's the antifa. I think you want to model this, this you want to focus on the model of antifa, right?

608
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:36,340
Yeah. Which is the, okay, exactly the same as the Wall Street protests are on 2011 on the Pope's work schedule. What was that called? The one percenters are bad or all that, right?

609
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:46,340
Right. How many of them were speaking on the fractional money system that when you get a check, it has no value until you sign it, right?

610
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:58,340
Yeah, nobody. Nobody. Right? Okay. So the same thing with antifa. It, it, look, is, it doesn't matter if it's a dictatorship, fascist, communist, whatever, whatever, is it lawful?

611
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:14,340
Is it benevolent or is it unlawful, meaning legal and malevolent? Right? So that's, that's the, the, the, the straw. Like a lot of people you wouldn't believe past few years. Well, yes, you probably wouldn't. People ask me about Bitcoin. I said, okay, first of all, it's an intelligence operation.

612
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:15,340
Yes.

613
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:29,340
If you buy Bitcoin or engage in human trafficking prostitution or illegal drugs, you're supporting the intelligence agencies. Any time you see thousands of percent profit, it's an intelligence operation.

614
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:48,340
And it goes back to the Jesuits before that it goes back to the Templars, before that it goes back to the who were the, the, the, the salucites before that it goes to the Persians, before that it goes to the Babylonians, the same intelligence operational model.

615
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:56,340
And there's a reason why they phrase the opiate of the people exists, right? You know, just say go, go ahead. I mean, that model has continued to present.

616
01:27:56,340 --> 01:28:11,340
So it doesn't matter what is like, okay, look, I have a personal story I could tell you from conversations with the Black Lives Matter and tying it into the, because it's loosely entitled the antifa loosely.

617
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:26,340
I don't want you to lump it up with the affirmative action. Remember that? They were saying, oh, we're going to title people because of their color or whatever it's too bad. And no, no, no. Affirmative action started.

618
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:36,340
This is from speaking with someone who was involved in structuring that in the 60s was American industry was becoming incestuous with middle-aged white guys.

619
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:50,340
You know, go look at, for example, documentaries on Ford Motor Company or the NASA or whatever in the 50s and 60s. You see all these guys with short haircuts, with pocket protectors, white guys, right? Middle-aged, right?

620
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:58,340
Everywhere. Okay. What they found out was American industry was getting stifled because of the culture of the middle-aged white guy running everything, right?

621
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:20,340
So they needed an influx of some new blood, new ideas, slightly different, just, and then they knew it had to be done culturally because they kept tightening the reins of education because this is back then if you wanted to be an architect and you showed you were competent in the field and can prove it with some testing.

622
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:34,340
They gave you an architect's degree or they not a degree from a college, but they gave you the licensing, same with a doctor, same with whatever or a lawyer. If you if you can prove they knew the law, they gave you the let's say quote unquote licensing and permission by the state.

623
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:47,340
Now they made it a requirement that you have to have a certain amount of college. Right. See before they, okay. So even that, they did that and they encouraged that back in the 50s and 60 because they needed some new blood.

624
01:29:47,340 --> 01:30:01,340
Right. Didn't come. Didn't come. So the only way we're going to get it is by getting some of the Caribbean Latin, African, Asian blood in here. In other words, non, not white America. We need.

625
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:16,340
And white America includes also the German and the Swedish and we know we need some people diverse cultural diversity that will break us, break the train of thought that we have because that culture, by the way, we'll see things differently.

626
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:27,340
Different way. And that was the reason for affirmative action, not to unrighteously, unmeritoriously enriched people.

627
01:30:27,340 --> 01:30:33,340
And certainly not to correct some previous injustice. That's just ludicrous. Nobody.

628
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:42,340
So here's the thing with the BLM and antifosal title instead of saying, well, we were slaves.

629
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:49,340
How about them saying that we have enriched your culture? Right.

630
01:30:49,340 --> 01:31:03,340
Okay. Look at what the hip hop movement did in the 90s. Like before the 90s, it was ghetto and whatever. But in the 90s, you had, you go down to like white bread America. They were embracing big e-smalls and two-bock. Right. Right.

631
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:12,340
So I'm not, this is a bad example because I'm not, I mean, I, I mean, if it sounds good, it is good. I'm not a particular genre of any fan, a fan of any genre.

632
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:26,340
What I'm trying to say is the original idea for this multicultural stuff that was put into government codes in terms of hiring practices had nothing to do with unmarried, without merit bringing people in.

633
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:38,340
And merit of it was injecting a multicultural, multiracial, multicultural environment where it was right just white bread middle-aged white guys, you see.

634
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:47,340
Well, see, I had a conversation. This guy was a civil engineer who developed all the highways, which kind of a nightmare in Atlanta, Georgia. He was in his 80s.

635
01:31:47,340 --> 01:32:02,340
He was about a decade ago and he was part, and says, nobody knows this. Here's the other thing. When you hear about corn-a-coat black people, you always culturally, just like when they show a doctor, they show a white lab coat with a stethoscope.

636
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:11,340
Well, when you hear about black people and where they live, they always show a ghetto or something like that. They never show the upper middle class neighborhoods like Cue Gardens,

637
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:26,340
or Queens in New York, or the Hollis Queens. They never show Marietta, Georgia. They never show, I mean, there's like dozens of upper middle class black neighborhoods, you know, like the Cosby Show kind of thing, you know.

638
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:31,340
They never show that. Right. Never. So.

639
01:32:31,340 --> 01:32:41,340
But it's funny you keep saying white bread because it's very funny to me considering that the cuisine in America and the music and everything else.

640
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:54,340
If you were to extract and remove completely, you know, blacks, Italians, and Jews, I'll just pick those three groups. Guess what you got? Nothing.

641
01:32:54,340 --> 01:33:02,340
I mean, really, anything that you consider to be, I mean, just the example of pizza I bring up all the time, which is funny.

642
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:18,340
Without this injection into the eco-spear, so to speak, of the cultural diversity, you've got a very stagnant situation without them and then later Asians and then so on and so forth.

643
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:30,340
Without these different injections of different things that are diverse culturally, you have stagnation, which is exactly the same when it comes to the technological advances, right?

644
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:42,340
Right. But the stagnation, if the stagnation is in deliberate, like in some cases you want stagnation so that the art doesn't get lost like in wine making, for example, or violent making.

645
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:58,340
Right. You know, the strata various, so they're not telling the people why it has its original sound because it's so simple. Right. And wine making, for example, if wire older, it's not really that the age of the wine.

646
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:15,340
If you ever drink like a thousand dollar bottle of wine, it tastes like jam, but it still tastes like, it takes some jam, filter it out, whatever, strawberry, grape jam and mix it with some wine and it's not that simple, but that's what it tastes like.

647
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:23,340
You know, it's like, why would you? It's the practices. That's what makes the age, right? So antiques, better, you know, that's the practice.

648
01:34:23,340 --> 01:34:34,340
So some things you do want stagnation, right? In other words, you know, the best cheese, you know, Parmesan, Regiano. Well, but there's a different stagnation.

649
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:47,340
That's the same stagnation. They're not, they're not innovating. Yeah, but there's a difference between stagnation and maintaining a quality which has been reached by practice, right?

650
01:34:47,340 --> 01:34:56,340
And if it needs, if it needs that influx, let's say, yeah, but that's better. Let's look at genetics. Right.

651
01:34:56,340 --> 01:35:04,340
There's a guy as a YouTube video goes around the Antarondoc mountains where everybody's, you know, not everybody, but he interviewed interviews.

652
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:15,340
People that have been in bread and they're seriously retarded, right? So, so that inbreeding, you know, sometimes shouldn't happen.

653
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:31,340
Yeah. Wow. Sorry. There was a bit of a, I think, thunder roll behind me there. Yeah, hear it. Sorry. It was like this boom. And then there was a second boom. So I was just a little distracted there for a second.

654
01:35:31,340 --> 01:35:44,340
But no, but that's the thing though is one something becomes too incestuous. There's a level at which, you know, homogenous actions and breeding and practice is good.

655
01:35:44,340 --> 01:36:07,340
But this varies, right? And if it becomes too incestuous again, then we'll have stagnation. So at certain points, you need to engineer the introduction or the reduction of new information depending on the quality of things that are being produced, whether it's people or it's cheese, it doesn't matter, right?

656
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:17,340
No, well, the context matters, right? In other words, if you want to preserve something, you want to do it the same way, but you can't because the, you know, everything, the environment changes, right?

657
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:31,340
But, you know, it depends on the fine points that you're looking at. But look, you know, you got to, I see here something about 200, you know, I got cigarette and working well 200 years. It hasn't worked well. So I'll prop again to every time there's a new generation.

658
01:36:31,340 --> 01:36:51,340
Here, this is how the social engineering works. You got to separate the children from the parents because the, the otherwise the children will be like the parents, not like a carbon copy of the parents, but pretty much a copy of the parents. So what you do is you create a rift, a generational rift, right?

659
01:36:51,340 --> 01:37:00,340
And then it started in the, actually in the 1800s, late 1800s and, you know, remember, rebel without a cause, James Dean, right? The rift, right?

660
01:37:00,340 --> 01:37:01,340
Yeah.

661
01:37:01,340 --> 01:37:12,340
Between, okay, so you create a rift within the household, doesn't matter. In certain cultures, they separate the children from the household. That's the best way to change society because you can't teach something to a child.

662
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:21,340
And then they go home and sleep with the, in the same house and they have a different, you know, philosophy or ideology, completely different ideas and won't work.

663
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:36,340
Conflicts, so they know they can't do that. So they create a conflict, generational conflict within the house, right? And then one of those younger people are ejected from that environment, then they have more wherewithal supposedly and can rebuild society, right?

664
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:46,340
And this is just how it's done, but that system doesn't work anymore, right? Because there's too much information.

665
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:57,340
It's all distractions. You know, I think on the early Greek speak stuff, well, I spoke about what's coming as a Middle East union, but it's not, no one cares about that.

666
01:37:57,340 --> 01:38:08,340
The reason for it is you're going to have a very conservative, quote unquote, move back to lawfulness and a very stringent, unlawful, it'll be lawful, but it'll be overdone, right?

667
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:24,340
You know, smothering. So this, this has started already. I don't know if you guys are paying attention, you know, on the subtleties of things that were banned and censored, let's say a year or two ago, or starting to be on, you know, mainstream media, right?

668
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:37,340
Like the, you know, the death from deaths from the, the shot, right? And the hoaxes that have been prepared medical hoaxes, that's starting to come out. And also being fed up with all this liberal agenda.

669
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:41,340
This is all planned, by the way, it's by the same people that brought you the liberal, right?

670
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:42,340
Of course.

671
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:57,340
And we've, I've talked about this and it's in within, by 2025 or so, you're going to be within the froze of an ultra conservative society that, that you will not recognize compared to what's been going on the past few years.

672
01:38:57,340 --> 01:39:08,340
So snow, snow, big deals. Funny. It's great to talk about stuff that's going to happen in the future. And then you're still alive. You see it rolling up just like you talked about it and, you know,

673
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:17,340
and it seems natural to everyone, but it's clearly unnatural because you knew it was coming and you know the control mechanism. So,

674
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:26,340
well, right. I mean, quite frankly, if you listen very carefully to the early shows that we did, you could have predicted the past couple of years very easily.

675
01:39:26,340 --> 01:39:29,340
Yeah, but here's the thing.

676
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:35,340
When you see it coming, the people, the people are just going to complain about it when it comes, even though you told them, right?

677
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:51,340
Well, that's what they do anyway. Yeah. Yeah. So, so, you know, so again, it's about the, it's about, I'll use the word individual or each, each, you know, select person, man or woman or being what they do with it.

678
01:39:51,340 --> 01:40:04,340
And you structure yourself. Okay. This is how you, you know, it's about living life with efficiency. Right? So, for example, if, remember during the Obama years, we were supposed to go in a war and lock down or whatever.

679
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:19,340
You know, it didn't happen till 2020, right? So, if people that got caught up with the prepping, because disaster is coming and all this, if you know that it's not, you don't have to get engrossed in that argument.

680
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:33,340
You don't have to spend any energy in it, right? At all. That's where the efficiency comes from. It's not a, you're not going to change anything by knowing about it, but you will, you won't waste energy on it.

681
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:43,340
No, fair enough. So, look, with the last little bid here that I have you because we're going to end this around the two hour mark, not necessarily right on it, but around there.

682
01:40:43,340 --> 01:40:57,340
I have this, I have this idea that you, you might be open to revisiting the Ocelli in the Greek thing, which would be fascinating. Of course, generally, you designed that. We had that.

683
01:40:57,340 --> 01:41:07,340
Absolutely. It's not for say we'll be fascinating, not just informative this time. You know, I've always said I try not to share more than 10%. Right? Right.

684
01:41:07,340 --> 01:41:23,340
So, let's do the 11, 12, 13, 14 up to 20, 30, 40%. Why not? It's going to be nitty gritty. And it's all done with, when I say people are more on, I say that affectionately, right? Because if you've got a better word, I'd like to know.

685
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:39,340
But it's, but it's not going to be on a venue. We could talk. I think the best way to do it is the way that behind a paywall and and give not an hour out 15 minutes.

686
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:49,340
And you don't just edit clips out. We do a 15 minute or 20 minute or half hour max segment on what you will get if you contribute.

687
01:41:49,340 --> 01:42:01,340
No, that's how much contribute otherwise you're not going to get. And it doesn't even have to be quote unquote money, you know, credit because there is no right. You have to give something in return.

688
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:11,340
Oh, fair enough. Some exchange fair enough. I'm more than happy to explore this because, you know, I have all the mechanisms to do it.

689
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:27,340
The model has not quite panned out so well for me the past couple of years. And frankly, I even considered, you know, letting this go finally after doing this for 10 years because I feel like I'm kind of banging my head up against the wall, honestly.

690
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:35,340
But this would be a very interesting way to go forward and do the thing that I want to do here.

691
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:43,340
The whole key chuck is not the bang your head on the wall. No, I know, you know, unless it's a, you know, unless you're into that kind of thing.

692
01:42:43,340 --> 01:42:55,340
No, no, listen, I'm enjoying it. I'm saying that it's one of these things that just seems to keep happening because I feel like I'm making plenty of effort to inform people about certain things.

693
01:42:55,340 --> 01:43:07,340
Let me just say it this way. It goes down to one thing really. It's, okay, running with the scissors, new bad news travels faster than good news, right?

694
01:43:07,340 --> 01:43:17,340
True. No. The other thing is you're not attracting people that are good at communicating. So in other words, if you have a listener base, I'm saying this publicly because it's just to help people.

695
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:27,340
If you have like 100 people listening to you and 99 of them can't communicate a thought even in their daily lives, how are they going to communicate what you're saying to someone else?

696
01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:33,340
Yeah, well, I'm saying that it's not, they'll try to explain it to someone else and they'll just be like, I don't know what you're talking about or I'm not getting it.

697
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:41,340
Well, that's exactly the thing I've come to is that, you know, the majority and look, this is not to offend anyone or to put anybody down.

698
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:49,340
But the bottom line is the majority of my regular listeners do not seem to communicate with anyone else about the show.

699
01:43:49,340 --> 01:43:55,340
Right. Anything is to attract people that are good at communicating. That would be preferable.

700
01:43:55,340 --> 01:44:03,340
Right. This way the information could be, you know, and again, it's the information that is key. It's not about, you know, it no offense to you.

701
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:10,340
Right. The only thing about giving information to someone, anyone that helps their lives and they can't spread that, they have to give something.

702
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:18,340
They have to give something in return. Emphasis on the half, they have to give something in return because that's, you know, fair exchange.

703
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:24,340
Unless they're on the poverty level, meaning poverty is poor in spirit and then of course you want to help the poor.

704
01:44:24,340 --> 01:44:30,340
Right. But when they get off that poverty level, then to go on from there.

705
01:44:30,340 --> 01:44:39,340
See, that's why the Greeks, I never really pursued it. I've pursued other things in audio design and other forms of engineering that I'm working on.

706
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:46,340
But when I say audio design, I mean a way of producing sound that has never been heard before.

707
01:44:46,340 --> 01:44:55,340
Like a small speaker that's under your arm that sounds more clear and more base and louder than a, you know, a large floor standing thing, right?

708
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:59,340
It's just some kind of different physics I'm using.

709
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:02,340
Oh, and some of your private Newtonian's. Yeah, and some of your guys.

710
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:12,340
It's not Newtonian. It's a can break the laws of physics, but Newton's been dead for a long time and there is a category called non-Newtonian fluids and non-Newtonian physics. Finally, not quantum garbage.

711
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:27,340
But the thing is I've never leaned on promoting the Greek speak. I've never done other than a website which is strictly for, you know, it's easier to go to uncommonradio.com and find the email. That's all that's on there.

712
01:45:27,340 --> 01:45:36,340
There's no longer an archive on uncommon radio or anything, right? Nothing. There's just an email. It's just go to uncommon radio. That's where you send an email and that's it.

713
01:45:36,340 --> 01:45:45,340
I mean, I'm not doing. I have other emails and stuff for other purposes, but, but the thing is if you're going to be giving information to those that can't spread it because this is altruistic.

714
01:45:45,340 --> 01:45:57,340
If you know something that can help someone and others and whoever is receiving it is not spreading it to others, then it's kind of like just a single use thing, not getting anything back.

715
01:45:57,340 --> 01:46:08,340
It has to be fair exchange of some sort. And that's why I look at all the models, like people that grow channels and immediately donate.

716
01:46:08,340 --> 01:46:17,340
Here's my Patreon. Here's my Bimea coffee. Here's my membership because in, innately they understand that they should get something back for what they're doing.

717
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:30,340
And if they just put it out openly, they're probably not going to get anything back. So if you're doing this for a living or trying to doing something worthwhile living,

718
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:42,340
look, if you're painting houses or sweeping streets or a shoveling coal or shoveling shit or whatever, and it's useful to society or useful to people, you should get something in return.

719
01:46:42,340 --> 01:46:53,340
No, this is true. And the problem with this, you know, a newer paradigm regarding the model of information distribution is that for the most part, there must be like a free level to it.

720
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:59,340
And then something behind a paywall, something that is, you know, for that exchange.

721
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:10,340
Of course. And it should be good. I've sometimes people email me things that are behind a paywall, they're remembering, like, what do you think of this?

722
01:47:10,340 --> 01:47:17,340
And I'm like, I'm not, it hasn't very little value. Here's the whole thing.

723
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:31,340
I found that other than looking up, you know, how to change a water pump on YouTube, you know, it's very helpful because you've actually, if you've never changed a water pump on like a 2000 Dodge Caravan 3.0, for example,

724
01:47:31,340 --> 01:47:43,340
it's good to watch your video, what to expect, right? At least you get something out of that. But the majority of what's on YouTube is just taking up your time. It's a dummy load. You know, do you want to just kill two hours or whatever?

725
01:47:43,340 --> 01:47:55,340
So, oh no, the most useful stuff I've found on YouTube, honestly, is like, look, this is how you use your software. This is how you, you think your computer faster without downloading cleaning programs.

726
01:47:55,340 --> 01:48:00,340
Yeah, stuff like that. Or even, you know, look, your computer has a problem. Here's how you might be able to address it.

727
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:02,340
Right. Stuff like that. Very practical.

728
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:04,340
Do you like it? Yeah. All DIY stuff. Yeah.

729
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:21,340
Yeah. But, yeah, but the thing is, there's something called medical advice and legal advice and all this other stuff. You know, when you study the laws on that, it's only those, you know, there's plenty of people in, quote unquote, prison for practicing law of all license or medical,

730
01:48:21,340 --> 01:48:35,340
some of our license, right? And they've been tricked into that because the actual laws and codes are, if you've been licensed and lost your license or haven't renewed it, that those are the only people to be charged with those crimes.

731
01:48:35,340 --> 01:48:46,340
But there's plenty of people that have been peddling, let's say, what's called legal information, especially in the Patriot community or with medical stuff that have gotten in trouble. They don't understand how that works.

732
01:48:46,340 --> 01:48:55,340
So that the, and it's always misconstrued. And also, if you're speaking anything political, it's always going to be pro this or anti that, right?

733
01:48:55,340 --> 01:49:07,340
If you're speaking about, let's say, what the holy rites of the world, they're going to think you're pro religion or anti-religion or the brand you as one religion, or I'm not religious, right?

734
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:24,340
So there's, so I think the category of putting everything under history, right? So if you want to speak about how to basically fix the human body, put it under medical history, or legal history, or whatever, right?

735
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:33,340
Because when you're watching a YouTube to get something out of it on how to fix your computer, that's historical because it was done prior to you watching it, right?

736
01:49:33,340 --> 01:49:44,340
So everything is in history, even look, in order for something to happen, it must already exist because things that don't exist just don't come into existence and happen.

737
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:48,340
It already exists. You just haven't gotten there yet, right?

738
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:54,340
So everything is in history. That's why I said, when you, when you understand in the past prophecy, it's history of the future.

739
01:49:54,340 --> 01:50:00,340
We write history of the past. Well, we don't really have any real history.

740
01:50:00,340 --> 01:50:13,340
Right. But the what's coming is already happened, but not within our vantage point. Right, right? And you know, the thing is, look, I've already seen advice. Don't put this on Patreon or anything.

741
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:29,340
No, I don't think it needs to be anywhere like that. No, no, no, hold on, those things are necessity. Those things need to be in place because that's how society works. Like, for example, if you go to the stove and want to buy something, they expect you.

742
01:50:29,340 --> 01:50:38,340
Through tradition to go to the cash register is something I pointed out was with someone at Walmart, right? Right.

743
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:47,340
And I'm looking, I said, look, I said, is that the self checkout, right? Waiting there to get some soaps and things like that.

744
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:56,340
And I said, look around the walls and I was like, huh? Why? I said, look around all this. Look, this is the exit. This is the entrance. This is where the customer services.

745
01:50:56,340 --> 01:51:08,340
These are the counters. Look, look at the walls. Look, if you see any big signs that you must come to checkout first and quote unquote, pay for it before you leave. It doesn't say that anywhere.

746
01:51:08,340 --> 01:51:23,340
You know why? Because everything's already been paid for. But customarily, you have to go to the cashier or the self checkout and process a card or get put some paper in the machine. And then you can get a receipt and walk out. Right.

747
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:34,340
Customary. No, where does it say in these big stores or even small stores that you have to stop at the cash register and do some kind of transaction before you leave? It's customary, isn't it?

748
01:51:34,340 --> 01:51:48,340
Well, yes, do it. I mean try try to try to violate the customs. See what happens. I've seen a lot of people just walk right out. No problem. See, I've seen that too. And I wonder about it because I've also seen the other way too. You know, it's already prepaid by the way.

749
01:51:48,340 --> 01:51:58,340
I know you choose your it's not stealing, but I'm not saying you should do that because the good customs, right, will require otherwise.

750
01:51:58,340 --> 01:52:07,340
Here's the whole point in this. These customs should be avoided when they're totally unlawful, which most of them are.

751
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:17,340
But it comes to you come to a point where it's not avoidable anymore, right? Like in other words, you have to drink your own pee to save your life if you're stuck in a room somewhere for days and days, right?

752
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:25,340
Well, see, but here's the thing, right? I feel as though I must personally exchange something for value. If I receive something for value, right? Yeah.

753
01:52:25,340 --> 01:52:36,340
So I feel as though it is an obligation of mine to not simply walk out with any regardless of what it is. I'm supposedly entitled to or not. Right.

754
01:52:36,340 --> 01:52:43,340
How about that kind of perspective? I mean, is that not a problem? Here's the thing.

755
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:54,340
This is planet earth, right? So bars. I know it's very simple. Yes. The saving grace of the educational system is this.

756
01:52:54,340 --> 01:53:05,340
Everything they're telling you about anything. Just reverse it and the reverse is true. That's how close. That's how accurate it is. In other words, right?

757
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:20,340
So even though, like, for example, all college degrees or a BS degree, right? You know that if they tell you what's this, the exact opposite is true. So they're very reliable that way.

758
01:53:20,340 --> 01:53:28,340
It's not like a mixed bag. Right? No, it's not like your news or real pet. Look, if they tell you there's a pandemic, there is no pandemic. Right?

759
01:53:28,340 --> 01:53:40,340
Not like the other terrorism. There is no terrorist. But your news media doesn't quite function like that. And not like the education system because they mix things together. It's not a one to one reversal.

760
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:50,340
I have it. Well, here's the thing. I found that the main. Well, you're talking about mainstream media is so bizarre in its thought pattern, which we didn't get into the filtering, by the way, in the coding. No, we didn't.

761
01:53:50,340 --> 01:54:07,340
Yeah, that it's it's very coded. Maybe I'll jump into that real quick. Okay, sure. We can go over time a little bit if you know how does that be have sentinels, right? They watch what's going on. And like let's say you were security at a football game or a big public event.

762
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:21,340
You're watching the event. You might enjoy it, but you're also watching the crowd and someone who's well seasoned in security will know will notice things that potentially could become hazardous to the group. Right?

763
01:54:21,340 --> 01:54:28,340
You know, I know that this is absolutely true because you're well well. Well, you and I have had plenty of private conversations. You know I worked in security. Right.

764
01:54:28,340 --> 01:54:41,340
So you're watching the crowd very careful, even though there's a band playing on stage or whatever, right? And this is without all forms of security. So you're watching say, Oh, you see this right here. This is going to might turn into something we need to focus.

765
01:54:41,340 --> 01:54:49,340
I'm watching packages. I'm watching things that are left on the floor. I'm watching all kinds of stuff that nobody's looking at when I'm working here. Yes, good.

766
01:54:49,340 --> 01:55:04,340
Right. So imagine you have a way to label the status of the group and you do it through the language. So for example, let's use the biblical text or any religious text, by the way, works with every religion.

767
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:08,340
But let's use the Western biblical one.

768
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:16,340
They've changed everything around the perception of it so much that it's again, almost polar opposite, whatever you read, it's the opposite of what people think.

769
01:55:16,340 --> 01:55:29,340
So you put out this Jesus character, J-E-S-U-S, right? Well, first of all, anyone who's got half a brain knows it's not an English document is written in Hebrew. So be Yahshua.

770
01:55:29,340 --> 01:55:38,340
And the sixth book is the book of Joshua. Please call it Joshua with a J. Why didn't they call him Joshua's name was Joshua. Something's wrong.

771
01:55:38,340 --> 01:55:51,340
It's really fishy to call him J-E-S-U-S. So when you put your security out there to watch the crowds, if everyone is using the J-E-S-U-S, that means they all fell for it and you're fine.

772
01:55:51,340 --> 01:55:57,340
You don't have to hide anything. You don't have to redact anything. You don't have to propagandaize anything, right?

773
01:55:57,340 --> 01:56:23,340
They already used it while using the code. They already read to that code which again involves the letter J which wasn't even in. Right, but let's say for go that and it's used as Joshua now and said, "Well, the why it's a J." That's fine too, but why not call him Joshua? Why they turn it to J-E-S? It's so distorted to make it so an eight-year-old with a mild awareness of the history of it. We'll see it.

774
01:56:23,340 --> 01:56:45,340
Now here's another example. You have to pay for that. No. They got everyone saying, "How much did you pay for that?" Oh, I paid for this. Okay. No, there is no pay. You cannot pay. What you do is you settle. You settle. You do not pay. You satisfy or you settle. Did you settle that with them? Right, did you settle on that? Right? Okay. There is no pay.

775
01:56:45,340 --> 01:56:58,340
There is no pay. So if they got everyone saying, "That's paid or I'm going to pay or you paid or you have to pay the security." Right? You know the security is is another thing, but let's say they're watching societies.

776
01:56:58,340 --> 01:57:13,340
Oh yeah, these are all idiots here. They're fine. They're all subdued. Well, the term and insecurity literally when you're dealing with transactional things is to settle up. Right? That is not paying. You cannot pay. You settle with, that's why you have legal tenders. You cannot pay with legal tenders.

777
01:57:13,340 --> 01:57:25,340
Or legal tenders to satisfy. Right? So even when we're examining loss prevention and leakage and things like this, these are all terms, by the way, used in you know, very short. Yeah, it has been settled. Right? Because legal say has no legal bearing. Right?

778
01:57:25,340 --> 01:57:42,340
So it's funny. We someone once wrote a letter to an attorney and we mentioned a bunch of things and I said, "If you don't understand anything, if you do have problems understanding or difficult understanding what's in this document, you should consult a lawyer."

779
01:57:42,340 --> 01:57:54,340
This is writing to an attorney because you know what I mean? It's kind of like a double and it's kind of like saying to a psychiatrist anyone who wants to see a psychiatrist should have their head examined, right?

780
01:57:54,340 --> 01:58:09,340
But so all of these terms that are put out there that are completely non-sex-sensical in the context of late things work are coded messages for the security crew, security, what do you call them? Crew, security team, whatever.

781
01:58:09,340 --> 01:58:21,340
That is watching to write in their log at the end of the day, are we having, did everything go smoothly? Right? Or are we having problems that we have to take care of? Right.

782
01:58:21,340 --> 01:58:30,340
So when you have people in the religious circles using J.S. U.S. or G.O.D. Oh yeah, these people are totally, they don't know anything. Right.

783
01:58:30,340 --> 01:58:51,340
When they have to say that they have to pay or they have debt, right? They don't know anything. They're totally fine. Right? You see? The medical goes the same way. Right? The blood, some people say, "Look, I went to the doctor and said, "Hold on. Before you tell me what he said, did he strap a cuff on you and tell you you have blood pressure?"

784
01:58:51,340 --> 01:59:03,340
He says, "Yeah, he did. That's a quack. That's a total quack, which is standard, by the way. Standard is, can quackery become a standard?" Here.

785
01:59:03,340 --> 01:59:12,340
Rat feces in food is monitored, Rat feces at food processing locations is monitored by the FDA. Okay? Right.

786
01:59:12,340 --> 01:59:25,340
How much Rat feces is allowable at the location? Now, long time ago, they found that all the hot dog manufacturers not only had Rat feces at their food processing locations, but it was some of it also getting into the food.

787
01:59:25,340 --> 01:59:30,340
They can't shut down all the hot dog manufacturers in Mary. There'll be a revolution. Right?

788
01:59:30,340 --> 01:59:42,340
There's also an allowable level of... So they allow it? This is disturbing, too, by the way, just a quick point. There's an allowable level of human flesh in your hot dog also.

789
01:59:42,340 --> 01:59:43,340
Well, if you...

790
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:52,340
If you've been eating pork since the 70s, let's say, I've been a whole old, you are definitely...

791
01:59:52,340 --> 02:00:02,340
Let's say, you have human... In other words, there is no processed pork on the market that does not show human DNA. Put it that way. Let's go that way.

792
02:00:02,340 --> 02:00:15,340
Let's make it to the extreme at this point. There's human DNA. In other words, you're eating pork, you're eating people, but it's usually in the ground-up version. That's very well-known, and it's left about just like chemtrails are left about.

793
02:00:15,340 --> 02:00:27,340
So if you research chemtrails, it's all conspiracy theories, but if you put in a stratospheric aerosol injection, you'll find all the patents and all the groups that are doing it and all that.

794
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:39,340
You can find a lawsuit from what is in 1971 regarding chemtrails being created over the state of New Jersey, because it was creating too many artificial clouds.

795
02:00:39,340 --> 02:00:44,340
And therefore, it's a stratospheric aerosol injection.

796
02:00:44,340 --> 02:00:54,340
So, you know what I say, no pork on my fork, and there's a reason for it. Because it's so similar to human flesh that there are people that...

797
02:00:54,340 --> 02:01:00,340
You know what a prank is, right? That's another part of the Greek speak, the pranking element. It's all about pranks.

798
02:01:00,340 --> 02:01:12,340
The worst thing I've ever been hearing since I learned how the money system works is they're going to war for money. No, there is no money. That's nothing to do with that.

799
02:01:12,340 --> 02:01:18,340
They're going to war because you want to go to war. You know, people do.

800
02:01:18,340 --> 02:01:27,340
Well, that becomes terribly twisted. That is a discussion for, I think, a separate presentation even.

801
02:01:27,340 --> 02:01:37,340
Okay, let's just a bit of deal and I appreciate you having me on because it's like a memory of things we've done that were done very well.

802
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:48,340
Well, I always enjoy this because quite frankly, every time, again, the little tagline I put on the website, right, revelation to conversation is meaningful to me.

803
02:01:48,340 --> 02:02:01,340
Every time I have a conversation with someone who is, you know, in a different frame of mind, which is always a guarantee, right? Nobody's in exactly the same frame of mind that I am.

804
02:02:01,340 --> 02:02:07,340
You know, here I go using all kinds of sloppy, ham-handed phrases, right?

805
02:02:07,340 --> 02:02:17,340
I like doing this with you occasionally gets them upset and then he goes on a tear about something I just said that is really badly worded.

806
02:02:17,340 --> 02:02:28,340
And we wind up discussing etymology and we wind up discussing the actual roots of things as opposed to, you know, the general convention, the conveyance that they tell you about.

807
02:02:28,340 --> 02:02:38,340
For actual reserve banking, sure you've heard about that elsewhere. I mean, I love the presentation in that movie, a zeitgeist about it, you know. I'm sure you've seen that.

808
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:45,340
Yeah, but they look what they do in two hours was zeitgeist. We could do in 15 minutes and you'll get more out of it.

809
02:02:45,340 --> 02:02:51,340
See, that's the thing is that a whole lot of this stuff that we have done and is now not available as it was.

810
02:02:51,340 --> 02:03:04,340
Well, look, we can go on and on and on, but I recently, past year or two, been doing some private Skype conversations with someone that's important to me because, you know, I studied the ancient hybrach text and this person is from Israel.

811
02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:15,340
And the reason they're important to me is when I bring up some ancient hybrach text, I asked them if you read this, if a modern day Hebrew speaker read this, would it be understood?

812
02:03:15,340 --> 02:03:22,340
Are they still using in the, you know, in my litmus? This is yeah, or sometimes we'll see that word stop being used anymore, right?

813
02:03:22,340 --> 02:03:25,340
You know, if you're reading bail wolf, it's old English, right?

814
02:03:25,340 --> 02:03:36,340
So, so I'm trying to figure it so that person, but I said, how do you find out about Greek speak? And he says, well, years ago, I used to go to the office, which is Starbucks, you meet up with some local people, right? And they have coffee or walks of life.

815
02:03:36,340 --> 02:03:45,340
And this person works in physical therapy and there would be an attorney there next firefighter or whatever. He just saw kinds of people.

816
02:03:45,340 --> 02:03:56,340
Well, he didn't know about Greek speak and this attorney, a lawyer goes to him and says, listen, you got to hear this guy the Greek and I listened to him for, in 50, he did a 15 minute explanation on how the money system works.

817
02:03:56,340 --> 02:04:07,340
I've never heard it explained so simply before I use it all the time. Really? So it was an attorney that heard this, that enjoyed it and conveyed it to someone who I consider a friend now.

818
02:04:07,340 --> 02:04:14,340
Is that interesting? You just never know who is going to find out and, you know, use it or whatever, you know?

819
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:21,340
Well, see, that's the funny thing about lawyers and attorneys and, you know, people go, well, they must know the law and this and that. Actually, what they know how to do is tell a story.

820
02:04:21,340 --> 02:04:25,340
Yeah, well, the attorney is not a lawyer because you can give, here's a proof of that.

821
02:04:25,340 --> 02:04:31,340
Well, that's why I separate you. You can give attorneys and lawyers. You can give power of attorney. A attorney just means they represent you can sign for you.

822
02:04:31,340 --> 02:04:38,340
Like, for example, I can give you power of attorney over the car, the house, the bank, whatever you can make me your attorney.

823
02:04:38,340 --> 02:04:49,340
So to speak, I practice them all. No, attorney, right? In other words, an attorney is power of attorneys. It's all by, a lawyer is knowledgeable in the law and a friend of the court.

824
02:04:49,340 --> 02:04:54,340
Attorney is just representing an incompetent or someone who is not available because they're incompetent, right?

825
02:04:54,340 --> 02:05:03,340
Or even in the case of, say, a medical issue, if you give someone the power to make medical decisions for you when you've been put into surgery or whatever, they are technically your.

826
02:05:03,340 --> 02:05:10,340
And there is no, the medical industry, there are no doctors, by the way, medical doctors are medical technicians. They're not really doctors.

827
02:05:10,340 --> 02:05:21,340
And they are part of the legal system. I've witnessed this more than a dozen times in my life where I've asked certain doctors, why are they prescribing this with that when it's obvious as well.

828
02:05:21,340 --> 02:05:29,340
And why don't we just do this herbal tincture instead, which is where it was garnered from with no side effects is, well, legally, I can't tell you that.

829
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:36,340
Well, legally, wait a second. You know, legally, what do you mean legally? I thought you're, you know, not this is about health and medicine.

830
02:05:36,340 --> 02:05:43,340
So it's really the attorneys that are running every, well, the attorneys are the trustees for the bankruptcy, right?

831
02:05:43,340 --> 02:05:53,340
So, and well, everything's bankrupted, you know. But people don't understand that all of your institutions are running on emergency status.

832
02:05:53,340 --> 02:06:02,340
So, like every year they sign in every few years, the state of emergency, right? Politically, you can look it up. It's in the federal register.

833
02:06:02,340 --> 02:06:08,340
No, that's all true. And of course, we have also covered that as well.

834
02:06:08,340 --> 02:06:20,340
And I look forward to this. If you're very serious about revisiting this and doing the short term, I'm already seeing some interest. Some people would really love to hear some of these things again.

835
02:06:20,340 --> 02:06:37,340
Also, an expansion of information because some years ago, again, about eight, according to, you know, that Gregorian thing, that calendar, about eight years ago, you and I are talking about things that were going to happen in about 10 years.

836
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:49,340
So it's right right right on her. And some things are happening that we discussed. In fact, if you go back to the medical discussion, I got to tell you that there's a pretty stark description from the Greek about,

837
02:06:49,340 --> 02:07:04,340
theoretically, I said these things about viruses, they're going to use, they're going to bio-terrorism. In other words, that the powers that be or what you consider, the authorities are going to terrorize you with that.

838
02:07:04,340 --> 02:07:08,340
Right. I've said it. That was very clear about that long time ago. No, you were.

839
02:07:08,340 --> 02:07:20,340
You were. Indeed, I have carried with me ever after the challenge to many people. Okay, do me a favor. If there is something that exists, that's called a virus.

840
02:07:20,340 --> 02:07:34,340
It does. It's just like litter. It's just like litter on the street. No, I understand. But what I have asked people to do is show me a photograph. You must admit, if something exists, you can photograph it.

841
02:07:34,340 --> 02:07:44,340
Yes, or no. Well, in the other thing with the shots and the injections, I've been looking at that, always touting an NIH document, 900 pages long.

842
02:07:44,340 --> 02:08:00,340
Can't find it now, by the way, I have it on a dead computer. Basically, it's 982 pages or something. You read the introduction and asks about the efficacy of, in, you know, immune boosting stuff, you know, basically vaccines.

843
02:08:00,340 --> 02:08:12,340
And you go to the conclusion, 981 pages, and they basically say it's inconclusive. Why, what are you going to read in between? Right? But when you read it in between, this is what you find out.

844
02:08:12,340 --> 02:08:25,340
Recently, I was out about recently a year ago. There was like a little thing set up to do the, you know, the shot. And someone was speaking and everyone frowned and said, "Oh, you're one of those anti-vaxxer nut jobs, right?"

845
02:08:25,340 --> 02:08:33,340
Well, I walked up forward and I said, "Well, look, are you taking into account the blood type and body weight of who's going to be getting the shot?"

846
02:08:33,340 --> 02:08:42,340
And they also have to take in consideration if they're male, female, and their race as well. Are you taking those things in considered? Because all the studies, that's how they do it.

847
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:53,340
When you get a shot, they have to know your blood type, body weight, male, female, right? Yeah. Black, white, or Asian. Because if you speak to an anesthesiologist,

848
02:08:53,340 --> 02:08:56,340
it's very determinative there, regarding... And by the way, yeah.

849
02:08:56,340 --> 02:09:02,340
Yes, Asia, here's the funny thing. Most anesthesiologists have no concept as to why anesthesia works, actually.

850
02:09:02,340 --> 02:09:10,340
Oh, yeah, but here's the interesting thing. There is a 90-pound white girl with red hair and freckles needs an appendectomy.

851
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:11,340
Right.

852
02:09:11,340 --> 02:09:15,340
And there's a 300-pound black guy that needs an appendectomy.

853
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:15,340
Right.

854
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:22,340
Okay, the amount of anesthetic that you have to give the 90-pound white girl with red hair and freckles will kill the 300-pound black guy.

855
02:09:22,340 --> 02:09:27,340
So there is such a thing called medical racism, just like you won't find pro-Zak in Asia.

856
02:09:27,340 --> 02:09:31,340
Because in places like Korea, Northern China, if you take pro-Zak, you die.

857
02:09:31,340 --> 02:09:35,340
Yeah, it doesn't. Yeah, it doesn't. It's not... It's totally illegal there because...

858
02:09:35,340 --> 02:09:36,340
Yeah, it literally just...

859
02:09:36,340 --> 02:09:44,340
Yeah, so there is medical racism. So anyway, all the studies about things that are injected and all these immune, whatever,

860
02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:52,340
if they're not taking a great consideration, all these things that we just... It's a one-size-fits-all hoax.

861
02:09:52,340 --> 02:10:02,340
Well, it's funny. I forgot about that when recently there was a discussion about a K-pop star who was sentenced for a felony in Korea

862
02:10:02,340 --> 02:10:07,340
because they had one of these SSRIs in their possession.

863
02:10:07,340 --> 02:10:17,340
Now, I guess that their ancestry not entirely Korean. So this again changes things. I mean, even...

864
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:20,340
Well, blood disease is a cool reasonemia, sickle cell anemia.

865
02:10:20,340 --> 02:10:27,340
They're the same thing. All these other genetic traits, we are... We're all the same, really, but we have variations.

866
02:10:27,340 --> 02:10:31,340
But there are variations, but those variations that are related are related for a reason.

867
02:10:31,340 --> 02:10:36,340
And the thing is that K-pop star got in all this trouble for having something that would be commonly in somebody's pocket here

868
02:10:36,340 --> 02:10:45,340
in the United States. Sure, sure. But this is... And a pharma. In other words, it was a typical pharmaceutical here, but lethal on there.

869
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:50,340
Right, exactly. And you brought a K-pop star anemia. I bring that up all the time, too.

870
02:10:50,340 --> 02:10:57,340
Anyway, look, I'm gonna close this out now. And I look forward to having more discussions with you in the future.

871
02:10:57,340 --> 02:11:09,340
I certainly want to have another one publicly, for sure, maybe to announce formally what it is that you did propose to me privately.

872
02:11:09,340 --> 02:11:16,340
And then mention here on air, because I think we could do one of those things that I think is extremely worthwhile,

873
02:11:16,340 --> 02:11:26,340
which is informing people about the world around them, even if it is just that world that is within five feet of their reach from where the base of their body is.

874
02:11:26,340 --> 02:11:33,340
Right? I think that that is extremely affected because... And useful. No dummy load-free.

875
02:11:33,340 --> 02:11:46,340
Dummy load-free, which is interesting. Of course, I present sometimes opposition and commentary, but like you said, it's an Abbott and Costello on occasion, but if we condense it a bit, I think it's got to be...

876
02:11:46,340 --> 02:11:52,340
It's got to be. You've got to show both sides and what's great about both sides are on the same bird anyway, you know?

877
02:11:52,340 --> 02:11:59,340
Oh, there you go. The left and the right wing, it's still part of the bird. Up and down, inside out, left and out, all hot and cold, yeah.

878
02:11:59,340 --> 02:12:06,340
For better or worse, that's what it is. And so uncommon radio still exists, but uncommon radio...

879
02:12:06,340 --> 02:12:15,340
Just an email site. In other words, you go there and you just find the email and I'm very easy to access.

880
02:12:15,340 --> 02:12:25,340
Fair enough, and we're gonna access you a bit, and hopefully, yeah, we'll be able to really put out some useful...

881
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:38,340
See, that's the best part, is the useful stuff, like you and I both agreed about YouTube. It is so great when you get a hold of a piece of information you need, and they show it to you on a video there, right? DIY, how do you do that?

882
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:47,340
YouTube University, man. YouTube University, not so bad, and quite honestly, again, a lot better than the PS you might get elsewhere.

883
02:12:47,340 --> 02:13:00,340
So, we're closing this one out. Again, thank you, Greek. I always appreciate the Greek speed. Even if it takes me a little while to absorb it, and fully understand it, and I'm not even saying that I always do.

884
02:13:00,340 --> 02:13:11,340
So, there you go. But we'll get there. Anyways, the Ocele Effect is done for tonight. No matter who you are, where you are, when you are, because most of you catch this further on down the stream.

885
02:13:11,340 --> 02:13:20,340
By a podcast, I appreciate you, and I am Emilio Ocele, all of you are a GD Effect. Good night.

886
02:13:20,340 --> 02:13:43,340
