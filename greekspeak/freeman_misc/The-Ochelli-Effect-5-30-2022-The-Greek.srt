00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,680
You Chilly Effect is sponsored by Wall Street Window.com and listen to this like you.

2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,080
May 30, 2022, allegedly according to that thing we call a calendar, and this indeed is

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,360
the show you were looking for.

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,360
How do I know that?

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,120
Because you're hearing me say this.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,160
So it is a Monday or Monday according to the Pope's work schedule.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,960
There's a phrase that I don't often utter along with the rest of the beginning of the

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,840
show, you know why?

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,160
Because I got it off of somebody who explained it to me quite a while ago and was absolutely

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,480
correct when he did.

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,120
Of course, the first day of the week would be Sunday according to your calendar, right?

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,120
Sunday.

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,120
Why anyway?

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,960
Sunday, Monday, Tears Day, Wotens Day, Thursday, Friars Day, Saturn Day, and that completes

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,120
the cycle, doesn't it?

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,840
Where does it?

17
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,080
Where did we start talking about telling time and the fact that nobody on the planet actually

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,240
does it?

19
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,880
We did that on, well first, it was introduced to me on a show where I interviewed a guy

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,800
that I just knew as the Greek.

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,160
Now, I'd heard about him but didn't really talk to him before, did this some years ago,

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,640
and I think it was on American Freedom Radio.

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,560
Well, anyway, thanks to Danny Romero, we ended up doing a little show called O'Chelly

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,560
in the Greek.

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,880
What the hell?

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,040
You gotta say the things that people aren't saying sometimes because if you have knowledge

27
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,200
and you don't speak it, there is something about that.

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:48,320
But we might wind up discussing all that as we attempt to recap or add commentary to the

29
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,640
O'Chelly in the Greek shows, which were in two sections, two major sections anyway, and

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,880
we have revisited those topics over the years and done separate interviews or discussions

31
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,640
and whatnot and the Greek has been invited into many places, at least many by my count anyway.

32
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,320
Many places where they thought, "Oh, the O'Chelly in the Greek show is great."

33
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,840
They invite the Greek on, they never invite me because I'm just the guy framing it.

34
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,960
But anyway, thanks Freeman, who I invited on to my show and never invited me onto his,

35
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:26,120
and stuff like that, but all petty, petty concerns, the world is strange and it's even stranger

36
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,000
when you actually pay attention to what's happening and what's about to happen.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,960
The Greek is with me, how you doing, man?

38
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,840
Hey, I'm doing, doing what the Greek does.

39
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,560
So we're here for another one because every time we do something, it's another one, right?

40
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,560
It absolutely is.

41
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,760
It's certainly another one.

42
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,640
I forgot to ask you before we went to air, we could take phone calls, but I didn't really

43
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,600
promote this or anything, so probably nobody's prepared to take the calls and they'll get

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,400
the podcast later.

45
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,960
I guess they possibly say anyway.

46
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,120
Any question they have has already been answered?

47
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,000
Think about it.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,280
That's true when we're talking about recapping the stuff we already covered.

49
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,760
Of course, you and I discussed some things in private and semi-private before, the public,

50
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:31,120
the private conversation and public concept, the water episode, which is still somewhere

51
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,320
on O'Cellys.com.

52
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:41,040
It's not there right out in public because it wasn't meant to be shared far and wide, but

53
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,280
we should be.

54
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,440
We've got more stuff in the bag as they speak.

55
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,840
We got something, let's say we meaning because you never really come up with anything on your

56
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,360
own, right?

57
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
Completely.

58
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
Cosmic forces, right?

59
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,680
Oh, look at this.

60
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,160
I have a listener in the chat room who's very familiar with you who is actually asking what

61
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,200
day it is.

62
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,200
That's what I was about to do.

63
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,720
I think, I don't know if you stepped on me or I stepped on you, we cross hairs there a little

64
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,000
bit and I was going to say it's very simply the 16th day of the third month.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,280
You got to really think about it this way though.

66
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,760
The day starts at noon.

67
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,400
You know how they, you look up moon phases on Wikipedia and it's 29.3 or 28.6 days.

68
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,200
That's because they're trying to wiggle it into a midnight schedule, but if you do it at

69
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,040
noon, if it starts at noon, meaning high noon, right?

70
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,360
The zenith.

71
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,200
Because you know there's actually a noon in the middle of the night also, but that's

72
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,520
another story.

73
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,520
That's more advanced.

74
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,800
We've only talked about stuff on second grade level.

75
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,520
That would be third, fourth grade.

76
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:50,280
But it's the, as of noon time today, it kicked over to the 16th day.

77
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,680
And your day of rest, you know how every culture has a seventh day of rest, you know, culture

78
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,760
had it except for the Mayans because they were working on another solar system.

79
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,480
They only had a 20 day month, right?

80
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,200
But every culture, you know, even the, you know, I mean when I say pagan, you know there's

81
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,040
about 3,500 different tribes or groups of it.

82
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,360
They know about the seventh day.

83
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,560
So that just happened.

84
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,240
So your seventh day of rest is on the eighth day of the month, the 15th, 22nd and 29th,

85
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,280
and then your last day is the 30th.

86
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,840
And when you figure out that the day starts at high noon, just like anybody grew up in the

87
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,760
50s, 60s and 70s, remember the old banking convention before it was electronic?

88
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,760
What happens?

89
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,960
Well, how did they date the checks when they brought in after 12 o'clock?

90
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
They dated them the next day, remember that?

91
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,960
That's right.

92
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,960
That's right.

93
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
That's right.

94
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,960
That's right.

95
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,960
And no, they did that.

96
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,040
And actually they did that all the way up into the 90s even with the different communications

97
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,600
now starting to really be prolific as far as computers go.

98
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,720
It still was that way.

99
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,000
Yeah, you bring it in.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,360
Why is this, I actually ask that question, I think, when I was 16 or so.

101
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,640
And I cast a check and they stated that it was cast on the next day.

102
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,440
I said is that a state?

103
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
Is it the old system?

104
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,640
It's the, well, it's the slave, you know, instead of calling it the United Nations, it's

105
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:21,240
really, it was initially, there's two United Nations, the one that started in the Presidio

106
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,480
to fight Japan and then it was reorganized in '47 and it was the Vatican consolidated slave

107
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,800
holdings.

108
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,720
But that didn't go good, so they bought the United Nations anyway.

109
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,000
Anyway, yeah.

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So where are we at?

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Where are we at?

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,320
By the way, one of my regular listeners actually said he's very happy that he is still tracking

113
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,640
with the correct date as he knows it.

114
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,720
So you just declared it.

115
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Yeah, I know who it is.

116
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
Yeah.

117
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,520
He's made me aware of that as well.

118
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
Oh, okay.

119
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,120
Well, it's not, it's not Joe just in case you think it's.

120
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
Oh, it's not.

121
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,360
Well, I hope there's, well, you know, here's the thing.

122
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,640
If half the world helped one person, everybody's taken care of.

123
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,640
True enough.

124
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,960
So if one third of the world took care of two people, everybody's taken, if one person took

125
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,680
care of 100 people, everybody's taken care of.

126
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,920
So you know, in meaning one percent, see, so if you do something in life that makes someone

127
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,240
else's life better, right?

128
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,600
That's quite an accomplishment.

129
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,720
You know, there's a lot of sayings about that, right?

130
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Oh, yeah.

131
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,360
So I've gotten about 1200 emails in the past seven years that are specific, not 1200 emails,

132
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
total, but 1200.

133
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,680
A thousand or 1200, including some that are 24 pages long, not paragraphs or pages, they

134
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,080
have to be PDF.

135
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,720
Anyway, that they tell me generally because of what you've said, not because of me, you've

136
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,800
got to be very careful because you told me your life is better because of me.

137
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,040
I'm going to slap you down or drop you like a hot potato.

138
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
It's not me.

139
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
It's what I'm saying.

140
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,720
It's a big difference.

141
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,360
You know, when you get a $50,000, let's say check in the mail, do you go and hug and kiss

142
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
the postman?

143
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,360
You know what?

144
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,640
You know, there's nothing to do with it.

145
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,080
He just brought it to you.

146
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
Yeah.

147
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,080
You don't even know.

148
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,440
You don't even want to look at his ugly face.

149
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,240
So anytime, so I'm just saying.

150
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,240
So for her.

151
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,640
Yeah, I'm just going to say I have a lady who I know.

152
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,640
I know what to keep time.

153
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,040
I know who the gods are, which is a bad word.

154
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,440
I think we've gone over, you know, as we go down, we're going to pick these titles down.

155
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
You know, there are no gods.

156
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,200
I hope you guys know that.

157
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:39,200
It's a very poor use.

158
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,960
We'll get into that briefly.

159
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,160
Chalk the hashtag up, but they eat better.

160
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,160
They think better.

161
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,160
They sleep better.

162
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,160
They're finances are better.

163
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
Right.

164
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
We're actually finances are better.

165
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
There may be less in fewer zeros, but the quality is better, right?

166
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
Fair enough.

167
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
So on and on and on.

168
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,040
So if everybody else, I can get a couple more people to do that on what they do well.

169
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,560
Nope, not, not say what I'm saying, but say what they say in their expertise field and

170
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
share it.

171
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
Right.

172
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
So.

173
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Okay.

174
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,560
Well, let's go.

175
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,840
You know, let's, let's, let's begin.

176
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,120
Well, let, let, let's, let's take the old episodes as a framework, right?

177
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,080
And I know exactly the first organized episode because we had a couple of discussions before

178
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,320
that and we went around different things and made some jokes and had a good time and,

179
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,200
and, and, and by the way, I never object to that.

180
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,680
We consider you until jokes, Greek.

181
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:30,520
I mean, this is a positive thing to do too, but since we're on, on, on track here to do something,

182
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,480
I, I have the idea that we should begin with, everything is external input.

183
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Now, right.

184
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,240
And I said, I found the playlist.

185
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,560
It won't show up on a search, but it'll show up on a regular search on a browser, right?

186
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,760
On, so it's, and this is the first episode is on the bottom of the playlist.

187
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Okay.

188
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,960
I don't know if anybody could follow because I, I, there are a couple of people that I've

189
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,360
told that do have you two, right?

190
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,240
And I was to go listen to this series, right?

191
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,800
And it's old because it's, it, it doesn't matter if you listen to this, we had a hundred years,

192
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,120
a hundred years, and I would still be relevant.

193
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,680
And it would be relevant a hundred years ago.

194
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
External input.

195
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,040
Yeah, we got into how we're, um, listen to the episode, you know, you know, when, you,

196
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,760
when you have a squirrel raised, I mean, a dog raised by gorillas, it still acts like

197
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,680
a dog, but a human raised by gorillas will act like a gorilla.

198
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,680
Why?

199
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,160
Because most of the animals and creatures on this planet come preloaded, preloaded software,

200
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
don't they?

201
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
Right?

202
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
We don't.

203
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,960
We actually mimic, we need a school.

204
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,960
I mean, like, you know, a training from the beginning.

205
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,760
I mean, think about potty training, right?

206
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
Oh my goodness.

207
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,240
Could you imagine when, when, when would you figure out, you know, how to use that apparatus

208
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,680
or that the proper squatting position, right?

209
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,960
What, you'd have to be able to walk first, right?

210
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
Right.

211
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,640
And we talked about how that's not just psychological, but it's physical.

212
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,280
I mean, for instance, a horse drops out of mama horse.

213
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,720
That thing will stand up pretty quick and be able to walk around.

214
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,720
I mean, it may not run like a race horse right away, but, you know, that's, that's an added

215
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
feature, right?

216
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,200
Typically, those herd animals within a week, they're capable of the herd, they're capable

217
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
in the herd within a week.

218
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
Right.

219
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,240
There, there's a level of being adept, maybe a bit limited at first, but it's, it's not

220
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,920
long after that they are equal and growing into their place, quickly.

221
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,080
People are not so much.

222
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,840
Never so much.

223
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Right.

224
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,680
The thing I would add to that is, this work always continues.

225
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:41,000
It'll be, until my last breath, inquiring about the truth.

226
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,960
This kind of stems over into the container, but there's a lot of talk.

227
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,640
But, you know, there's this echo chamber in Italian they call them papagallo, right?

228
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,280
It's like a parrot, you just want to, Polly want to crack her, right?

229
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,480
Everybody's repeating everybody else.

230
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,240
I understand the political stuff because if you got, you know, and I understand the current

231
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,600
event stuff, but if you spend more than five minutes on a year of papagallo, you know,

232
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
I know you do that too.

233
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,480
I'm not saying this against you, because we have a relationship, but it's a, it's an honest

234
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,680
and objective criticism.

235
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,520
There's so much stuff that can be discussed and if you start from the beginning, you won't

236
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,760
you'll be discussing current events from 3,500 years ago and you'll never catch up.

237
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,720
So I could see why people do want to discuss it.

238
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,440
The thing that I don't like about it is they're just piggybacking, they're riding the wake

239
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,720
of the mainstream, you know, because most of these people on this planet, which we'll

240
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,400
get into later when we talk about the constitution, it's important too, our, it's a herd mentality.

241
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,800
And it's beyond that.

242
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,520
That's how they were raised in external input, right?

243
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,160
But the thing that I want to talk about really that bridges over to the physiology of it.

244
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,680
I've been looking at this DNA and that's what I said, why, before I said DNA and genetics,

245
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,520
it's really genetics.

246
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,040
You hear a lot of talk about that, you know, how they want to mess with it and the alternative

247
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,120
talks about this and that and star seeds and this and that, but no one really takes the

248
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,440
time to research all the grunt work that's been done on it, you know, in other words, lab

249
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,800
reports, scientific reports that are real, not, not as, you know, something that someone

250
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,760
is reading about what someone else wrote about something else, but actually the actual, you

251
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,040
know, the grunt work, you know, that was done, the good research, right?

252
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,160
Although you could say that that grunt work is often built on earlier grunt work, I mean,

253
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
the course of life.

254
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
Yeah, be careful.

255
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,400
Well, I'm talking about isolated experiments where the, all the controls are within the

256
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
document.

257
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,240
Oh, certainly, but they're informed by previous work, okay?

258
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,120
There is a continuum here where in the, you know, say someone is alive 80 years, in those

259
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,800
80 years, they only go so far.

260
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,560
So quite frankly, they have to have a beginning.

261
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,080
No, I'm strictly talking about like when they teach science, the way they used to teach

262
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:59,000
it 50 years ago, you had the theory hypothesis experiment conclusion, right?

263
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,800
Like you approach it, you approach the problem, you chew gum and then you figure out the

264
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
answer just by chewing gum, right?

265
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
No, you just joke it.

266
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
That's what they're doing now.

267
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Yeah, really.

268
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,800
So, no, no, what I mean to say is that what happens though is that they must be informed as

269
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,800
to there is a problem to begin with for them to begin the exploration, right?

270
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:23,880
You don't have a hypothesis without a bit of speculation, one, yes, and also some level

271
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
of information.

272
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,040
I mean, even any theory must be based on something.

273
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,720
So you have a basis that is not often picked off by the person who is now going to take

274
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,720
it further.

275
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,720
I'm saying there is a continuum of information which is built or can be, I should say, and

276
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,080
has been disrupted, manipulated and hidden.

277
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:50,680
But the idea is that, you know, at first maybe there was a concept that things that were

278
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,680
invisible could be, you know, they're not observable by the human eye necessarily.

279
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,120
Maybe they don't exist at all.

280
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,200
And that had to graduate into no.

281
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,640
There are things that cannot be seen by the human eye which are present.

282
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
Well, right?

283
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah, 99.9999999999.

284
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,100
You want to add 1,0009999 so that is invisible to us based on the instrument of the eye, the

285
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,100
senses.

286
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,100
We have to use tools.

287
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,880
You know, and they've always been around.

288
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:26,860
You know, when they dig up, you know, when they find high tech devices in the US, the Smithsonian

289
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,380
comes in, they put it in a shipping container, fill it with concrete and take it out to the

290
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,460
Marianne's trench and drop it, right?

291
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,500
Because it doesn't match history.

292
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,740
So everything you see around and more dances around long time ago.

293
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,060
But what I want to say about the genetics and the hereditary is very interesting.

294
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,060
This was very difficult to find.

295
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,140
But within the DNA itself, there's a whole other world of it.

296
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,180
Like an easy way to start off, and it does have memory.

297
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,580
You do carry memory, but it's not tangible.

298
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,900
It's what I don't like to use Freudian terms, but it's more in the subconscious, right?

299
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,580
You're not conscious of it, but it could be ferret, ferret it out if you push yourself.

300
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,060
And there's a very deep layer.

301
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,780
Let me just cut to the thing and we'll bring it up again with the container.

302
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,180
You know how when you cut a tree, it has tree rings, right?

303
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,220
And it shows the summer grain and the winter grain, right?

304
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,780
Your mitochondria has that too.

305
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,260
And it emerges differently in everyone when you're born and they don't know where the

306
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,220
whole this comes from because the actual might interior of the mitochondria is very, very

307
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,220
old.

308
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:30,420
The actual composition, the chemistry and the organic chemistry is aged.

309
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,020
So a new baby comes into the world, but their mitochondria could be three, four, five,

310
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,300
twenty thousand years old within the cell itself.

311
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,060
And they're like, how the hell does this carry over?

312
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,060
Well, it does.

313
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,060
Okay?

314
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,580
So, but they can't, well, you can't talk about this publicly.

315
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,780
We'll get into some other stuff.

316
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,460
How simple this is.

317
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,780
There's a bit of an influence that you carry over.

318
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:56,900
So as you, everything, yes, learning how to poop properly because everybody poops, right?

319
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,740
All that all the way to how you speak and how you act as external.

320
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:06,300
But there is a very, very base, you might call it psychological spiritual, recordation

321
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,300
of everyone that came before you within that genetic line and what might be in there

322
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,740
is previous traumas, previous successes, right?

323
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,520
These tendencies, meaning what your spirit, you know, mind is, is, is, is what you have

324
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,500
proclivities for.

325
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,340
Not necessarily the way, what language you speak or whatever, right?

326
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:30,220
So there is an influence, a very subtle influence, which I don't think it's as subtle as people

327
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,540
or am I put it just because it's small doesn't mean it's, in, in significant, you know?

328
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,660
Well, it's the most ladies will think so.

329
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,860
But anyway, so, so that's the external input.

330
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,860
I'd like to leave that one on.

331
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,180
There's only one thing, one comment.

332
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:46,980
I never leave comments of you, animals are not homosexual.

333
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,780
They might have those kinds of behaviors and things like that, but there is no homosexual,

334
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,660
the animals and we've explained what homosexuality is.

335
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,980
It's a mind control thing, right?

336
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,140
It's actually a ritual.

337
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:03,300
We'll talk about, we'll talk about that as we go on, you know, like, like in a perfect

338
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:09,380
society, there is no military, meaning that everyone is in the military.

339
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,420
If the country needs to be defended, everyone is boots on the ground and everyone has

340
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:19,700
at least five hours of training on some kind of weapon they could use to defend themselves.

341
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,980
So you don't need a military if everybody is in the military, right?

342
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:30,780
So you see, so, so the, so when you get to the point that the humans are now, which will

343
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:36,220
discuss external input here, I'll throw this in also is, when you read the ancient texts

344
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:42,380
and you will talk about this when we bring up the gods, you know how I talk about how simplistic

345
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,940
life should be, food clothing shelter, which we did want on that and all that.

346
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,860
And maybe I'll save it for that because this is very, very important and it's, it's things,

347
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:55,020
you know, how I've kind of hold back because, you know, new information should be given

348
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,940
as such and then if it's appreciated, you continue and then if it's not, you just let

349
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:05,620
it be, you know, and we'll get more into the, the, what shouldn't let be on this one.

350
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,900
So we run out of time quick.

351
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,100
What was the next one?

352
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,300
What was the next one we did?

353
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,500
It was the container.

354
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Oh my goodness.

355
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Right.

356
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,780
Well, the container, these two things are logically, it makes sense to go from one to the

357
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,780
other.

358
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:24,700
Again, about the container, you have to know what the container is even to begin to tackle

359
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,180
something like DNA because, well, as you said, trauma, well, that's definitely external

360
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,940
input, right?

361
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,420
But also external input has to do with the other things that are taken into the

362
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,500
body and utilized to keep building the body, right?

363
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:46,260
So what could be getting a, a, a big dose of arsenic, it feels like, you know, your stomach

364
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,340
is like a cement block appeared in your stomach suddenly, right?

365
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,340
Sure.

366
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,340
That could be part of it too.

367
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,580
But naturally, before we continue, yeah.

368
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,780
Well, but naturally, there's another part of it.

369
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,980
We're talking about the human body and biology.

370
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:05,180
Yeah, of course, but naturally one must assume even external input, okay.

371
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,060
What do you might say about the psychological end of it?

372
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:12,700
Well, the psychological end of it creates a physiological response, spiritual, true.

373
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,300
But you know, that is a psychology means spirit, yeah.

374
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,300
Yeah.

375
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,260
And what you breathe and what you are breathing in, that's why I often mix those terms because

376
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,220
spirit is breath, okay?

377
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,620
No, that's salt.

378
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,860
Well, either way, that's the, the whole thing too.

379
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,940
That's the thing if you, if you missed, you ever see the movies where, which wire do I

380
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,100
cut, so disarm the bomb?

381
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,100
Why would you tell them to cut the red wire when you should cut the black wire when you

382
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,500
want the bomb to go off, right?

383
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,940
So they reverse definition like the word nice.

384
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,180
That's a terrible word to wish upon someone, especially in the beginning of the day.

385
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,380
Well, this is why we're constantly looking at the etymology of these things.

386
00:20:53,380 --> 00:21:00,220
Yeah, so the etymology, like psyche, in Greek, psyche is the spirit.

387
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,860
And in English, it has to do with psychosis, psychology, right?

388
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,340
Anything that has to do with the mind, so the mind is the spirit.

389
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:10,660
The soul is the numa.

390
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,780
In English, it's spelled with a P and U prefix.

391
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,820
So when you have a pneumatic tire, pneumonia, right, it has to do with air movement.

392
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,700
So the living, you know, everything is part of biology, even rocks, right?

393
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,180
Because otherwise, you wouldn't have a fossil, that's a rock, right?

394
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,460
So if you have something alive, becomes a rock, a rock, you know.

395
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,500
And who's to say a rock doesn't have a thought every thousand years, which is more than most

396
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,820
people I met, by the way?

397
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:44,780
But the thing is, we don't consider these things that don't breathe air and have a metabolism

398
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,780
to be alive.

399
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,780
They do.

400
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,500
I actually suggest that everything has an inhalation, exhalation.

401
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,340
You could suffocate a rock as an experiment.

402
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,340
You can do it.

403
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,180
Meaning when it suffocates, it loses its properties, its color changes, its strength

404
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,140
changes, right?

405
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:05,820
So the, that, again, think of the, without even getting it, see, it's very, how would you

406
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:11,060
say, if you say there's no such thing as a virus, right?

407
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:16,020
Because a virus as such is part of toxicology, which is part of liver function.

408
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:21,380
If you want to create a poison to toxify someone, you have to know how the liver works.

409
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:25,780
Like for example, if you want to suffocate someone, you got to know how the big toe works.

410
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,940
No, I'm just joking.

411
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,020
If you want to suffocate someone, you got to know how the lungs work, right?

412
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,020
Okay.

413
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,780
Look, this is why I'm trying to get you to settle down a little bit.

414
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,780
Okay.

415
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,660
Because you're kind of, you're kind of dancing along a little bit quickly here.

416
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,460
And I want to, I want to go step by step so that it can be easily understood.

417
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,300
You and I have talked about being easily understood as well.

418
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,540
Here's the thing.

419
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,460
The external input, right?

420
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:54,380
This is relatable to all the things that come next because, as I was saying, when you're

421
00:22:54,380 --> 00:23:00,060
talking about even DNA and what goes into it and trauma, what I was trying to get at is

422
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,980
that the body will create a chemical which will affect things.

423
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,260
This nowadays they refer to as epigenetic.

424
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,700
It is above the genetic response.

425
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:13,700
But what it does is it creates a response best I can understand that literally does alter

426
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,740
the structure of the thing.

427
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,740
It is.

428
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,740
Hold on.

429
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,140
The body doesn't, you stop to a little too quick there.

430
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,100
You said the body creates a chemical that.

431
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,100
No.

432
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,900
The reason the body creates the chemical is to be a carrier.

433
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,420
Diamonds are carbon, right?

434
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,060
I got a barbecue pit outside.

435
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,340
Lots of carbon in it.

436
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,700
Can I call it a diamond?

437
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:41,560
It takes the chemical, the basic organic material and develops it into how a lumpic

438
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,740
cold develops into a diamond.

439
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,580
At that point, it's imprinted.

440
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:52,540
So in other words, when you say carbon, for example, you think of a hard material like a lumpic

441
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:57,480
cold or a diamond, or CO2 gas that sublimates, it doesn't have a liquid state.

442
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,380
It goes from a solid to gas, right?

443
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,780
Like carbon dioxide, right?

444
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:08,100
But what people aren't talking about in biological entities, there is a gel state of carbon.

445
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,580
Pure carbon, it's a gel state.

446
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,220
When I mean a gel state, I mean like hair gel.

447
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,780
It's like jelly.

448
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:19,420
And if you pour it on a table in any lab in the world and say, test that with your inforomature

449
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,420
spectrometer, tell me what it is.

450
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,260
You want to ask say, the best equipment in the world, it'll show it's 100% carbon.

451
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,580
How is that possible?

452
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,340
Oh, we don't want to discuss that.

453
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,860
Right now, it will be in the future.

454
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,020
So when they say that we're carbon based creatures, you've heard of that.

455
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,020
Of course.

456
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,420
Well, it's not the carbon that we are familiar with externally.

457
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,940
It's the carbon that we're familiar with, not familiar with that happens in all biological

458
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,340
beings.

459
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,060
What can you do with a gel?

460
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:49,100
Could you imagine metallic hydrogen?

461
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,940
I drop a bar of metal on your table, heavy enough, that'll break your foot if you drop it on

462
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,180
your...and if you have it measured, it's pure oxygen.

463
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,260
It'll be scratching your head all day, right?

464
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,820
Think about how incredible that is.

465
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,620
Now, all these materials in different states can carry different things.

466
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,180
Hey, here's an idea.

467
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:14,180
Let's take a plastic tape, put magnetic particles on it, and when the music is playing

468
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,540
through the input board, we'll stimulate those magnetic particles.

469
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:22,820
So when we replay the magnetic tape over the inverse head, a magnetic head, it'll create

470
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:28,340
an electrical impulse that will record music, because before cassette tapes or regular tapes

471
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,620
they used wire for that, right?

472
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,060
And then we got to the point where we're using light.

473
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,100
And now we're using light within little chips.

474
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:40,340
Do you know that here's a statistic and I'm going to be conservative, I'm not going to exaggerate.

475
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:47,380
Do you know that your typical stupid rectangle, what they call a smartphone, is got 16

476
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,860
billion transistors in it?

477
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,860
Think about it.

478
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,860
Why do you know that many?

479
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
Yeah, look it up.

480
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,860
It's actually conservative.

481
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,100
The iPhone 13 or whatever's got 23.

482
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,100
Okay.

483
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,380
The new ones...yeah, or 10 years ago they had 7 billion.

484
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:08,980
You know what a transistor is, it's a switching, in other words, the old vacuum tubes, the

485
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,100
good guitar amps and all that.

486
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,740
Each tube represents one transistor.

487
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:18,660
So they went away from the vacuum tubes, they put it on a solid state silicon chip and

488
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,580
they made it so small that they could put 16 billion.

489
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,500
You know if you stood here counting 16 billion seconds, you know you might run out of time,

490
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
right?

491
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,500
In your life.

492
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,460
That's how many transistors you'd be.

493
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,980
So all of these...we're doing this.

494
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:37,780
I mean I'm saying, human hands, human artisers, we're talking about, you want to get real

495
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:42,100
13 year old slave girls in the Far East are building these, right?

496
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
Think about it.

497
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,100
You're not going to argue with me on that, right?

498
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,100
No, no.

499
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
Okay.

500
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,420
They're putting...so 13 year old slave girls in the Far East are assembling devices that are

501
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:56,540
fairly cheap with 16 billion transistors and that we can't count to 16 billion if we

502
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,980
lived another hundred years.

503
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,740
Are you carrying this around?

504
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,820
And this is commonplace, this is nothing special I'm talking about.

505
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,820
Well, right.

506
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,100
No, they're...they're much more sophisticated things that are...

507
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,940
Yeah, not that sophisticated things are so sophisticated that I cannot even talk about

508
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,940
it.

509
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,940
Right.

510
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,940
I will.

511
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:22,820
We'll broach it a little bit and I'll show you how simple some of these things are.

512
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,100
This is...we're talking about the...what it means to be in this universe.

513
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:31,860
When you listen to Greek speak, it is extremely rarefied.

514
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,260
It talks about what this universe is about.

515
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:37,140
Which, by the way, is a great B universe.

516
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,940
We're not in a great...okay.

517
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,540
It's a B movie universe, okay?

518
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,140
How else would you say it?

519
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,980
It's where...this universe is set up to be like a bad Saturday morning cartoon.

520
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,980
How else can I say?

521
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:53,500
Actually, you know, I'm using references that you have to be born in the 70s or 60s to

522
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,500
know.

523
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,220
But so tell me if I get too retro.

524
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,220
It's all right.

525
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,380
This is the universe we're in.

526
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,860
So...and it's a fine place for what it is.

527
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,100
Let's go back to the container because we're going to run out of time.

528
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,100
I always...we always do.

529
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,860
And you're always going to run out of time on this stuff.

530
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,180
But the reason I use the container is to get people away from their body because you're

531
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,180
not your body, right?

532
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,620
You know, we'll talk about consciousness transfer.

533
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,740
That's one of the technologies that's been around for over 90 years and it's completely hidden

534
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,220
from people, right?

535
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,220
Well, people are still conscious about that.

536
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,220
People are still conscious about that coming, yeah.

537
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,220
Yeah, yeah.

538
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,500
Well, it's already been around for 80 years and it's constantly being developed for 80 or

539
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,380
90 years.

540
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,780
The container...here's an interesting thing.

541
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,700
You know when people are illiterate, you show pictures.

542
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,380
You don't write, remember the old towns?

543
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,060
You had a shoe on the store.

544
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,620
You didn't write any...but you wrote shoes because most people weren't interested in learning

545
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,940
how to read, right?

546
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,940
Yeah.

547
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:55,540
So when you go into biology, any human anatomy medicine, any study, let's say gastrointestinology,

548
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,540
right?

549
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:02,340
You'll find anatomy drawing of an intestine and you're illiterate and you look at it and

550
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:07,580
they tell you that some holistic idiot doctor says, "I make a natural product that

551
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,860
your body absorbs better."

552
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,980
Look at the intestine.

553
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:16,300
Show me how anything gets absorbed through three or four hydrophobic layers.

554
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:21,340
As a matter of fact, you could download a cross-section of firestone steel-belted radial

555
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:29,140
tire and hold it next to the intestine drawing and they're the same in principle, right?

556
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,620
Yeah, nothing goes through these membranes.

557
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,460
Your lungs, look at lung tissue.

558
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,740
It's not as robust as the intestine and the billi and all that are different because

559
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,700
you need a higher surface area to a certain degree because things happen faster in the

560
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,700
lungs.

561
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,300
Hopefully your body thinks happen faster in the lungs.

562
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:52,300
But anyway, nothing goes through the body.

563
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,300
It's in a vacuum.

564
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:59,340
In other words, it's a two-separate atmosphere here, anterior exterior.

565
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,620
You have a tunnel that goes from the mouth to the end.

566
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,940
This is discussed.

567
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,500
That throws contagions completely.

568
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,900
The only thing that could be contagious is something actually lodging on the surface,

569
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,460
interior or exterior.

570
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,620
We have a serious problem because let's just think about it simply.

571
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,020
We're just visiting here.

572
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:24,260
We notice that they offer you the common courtesy that if you don't know how to read their

573
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:29,340
stuff, they offer a picture once in a while, right?

574
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:34,900
Only, not only are all the medical textbooks and anatomy books full, chock full of text,

575
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:38,180
but they have diagrams for the completely illiterate.

576
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:42,540
In this case, they're highly educated, nor the illiterate are picking up on what I'm talking

577
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,740
about here, which is self-evident, by the way.

578
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:51,620
As a matter of fact, you ever go to a place where they, of course, sausage is, right?

579
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,500
What is a sausage?

580
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,980
It's ground meat, stuffed in an intestine, right?

581
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,980
Yeah.

582
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,980
What it should be anyway, yeah?

583
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,620
It's, well, yeah, so nothing goes out through there.

584
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:06,900
In many, the concept of a soccer ball, they used to take animal bladders and put air or

585
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,580
carry water.

586
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,300
How are you going to carry water?

587
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:14,540
Do you think they had wine flasks and water flasks made from animal skins because the skin

588
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:19,180
is the same and animal organs because they leaked?

589
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,180
No.

590
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:27,020
They made liquid containers out of animal skins and animal organs because they didn't leak.

591
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,100
There's nothing that goes through that.

592
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:37,380
So again, if you set 100% of the human population is moronic, that's pretty true, but if you pick

593
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:44,420
out, statistically, you can say 99.9999 because the medical textbooks and the biological textbooks

594
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:49,140
are accommodating the literate and the illiterate and no one is noticing.

595
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,100
So what do you do with a population like that?

596
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:54,180
Well, you do a cell in the Greek once in a while.

597
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:58,860
It's always the same thing with the cause.

598
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:04,540
The only amendment I would make there with the container is that there are states of

599
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:11,500
elements, a metallic hydrogen, gel state carbon, on and on and on, that human bodies can

600
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
make.

601
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,980
I mean, any bylaw, a plant can do it, right?

602
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:20,380
Anything alive that has a metabolism, a soul is a metabolism, right?

603
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:28,660
So metabolic rate is breathing, circulation, various systems, nervous systems, circulatory,

604
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,660
respiratory, right?

605
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,660
Right.

606
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:35,180
When all those systems shut down, the body, the physical part goes into chemical decomposition.

607
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,620
It starts to, that's what death is, right?

608
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,100
And then the mind and the spirit no longer is carried.

609
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,780
Just like if you're, right now you have a soundboard and all this in front of you recording

610
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,780
and you're broadcasting.

611
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,820
If I went in and pulled all the wires, I just took the soul out of everything and it's

612
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,700
just going to shut down even if they pulled the batteries out, right?

613
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,700
Nothing works.

614
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,700
Right.

615
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,700
So that's the soul.

616
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,820
The spirit is the information that's being carried.

617
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:05,580
So on the container, I would leave that alone for now and going into how deep it can get,

618
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,700
it gets very, very deep.

619
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,180
And it's already been exposed.

620
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:13,980
Like I said, they have it in text and they have it in pictures if you can't read and

621
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,260
nobody still notices.

622
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,580
What are they supposed to do?

623
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,460
Walk on your door in the middle of the night and tell you, hey, you better learn this, no

624
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,460
one's going to do that, right?

625
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,460
So.

626
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,060
Well, you know, I take note that in the third episode, we went to the Constitution.

627
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,060
Let's do that.

628
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:33,740
And you know what's interesting there is that I was just thinking to myself, where are

629
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:37,500
their pictures for the illiterate of the Constitution?

630
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,660
Well, why is it a con?

631
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,900
Why isn't it a pro?

632
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,900
Wouldn't you rather have the prostitution?

633
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,020
Why do you got to be so con all the time?

634
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,020
I got you.

635
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,020
Anyway, okay.

636
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,700
So the Constitution here, let's, that's pretty good there.

637
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:58,340
I don't know if I nailed the, sent home the point that it's a free, Masonic document, right?

638
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:02,980
And there's something called, I'm going to be loosely going around the airy fairy woo-woo

639
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,980
circles, right?

640
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,780
That the new age, okay, we give you an example.

641
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:12,660
Back in the late 80s, I was living in Manhattan and I had roommates and neighbors in kind of

642
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,660
new age.

643
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:19,620
And about flat earth, concave earth, indigo babies coming in and nurse says, yeah, babies that

644
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:23,940
are being born out, they have a red spot behind their knee and they're like special babies.

645
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,940
All the stuff you start hearing now, you know, the new age stuff that started in the 1800s,

646
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,420
but I was around the flat earth.

647
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,860
Look, in the 1990s, I was telling people, you know, the earth, they're lying to us, right?

648
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:36,580
I really knew the moon missions.

649
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:42,300
Look, when they broadcast the moon mission, I was four years old and the parents had a friend

650
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,300
come over.

651
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,860
And at four years old, you might remember a good amount, but I remember looking at him and

652
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,860
he says, everything that's showing on TV is a lie.

653
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,660
This is being done in a film studio while it was happening, not later.

654
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,020
And I remembered that.

655
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,580
So I started talking about that later.

656
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,780
I was like, hey, there's somebody standing right there, right?

657
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,940
In real time.

658
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:07,580
So when I say about woo-woo airy fairy, I've seen that my whole life, you know what I mean,

659
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,580
right?

660
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,020
That's like way off with the mainstream beliefs.

661
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,020
Of course.

662
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:17,180
And I'm not one, you know, it's something that, you know, it has its place, right?

663
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:18,700
Because it's a communication.

664
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,700
That's all.

665
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,540
I don't take it to heart, but it's just, you know, you know what's there?

666
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,780
And if you got access to the access to the airy fairy stuff.

667
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:31,780
So anyway, they talk about like the Luciferian rebellion, you know, there's like this cosmic

668
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,220
war, right?

669
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,340
Negative versus positive, the dark versus the light.

670
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:44,000
The light is always portrayed as having a monarchy, an imperial reign with Princess Prince's

671
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,740
King Queen.

672
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:52,200
The dark force may have that, but in a more evolved state, what they want to do is get

673
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,820
out of people's minds that they should ever accept a king or queen.

674
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:01,540
So they invented this constitution thing where they have these various sections of government.

675
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:05,660
So when you don't like what they're doing, you go to one group and they say, well, this

676
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,660
other branch made us do it.

677
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,860
And then you go to the other branch and they said the other branch made us do it, right?

678
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,020
It's a typical scam.

679
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:17,540
So the whole thing about this constitution thing, and by the way, I have not met, I met, I

680
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:22,060
had a long discussion on supposedly a constitutional lawyer and a constitutional scholar.

681
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:26,380
And when I brought up things, they didn't even know was in the constitution.

682
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:31,780
So if your job is to study this document and I say article such in section 10 says there

683
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,980
will be no US court will have any power in law or equity.

684
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,420
They didn't even know it was in there.

685
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,420
Right.

686
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,580
And that's a major thing.

687
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:45,220
If the constitution says that US courts have no power in law, then what the hell are they

688
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,220
doing?

689
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,220
It's in the constitution.

690
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,220
Yeah.

691
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,220
I got you.

692
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:54,060
Look, there's a few things in there that are rather contradictory to the things that you

693
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,060
will ever have been made.

694
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,060
Yeah.

695
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,060
And there's no rights in the constitution, right?

696
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,060
Talk about that.

697
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,940
Well, that's another thing.

698
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,940
That's the bill of rights that came 14 years later.

699
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,940
That was the second revolution was the bill of rights.

700
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:13,620
You know, the constitution is a really good guy that studied this in Arkansas, Jerry Kirk.

701
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,940
His dad was studying it.

702
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,860
His grandfather was studying it.

703
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,860
Okay.

704
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,860
They found documentation.

705
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,340
The constitution, it was 1789, way down.

706
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,860
They sent it to the Vatican and five years later it came back approved.

707
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:28,660
You know, the copy from the Vatican was the one they used, right?

708
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,780
Because the whole thing is to get in your mind here.

709
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,780
Here, here, give another thing.

710
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,380
Let's want to say the constitution is government.

711
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,380
You have no government.

712
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,500
You have the state is it's not the same.

713
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:41,540
That's why if you go to any form, birth certificate form, driver's license form, the last, you

714
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,900
know, you fill out all the stuff they want in the form and you sign it.

715
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,580
What's the last thing on every form?

716
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,620
Oh, they all say the same thing.

717
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,820
It doesn't matter what form you use.

718
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:57,260
It says all in front here in information is to be used for the good of the state.

719
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:00,220
It doesn't say government is a big difference.

720
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,220
So that's another mix up.

721
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,220
Like, soul and spirit.

722
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,340
I don't know the difference between the state and the government.

723
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:09,460
So just like federal reserve, it's not federal and it has no reserves, right?

724
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:14,940
That's why one day I think I'd like to talk to you about the Magna Carta, but not today.

725
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,540
Magna Carta was a step in to create a lack of confidence.

726
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,340
Okay, you can give me an example.

727
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:27,420
I live in a free democratic society where the government has secret police agencies, secret

728
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,740
spying. They put toxins in the food.

729
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,020
They prevent healing methodologies.

730
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:40,380
They arrest those that put healing methodologies out there go against their alopathic system.

731
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,500
They have, they don't have any money.

732
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,780
They have credit.

733
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,980
They create money off your signature and they lie to you every day.

734
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,980
Okay?

735
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,700
And there's no private ownership a lot, even though people think.

736
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,700
Okay, let's, that's the situation.

737
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,540
And they basically deceive you.

738
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:00,100
But it's a free democratic society constitutional republic.

739
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,660
Now here's this other society.

740
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:09,380
It's a fascist dictatorship and they're communist also, but they have a benevolent royal

741
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,700
running it.

742
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,980
And he makes sure that there is no secret police.

743
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,740
The money is based on substance.

744
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:18,680
All of the food is grown with strict measures that there is no toxins put in.

745
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:23,580
The education system is free and open and there is no revisionism in it.

746
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:28,380
There is property ownership and which one would you rather live in?

747
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,420
Do you see?

748
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,820
Well, obviously the communist fascist where everything is good.

749
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:37,220
Well, see, but how is it communist and fascist if it's like that?

750
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,980
You see, that's, that's, that's, that's, yeah.

751
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,980
Exactly.

752
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,540
So when you, they've got names against you, those, oh, communist, that's bad.

753
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,340
Well, it, it doesn't matter what form of government they have.

754
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,060
Is it my level in?

755
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,060
Or is it benevolent?

756
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,220
Is it parasitic and predatory?

757
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:55,300
Or is it nurturing it and benevolent?

758
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,300
Yeah.

759
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,300
Okay.

760
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,260
That's always, that's always the larger question.

761
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:03,660
You know, when you, I, I, I find this going round and round with people about these isms

762
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:09,780
all the time that, that, that, that is the ultimate question to me is, well, is this a better

763
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,620
circumstance to be in than that?

764
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,620
Because I don't care what label you slap on it.

765
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,380
Here's what's actually happening.

766
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,380
Right.

767
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,900
That's the point with this whole thing and that's why you don't have a government anymore.

768
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:26,740
And then you, and you can actually, there was a congressman, and they killed him twice, believe

769
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,140
it or not, if that's possible.

770
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:35,100
He, he did the last in 1992 congressional report says, hey, we're completely bankrupt.

771
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,220
This is the largest trust in you in world history.

772
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,820
1933 bankruptcy, right?

773
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,140
So you're living in a bankrupt entity.

774
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:53,620
So the bottom line is they drove everyone to places that they evaded the royalty because

775
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:58,220
it's, if you have a malevolent government and it's got all these branches and sections,

776
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,500
the chances of flipping them over to being benevolent.

777
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,260
And by the way, when they're malevolent, they don't tell you they're malevolent, they

778
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,900
tell you the opposite, right?

779
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:07,900
Always, right?

780
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,180
Because when someone's going into the hardware store to steal, they, if you ask them what

781
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,100
you're doing here, they say, I'm here to steal or they say, hey, I'm just a customer.

782
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,740
Right?

783
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:21,540
So, so it's, if you can't change it when, when it's, when it's a multiplex system, but

784
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:25,740
if you have one guy in charge and his wife and his son or whatever, it's a lot easier to

785
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,220
convince them, right?

786
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,740
Two or three people.

787
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,740
Then in what?

788
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,900
You got 623 congressmen and whatever.

789
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:36,940
And senators, you got the executive groups, you got all the intelligence agencies, the

790
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:40,740
court system, you're going to convince all of them to work together, make it better,

791
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,540
let's never, never, never.

792
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:50,780
So, the purpose of, of this whole discussion is to show people that careful in what words

793
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,460
you use because the word in itself doesn't hold the function.

794
00:41:54,460 --> 00:42:02,420
So, a malevolent democracy versus a benevolent fashion, you know, dictatorship, which one would

795
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,420
you rather have?

796
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,940
Most people, most Americans that rather have a malevolent democracy because they're so,

797
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,180
you know, over the edge right now, right?

798
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:13,580
Well, because they're attached to the term as opposed to the, the, the, the, the, the

799
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:19,420
circumstance to reality, the function of it, you know, and, and that is, again, a, a,

800
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:24,740
reason why I'll move us ahead just a little bit, because I titled it strangely the next

801
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:28,460
time and I think it was God is dead question mark.

802
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,460
Mm-hmm.

803
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,420
And, and the reason for that, because now I've went and gotten a list as you suggested, which

804
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:36,100
people can do if they search for it.

805
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,340
And, anyways, you just keep it in order.

806
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:45,660
It is very important because here is the greater question, right?

807
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,540
What, what actually is all this organized upon?

808
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:55,220
Because all along the way, whether it is the design of the external input or the intention

809
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,740
of the container, right?

810
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,020
What always enters that, that discussion?

811
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,900
I mean, even atheists, which I find funny.

812
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,740
Uh, well, the atheists I like because they know the gig is up.

813
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:08,940
They know that they're being served bullshit with religion.

814
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:09,940
Yeah, but they don't.

815
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,940
So it's easier to say it.

816
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:16,180
Wait a minute, but they don't because I really honestly, most of them, they, they, they

817
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,580
don't actually adhere to that just like everything else.

818
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,580
Nothing is.

819
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,580
Oh, they use, they use divine language.

820
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,580
They said, well, the, this created that while you need a creator, right?

821
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:30,220
If you read the atheist books, they, they use the language that would mean there is

822
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,540
some, an external input, right?

823
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:37,720
But they have, but here's what the problem is though is they always seem to find their way

824
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:43,500
to another deity and they don't, yeah, it, it, it, it, exactly.

825
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,500
It's the state.

826
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,980
You just ask them, you don't believe in God, but do you believe in the laws of the state?

827
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,340
And they say, well, then the, the state is your God because your law comes from your

828
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,340
God.

829
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:52,340
And guess what?

830
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,140
April 1st is your holiday, right?

831
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,140
Exactly.

832
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,140
But, but that's my point.

833
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:57,140
Is it?

834
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,140
And they do Christmas.

835
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,140
They do Christmas, by the way.

836
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:05,220
There are the exceptions who actually seem to internalize the concept and yeah, they know

837
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,220
the gigs up.

838
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:12,220
But my friend, most of these atheists are just basically adopted sadism.

839
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,540
No, they're just as ignorant as your typical human, but the God's okay.

840
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,140
First of all, just delve right into it.

841
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:21,900
There is no such thing that God is a word like democracy or fascism, whatever, eludes

842
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,900
a certain thing.

843
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,900
That's a tutonic term.

844
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,860
It means the sun, tutonic meaning old German English.

845
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,860
Yes.

846
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:31,540
And it means the sun or the sky or the heavens.

847
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,940
Like even today, if you go to, is this, this was worldwide.

848
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,700
If you, like in Asian cultures, they don't use the term God.

849
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,780
It's the power of the heavens, meaning if they're flying in the sky and they could drop

850
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,060
shit on you, you better pay, you know, you better give them respect.

851
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,380
That's basically what it is, right?

852
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:50,060
If they're, you know, in military, it's called the higher ground, you know?

853
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,060
What kind of sensible?

854
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:55,420
And, you know, just a quick illusion to a formally tied way.

855
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,660
So there is no, there is no sense.

856
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:03,300
No, no, no, no, I'm just saying this is sensible though to, to reckon with, to respect the

857
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,940
power of something that can drop something on you out of the sky.

858
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,940
Okay.

859
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,140
And just essentially what it is.

860
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,140
Right.

861
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:14,220
And a quick allusion to somebody who passed on recently is that, you know, Jordan Maxwell's

862
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:19,900
big point at all times was, you know, makes sense to worship the sun at least because

863
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:24,140
well, it is a life giver, but it is a life giver without it.

864
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,140
You know, it does.

865
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:30,460
I don't, let's leave a hope he's resting well, but let's go on.

866
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:35,380
But my point is this is yet another thing which is up in the heavens as far as your concern

867
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:38,420
from your point of view, which you must reckon with.

868
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:41,580
I mean, you can't say you can ignore the sun.

869
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,500
It doesn't have to be over in the sky.

870
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,940
I'm using that as a convention that even the Easterners use, they could be under your

871
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:48,940
feet.

872
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:55,060
Also, the, so for, for example, the easiest thing to say is when you look at the biblical,

873
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,300
it's the alohem, the word, GOD is not in there.

874
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,780
I don't know where they get, I know they get the GOD from the English versions and all

875
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:01,780
that's incorrect.

876
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,780
Yeah, of course.

877
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:05,620
It's a derogatory term, actually.

878
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,420
They're, they're a race known as the alohem.

879
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:11,660
And if it wasn't for the alohem, we wouldn't be here because they're basically preserving

880
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:12,900
us.

881
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:17,180
In essence, as we go on further on, you're not put here on this planet.

882
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,580
This is the addendum to that, to do anything.

883
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:22,820
What people would call Genesis one, I mean, alohem is right there.

884
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,820
That's it.

885
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,540
There is, yeah, that's all there is.

886
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:29,260
It's alohem and there are other alohem within their scope.

887
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:33,980
And also the biblical, we could get into it, that is all local.

888
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,700
It has to do with a certain group of people.

889
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,900
If you think it has something to do with you and you're not one of those people, well, you're

890
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:40,900
deceived.

891
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:41,900
Right.

892
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,900
So, and you, you can be one of those people by allegiance, just like, you know, well,

893
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,300
you could have someone born in other country and they get, it isn't shipped in another country

894
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:49,820
by creating an allegiance.

895
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:51,060
You do that.

896
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,300
That's another way to do it.

897
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:56,100
That conversion, the only thing that you could convert is rice and currency.

898
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:02,340
But so, you notice they never talk about allegiance, they want to convert you to another religion.

899
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:06,260
But then they take God out of the, and these beings out of the picture completely.

900
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:09,860
But give you an idea, you're not here, they didn't put you here to do anything.

901
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,420
That's why you're always running around with horse and carriage.

902
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,060
You're going to say, "Greek, we're not running around with horse and carriage."

903
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,500
Oh, hell you were.

904
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,140
You, the only time you haven't been running around with a horse and carriage is the past

905
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,140
hundred years.

906
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,140
Yeah, right.

907
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:23,140
There's that.

908
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:25,860
99% of the time the year has has been on this planet.

909
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,380
It's horse and carriage, dude, and you're walking with sandals.

910
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,380
I know, 99.9% of the time you've been on this planet.

911
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:36,420
So, the reason they set it up that way is the same reason you ever see that Norway seat

912
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:40,060
bank where they got these four cliffs with these big pallets of seeds and they're putting

913
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,740
it in the side of an icy mountain to storm.

914
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:45,580
In case all the seeds go away, they got seeds in the mountain, right?

915
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:48,500
Yeah, this is where they're supposed to be keeping all the heirloom seeds with the

916
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,740
original, you know, nontampered with, non-g.

917
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:51,740
Supposedly.

918
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:52,740
Yeah.

919
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,740
That's what we are here.

920
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,740
We are put here.

921
00:47:54,740 --> 00:48:00,780
We're seeded here, literally, to a very, to preserve the human, a certain type of human

922
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,380
away from all the mess.

923
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,580
It's kind of like a really bad neighborhood.

924
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:08,820
Like, I had a shop in Brooklyn and it was a really bad neighborhood.

925
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:13,500
I mean, like, really bad, you know, talking about the cliche crack houses and shootings every

926
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,500
night.

927
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,500
Right.

928
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,700
And there's, there's industrial building.

929
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,300
It was a welding closed down welding supply.

930
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:24,860
And you went through the building into the back and Brooklyn is a very old suburb.

931
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:28,300
And then the back, it opened up to this alleyway and there was another building in there that

932
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,180
used to be an old carriage house.

933
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:35,620
And it was just basically brought up to 1930 standards where it had one outlet in the whole

934
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:36,620
building, right?

935
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,180
And I used that as my shop, but it was beautiful in there.

936
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,860
Because you couldn't see it from the street.

937
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,580
You imagine you can imagine what I'm saying here, right?

938
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,180
And it was, I felt like I was in paradise.

939
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:49,100
You know, this building is 150, 200 years old and all, well, they used to shoe horses and

940
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,420
things like that.

941
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:51,740
And I used it as a shop.

942
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:55,580
And when I was in there, I didn't know what, I mean, you could hear the gunshots and all

943
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:56,580
that, right?

944
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:57,580
You see?

945
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,900
And they didn't know that that, no one in the neighborhood knew that that was there.

946
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,700
They saw me going in and out.

947
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:02,700
But you see what I mean?

948
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,700
So that's how the earth is.

949
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,780
You're in a really bad neighborhood, but you got this corridor that you're in right now.

950
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:12,260
So let me ask you, let's go back to the seed bank in the pallet that's stuck into the

951
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:14,380
frozen mountain in Norway.

952
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:17,260
What, what, what, what two seeds inside that pallet and they, hey, Chuck, what are we

953
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,260
supposed to do?

954
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:20,660
What do you mean we're supposed to do?

955
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,940
We're wrapped up in this pallet inside of the mountain.

956
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,940
You can't do anything.

957
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:25,940
Think about it.

958
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:28,540
You're not supposed to do anything.

959
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,140
You're in a seed bank, right?

960
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,580
But it doesn't mean it's terminal.

961
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,580
Well, it seems terminal, right?

962
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,580
No, it's preservation.

963
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,580
It's preservation.

964
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,580
It's preservation.

965
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,700
You're going to be taken out and you'll be able to grow.

966
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:44,980
So, that's why 99% of the time, if not 100% of the time, you talk about making the world

967
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:49,460
a better place, you get, you find yourself eating out of a garbage can or dead.

968
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:54,820
Which is great, but it's, yeah, already be dead, by the way, being out of garbage can't,

969
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,700
even though there is a true science to eating out of a garbage can.

970
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:03,220
So, no, guerrilla survival is a, yeah, urban guerrilla survival is a real thing, but go

971
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,220
ahead.

972
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:05,220
Sure, sure.

973
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,540
You want it, yeah, because you don't want to get food poisoning, but here's the thing.

974
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:15,620
These Elohim are a very, very specific group, right?

975
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:20,860
You have other groupings and then you have other beings, right?

976
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:25,020
For example, here, you want to go for the hairy, this is a stretch.

977
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:29,140
There's something called the dragon of old, that keeps coming up.

978
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:34,900
When you hear that, of old term brought up in any text, that means that's as far back as

979
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,220
we can go.

980
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:44,180
It doesn't mean, in other words, that word of old in any ancient writ has incredible import.

981
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:48,260
It's almost like saying original.

982
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:53,900
The dragons were the first ones in this universe, not the Elohim, not the humans.

983
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,900
Think about it.

984
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:58,900
The humans, the Elohim, what people call Yahweh and God and all these other human beings,

985
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,900
came later.

986
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:04,860
This is a very, very, very, very, very complex situation.

987
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:08,740
Yeah, I don't think you've ever actually talked about this specifically before.

988
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:13,380
No, I'm not going to get into details because there's no, you don't talk about the eighth grade

989
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,500
when you're in the second grade, right?

990
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,700
You can talk about it, but it ain't going to happen.

991
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,860
You've got to progress through the study.

992
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:21,860
Yeah, you do.

993
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:22,860
A little glimpses of it.

994
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:25,300
Maybe, you know, look, eventually you're going to be doing this.

995
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:26,300
Yeah.

996
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,860
Yeah, so there's an alliance.

997
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:31,860
There are alliances between different beings.

998
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:35,340
Well, look, what do you think?

999
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:39,420
One of the things we talked about with the gods is that they're going to be making themselves

1000
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:43,100
known, but they're going to be making themselves known the way they really are, not the way in

1001
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:48,700
your King James or the way church or whatever tells you that none of this stuff, they are

1002
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:55,260
from the sky, they're from above, and they have interests with us, both positive and negative.

1003
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,260
Okay?

1004
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:00,060
We're in a time right now starting.

1005
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,060
And this is advice.

1006
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,900
I do give advice, all kinds of advice to people.

1007
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,340
You ready for this?

1008
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:09,100
Your prayers and meditations mean nothing.

1009
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:12,740
You're in that time period starting now, actually started a little while ago.

1010
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,780
As time goes on, no one's going to be listening to you anymore.

1011
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,580
So you can get on your knees and pray for help.

1012
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,100
You ain't getting nothing.

1013
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,140
You're on your own.

1014
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:29,180
There are beings, lesser beings, that are predetermined to help you before you pray.

1015
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:32,180
So when you think you're praying and you're getting help, well they knew about that before

1016
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:34,420
you even, you see what I mean?

1017
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:39,700
This is the point that you're at right now because the level of danger, cosmic danger, spiritual

1018
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:43,300
danger that exists is radio silence, right?

1019
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:46,500
Right before a war, right for the first battle, they do radio silence.

1020
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,180
You ever notice that when the bombers, even in the movies, they show that bombers are

1021
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:54,340
ready to fly over the city, do they start yipping in the appen over the radio or is it radio

1022
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,180
silence when they take off, actually?

1023
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,180
You know about this, right?

1024
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,180
Of course.

1025
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:02,020
But the police, the police are going to go raid someone, they're radio silence, right?

1026
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,020
Right.

1027
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:06,460
Now this is what causes me to actually skip over, learn to tell time, which is episode

1028
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:11,740
five and then go to the dummy load because I fear that that's where we're going to start

1029
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:17,220
and that was one of the most evocative phrases you used, which got people upset a little

1030
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:18,220
bit.

1031
00:53:18,220 --> 00:53:19,220
We're listening a bit.

1032
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,820
The keeping time or the dummy load?

1033
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:21,820
The dummy load, of course.

1034
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:25,620
Keeping time was sort of like, well, okay, I can understand that and that sort of makes

1035
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:26,620
that made sense.

1036
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:31,940
You see, to a lot of people who said, you know what, that makes a lot of sense because how

1037
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:32,940
do you do this?

1038
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:33,940
You have to observe.

1039
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:38,820
Why is it, you know, we talked about how the clock is really kind of a meaningless thing.

1040
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:43,660
It's meant to represent something, but you know, hold on, the clock is good for navigation.

1041
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:44,660
Navigation?

1042
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:45,660
Sure.

1043
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:46,660
I mean, it helped us get together.

1044
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:51,140
You know your speed and you know your time, you can measure your distance, literally.

1045
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,140
Of course.

1046
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:56,580
But no, no, no, look, it's perfectly good in trigonometry.

1047
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,580
You know what I mean?

1048
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:01,340
Where you do require three factors, okay?

1049
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,340
It's fine.

1050
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:08,620
But when you got to the dummy load, it just, people took it personally, which by the way,

1051
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:16,020
the question in the chat comes up, which, let's see, let me just read it verbatim, blah,

1052
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,020
blah, blah, blah.

1053
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:23,060
What is the Greek value most freedom or truth, which would he prefer?

1054
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,220
Truth, because you can't have freedom without truth.

1055
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,540
There you go.

1056
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,540
And I think that's it.

1057
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:31,860
It's like which one do you value, you know, food or water, water, because if you have water,

1058
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:32,860
you can make food.

1059
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:33,860
You're true enough.

1060
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,460
There you go.

1061
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:41,020
So, but back to this, I think this leads right into the dummy load because again, it was

1062
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:43,380
a misunderstood term.

1063
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:48,340
Some people took it regardless of what you said as, oh, okay, so we're all dummies, which

1064
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:52,740
you had said a hundred times already, but they didn't hear it until you used the word dummy.

1065
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:56,460
Well, if you took it personally, it means they were, well, hold on.

1066
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:02,100
If someone takes something personally, aka, insulted to a certain degree, you can only insult

1067
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,660
the ignorant.

1068
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:08,300
Someone who is well versed in whatever they think they want to know about and they're looking

1069
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,780
for the truth cannot be insulted.

1070
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:14,780
Hey, if we were in the same room right now, and you said, hey, Greek, you got tomato sauce

1071
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:15,780
going down your shirt.

1072
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:20,020
No, I can be insulted or I could say, hey, I didn't see that.

1073
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:21,020
Thank you.

1074
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,020
Right?

1075
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,020
No, you try to insult me.

1076
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,020
You say I'm a slob.

1077
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:26,020
You see?

1078
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:30,140
The character, so people that take things personally and get insulted, it tells you a lot about

1079
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:31,140
their characters.

1080
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:34,020
There's a lot of character tests.

1081
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:37,100
Here give you an example in terms of the dummy load.

1082
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,140
I have a greeting on the phone, right?

1083
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:44,340
So when you call it, and this weeds out, you know, when you get a number that you don't recognize,

1084
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:48,220
you might want to answer, you might not, but you know, it's a new incoming, right?

1085
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:52,060
Well, you still have that greeting on your phone because that was pretty funny.

1086
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,060
Yeah.

1087
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:56,540
It says, you have reached the number that you have just dialed.

1088
00:55:56,540 --> 00:56:00,780
If you believe you've reached an error, hang up and dial it again.

1089
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:05,220
And very often I'll see a number, the four rings that get the greeting, it hangs up, and

1090
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:09,340
then 30 seconds later, the same number calls back.

1091
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:13,060
So right now, I know who I'm dealing with, someone who is not listening, someone who's

1092
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,300
not paying attention.

1093
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:20,380
I just weeded out about 75 to 80% of all the possible headaches I could have with this

1094
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:24,860
person if I'd end up doing business with them, whether it's for a month or a year or 10

1095
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:26,180
years, I just weeded them out.

1096
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:32,700
I just boxed them, I pigeon-hold them in a category that is actually objectifiable and

1097
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,380
usable in my advantage.

1098
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,580
Say, hey, this guy can't pay attention.

1099
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:39,060
Why would I invite him over to something, you see what I mean?

1100
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:43,180
So when I say these things and people get insulted, hey, fine, go sit in the corner and

1101
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:47,340
be insulted because you deserve it until you change it.

1102
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,660
That's the thing about external input.

1103
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,420
You can change it.

1104
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,420
It's malleable.

1105
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,220
Well, that's the thing.

1106
00:56:54,220 --> 00:57:00,620
And new information or different input from what you've already received then changes what

1107
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:03,500
it is you have to work with as far as making evaluations.

1108
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:10,340
I mean, so, yeah, we've been through, you look, we've been through, you got the Buddhist,

1109
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:15,100
you got the witch, you got the born again, Christian, all of us on air with all this stuff.

1110
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:20,660
And I can't engage, I don't mind listening to a witch or a Buddhist or a born again or

1111
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:26,420
whatever, but you got to bring something that has some value, not something, you know, like

1112
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:31,260
giving an example, I've found out a lot of people in America especially, they get, when

1113
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:36,620
you talk to them, like, old commercial jingles, right, they get, that's what they were raised

1114
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:40,820
on, like you want to explain something to them, if you say, oh, Caligon, take me away, they're

1115
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:45,060
like, oh, yeah, you know, or if you use things that they saw on TV, come on, you know,

1116
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:49,380
commercials, this is their, this is their character, this is how their characters, they were raised

1117
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,380
on junk, right?

1118
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:54,380
You see?

1119
00:57:54,380 --> 00:58:00,300
No, I totally understand, that's one of those things that, you know, whenever people are

1120
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:09,820
caused to, what is the term used actually, where you, you reminisce, it's, you know,

1121
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:15,500
and what though, it's the quality, oh, I understand, but before you get to quality, you can strike

1122
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:20,300
that tone because of repetition because they were steeped in it and that's what it is, it's

1123
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:24,260
got nothing to do with the quality actually, which is because they were steeped in it, they

1124
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:29,860
immediately recall it and it creates a comfort zone, you can, you can bridge gaps with

1125
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:35,100
people that you disagree with by getting them to relate to something where you're, you're

1126
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,100
now wearing these things.

1127
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:40,640
She's not a dummy load, a dummy load is, see, I know all those jingles, I was raised in the

1128
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:41,980
'60s and '70s, right?

1129
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:47,780
With that, but I don't, I don't incorporate it in my character at all, but I noticed that,

1130
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:50,380
other people do and that's, that's fine, you have a choice, right?

1131
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,580
We do live in a certain amount of free will with that.

1132
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:55,620
No, I'll throw some, yeah, I'll throw some, yeah, I'll throw some, yeah, you're right now,

1133
00:58:55,620 --> 00:59:00,780
Greg, we'll walk downstairs, the loner and pairs and I bet you, you know what it is, you,

1134
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:03,420
you've already got it in your mind, it's actually not a bad thing.

1135
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:07,860
It's just a linky, all right, anyway, how many people know that, you know, when you want

1136
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:12,460
to see, but see, now listen, even in your voice, we use medical, can we use medical terms

1137
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,220
on this or is this going anywhere?

1138
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:17,980
Anyway, you know, it, it'll go places, but you know what, YouTube has suspended right now,

1139
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:18,980
so screw it, God.

1140
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:23,740
Okay, so anyway, anyway, anyway, you want to see something funny, hand somebody who was

1141
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:30,340
born after 1990, a regular dial telephone, not a touchpad, but a dial phone and ask them

1142
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:35,380
to dial a place of local, they can't, they don't even, it's like watching a monkey trying

1143
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:38,980
to fuck a football, right?

1144
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:41,700
So anyway, what do you do with that?

1145
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:46,340
Well, you know, you, they're enlighten them, like I've met some wonderful, wonderful young

1146
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:49,820
children and the nanny would put them in front of the TV and I told the parents, they'll

1147
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:55,300
let the TV, the nanny, and the nanny just puts these wonderful children, twins, boy and

1148
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,060
girl for turnl twins, and the parents got insulted, I said, you know, your nanny has the

1149
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:02,620
children from the TV all day, the TV is raising your children, they didn't want to talk to

1150
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:04,220
me after that because it told them the truth, right?

1151
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:07,700
But I have to be said, but I talked to the children and they, they thought the TV has been

1152
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:11,260
around since Noah's Ark, they, they, they, they didn't know when it was invented, I said,

1153
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:15,900
you know, TV is pretty recent, 1920s, 1930s, people didn't have them in their homes till

1154
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:20,300
really the 50s and 60s, they were like, wow, no one ever told us that, you see?

1155
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:25,020
Right, you just give it, so yeah, they never looked into it and I just give them a

1156
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:28,940
little, it's not really, you know, we're not made for that, you know, at this point, you

1157
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:32,940
could be made for with a chip in your head later, you might have to have it, but, but anyway,

1158
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:37,620
well, you know, you've been around young children recently, right?

1159
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:41,860
Because if you're around younger children recently, you'll find they have no concept of

1160
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:46,500
a, of a time when there wasn't these little computers and, and like you said, the, the

1161
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,500
stupid rectangles.

1162
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:52,740
I mean, it's almost like that's a given, that's been here like air, you know what I mean?

1163
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:58,820
And the thing, the thing, the thing is, you know, it's just like, you know, there's a lot of,

1164
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:02,980
you know, a lot of things, you know, that's, you know, a lot of things, you know, it's like,

1165
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:07,540
you know, you have to, you know, you have to have to have a, you know, a lot of things, you

1166
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:11,380
have to have to have to have a lot of things, you know, a lot of things, you know, you have to,

1167
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:16,380
have to have to, you know, have to have a lot of things, you know, you have to have a lot of,

1168
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:20,420
you know, you have to have that thing, you have to have a lot of things, you have to have the,

1169
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:22,500
you know, in a real world situation.

1170
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:27,420
An example of that is if I had a treadmill in here and I ran a mile on it, I can tell you

1171
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:30,820
I ran a mile today on a treadmill, right?

1172
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:34,180
It's fairly accurate in terms of effort, but did I go anywhere?

1173
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:36,180
Right here in my living room.

1174
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:37,180
Did I go anywhere?

1175
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:38,180
No.

1176
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:40,700
That's a dummy load, like a treadmill is a dummy load.

1177
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:45,180
I hamster a wheel is a dummy load, right?

1178
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:50,220
So when you turn on all this media, it doesn't matter what it is, you know, I have a bullshit

1179
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:54,460
filter I designed for the computer and a lot of times what it does is it filters out the bullshit

1180
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,460
sound.

1181
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:57,780
I'm like, wife said sound in the computer, so you got no sound on the computer.

1182
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:58,780
I go to these different websites.

1183
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:01,820
I see it because the bullshit filter is on trying to bullshit filter off and you'll get

1184
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:05,500
some sound, right?

1185
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:09,180
So this is part of the, oh, Calgon, take me away, right?

1186
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:11,300
So the dummy load is a waste of time.

1187
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:18,340
So people, all these issues, again, I see, I've actually been very good about avoiding.

1188
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:20,820
I use the computer like a reference pocket.

1189
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:25,340
Remember, okay, go to a hardware store, they might still have them pocket reference books.

1190
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:27,900
I don't know if they still have them, but I know what you're talking about, yeah.

1191
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,380
It has everything conversions.

1192
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,900
In fact, you know, it's usually machine issues.

1193
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:36,180
I mean, people in the technical are, you know, if you like building stuff, it's good to

1194
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,180
have one of those.

1195
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:41,500
Melting points, boiling points, you know, chemistry, it's got a little bit of everything,

1196
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:42,500
you know?

1197
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,500
Right.

1198
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,500
You've got your computer out of table in there, right?

1199
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,500
Yeah, of course.

1200
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:47,500
Yeah.

1201
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:51,980
So anyway, the whole thing about, I lost track now, we were still on the dummy load.

1202
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:52,980
I got to go to the computer.

1203
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:55,180
You know, we'll take a little break, all right?

1204
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:59,060
Because we've been at this for about an hour and you've got a faster pace today than

1205
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:00,060
I'm used to it.

1206
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:01,060
I got to be honest with you.

1207
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,060
That's right.

1208
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:03,060
But it's okay.

1209
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:07,060
We will adjust and return after just a little pause.

1210
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:09,140
Be right back with the Greek.

1258
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:45,620
happening today. Larry Hancock's book, Indonile, rembs the cover of many of them. Using new files

1259
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:50,980
that exposes things about the Bay of Pigs that no one has ever written about before. It shows why

1260
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:56,580
it really failed and why the United States did not learn from it. Secret Wars became a stable

1261
01:07:56,580 --> 01:08:02,180
US-covert operations that are still happening today. It also shows why other countries today are

1262
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:08,420
doing a secret operations with more success. This is the book that puts what some want to deny

1263
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:15,380
into the light. Indonile, secret wars with hair strikes and tanks. Larry Hancock,

1265
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:27,220
in digital or physical- This is James Corbin of CorbinReport.com and you're tuned into the

1266
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:32,900
Oceleaf- Ocele.com. Revelation through conversation. Second hour of the Oceleaf

1267
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:37,460
begins now at Ocele.com but of course you're probably catching this further on down the stream by

1268
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:42,740
your final slab of choice, your applicable application, your pod catcher, it is yours. So you're probably not

1269
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:49,460
on the same timeline as me at the moment. Anyway, it's Monday and according to that thing we call

1270
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:55,780
a calendar, it is just after, well, Jesus is actually more the quarter after 9pm in the eastern time zone,

1271
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:59,540
but I'm sure you're hearing this some other time, some other place, so no matter who you are,

1272
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:04,500
where you are, when you are. Well, okay, so I'm talking to the Greek and you know, something comes up

1273
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:09,540
here, we're going through this list, which is publicly accessible and you can find it out there of the

1274
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:14,660
many Oceleaf and the Greek shows, which were done in two sections. One of them were episodes and then

1275
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:20,660
the other were chapters. Okay, the second one was chapters. Anyway, you put them in order, they're

1276
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:25,060
pretty interesting, but they're not totally available out there on the internet unless you're a member

1277
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:31,940
at Oceleaf.com. Now you do that, you have access to the Oceleaf and the Greek list where I saved all of

1278
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:40,420
them and there's also an episode which was not publicly ever aired anywhere and so that's that. If you

1279
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:47,860
choose to support me over here, you do get all of the episodes just so you know, but there's a lot

1280
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:51,940
of other stuff over there and I constantly put up content, which is only available to members at

1281
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:58,980
Oceleaf.com. So I say this because you know, it's been waning support lately, Greek, I just want you to

1282
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:06,020
know again, seem to go up a little bit and then back down. That's that's very easy to do if you're

1283
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:11,220
looking for support. I don't mean like just a plain old jock strap, but if you're looking for

1284
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:19,060
input, there's seven billion people out there, right? Right. You ever go fishing? Sure. You have to

1285
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:23,860
use the appropriate lure, you have to use the appropriate bait, you have to use the appropriate, right?

1286
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:32,660
Location. Very easy. Well, I'm sorry. I totally simple. I totally want to see how simple it is.

1287
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:38,180
You start with the simplicity of getting quote unquote. What are they, what are they called? Well,

1288
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:42,420
yeah, internet people, they don't put up subject matter. They put up, they call it content. That's

1289
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:49,300
what they call it, right? And then they get followers. Okay. Yeah. Well, yeah, here's the thing.

1290
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:56,180
Here's a go. There's a, was around an old school salesman and you take out a contract, you know,

1291
01:10:56,180 --> 01:11:01,540
and the the the perspective buyer, you know, when he signs the contract that's done. If he saw you sit

1292
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:07,380
in there with the buyer for more than 20 minutes, he walks up to your desk with the perspective buyer

1293
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:12,420
sitting across from you. He doesn't look at anybody. He puts his big hand on the contract and crumbles

1294
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:17,380
it up and throws it in the garbage and tells the perspective salesman the leave. I mean, perspective

1295
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:22,100
client to leave and I'm like, what the hell? Annie, what's going on? He says, I told you, if you can't

1296
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:27,940
get them to open their wall in the 15, you know, first 15 minutes, some kind of commitment, you could,

1297
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:32,420
you could like, what do you, what is it? You court them for the next three months or wasting your time.

1298
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:38,740
Better, I'd rather have you doing nothing than doing, you know, courting these idiots, you know.

1299
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:43,460
Right. Well, you know, throw your effort here. This is, we should probably,

1300
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:48,260
do something that is in less than 15 minutes, you want people to join.

1301
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:57,220
No, I understand. Look, that's an illuminati number, by the way, 15, 5, 1,

1302
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:02,900
any, you got to play the numbers, 3, 2, 2, 6, 6, 6, you remember play the number, they tell you play the

1303
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:09,780
numbers, right? Which by the way, that comes into the next part of the discussion because we did

1304
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:18,580
talk about numerology and all that and exactly how this really stands, what, what the circumstances is

1305
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:23,860
with the three, sixes and all that. And, well, what does everybody think of when you usually bring

1306
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:30,900
this up? Well, Satan, Satanism. We had a discussion about that after the dummy load.

1307
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:38,660
Let's just, let's just interject what that is. Okay, real quick, you have a race of beings, let's say,

1308
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:45,860
known as the Elohim. There are many races. And they had a re, an internal reorganization where a group

1309
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:52,260
of them fell out of following, a following, favor. And the ones that fell out of favor became

1310
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:57,940
messengers or angels. And the angels that had a bad reputation and fell out of favor even more were

1311
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:03,540
known as demons. That's all it is. Imagine a corporate structure were, or in the military or whatever,

1312
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:09,300
where someone gets demoted, where in the military an honorable discharge would be an angel, a dishonorable

1313
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:16,340
would be a demon. And by the way, I talked about the quote unquote dragon types. You have both on both

1314
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:22,020
sides. No, you have more dragons coming over to the human side, like a hybrid type. This is

1315
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:29,700
sounds very, very woo-woo to people, but that Satan character was one of those. And, in persona,

1316
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:34,660
in meaning, because they're not physical beings, right? So the persona generally, just like in Star Trek,

1317
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:41,780
they were fighting the klingons and then the later on they rebooted the series and now they have

1318
01:13:41,780 --> 01:13:46,180
a klingon, you know, they made a man's and the klingons are on the bridge, you know, he's an officer,

1319
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:50,980
right? Right. Yeah, that's the Satan character. And there's many, he's part of a program.

1320
01:13:50,980 --> 01:13:57,380
There's many of them. But yeah, you got to, you know, if you spend your whole life finger painting

1321
01:13:57,380 --> 01:14:01,540
on the wall with chocolate pudding and you think that's psychodynamic or religious or whatever,

1322
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:07,140
you got to boil these terms down to very simple black and white, you know, immature, spiritual

1323
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:14,740
and maturity. You can call it. Right, right. And you know, we closed out that first portion, excuse me,

1324
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:19,620
of the series with random thoughts where we kind of attempted to do what we're doing right now,

1325
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:28,500
which is to address each of the issues already addressed and discuss that. And that's what it looks

1326
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:34,660
like it closed out at, but it didn't. It actually went on a bit. But I know that that was an effort to

1327
01:14:34,660 --> 01:14:40,100
sort of clarify everything that had come before. But which, by the way, everything I've ever said

1328
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:46,580
publicly is an introduction, right? Even if it's a two hour topical episodic sonic event, it's still

1329
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:52,020
an introduction. Of course. The point is that no one seems to get very if you get is there's a formula

1330
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:56,580
to doing this stuff. It's basically comprehension and you don't have to make stuff up like people do.

1331
01:14:56,580 --> 01:15:01,140
You just look at what's been memorialized that came before you. It doesn't matter if it's written or

1332
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:06,340
audible, something that came but don't piss on and shit on everyone that came before you. In other

1333
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:11,780
words, if they wrote something down, guess what? It might be worth reading. Well, see, that's what I

1334
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:18,260
was trying to get at before when I was talking about building on the knowledge previous because everybody

1335
01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:22,740
does regardless of how there's, you know, there's an innovator, they've come up with something that

1336
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:28,260
nobody comes up with something out of nowhere. It's all based on something. If it's an

1337
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:32,740
evaluation, you got the super high. We have the informational super highway. Most of the universe,

1338
01:15:32,740 --> 01:15:39,460
most of existence is say universe is not physical as we know it. The physicality that we live in,

1339
01:15:39,460 --> 01:15:44,500
what they call the three-do-you-world is no different than as if you went inside of a mountain.

1340
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:48,740
And I'm not talking going inside of a mountain after you dig a tunnel. As if I just snapped,

1341
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:54,420
you snapped your fingers and you appeared inside of solid rock. How much mobility and freedom do

1342
01:15:54,420 --> 01:16:00,340
you have? You're like, holy crap, I'm inside of a rock. I can't do anything. And pretty soon you won't

1343
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:06,900
be able to breathe. So the density that the humans live in, this 3D is, is, Miniscence, one

1344
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:12,020
millionth of 1% of physical, of the reality of what's out there. And this is the next level for

1345
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:21,940
humanity to realize that. Well, this is why the cosmic censorship issue is mentioned throughout

1346
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:28,820
all of the episodes, too. Of course. And, you know, for someone who's saying cosmic censorship.

1347
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:36,820
Well, and also remember, we pre-cognate a lot of the stuff. We said the word "sensorship"

1348
01:16:37,780 --> 01:16:43,060
more than anybody else did five, six, seven years ago. And then what do they have now?

1349
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:48,820
Oh, well, now everybody's screaming about the censorship everywhere.

1350
01:16:48,820 --> 01:16:52,100
We use that word at least 10 times each episode. Oh, I know.

1351
01:16:52,100 --> 01:17:00,580
Seven years ago. And we're trying to tell people, hey, you're always censored. But now it's in your face.

1352
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:08,340
And you still don't care. Well, no, that's the thing is they care about what they think their freedom is.

1353
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:14,260
And it's always so funny to me. It's always based on a bad premise. You know, I have the

1354
01:17:14,260 --> 01:17:21,060
freedom to be on Twitter, do you? Okay, well, I didn't know. First of all,

1355
01:17:21,060 --> 01:17:25,380
When I hear the word people want freedom, it's like in the police report, we shot them 14 times

1356
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:29,700
for his own safety. Yeah, right. But that's in that police report. They killed the guy for his

1357
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:35,620
own safety. Well, that's the thing. You know, you're fighting for peace. You know, you're making a mistake

1358
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:42,100
here. You're engaging in the wrong thing is not by making war on war. Yeah, I know. But that's

1359
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:47,060
what I'm saying is that there's always this false premise built into either what they're saying or

1360
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:51,700
what they're aiming at. You know, it's like the people that say they want to get to a certain thing.

1361
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:56,660
I always look at and go, well, that's not what your actions say. I understand what the words are

1362
01:17:56,660 --> 01:18:04,180
being loaded. Anybody? Got me load anyone? Right. There you go. So, okay. Now, I again, I want to run

1363
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:07,780
through some of these other things. And I know we're not going to get all the way through the list,

1364
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:13,460
even if we had the complete list. And I had all kinds of notes. But let's see what we can get done

1365
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:19,140
here in the time we have. And I think that's always a worthy thing to engage in. All right. Stop

1366
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:26,180
looking for land as you're standing on it. Okay. Well, that's right. Now, that was fun because a lot of

1367
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:31,300
people started asking about the, you know, the different place. By the way, somebody in the chatroom

1368
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:35,540
says they had not heard the, you know, like, like watching a monkey, fuck a football since their

1369
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:40,100
grandfather and they appreciate hearing that because they haven't heard it since. I use that term

1370
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:44,100
on occasion. I just usually don't say it on air because I usually don't use that language on air.

1371
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:48,660
But yeah, right. Well, the other one I really like is they couldn't pour. The other one I really

1372
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:53,220
like is they couldn't pour piss out of a boot even with instructions on the heel. You're putting it

1373
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:57,940
on the bottom. Yeah, we're putting it on the heel. Yeah, even with instructions on the heel. So

1374
01:18:57,940 --> 01:19:01,860
see, that's the whole thing about you just, you know, look, if it's, if someone took the time to

1375
01:19:01,860 --> 01:19:08,020
write something down or it doesn't mean all of it and everything, that means that, you know,

1376
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:11,700
a technical manual here, this is going to tie into what you're saying about a grandisanal.

1377
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:16,740
Really, really, really, really fast before we go to Atlantis is that another question comes up,

1378
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:20,820
which is what, what happened to the old question, everything in quotes archive?

1379
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:28,020
Archive? That's your business. I never, I never put anything on the internet other than a single

1380
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:34,820
page and an email. Right. I think it may be that that was a site that someone else had put onto

1381
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:41,220
a server. And I think maybe it does not look very easy. Look, here's the other thing. I give my time

1382
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:45,780
freely because I know that if you live your life here and you help one person with something,

1383
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:55,460
even trivial, your job is done here, right? So the easiest way to get in touch with me is uncommonradio.com.

1384
01:19:55,460 --> 01:20:02,180
And if you hold your mouse over where it says email or whatever, it'll, that's the email. It's

1385
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:09,140
uncommon sense radio one, number one, at email.com. And that's an email. Or it's, they use the same email

1386
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:15,220
for Skype content. I'm very easy to contact and I'm free with my time. Right. So if you, you know,

1387
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:20,980
you want, you know, if you want a frozen dinner, that's the archive. If you want a fresh cook meal,

1388
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:29,620
hit me up. Well, that's the other thing. He gave me a very good way to freeze fish actually one time.

1389
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:35,700
Water, you don't never get the freezer, you know, water evaporates more than room temperature in that

1390
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:40,420
freezer. You know, but once you go, that's the freezer. But if you go below, you know, the, like, what

1391
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:46,900
they call a medical freezer, they, you know, below 70 minus 70 or so, which is very dangerous, by the

1392
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:52,100
way. You know, the double door freezer is and all that. You don't get freezer burn. But if you throw

1393
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:58,500
it in water, it's not just fish, but anything else that's like that. Well, no, but it was a great way

1394
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:05,140
to actually get the fish to not be damaged by being frozen for it extends the life in the freezer.

1395
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:09,860
You believe it or not? If you don't open and close that freezer door alive, it's good for 10 years

1396
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:15,860
in the water. Hey, believe it. They put it down. They pull stuff out of glaciers all the time, right?

1397
01:21:15,860 --> 01:21:21,540
Thousands of years old right and is still edible, right? No, no, I understand. I'm just saying that

1398
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:25,060
that was just one of those things I never considered, even though it should have made sense to me.

1399
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:30,020
One of those, I'm just pointing out that you actually have what makes sense to you.

1400
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:35,060
Careful. Culinary thing. Well, you know, I got a friend named Joe who told me you had a great way of

1401
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:40,820
cooking potatoes too. So, you know, I'm just saying. Stove top. Yeah, but I know that you got that

1402
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:46,340
for the stove top cooking, by the way, got from Gil Cherokee Indian, you say, white man uses a lot of

1403
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:52,980
wood, makes a lot of smoke, very little heat. The Indian uses very little wood, no smoke, a lot of heat.

1404
01:21:52,980 --> 01:22:01,540
Right? So, no, no, fair. No, I'm just saying that it's just, you know, you never know what it is you

1405
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:05,380
could gain. Since you mentioned, you know, I could show you how to cook a good meal. I was just explaining

1406
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:09,780
all along the process. You've actually got some good knowledge there. If that's all you want to hear,

1407
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:15,060
I'm sure you'd be more than happy to provide somebody with instructions on stuff like that. So,

1408
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:24,100
anyways, um, okay, so stop looking for Atlantis. Yes. And then recaps and ginger snaps. So,

1409
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:30,260
again, we had to go back over stuff is what happened there. That kept happening a lot. Let's see.

1410
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:37,060
Uh, reference to history. And I guess that was, you know, talking about what we, really we covered that

1411
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:40,340
at the very beginning of the show when you and I were talking about that. And then of course, quality,

1412
01:22:40,340 --> 01:22:48,980
food, water, uh, and law, which, okay, that, that's an interesting mix. Law, you don't have any law that's

1413
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:57,220
gone, been gone for over 90 years worldwide more than 60 years. Some very religious societies try to

1414
01:22:57,220 --> 01:23:05,620
have some law form, uh, and money. Law and money go together, by the way. Uh, if you lose your law,

1415
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:09,940
people say, so what, Greek, what's the difference? If I use a piece of paper or get food or substance back,

1416
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:14,340
money, well, the problem is you lose your law. You know, they, you know, they, you could be arrested and

1417
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:19,540
charged for stealing rocks from the moon, right? No, what are you going to do? So it's, it's set up that way.

1418
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:23,860
But that's again, okay, there's, there's a, there's a problem that you have. The solar system is in

1419
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:27,460
a neighborhood. This is something I never brought up and this goes with it, land this and all the other stuff.

1420
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:33,620
Good. You build a new house, right? Life savings is a big house, like MacMatchan, whatever, big house,

1421
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:37,620
big beautiful house, everything, all the amenities. So what you do is you live on the roof, right?

1422
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:42,740
Rainers know you live on the roof. No, you don't live on the roof. You live inside. Right.

1423
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:48,980
When you have an advanced society anywhere, you don't live on the surface. You live on the, you build,

1424
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:55,940
you live on the surface, you subject to solar events, meteorites, weather, attacks, yes, attacks from other beings.

1425
01:23:55,940 --> 01:24:04,260
Right? So you live inside the planet, inside. So when they tell you all these planets are bare and

1426
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:10,180
look at the surface, they're very advanced beings living inside. Nothing is wasted. They're all inhabited.

1427
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:17,140
There are some dead planets like the moon is a dead planet, meaning it's dead. So it's been hollowed

1428
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:24,100
out and used and repurposed as a satellite as it is because there was a time when we didn't have a moon

1429
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:32,180
not too long ago, like half a million years, let's say. So you know, reading HD Wells very carefully when

1430
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:36,820
he said Martians were coming, it's kind of interesting because people would say, oh, well, we didn't have

1431
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:41,700
the telescopes to see that there was nothing on the surface of Mars. What we did actually. Yeah.

1432
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:50,180
Was right. You could look up right now. Lowell, the astronomer has lots of notes of what he saw in the

1433
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:56,100
telescopes. There's a war on Mars. Explosions, smoke every night. Well, what are they going to do?

1434
01:24:56,100 --> 01:25:03,300
Just credit him. They just put it in a hide it away. Up until the 70s NASA used to put out transient

1435
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:08,740
lunar phenomena. Transient mean like, you know, weird stuff going on in the moon. They cut that off.

1436
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:17,700
But it's very, very, very active. The thing is though, we're intelligent beings from other places know

1437
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:23,060
our purpose, which is no purpose just to exist until a certain time. We're in a seat vault in a seat

1438
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:26,340
bank. What are you supposed to do when you're in the waiting room? Remember the waiting room?

1439
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:32,020
See, that was another, it was another long concept where we explained that along with the end

1440
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:38,660
of credits, which started to get a little bit work up. We're in the credits. Well, no, but we were in the waiting room.

1441
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:44,340
Until 2025, we're in the 2021 and a half when you pass that point, I said this even before.

1442
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:49,540
When you pass 2021 and a half, that will determine those three and a half years after 2018,

1443
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:54,660
what the next three and a half years will be like till 2025. It's been on point.

1444
01:25:54,660 --> 01:26:01,620
No, so far that's the thing. It's all A plus plus plus material. But as I was saying, we were in the waiting room.

1445
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:12,900
But we are in the time when it is the end credits. So here we are. And now actually it's kind of

1446
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:18,100
interesting because 2022, that would be definitely the end of the first phase of what you talked about.

1447
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:21,940
And we were doing that in, I don't know, 2014, 2015.

1448
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:30,260
No, it's not really a phase. It's okay. I gave the play school room a version of it.

1449
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:36,660
You have four seven year periods and seven four year periods and they overlap.

1450
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:42,660
But the more predominant one is the seven year periods in the middle of seven is three and a half.

1451
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:47,460
So when you get to that three and a half year into the seven year period, and this one would be

1452
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:53,060
28 that started in 2018. So three and a half put your 2020, 2021 and a half.

1453
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:58,100
When you get to the three and a half year period, what that does is it shows you basically this is

1454
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:03,300
what the next three and a half is going to be like. So it's kind of like a stalled.

1455
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:09,780
You know how, one of you ever heard about this using a slightly like the 20th century was a stalled

1456
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:15,060
century. They stalled it with World War One, World War Two, all the other wars, the bankruptcies,

1457
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:19,860
the UN, all this stuff, they stalled it. In other words, you know, when it was stalled, I mean,

1458
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:24,180
literally stopped it. There was the creativity that you had in the 20th century,

1459
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:30,100
Harkins back to whatever was developed in the 19th century, right? 19th century they attempted to

1460
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:37,220
stalled it in the beginning, but it was super creative all the way through. 21st century definitely

1461
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:42,260
got stalled because it started with 2001, right? You know people think, you know, when did the 20th

1462
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:48,980
century start? Not 1900, 1901, right? So like when you're born, you're in your first year or when

1463
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:53,300
you're born, you're in your first decade. When you're born, you're in your first century. When

1464
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:57,220
you're born, you're in your first millennia, depends on how you want to, you know, break down the

1465
01:27:57,220 --> 01:28:03,060
time period. But the 21st century was definitely stalled seven months, I think it's nine months

1466
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:08,500
into it. You know, they, they, they, uh, nuke, lower Manhattan and, uh, brought in, you know,

1467
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:12,100
airplane restrictions and all this other stuff. You know, made a lot of people rich, you know,

1468
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:17,540
when there were no airplanes involved. So they, they, they, they keep stalling it. So there's no

1469
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:22,340
creativity. It doesn't mean that you don't have little tech advancements here and there, but

1470
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:27,380
there's no great, when I mean stalled means the creativity goes away. And then when the creativity,

1471
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:33,940
see, when a century is stalled, it could go two ways. One is you, you, you stop creativity in advancement

1472
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:40,420
or you, you create a period of destruction like they did in the 20th century. You know, before

1473
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:45,300
World War one and World War two, Europe was completely different, right? You know, right, right.

1474
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:50,100
It was totally all none of the old buildings, very few of the old buildings survived. None of

1475
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:55,860
the maps read the same and the cultures were completely, uh, there, there was over like 140 different

1476
01:28:55,860 --> 01:29:00,340
groups of Germans or, or, or Prussia, you know, anyway, all that was boiled down. Anyway,

1477
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:05,700
it was a period of destruction, but if you, if you do the destruction too much and there's too much

1478
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:09,940
power in the people, the hands just like now they, you know, they're doing the school shooting

1479
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:15,300
programs again, right? Right. Well, why would they want to take your guns away if they didn't intend

1480
01:29:15,300 --> 01:29:21,460
to do something that you'd want to shoot them for? So you see, yeah, now I keep saying that,

1481
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:25,460
you know, these people that talk about the guns, they're, they're, they're absolutely wrong. But they,

1482
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:30,020
they're not really, you see, that's not the pistols. It's the heavy, it's the heavy armament, you know,

1483
01:29:30,020 --> 01:29:35,540
I was at a shooting range once here and shooting all kinds three or eights, you know, all the standard

1484
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:41,540
stuff. Yeah. And a guy pulls up, uh, pulls a canvas off the Jeep and he's got a 50 caliber anti-aircraft

1485
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:48,900
loop that pick up truck target in the shed to, to smith the reins with tracers. I was like,

1486
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:53,220
holy shit, I didn't know that they were people, you know, quote unquote civilians with such

1487
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:59,140
ordinance, you know, and there are. No, there are, but it's, it's weird. Just pick what see weapons now,

1488
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:02,660
they could get you from space, they can get you through your telephone. You know, your telephone

1489
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:06,340
has a smartphone of sensors that has your body temperature, heart rate, breathing rate,

1490
01:30:06,340 --> 01:30:10,900
and all that in there, right? Well, I've tried to explain that, you know, people that are worried

1491
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:16,820
about the chips, I don't buy the whole chip thing because it's not necessary. There are biometric

1492
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:25,300
measurements where, remote, ID is, all you got to do is scan, you got the ID and you don't need to

1493
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:31,540
physically implant anything because you have a connectivity through waves. So, also they have

1494
01:30:31,540 --> 01:30:37,060
time tech. There's no time travel. You just go from event to event. Hey, are you ready for a little

1495
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:43,220
twister? Sure. Okay, so when you do a history lesson to children, you bring out what they call

1496
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:48,660
helps, like books, films, whatever, right? To do the history, all right? So imagine 10 million years

1497
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:52,340
from now they're doing a history lesson for children and they create this hologram, it's a physical

1498
01:30:52,340 --> 01:30:58,740
hologram and we're in it. We are merely being demonstrating a history lesson, right? So imagine

1499
01:30:58,740 --> 01:31:03,700
instead of a pop-up book or a film, they actually have a 3D reality. Okay, it's one thing. The other thing

1500
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:09,060
is if everything's predetermined in the future, just like a blueprint, it has all the renderings of

1501
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:12,900
the building, you know, you look at the ground, there's nothing there. Guy shows up with his pick-up

1502
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:16,580
truck, he unrolls the paper or his iPad and he shows you what they're going to build there.

1503
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:21,780
Well, that's the future, right? It's nothing there now and it's got every detail in it, right? You

1504
01:31:21,780 --> 01:31:26,500
know, a comprehensive architectural drawing even goes down to every nut and bolt, especially on a

1505
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:32,500
ship or an airplane, right? Okay, so, so if everything is predetermined, when they finish the

1506
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:37,220
design, 10 million, 50 million, 100 million years in the future and they start replaying it now,

1507
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:41,780
when we go into our past, we're closer to the future because that's when they started it and as

1508
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:48,980
we go into our future, we're going more into the past. This is how time travel, time, there is no

1509
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:54,340
time travel because time travel is like you said with the clock, right? It's events, how events are

1510
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:59,940
structured in the ether because everything, the most solid object, the atom, even anyone will tell

1511
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:05,940
you that analyzes this without the BS or you know, stuff they put out in colleges. The researchers,

1512
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:10,580
let's tell you that the densest material, when they look at the atomic structure, it's 99% space,

1513
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:14,820
you know, if you say proton-neutral electrons, all space, even a diamond is nothing there. So,

1514
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:19,460
it's how the ether is structured and vibrating. Right. So, the way you set up, let's say,

1515
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:24,500
the mathematics for something, see, math, nature doesn't do math, right? This is guy,

1516
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:31,460
Thuria Paphoses, Ken Wheeler. He says, "Mother Nature is not a crack core with a calculator." She's

1517
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:37,620
just barefoot, honey, with hairy armpits running around. That's Mother Nature, right? Okay. So,

1518
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:42,260
all right, so time travel, the way you do the math, I've gotten this recently and it's not anywhere,

1519
01:32:42,260 --> 01:32:46,020
it's... (inaudible)

1520
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:48,980
You're going robotic on the Greek, moving around or something?

1521
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:53,940
Not times for... Wow, totally robotic, they're... break.

1522
01:32:53,940 --> 01:33:02,260
Not... Yeah, you're not... Your sound does not go here, hang on a second, because it's just

1523
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:05,380
going all over the place. Maybe you're moving around, I don't know. Can you hear me?

1524
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:10,500
I can hear it. All right, you're still breaking up and going weird. All right, you know what I'm

1525
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:17,380
going to do, guys? I'm going to quickly take a little break. And, yeah, I'm going to just do that,

1526
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:21,780
because I want to see if we can get him back and see if we can finish this thought at least,

1527
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:26,740
before we're done here tonight. So, hold on, Greg, we'll get back to you and attack the O'Chelsea

1528
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:34,100
Effect of Return. (inaudible)

1529
01:33:34,100 --> 01:33:38,020
Get ready for it. We are telling it back now.

1530
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:46,500
So, after a slight electronic disturbance, we returned with the Greek. And it was so funny,

1531
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:51,140
because he says, "I know what time travel works," and then all of a sudden...

1532
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:57,540
Yeah, you got that. So, anyway, let's try again. Greek, you were saying.

1533
01:33:57,540 --> 01:34:05,380
All right, so let's just leave that one alone, but it's not how time travel works, because there

1534
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:10,180
is no. You're actually moving from a different events in the ether, let's say, in the substrate.

1535
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:18,020
And it's not... I got the math for it, meaning, you know, it's the kind of math that people use,

1536
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:21,860
not like I've measured this board... I've cut this board twice and it's still too short, right?

1537
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:25,940
Or you see someone on a construction site and they don't know how to read a tape measure.

1538
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:30,420
It's 16 and two lines. I'm like, "Whoa, come on, you got to learn how to read these things."

1539
01:34:30,420 --> 01:34:35,540
That's just the math, right? So, the math behind it, nature does it use math, it's just the form of

1540
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:40,260
communication, right? Like, I got some eggs, I got some beers, all right? How many? You know,

1541
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:46,660
that helps me, you know? Because some could be two or more, right? So, the math is just that. It just

1542
01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:52,020
helps one organize... get organized, let's just say. That's what ledgers are for. So, I have a ledger

1543
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:57,700
on that and what it is basically is determining the properties of something, not only of the properties

1544
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:02,420
as we commonly describe something, but the properties of where they are and when they are.

1545
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:08,980
Right? And this has been an active use, this technology has been actively used now for over

1546
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:16,260
100 years on the population, unaware, right? So, there's only so much, you know, that we can get into.

1547
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:21,140
But hey, if anybody wants to talk about time travel, I'm open for it, but maybe we'll do it on

1548
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:29,380
another occasion. Yeah, because I would relish the opportunity to even be able to witness events

1549
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:36,740
in the past directly, you know? And I've been told by more than one person that this is possible,

1550
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:43,620
but you got to stop thinking about it that way. And there is, you know? Yeah, but we go back to what we

1551
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:49,220
said. If you want to think about something, look, all right, I'm not going to say what religion it is,

1552
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:55,300
like Christians, but they got this symbol, right? And it's not biblical, it's not historical, right? So,

1553
01:35:55,300 --> 01:36:00,180
so if you want to experience that, how about just starting what's written about it first, right?

1554
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:05,380
If you want to learn about something, how about gather together what's been written about it first? And

1555
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:12,260
then maybe go more direct, you know? That's the thing. Why am I the only one stating that when the

1556
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:17,380
Christ was arrested, whether you believe in it or not, historically and biblically, he was brought

1557
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:22,500
to Pontius Pilate who washed his hands of the matter and said to the religious authorities who

1558
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:27,540
performed the arrest, I am returning him back to you, use your law. And then we know clearly that

1559
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:33,860
the religious authorities of Judea are not Roman, and their method of execution is Mosaic law,

1560
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:39,460
which is by stoning. And if you read the events as the people witness this is clearly not what

1561
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:44,500
symbolism the people are using, right? So, I mean, how retarded is that?

1562
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:45,460
Well, I approach that.

1563
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:46,500
So, I approach that.

1564
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:53,140
I mean, I approach that as, first of all, this idea of the cross, right? This is not a form of

1565
01:36:53,140 --> 01:37:00,100
execution used at that time. It's a no. So, actually, it was prior to it. It's not even, it was actually,

1566
01:37:00,100 --> 01:37:05,060
believe it or not, you're ready for this. Crucifixion was never considered execution, it was a form of

1567
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:11,940
torture. You were put up there for three days and after three days, they let it, if you had

1568
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:14,580
friends or family members, they usually took you down.

1569
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:17,620
Yeah, but for three days, you couldn't, you know, do it.

1570
01:37:17,620 --> 01:37:18,740
But they didn't put you on a--

1571
01:37:18,740 --> 01:37:19,940
You was created by the Assyrians.

1572
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:24,020
Yeah, but they didn't put you on a cross beam. They put you on a tree, usually.

1573
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:29,220
No, actually, the crucifix that they're talking about is a role is an Assyrian form of torture.

1574
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:33,220
It was never a capital punishment. Capital punishment is beheading or stoning.

1575
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:33,940
What does it mean?

1576
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:39,620
Yes, but the thing is, even if the Romans were seeking to execute somebody, they wouldn't have

1577
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:43,700
used that. They wouldn't have used it in that form. The Romans didn't do it anyway.

1578
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:48,500
It depends on who there was no argument because if we go back to the text, it couldn't be more clear.

1579
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:48,820
Yeah, and the--

1580
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:52,180
I'm just by let's say that I'm returning him back to you to use your luck.

1581
01:37:52,180 --> 01:37:57,220
Right, and next step is, as you said, mosaic law, they don't have that in there.

1582
01:37:57,220 --> 01:38:02,900
Yeah, by stoning. No, by stoning. It's very clear. It's actually details of that are given in Deuteronomy 21.

1583
01:38:02,900 --> 01:38:03,220
Right.

1584
01:38:03,220 --> 01:38:08,260
By the way, if you believe anything and you hold adherence to that biblical text,

1585
01:38:08,260 --> 01:38:09,620
you're completely deceived.

1586
01:38:09,620 --> 01:38:13,860
So the 99% of the people that have anything to do, that anything that comes out of there,

1587
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:20,020
are completely deceived by it, it has nothing to do with 99.99% of the people.

1588
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:23,700
It does state things that are coming upon the earth.

1589
01:38:23,700 --> 01:38:25,060
Yeah, they're there.

1590
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:27,540
But when it comes upon the earth, you're going to go with it anyway.

1591
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:29,140
So again, it has nothing to do with you.

1592
01:38:29,140 --> 01:38:34,660
It's a children's book. This is what the scripture, the biblical scripture is.

1593
01:38:34,660 --> 01:38:40,340
Very high order beings that were a billion years technologically ahead of us billions of years ago

1594
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:46,580
gave us that as a children's book. And if you're an adult and you say you can understand that,

1595
01:38:46,580 --> 01:38:50,740
maybe she give it to your cat and dog, and they'll maybe own this because you're really far gone.

1596
01:38:50,740 --> 01:38:53,620
It's written as a children's book. That's why you don't find

1597
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:58,820
99% of the relevant things that one uses in their lives in there,

1598
01:38:58,820 --> 01:39:03,220
just like if you went to a bookstore and picked up a book for four to six-year-olds,

1599
01:39:03,220 --> 01:39:05,860
you're not going to learn how to build, you know, fix your car with that.

1600
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:10,180
It's, you know, if a member fun with Dick and Jane and see spot go,

1601
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:12,340
that's the level of the scripture. That's where it's at.

1602
01:39:12,340 --> 01:39:14,340
It has to do with a certain group of people.

1603
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:19,780
And if you want to be part of that people, you have to basically have a legions to this particular God.

1604
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:22,020
Or entity. And he gives you laws.

1605
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:24,980
Like Simon says, if you want to be one of my people, you do this.

1606
01:39:24,980 --> 01:39:28,500
And if you don't do that, guess what? You ain't as people.

1607
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:31,780
So this goes with all the religions, by the way.

1608
01:39:31,780 --> 01:39:37,220
And these are non-imperial beings, by the way, which is another discussion.

1609
01:39:37,220 --> 01:39:43,860
This is a federation of human beings that are looking out for like,

1610
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:49,460
we're like not even 2% of, you know, our genetics is less than 2% of what,

1611
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:53,780
by the way, bouncing around like a banana and a monkey grove,

1612
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:57,540
bass, backwards. This is a fact.

1613
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:59,620
Anyone could look this up, by the way.

1614
01:39:59,620 --> 01:40:04,260
Genetically in the mitochondria, like we were saying earlier, there's information that goes back,

1615
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:07,060
you know, all the way, you know, as far as you want to look.

1616
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:11,220
Do you know that monkey genetics and pig genetics come after human genetics?

1617
01:40:11,220 --> 01:40:14,180
So that blows away completely that we came from monkeys.

1618
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:19,860
Now, I've been to certain universities and courts and doctors.

1619
01:40:19,860 --> 01:40:24,740
I could tell you they definitely came from monkeys, but that's a different story.

1620
01:40:24,740 --> 01:40:30,340
So, well, there is an interesting divergence there where it does seem as though there's

1621
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:38,100
maybe a heavier influence from one species over another among, you know, I don't know.

1622
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:43,860
It gets a little confusing, but it does seem like maybe we're not all actually, as you, I mean,

1623
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:45,860
we're universally, we're interchangeable.

1624
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:50,260
We're extremely old, extremely old, it's okay.

1625
01:40:50,260 --> 01:40:52,340
You know what we're more like?

1626
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:57,060
Do you remember okay? You got vinyl 33s, you got 45s, more of the little singles,

1627
01:40:57,060 --> 01:41:00,020
and then before that you had the 78s. Do you remember the 78s?

1628
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:00,980
Yeah, actually, yeah.

1629
01:41:00,980 --> 01:41:03,380
Okay, I got some 78s, they're very thick.

1630
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:09,860
Anyway, I pulled one out and I put it on a turntable and I downloaded it digitally into a file.

1631
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:16,420
So, I went from like a 1923 record to having in a digital file.

1632
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:20,820
Think about the jump because it went from 78 to 43 to 43, right?

1633
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:29,700
So, you know, then magnetic tape to DVDCD and now I'm going from 78 right to

1634
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:33,620
a computer file, holy crap, what a quantum leap, right?

1635
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:35,460
That's how we are right now.

1636
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:36,660
We are that version.

1637
01:41:36,660 --> 01:41:41,140
We are almost like a digital representation of what humans are.

1638
01:41:41,140 --> 01:41:43,380
What do you think we only lived to 60 or 70 years?

1639
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:46,100
You know, you're not even about those 80/90s.

1640
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,460
You're not supposed to do anything.

1641
01:41:47,460 --> 01:41:51,540
Yeah, but you know what's funny about those digital representations is that

1642
01:41:51,540 --> 01:41:58,100
they are as sophisticated as it is, it lacks a whole bunch of things.

1643
01:41:58,100 --> 01:42:00,740
A whole bunch of stuff has been removed.

1644
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:04,420
Well, see, but that's where I was going here is that, you know,

1645
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:09,940
it's de-evolution as opposed to evolution, it seems like because even though these things are like

1646
01:42:09,940 --> 01:42:14,980
your spaster and they can move quicker and you can communicate them, you can send them around the

1647
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:19,620
world in seconds, right? You couldn't send a 78 around the world.

1648
01:42:19,620 --> 01:42:21,460
You were experiencing, yeah.

1649
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:23,620
Well, you could, but you're experiencing evolution.

1650
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:27,620
Let's say you work, let's say with telephones all day, salesman, right?

1651
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:28,740
Your finger gets sore.

1652
01:42:28,740 --> 01:42:31,700
Every set's where they stick a pencil to dial or the old dial phones, right?

1653
01:42:31,700 --> 01:42:32,980
You know, touchtones.

1654
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:34,180
Now you don't do that anymore.

1655
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:37,700
You have a mouse. You have a different type of soreness so your body is going to evolve different.

1656
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:40,580
Then what is it called? Carpet Tunnel Syndrome, the type of sad?

1657
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:44,180
That didn't exist 75/80 years ago, right?

1658
01:42:44,180 --> 01:42:47,940
Well, maybe a tailor would have it sewing buttons all day or something.

1659
01:42:47,940 --> 01:42:49,220
That makes sense, so.

1660
01:42:49,220 --> 01:42:50,580
There is evolution, you know?

1661
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:53,780
Like in other words, cheap shoes give people bad feet.

1662
01:42:53,780 --> 01:42:54,740
I'm serious.

1663
01:42:54,740 --> 01:42:56,420
Right, bad shoes.

1664
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:57,860
So that's a form of evolution.

1665
01:42:57,860 --> 01:43:02,820
So there is evolution that way, in other words, biological influence change,

1666
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:04,740
on a biology of something.

1667
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:06,580
But essentially, okay, here you are.

1668
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:07,860
Let me just drop another thing.

1669
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:12,180
Do you know that most of the people on this planet, two thirds are synthetic humans.

1670
01:43:12,180 --> 01:43:15,060
They're not real humans as humans are defined.

1671
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:16,100
What I mean by that?

1672
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:19,220
At conception, people, it's funny how many people will know this.

1673
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:20,820
You could look it up.

1674
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:24,260
At conception, when the sperm meets the egg, there's a flash of light

1675
01:43:24,260 --> 01:43:26,420
when the union, when the conception begins.

1676
01:43:26,420 --> 01:43:27,780
It's a very brief flash of light.

1677
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:29,460
It's in the millisecond, you know?

1678
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:31,300
But it's within the frame rate.

1679
01:43:31,300 --> 01:43:33,060
If you have a microscope, you can see it.

1680
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:35,780
It will be a little white yellow, blueish,

1681
01:43:35,780 --> 01:43:37,060
flash.

1682
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:38,820
That's a download.

1683
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:42,180
That is a ethereal download that determines whether the person is going to

1684
01:43:42,180 --> 01:43:44,420
carry genetics that are real or whatever.

1685
01:43:44,420 --> 01:43:47,540
Now, when you manipulate that flash,

1686
01:43:47,540 --> 01:43:51,380
just like if you're downloading something and the internet gets a hiccup,

1687
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:52,820
you know, the download is bad, right?

1688
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:54,100
You've got to do it over, right?

1689
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:57,700
Okay, so there's a little download that happens at the moment,

1690
01:43:57,700 --> 01:43:58,900
the sperm in the egg meat.

1691
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:01,780
And this has been learned in how to be interrupted.

1692
01:44:01,780 --> 01:44:03,700
And when that's interrupted in an individual,

1693
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:06,580
it's recorded on the mitochondria and they're not a real human,

1694
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:07,380
cosmically.

1695
01:44:07,380 --> 01:44:10,900
You know, if you hit them across the head with a baseball bat,

1696
01:44:10,900 --> 01:44:12,100
they'll cry.

1697
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:13,860
If you don't feed them, they'll get hungry.

1698
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:16,980
They sound the same way, but cosmically, from a spiritual point of view,

1699
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:18,340
they're considered a synthetic.

1700
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:21,220
Now, here's the interesting thing about it.

1701
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:23,540
This could have happened to your parents.

1702
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:26,820
It has to, it's not hereditary of the synthetic formation.

1703
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:29,700
It has to be, at the moment, a conception has to be manipulated.

1704
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:34,100
So let's say both of your parents would became synthetics because they were a manipulative,

1705
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:35,380
they can have a real baby.

1706
01:44:35,380 --> 01:44:36,340
In other words, you weren't.

1707
01:44:36,340 --> 01:44:39,380
They didn't mess with that point when you were conceived.

1708
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:42,180
You could be real, but in your genetics, in your mitochondria,

1709
01:44:42,180 --> 01:44:44,180
it will show that your parents were messed with.

1710
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:48,740
So the people that, you know, the normies, the mask wearers,

1711
01:44:48,740 --> 01:44:51,540
the people that have to, you know, oh, I got to do what they say,

1712
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:52,820
those are the synthetics.

1713
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:56,020
And they've been, this is, this process started in very recently,

1714
01:44:56,020 --> 01:44:58,580
in the 70s and 80s experimented on very heavily.

1715
01:44:58,580 --> 01:45:02,900
They always blocked this kind of high-level technology by telling you,

1716
01:45:02,900 --> 01:45:05,780
oh, they did chemical and men, K, ultra,

1717
01:45:05,780 --> 01:45:06,260
they did this.

1718
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:07,780
They always try to keep it on the chemical.

1719
01:45:07,780 --> 01:45:10,340
The more chemical stuff they try to tell you,

1720
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:14,980
that means that they're actually messing with you on a higher electrical frequency level, more and more.

1721
01:45:14,980 --> 01:45:16,020
All right?

1722
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:18,020
Just like nuclear devices.

1723
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:21,300
Okay, so now I've got, now I've got a personal question because

1724
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:24,900
I, I have been hearing people over the past few years, especially,

1725
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:28,660
talk about the non-player characters because they're relating it to a video game.

1726
01:45:28,660 --> 01:45:29,620
NPCs.

1727
01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:29,940
And-

1728
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:34,180
That's a valid, that's another way of disclosing what's going on, right?

1729
01:45:34,180 --> 01:45:39,700
Look, what's the difference between a normy and a conspiracy theorist is two and a half years.

1730
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:40,340
Right?

1731
01:45:40,340 --> 01:45:44,980
Because anybody who's called a conspiracy theorist, which you know the origin of it,

1732
01:45:44,980 --> 01:45:46,820
of course.

1733
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:49,860
is always, they're always right, but it doesn't matter because to these people,

1734
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:53,620
that's why it's so easy to wipe out, says one third of the population will be wiped out.

1735
01:45:53,620 --> 01:45:57,780
Okay, well, we still, you could conceivably do that and not kill any real humans, by the way.

1736
01:45:57,780 --> 01:46:00,660
So when you're walking around on the street,

1737
01:46:00,660 --> 01:46:05,220
right, and you see people that have that blank stare because the, you know,

1738
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:09,300
they say the windows are the eye to the body, you know, they say the windows of the eye to the

1739
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:12,500
soul doesn't say that. It's the, to the body.

1740
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:16,820
Do you know when you look into someone's eye, you actually see the, the optic nervous goes

1741
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:18,260
directly to the brain.

1742
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:18,500
Yeah.

1743
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:19,620
It's part of the brain.

1744
01:46:19,620 --> 01:46:20,260
Yeah, of course.

1745
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:24,740
So when you look inside someone's eye, actually, this was shown a lot in the early movies,

1746
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:30,100
you can stimulate them to be happy or sexually aroused, depressed, but just by looking into their eye,

1747
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:36,900
if you know how to manipulate that, it's an old, the mesmerized hypnotic stuff, right?

1748
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:41,540
Yeah, today people will talk about neural linguistic programming. It's all based on this very same

1749
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:47,300
principle that if you, and that is also because the eye literally does project a little bit of

1750
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:50,180
light, whether people know that or not.

1751
01:46:50,180 --> 01:46:56,820
And if you learn how to control it, you can project what you like, obviously, and you can

1752
01:46:56,820 --> 01:47:02,740
cause an influence by interaction directly with that person's brain through the window of the eye.

1753
01:47:02,740 --> 01:47:06,420
Yeah, and it's so funny because you try and explain this.

1754
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:09,940
The fetics are very susceptible to that and they cannot project.

1755
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:10,660
Oh, they can't.

1756
01:47:10,660 --> 01:47:11,780
Here's the scary part.

1757
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:16,100
You can have a woman, you can have a woman that you can see the child with and you both

1758
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:19,700
could be real and the child could be a synthetic if it's messed with that conception.

1759
01:47:19,700 --> 01:47:27,460
Well, obviously, it has to be done fresh every time.

1760
01:47:27,460 --> 01:47:31,300
And it's done. There are satellites to do it. There's ground tech to do it.

1761
01:47:31,300 --> 01:47:32,900
There are no secrets, by the way.

1762
01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:34,660
There are no secrets anymore.

1763
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:39,700
Well, I've had people explain to me that, and I don't know if this sounds right to you, but

1764
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:42,260
the fact that we're constantly bathing in these

1765
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:49,620
electromagnetic frequencies, that is actually part of the purpose is to disrupt this

1766
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:53,700
this very unique thing that does occur at the moment of conception.

1767
01:47:53,700 --> 01:48:00,020
Incidentally, it has rendered a great many more people to be without it.

1768
01:48:00,020 --> 01:48:05,380
Sensibly, I'm thinking to myself, an electromagnetic frequency, which is pulsed at something

1769
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:08,020
at the proper speed, can disrupt light.

1770
01:48:08,020 --> 01:48:12,100
Sure, but it's not an electromagnetic, the electromagnetic, believe it or not,

1771
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:16,180
we're pretty, we're okay with it. It does heat up the water in the cells.

1772
01:48:16,180 --> 01:48:22,340
This is not a play on words. It's a magneto-dielectric, meaning it's more on the ether side,

1773
01:48:22,340 --> 01:48:26,100
like what Tesla talked about, instantaneous communication, right?

1774
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:28,740
Versus the time delay. We're having a Skype call.

1775
01:48:28,740 --> 01:48:31,300
I've had Skype calls all over the world. There's no delay. How is that?

1776
01:48:31,300 --> 01:48:34,420
You see, they're using this tech right here under your noses all the time.

1777
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:40,180
It's impossible, based on any physics, that we don't have a time delay, but we don't.

1778
01:48:40,740 --> 01:48:45,940
So that they teach you. By the way, you can't break the laws of physics and all this other stuff,

1779
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:49,700
that's the same thing that the Catholic Church did in the 1500s, right?

1780
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:52,820
So it's a religion. But here's the other thing.

1781
01:48:52,820 --> 01:48:58,100
I want to hear a little bit here. I want to hear it back to the good old Vinnie Eastwood days.

1782
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:03,940
Back in 2011, he interviewed a guy called Donald Marshall, who basically talked about the

1783
01:49:03,940 --> 01:49:09,220
cloning centers underground in REM, which is a rapid-eye movement, consciousness transfer.

1784
01:49:09,220 --> 01:49:12,260
When you're asleep, they're able to take your consciousness and put it in the cloned.

1785
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:15,220
Now, here's the thing. I revisited this because it's very important.

1786
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:20,420
About five years ago, I was sending people articles, not online anymore,

1787
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:24,900
that they did it. Remember all these archaeological digs in Egypt,

1788
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:29,940
I don't know, five, six years ago? I think, well, no, actually less than that. It was 2018 or so. Yeah, anyway.

1789
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:33,380
And this one article comes out. It was a scientific one. It wasn't on the mainstream.

1790
01:49:33,380 --> 01:49:37,860
And it says that they dug up a mummy and it was a clone. And I sent it to people and said,

1791
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:42,020
"Oh, they're going to clone mummies?" I said, "No, no, no, no, no, read it." The mummy that they dug up

1792
01:49:42,020 --> 01:49:47,140
is a clone. In other words, the Egyptians had cloning technology. And they went over everyone's head.

1793
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:51,380
Like, how could that be? Yeah. Very, very simple. Here's another example.

1794
01:49:51,380 --> 01:49:58,180
There's a short news clip. You could still look it up where they grow a second skin for

1795
01:49:58,180 --> 01:50:03,940
burn victims. They take some skin cells from you and they grow a skin in the lab and then they

1796
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:08,820
go put it on the patient, right? So the news people walk in there. There was a new company and they

1797
01:50:08,820 --> 01:50:15,860
went from being nothing to millions and millions. So the first three seconds, it shows this table.

1798
01:50:15,860 --> 01:50:22,340
It's very crude. How do you make cells divide and clone? It's very crude. He's basically, he's got a

1799
01:50:22,340 --> 01:50:27,940
table that wobbles. Imagine it's just like a wobbling table. It's moving with a motor and he's got all

1800
01:50:27,940 --> 01:50:32,020
these glass flasks on it and the liquid is wobbling and wobbling. So he goes up to one of them and he

1801
01:50:32,020 --> 01:50:38,180
takes the skin out of the wobbling table and he puts it on a, looks like a cutting board and he

1802
01:50:38,180 --> 01:50:43,060
scrapes off a layer and he holds it up. This is what we need. This is how they do it. It's very

1803
01:50:43,060 --> 01:50:50,180
simple. So if you agitated tissue very, very at a certain rate with certain water, it will multiply.

1804
01:50:50,180 --> 01:50:54,980
This is a, so easy. You can literally do it in your kitchen just like we talked about. You can

1805
01:50:54,980 --> 01:51:01,140
grow gold in your kitchen, right? Oh, yeah. So, yeah. So, so the Egyptians had this, you know. Now,

1806
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:05,380
the pyramids have nothing to do with this because the pyramids were built by others because the time

1807
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:10,500
that they tell you the pyramids were built, they didn't even have toilets, right? So, if I said,

1808
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:15,620
let's build some pyramids and these people here are crying about, we should build the toilets first.

1809
01:51:15,620 --> 01:51:20,740
We're going to build the pyramids first, right? No, no, sorry. They were very primitive. But the people

1810
01:51:20,740 --> 01:51:25,860
that were there, still amongst them, just like Atlantis, for example, you know, Atlantis has

1811
01:51:25,860 --> 01:51:31,780
shuttles to Venus and Mars, you know, back and forth and the northern part of Atlantis are the people

1812
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:35,460
that are in Ireland right now. They sunk the continent with sunk and the southern part were the

1813
01:51:35,460 --> 01:51:40,820
blue people like the, in Krishna, you know, the blue people. Very simple and things got out of hand

1814
01:51:40,820 --> 01:51:48,420
very quickly there. Well, over thousands of years, but, but the advancement, this concept of

1815
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:52,340
cloning, whatever they tell you, they're banning, you know, those a lot of laws we ban cloning is

1816
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:56,980
what they're heavily into, right? Like, for example, they have the DEA and,

1817
01:51:56,980 --> 01:52:00,740
any drugs in the Western world, but that means they're heavily into it because that's what the drug

1818
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:06,500
money is, what lubricates the banking system, right? Without the drug money, the wheels will get rusty

1819
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:10,660
and stop, right? Not mortgages, whatever is the drug money. So you wouldn't entirely discount

1820
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:15,620
Zacharias. So you wouldn't entirely discount Zacharias' sition is what you're telling me.

1821
01:52:15,620 --> 01:52:21,300
He's very light. He's like a lot of the stuff that I talk about introductory. It's much more like

1822
01:52:21,300 --> 01:52:26,180
the, what he calls the Anunnaki are hybrids of the Elohim. You're right. And no, I understand that,

1823
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:33,300
but when he gets into the, you know, the, the, the, the narrative that is left behind by a thoth,

1824
01:52:33,300 --> 01:52:38,500
it's him and somebody else who put them together. Right. Which are very old humans again. Yeah. And

1825
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:44,260
basically the laws that you see in the Bible that seem restrictive are to prevent you from having

1826
01:52:44,260 --> 01:52:48,660
sex with animals and male and male and female with female all the time and all that. Because

1827
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:54,580
look, there are worlds out there where they did have the homosexuality. They, they eliminated all the

1828
01:52:54,580 --> 01:52:59,540
heterosexuals and they reproduced by cloning. If your heterosexual is a death penalty, right?

1829
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:04,740
And other places, but so they didn't want that here. So they have these very strict laws to

1830
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:08,420
prevent you from mating with animals. When you go back, you know, all the history they tell you

1831
01:53:08,420 --> 01:53:12,820
is false, but all the mythology is true. Like when you see half animal, half horse, the center,

1832
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:17,380
you know, half animal, this is possible because our, our genetics are very valuable and pliable.

1833
01:53:17,380 --> 01:53:21,860
That's why, for example, when you read in the Bible, when they were told to go in and kill all the

1834
01:53:21,860 --> 01:53:26,900
animals also and the people is because they were having sex with the animals. You don't want to have,

1835
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:31,460
you know, because sheep could bear, you know, anyway, and cows, you know, they have a sheep with

1836
01:53:31,460 --> 01:53:37,140
human faces on the, on you could see that, you know. So humans are pretty monstrous. And what I mean by

1837
01:53:37,140 --> 01:53:42,100
that is like Lord of the flies, you know, remember the book Lord of the flies, young children get

1838
01:53:42,100 --> 01:53:47,380
shipwrecked and end up killing the fat boy in like two weeks, right, for no reason. How many times have

1839
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:52,020
we said you're on a violin planet? If you woke up this morning with your liver and your body be thankful

1840
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:56,180
because in the middle of the night someone will crawl in through the window and want to cut your body

1841
01:53:56,180 --> 01:54:00,980
open and you'll see why you're doing it because I can because I feel like it. Right? That's why

1842
01:54:00,980 --> 01:54:10,980
predators do. So we're in a very self-induced mania of violence and that has to be, you know,

1843
01:54:10,980 --> 01:54:15,700
well, it has to be under control. And but at this point it's going to let go. They're going to,

1844
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:20,260
that's what I'm saying. Your prayers are not, don't, they've been, if you think you're getting answers

1845
01:54:20,260 --> 01:54:25,140
in your prayers, it's been predetermined before you've even prayed already. It's already done. Everything's

1846
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:28,900
in the credits, right? And when you're watching the credits of the movie, you don't expect the new scene

1847
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:34,500
to come up. Sometimes they do that for shicks and giggles or whatever. But just a harking back to the

1848
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:39,620
cloning thing that is so advanced right now. Give me an example. If you look at these politicians,

1849
01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:44,820
presidents, prime ministers or whatever, you look around, you ever see how their motorcades is

1850
01:54:44,820 --> 01:54:51,700
like minimal security, like a half, like a half drunk retired special forces guy in his buddies could

1851
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:57,140
take over any motorcades. It's like minimal security. Right? Right? And kidnap any important person.

1852
01:54:57,140 --> 01:55:00,820
Well, this has been done before and they, and let's say they get the guy, the prime minister,

1853
01:55:00,820 --> 01:55:04,180
the president in the room, they're ready to call for their ransom money and the president,

1854
01:55:04,180 --> 01:55:09,940
prime minister explodes, boom, everybody's killed in the room. Well, and then an hour later, the same

1855
01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:14,900
prime minister, a president is doing a talk because it's not, you know, it's another copy, let's say.

1856
01:55:14,900 --> 01:55:21,700
So word gets around, don't bother kidnapping these, you know, high profile actors or high profile

1857
01:55:21,700 --> 01:55:26,820
people because they're not really real. They have a bomb in their head. And it's just like,

1858
01:55:26,820 --> 01:55:32,340
bank robberies went down when they started putting the dipax in the cash. So you leave the cash,

1859
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:38,100
you get a mile away and then boom, the dipax blows up how, what, what's, how good is that? Right? Right.

1860
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:43,300
You just wasted all your effort to get a load of people, still with blue dye, yeah.

1861
01:55:43,300 --> 01:55:47,460
So it's impossible to take hostages and it's no reason to assassinate anyone anymore because they're

1862
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:53,140
already not real. So this is so, if you're just like, for example, when you tell people about

1863
01:55:53,140 --> 01:56:00,020
nuclear technology or all this, they still think like 1940 stuff, right? Well, that's all held by

1864
01:56:00,020 --> 01:56:06,500
DOE, Department of the two groups that control that technology is the Department of Energy and the

1865
01:56:06,500 --> 01:56:11,620
Secret Service. It's a department in the Secret Service called the Office of Special Transportation.

1866
01:56:11,620 --> 01:56:18,180
I love it how they hide things between them from obscure names, right? So anyway,

1867
01:56:18,180 --> 01:56:24,580
the problem is you have two different societies. You've got the surface and dwelling earth

1868
01:56:24,580 --> 01:56:33,220
in habit, hence which are basically equal to almost herd animals at this point, right? But not. But

1869
01:56:33,220 --> 01:56:38,100
almost equal in many ways, the way they act, the way they think and all that stuff, not much more

1870
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:44,900
evolved than that, evolved meaning educated or cultured or their personal character. And then

1871
01:56:44,900 --> 01:56:49,220
you have another society that is not sharing that is incorporating a lot of the things that I've

1872
01:56:49,220 --> 01:56:55,940
discussed in the past five minutes. Right. Okay, so I have actually one more, I mean, we've got a

1873
01:56:55,940 --> 01:57:03,780
little bit over time here, but I'm sure you're okay with that for the moment. So you are, right?

1874
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:08,820
Just double checking. You know, actually I lost you there. You know, I've been getting a lot of

1875
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:13,700
hiccups every few minutes. Oh, really? For five seconds. Go ahead and repeat that. I'm sorry. I was saying

1876
01:57:13,700 --> 01:57:17,860
we're actually a little over time right now, but. All right, we're done. Yeah. We're done. Thanks for

1877
01:57:17,860 --> 01:57:23,140
hooking up on the dude a little bit of a recap. I think we put in a couple extra things there.

1878
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:29,540
Get people thinking definitely did. Okay. We'll leave it at that everybody. So slightly extended

1879
01:57:29,540 --> 01:57:33,540
podcast tonight and a couple of little hiccups here and they're back and forth between me and the

1880
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:40,900
Greek communicating for some odd reason. But a bunch of things in here. Yes, a recap for sure.

1881
01:57:40,900 --> 01:57:45,620
But yeah, you know, there'll be a treat for some in an irritation for most.

1882
01:57:45,620 --> 01:57:52,900
That that I I need to get a t-shirt that says that just says that a treat.

1883
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:59,300
A treat for some in irritation for most. A treat for some in irritation for most. I love it. I love it.

1884
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:03,780
That's how you know you're doing it right. There you go. Air okay, everybody. The Greek.

1885
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:10,820
Support Chuccochillianchillie.com. There's no money in it. So yeah, that is the problem.

1886
01:58:10,820 --> 01:58:14,740
That's the biggest problem, I think. And you know, some people would say that, look, you're in an

1887
01:58:14,740 --> 01:58:20,980
age when you can be independently supported. But quite frankly, I'm on that business model too. And

1888
01:58:20,980 --> 01:58:27,620
look, I'm not going to complain, but I'm going to complain. Okay, because people want to support you.

1889
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:33,380
They love you to death, but honestly. So you're listening and this is a very unsettling question.

1890
01:58:33,380 --> 01:58:39,060
Support the damn show. And I want you to do this because, you know, the Chillianchillie,

1891
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:44,420
for example, in a few places where Greg Paliske get his is the stuff out. I mean, you'll still see

1892
01:58:44,420 --> 01:58:51,300
my violence in some of these outlets, but nevertheless, it's nice to be a regular on CNN and on MSDMC.

1893
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:58,580
But no more. Revelation through conversation. Oh, chchillie.com.
