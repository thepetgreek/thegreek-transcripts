1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,080
* никто suется*

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,680
Game 30, Game 40.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,080
Game 3, Game 50, Game 40.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,420
Attack!

5
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,340
The biggest thing is now the Czecho National Radio.

6
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,740
It's been up for many years to plan the UK Research as specializing in the intelligacies of the Parliament,

7
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,860
and multiple of salvation,

8
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,940
and not again another global criminal operation within the twenty to twenty percentories.

9
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,200
Conversation speaks.

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,700
History is the market and tax.

11
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,540
Now I know, the most integrated voice is all these.

12
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,240
*the sound effect of the voice*

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,240
The O-Cali!

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,240
*the sound effect of the voice*

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,860
September 30, 20,

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,780
20 allegedly according to that thing we call a calendar,

17
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,020
and this indeed is the show you were looking for.

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,680
Guess I know that because...

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,680
*laughs*

20
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,440
You found it.

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,700
Anyway, still do have a little bit of a cough.

22
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,800
It may interrupt me on occasion here, but...

23
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,140
It is what it is on what they call "Wodans Day Wednesday the middle of the week."

24
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:57,660
Now, this is the time of the week that I usually try and do something different,

25
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,620
and gotta be honest with you, it was a great timing that I happen to be able to catch.

26
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:06,120
A guy I used to do a show with called O-Cali in the Greek,

27
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,920
and I'm more than happy to sit down and have a discussion with him just about any time,

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,260
because it's always a good time to see through the nonsense,

29
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,060
and not everybody is acclimated to Greek speak.

30
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,260
*laughs*

31
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,460
And we discover that incrementally, you know,

32
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,260
a different time periods on YouTube for sure,

33
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,560
when people discover the show that we used to do.

34
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,260
Comments still come in, I try not to pay much attention to them, but occasionally,

35
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:41,060
they do pile up a bit, and they range from the extremely disturbed,

36
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,660
sort of, upset, usual cesspool of commenting,

37
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,060
to, you know, "I'm so happy I found this."

38
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,560
But anyway, it's always fascinating, always interesting to speak with the Greek,

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,360
because I gotta be honest no matter how I see the world,

40
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,860
which apparently is not like the other upright standing individuals that are called humans.

41
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,360
*clears throat*

42
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,360
The Greek sees it in a completely different way,

43
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,960
and quite frankly, it's always a clarifying experience.

44
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,960
So, happy to have you along, Greek.

45
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:19,960
I gotta say, it's been a little too long, I think, since the last time you and I spoke.

46
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,660
I think it's what they used to call January.

47
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,760
Now, I'm not sure about exactly what day it is quite frankly,

48
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,260
because there was something off in my calculations,

49
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,760
and a few other people enjoyed this miscalculation along with me trying to reckon

50
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,760
what I would call real time.

51
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
Well, lawful time.

52
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,960
Lawful time, okay.

53
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:45,460
It happens to line up everything's lining up, like the Pope's work schedule,

54
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,660
and lawful time, for example, new time.

55
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:55,460
I'm reckoning around the 30th day of the 7th month, like September means 7, right?

56
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,260
So, it's lining up with the Pope's work schedule.

57
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,060
I know, like, I'm an Old Testament kind of guy at the tabernacle this year,

58
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,860
and it lined up with Maybon.

59
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,260
I don't know if you're familiar with Druid festivals.

60
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,960
I know this hardcore Druid guy, I know it's telling him,

61
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,760
"Today's the last great day," and he says, "Yeah, I know," and he says, "it's Maybon."

62
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,460
I said, "Really?"

63
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,060
So, that's lining up.

64
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,060
Anyway.

65
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:24,260
Lawful versus unlawful, legal versus whatever.

66
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,260
Why bother?

67
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,260
Okay.

68
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,260
All right.

69
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,260
Where do we start?

70
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,260
Well, where do we start?

71
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,260
I got a...

72
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,260
We start with a joke.

73
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,260
Okay.

74
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,260
You ready?

75
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,260
Sure.

76
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,260
Presidential debates.

77
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,260
That's the joke.

78
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,260
There's a joke.

79
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,260
Okay.

80
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,260
I know the punchline this time, Greek.

81
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,260
Isn't that amazing?

82
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,260
That is the punchline.

83
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,260
The punchline is just the thing itself.

84
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,060
Well, that's most of the planet seems like, really.

85
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,060
I've got a lot of...

86
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,060
I've got a lot of...

87
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,560
Yeah, you know I've been talking about legal and lawful.

88
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,960
I'm not concerned with anything legal or illegal.

89
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,460
Unless it's a sick bird, you know, an ill-eagle.

90
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,460
Okay.

91
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,960
And about clarity, you know, you have those that see

92
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,460
and those that don't see or not see, get it not see.

93
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,460
Anyway.

94
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:18,660
So anyway, I would suggest that the reality is to be judged on if it's real or not.

95
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,660
Right?

96
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,660
Okay.

97
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,760
If I bring you a coin and I tell you this is a silver coin, you could take it on face value

98
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,660
or what I say or you can have it tested for its silver content.

99
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,660
Right?

100
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,660
Correct.

101
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,160
But they're both real.

102
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:38,400
In other words, if you don't have it tested and it's a fake silver coin, it's still in reality

103
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
a silver coin, you see.

104
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,100
So, I've got counterfeit bill.

105
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,500
You know, counterfeit and fake news is, right?

106
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
So, reality must be tested.

107
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Correct.

108
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Right.

109
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:56,500
So, when we test it, proof it, we come up with something very different.

110
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:05,100
As a matter of fact, the results of proofing something cannot be relayed back to the Nazis,

111
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,300
you know, then people who don't not see, right?

112
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:15,000
Because the information gap that is created by simply providing the information of the proof

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
is so, so large and so discrepant to what they're used to, that it doesn't make any sense.

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,200
And thus, the proofing is irrelevant to those that don't see.

115
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,200
I think we've said, by the way, go back to the Oceleon-The-Greek stuff.

116
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:35,600
That's probably the best reference stuff for introduction to Greek speak and pick up those topics

117
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,000
and what we've talked about.

118
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,400
By the way, there's a website done by someone else called GreekSpeak.

119
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,900
It's a double E, double E, right?

120
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,200
SpeakSpaldWithWEE.com, justgreakspeak.com.

121
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:52,300
And if you want to get in touch with me personally, I have the dormant, uncommonradio.com website,

122
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,700
the only thing you can activate there is the email.

123
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,100
So, that's my own personal, and it's not active for various reasons.

124
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Even though it's a pretty kick-ass domain.

125
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,400
So, where do we go from here?

126
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,300
Well, okay, where we've been?

127
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,300
A couple things.

128
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,100
Where we've been, right, so I want to go back over something you just said.

129
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:22,300
Listen, I advise people to go ahead if you can access the archives are available out there.

130
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:29,800
For sure, I know there's somebody out there trying to sell them, but they are available for free if you look.

131
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:39,500
Anyway, so you could go back to those shows we did, but something you just said is very interesting to me about this ability to see and not see.

132
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,500
It's relevant to the time for sure.

133
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,000
I have noticed that the information gap is not something that is static.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,200
It is widening, and it's fluid.

135
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,700
Yeah, well, see, but I am noticing the increase in the gap, okay?

136
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,600
So, that's where I'm going with this. There may at some point be a contraction, okay?

137
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,600
But I can only talk to you about what I'm observing, right?

138
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,000
And the fact is this gap is growing.

139
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,600
It is growing in dimension in my mind, why?

140
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:22,600
Now, I question whether it is a linguistic issue, and if there is a failure to communicate because the communication is confounded.

141
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:33,000
Or if we are seeing because it seemed to me like we had a moment, more than a moment really, but a period of time where that gap wasn't widening.

142
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
In fact, it seemed as though all of a sudden people had awareness of things around them for a little while.

143
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It was very brief, not like what you and I were talking about when things would come together and people would understand everything quite well on this rock.

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:01,600
Okay, not like that, but a very brief time period where it seemed as though the comprehension, if you will, was actually elevating a bit.

145
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,000
And that is absolutely come.

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,800
Okay, so I'm going to come up for a second.

147
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,000
That must have been the last time I got hit by an asteroid because short of that, I can't see it.

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,800
Well, let me discuss the way the cosmic censorship, which is beyond that.

149
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,600
In other words, there is shutdown by a cosmic divine force, which is the shutdown.

150
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,400
So, but yeah, go ahead.

151
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:29,000
I get you, I get what you're seeing what let's say to cut to the chase, do you have a temporal, a temporal data on when that happened?

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:42,600
Do you think was it a year ago, five years ago, 10 years ago when I would say it was about four years ago and I did not take note of it until recently because of the tremendous contrast.

153
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:54,000
It was almost indesernable, like as if let's just imagine for a second, we think about the cosmic censorship as a computer program for a little while.

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,600
The program was not fully functional.

155
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,400
It seemed like about four years ago.

156
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:10,000
But now it has not only been updated and repaired, but incrementally appears to be growing more intense.

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Because I see a failure of communication here on the most simple of levels that used to be a given.

158
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I have troubles quite frankly having conversations.

159
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Maybe I could help, maybe I could help you out what you're trying to say, what I'm getting.

160
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Please.

161
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,400
What I've been talking about timekeeping is around 1998, which was the beginning of the seventh millennium.

162
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:44,400
But with a five year grace period, let's say 2003 on the Pope's work schedule, till about the early 2030s or less, when I say early 2030s, I'm talking 31, 32, 33.

163
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:52,400
You are going to have a thousand years of events in human history compressed into that time period of about 40 years.

164
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Let me just say that again, a thousand years of human events compressed into a time of about 40 years.

165
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:06,400
So it's very concentrated, so you don't have time to think, time to perceive, you just have time to what? Go along.

166
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,400
That doesn't mean get along.

167
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
That just means go along.

168
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:20,400
But nonetheless, I would suggest that the nature of our existence as humans, as we've talked about external input, is voluntary.

169
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Not because we're here, we've volunteered to be here, but because without talking about the Greek fates, the aspect of fate in many cases has many branches and is voluntary.

170
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:46,400
I think the last time we spoke, maybe two of the last times we spoke, I said the number one priority of the every administrative government in the world is population reduction.

171
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:56,400
How do you get rid of the majority of the people in the world and have those that are remaining be compliant and willing to go along with what's next?

172
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Well, what's interesting is that in most countries, especially the West, 40 to 75% of the people that put general population at large is willing to take an injection voluntarily.

173
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,400
If you know what I mean, voluntarily.

174
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,400
So why do you think in the US they're letting them not taking the guns away?

175
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Because it doesn't take much to take a simple to human to convince them to go out and shoot his neighbor.

176
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:34,400
So what I suggest is when you compress this time parallel to what is going to, what this time actually represents, don't try to make sense of it.

177
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:46,400
So if you do explain or proof what's going on, it won't make sense for any rational comparative basis that you can compare it to other things because it's unique in that way.

178
00:11:46,400 --> 00:12:03,400
But if you do understand how these things go by what's called the ancient prophecies and also just rational thinking and studying reference material, which we might want to talk about, not the reference material, but what is referenced and contrary.

179
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,400
You'll see that it's pretty easy to do and it's also once you realize you're being censored cosmically.

180
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Now you know what you can focus on shipping away at.

181
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:20,400
So that's what I've been trying to do with Greek speak and that's why, like for example, I don't, I'm not a public, I don't go out and do stuff.

182
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:32,400
Even though I recently did a Freeman interview by request and the website is dormant is because the reality as proofs will not make any sense.

183
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:42,400
No, look, I understand where you're going here, but this is interesting because you're actually bringing up some questions.

184
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Now I've gotten questions from listeners recently.

185
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,400
And by recently, I mean over the past few months.

186
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Actually, all during this year since the last time you were on.

187
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,400
And again, you know, noted on the Pope's work schedule, that would be sometime in January.

188
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:14,400
So since then, I've been getting questions one by one here and there related to current events and you know what is the connection and I never attempt to speak on your behalf.

189
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,400
You understand.

190
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:22,400
I've always said I will attempt to bring them on and see if he'll answer the question.

191
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:38,400
And so I'll have an interview.

192
00:13:38,400 --> 00:14:05,400
I'll answer everything that's asked by most of these people.

193
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,400
These are things that we've been taught about, you know, since we were children in one form or another.

194
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,400
And quite frankly, the fact that it is here, I'm yawning. This is not a surprise.

195
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Okay, even in the very dumbed down version of what, well, hate to do this, but what they teach you in the organized Christian faiths, which I'm well acquainted with.

196
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,400
You have a very dumbed down version of this.

197
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,400
Every Bible is a children's Bible basically to you.

198
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:45,400
All right. And these ideas that, you know, at a certain point, there would be this problem with linguistics I was talking about was already something that's been done before.

199
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:56,400
The fact that there is a disease. Now, I don't know if it's a virus, but of course people wanted to ask about that because we talked about viruses on this show, you know, the show we used to do.

200
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:05,400
The sonic events that we used to partake of, participate in, excuse me, not partake of that way other people could partake of.

201
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:14,400
You know, it seems strange to me, but a lot of people think that this COVID-19 thing is something new.

202
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:27,400
It is, COVID is COV-ID stands for Certificate of Vaccine ID. It's like it's an addendum to the real ID and it was implemented privately in 2019. That's what COVID stands for.

203
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:35,400
It's, you can't catch COVID-19 anymore. You can catch a birth certificate or driver's license or, you know, a gun license or something.

204
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:47,400
There's a coronavirus we've discussed before. Let's just warm up on the topic. You ever hear someone say, like, this food is high in cholesterol, wrong.

205
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:55,400
Colestial is something the body produces under certain conditions. There's no food. There's no food that has any cholesterol in it.

206
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:18,400
It's a virus as, it is not believable that you can catch a virus as such because all of the referenced documents since the beginning where, and all the way through all the postulates and research that has been done on it, it is something that forms in the body, just like all the other things that can be observed in blood and lymphatic system.

207
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:33,400
It is something that forms when the body is under extreme stress. Physical and emotional is exposed to toxins and as exposed to high levels of electromagnetic radiation and high levels of ionizing radiation.

208
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,400
The latter being nuclear, let's say, events, right?

209
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:46,400
So you can't catch a virus from someone any more than you can catch cholesterol from food or a red blood cell from someone.

210
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:58,400
And they are not the cause of disease and they seem to be present more often than not within people that have a certain classified disease.

211
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Let me just say language is coded as in a code. Sometimes it's in the code is so obscured that they jump a little too far, too fast.

212
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Like, okay, you're the blind JFK researcher, right? Is it or not true that in Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, they had published in newspapers at Oswald Shot Kennedy about eight to six to eight hours before it happened?

213
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Well, the actual event, no, but what they did have instantaneously was an entire background on Lee Harvey Oswald and stuff like that.

214
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:48,400
That was able to be printed immediately. Now, I'm being very careful about this in a time in which you could not transfer files instantaneously as we know them today.

215
00:17:48,400 --> 00:18:06,400
They had what would amount to the ability to do that based on what was published and the amount of time it took to go to press and actually produce a newspaper and everything else is also remarkable because it seems as though information was instantaneously spread throughout the globe.

216
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Or it was already in the hands of the publishers before the event. That is the only two conclusions one could come to based on the timing that it was produced.

217
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Now, I'm being very specific about this. Sure, sure. You don't want to give it any any. Maybe I was too liberal with that. In other words, there was there signs of four knowledge.

218
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Yes. Okay. Like, for example, everybody knows that 19 Arabs with box cutters don't vaporize towers. No matter what they fly into the tower. Right.

219
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:42,400
You could look at just about everything that's put it like how many times have you heard like a financial collapse? Well, it's a credit based economy.

220
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:51,400
It's all credit. Right. So how they know how how can you have a financial collapse in a credit based economy because it's credit. Right.

221
00:18:51,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Well, I know I'm into it. If the credit holders, the people who control the system credit, your access to credit. Yeah. They deny your access to it. Well, you have a collapse. Don't you? Right. I was explaining to someone and they actually did a little forensic work on it.

222
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:16,400
They went about three quarters of the way, but that was enough. Recently, they did a trillion, two trillion, whatever stimulus where they sent every one, $1,200, right? Check.

223
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:32,400
And I said that they don't have to two trillion or a hundred trillion or five dollars or anything that send anyone. When they send you the check, you're going to sign it. And when you sign it under various monetary acts, that $1,200 appears. Right.

224
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:52,400
But it appears at a rate of 10 to 1, so 12,000 appears. They give you the 12,000, right? So those 10,800, whatever leftover. The bank gets a third of that. And the rest of it, the other 7,000, 8,000 goes to the Fed or the people that allow the system to work that way.

225
00:19:52,400 --> 00:20:04,400
So they don't have anything to give you. They approved the funding of that, but they don't have anything. You go to the treasury or wherever, Federal Reserve, whatever you want to call and say, let me see the money you've got. They have nothing.

226
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:21,400
The banks, the gold, silver, heroin and all the other stuff they use is just commodities. So this is very easy to discover. Actually, you could look up, you know, any financial institution, not what's being taught about.

227
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:28,400
It's taught about them or reported about them, but their own information tells you that no one has any money. It's all credit.

228
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:49,400
So this goes on and on and on. But I had done on the Greek speak, I think, a week into the Corona thing. And I said, well, it was really funny how the Federal Reserve reacted on this before anyone else. Right. So it's a Federal Reserve virus, if you want to be more literal as an technological term virus.

229
00:20:49,400 --> 00:21:04,400
When you throw a virus into this computer or something technological. Now what's happening is I've discussed this not in length, but you know, as humans, we make tools and with the reason we make tools is because we want to develop or further certain techniques.

230
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:14,400
So when you hear about technology, you notice people don't talk about technique anymore, but the idea of technique and technology that the TECK part is almost the same word and meet it.

231
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:24,400
It's a Greek term. So when you develop a certain technique and you want to further it, you might need better tools and then you focus on making better tools.

232
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,400
But when you forget about the technique and you just focus on the tools, now you forget why you're making the tools, you see.

233
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:43,400
So this is where you're at right now. There's no more technique. It's just blatant technology. So technology in a sense that the tools have taken over.

234
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:58,400
So yeah, and the interesting thing is how this is still a secret. You know, I recently speak to people in public and they say, you should write a book and they say, well, anyone who writes a book is presuming that whoever is going to read that said book has reading comprehension.

235
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Right. Why would you write a book if you knew not presumed, but you actually knew that people lack reading comprehension. It would be a waste of time.

236
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:16,400
Right. So this is what's going on. It's the same thing. In other words, you don't have any money because it's a waste of time to have real.

237
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:23,400
You don't have any law because it's a waste of time. Look, I've spoken speaking of all they had that lady pass away recently.

238
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:37,400
And she's gone public. That's a preem court justice. Ginsburg. They asked her about her job. What would it's like to be a justice? Oh, all I do is work with bar members. That's my job. Now the bar association is nothing to do with law. Right.

239
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:54,400
They have the appearance of it. So you go, you go to a priest or a rabbi and you know, you show them the book that their religion is supposed to be based on. And say, we don't go by that. We go by our church or temple traditions.

240
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Right. Well, in those traditions are developed through a society, which is, you know, here it is. You have a legal society in air courts. Well, there's developed for a society to accommodate the people. Right.

241
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:21,400
For example, if you landed on an island or a planet full of savages and barbarians, is it easier to change them over into being civilized or is it easier to find out what they usually need and make it and sell it to them? Right.

242
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:29,400
The second part, find out what barbarians are into and you just manufacture and sell it to them. Well, you know, they're ready to go, right?

243
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:47,400
No, I understand. And that ties right to the thing you said about guns before because it's pretty interesting. I constantly am confronted here in the, in the alleged state of Georgia with people who tell me that, you know, there's those people who want to take your guns. And I keep trying to tell them, relax. Nobody wants to take your guns actually.

244
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:59,400
You are useful with a gun. Right. And I now am armed by the way. But it's only because I do not trust the thought processes of those around me.

245
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:13,400
So for defensive reasons, something I had never done regularly. Once I stopped being a criminal as a kid, I actually have, you know, possession of a firearm of a few of them.

246
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:27,400
This is not normal for me, but you know, how it is if you are, you know, in Rome, you do as the Romans do. And it's best that you do sometimes because that's the only way you're going to be able to defend yourself against the nonsense, which may come your way.

247
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:37,400
Well, you have to remember, okay, captivity. All right. When, when you look at animal statistics, for example, a straight cat, a straight dog average life two to four years, right?

248
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:46,400
But we know that if you have a pet dog or a pet cat and if you just pet them, love them and feed them and got a water ball, they're going to live between eight and 14 years. Right.

249
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:55,400
So you hear about people only live to 25 or 40 years ago. It wasn't because of distress, health and other things like that or disease.

250
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:11,400
It was because they, they try to live lawfully with honor and dignity. So if someone insulted someone, that was usually a death offense. And if you do old to settle that insult, the survivor then would be chased down by the surviving family.

251
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:19,400
And then they would die. See, so it was very, so in other words, I asked people said, how many times have you been insulted or have you insulted someone by the age of 21?

252
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:29,400
Many times. And while each time that happened, that was a potential life threatening experience. Do you know that in ancient times, or even up until you see the Westerns?

253
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:35,400
How many times have you seen in 19th century America movies, which are accurate in this sense?

254
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Guys insult each other in the bar. They step outside. They have a duel in the sheriff standing right there. It doesn't do anything right?

255
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:52,400
Well, you and I have both lived in the New York New Jersey area, right? And fact is only 30 years ago, you could handle things by, you know what?

256
00:25:52,400 --> 00:26:00,400
We're going to deal with this and you could potentially die in a fist fight. That was normal at one point.

257
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:11,400
Not if the, not if the state agencies were present. So now you're under captivity. I think I've gone on several things I've gone over how the, what's called America, the United States of America got into this mess.

258
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:29,400
What the civil war is. It's very simple. You know, the world is run by secret societies, which are societies that keep secrets and they're not necessarily the Freemasons and Knights Templars, but the Freemasons and Knights Templars were involved in this.

259
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:43,400
They went to Freemasons went to Lincoln and said, you have a country here that could potentially feed and provide resources for the entire world as we know it. Do you know what you're sitting on? And he's like, no, you know, I'm just an attorney from Kentucky.

260
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:53,400
And they says, well, we'll show you how to do it. And the Knights Templars backed up the Southern states with very advanced armaments and artillery.

261
00:26:53,400 --> 00:27:04,400
You've studied the, you know, inventions of certain weapons that are still considered modern were advanced by the South, right? They were superior militarily by and every means.

262
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:17,400
So they basically got the federal. What Lincoln was sitting on to instigate a war. Right. So all of a sudden one night of fort blows up and it was a fort that wasn't really populated. And they, that was the cause of the war.

263
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:36,400
The South was far more superior, but there were of course the plan was not for any South to the South or the North to win the plan was for to create enough chaos and decimation that the sent you can create a central government that'll spread out and maintain order through chaos.

264
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:51,400
You see, so once they subverted the South internally, then they approached Lincoln again and they had already figured out he's too much of a simple to understand what to do. They had to get rid of them.

265
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:58,400
So they got rid of them and then you had the incorporation of the government and that was done deliberately in 1871.

266
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Then you brought in the mystical side, which was even if you look up the department of justice, it's known as a historical anomaly even in mainstream circles that you could look it up right now on a Google search, the Department of Justice history.

267
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:19,400
They every all the historians call it a historical anomaly because no one knows who started or where it came from. Ha ha ha.

268
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:35,400
And then after that came all the intelligence agencies and all that that's when they put in the justice, the ancient goddess because the free the free mason's templates, whatever they always every occupying force or power base always puts in their religion as well, right?

269
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Well, and to hint at something that I know you're not going to speak about publicly, but I will hint at it and see what you have to say anyway. All of the blood spilled on this land during that time was more than just the result of a conflict.

270
00:28:52,400 --> 00:29:05,400
It was actually a ritualistic behavior that was part of the let's call the esoteric nature of what was being put into place.

271
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:13,400
I think people are able to recognize that you know we talk about it, you know the battle of Gettysburg and how many Americans died and you know more people died during this than any.

272
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:37,400
Okay, but for reason this was done well if you draw if you draw lines between all those points you form pentagrams right yes you do yes you so and I don't think a lot of people see that on their maps quite honestly, but that is a reality that I don't see any historian anybody who's looking at this not even the most alternative of individuals.

273
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:47,400
You know not even the the I hate to say this not even the Jordan Maxwell's will touch that if you have more than five people listening you got it.

274
00:29:47,400 --> 00:30:05,400
You're not you're not you're not going deep enough, but here's the thing also Chuck blood is the currency of the gods plural the plural gods even the most time it was you know he sacrificed his own son which no matter how you look at its human sacrifice well his son as a human in human form let's say.

275
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:17,400
But the and also told Abraham to bring a sacrifice as his of his son which was normal he didn't complain right the middle text is loaded with the concept of a human sacrifice actually.

276
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Right right and it's the because blood is the currency of the gods in the level of the the higher the order higher order beings blood is of higher value.

277
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:42,400
So one thing that people don't understand is you know again proper divine economics right so that would go under divine economics the other thing is the ability to procreate children themselves because they represent the fruit.

278
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:53,400
Of the seed so we've gone over that I think before that's why you have all of the most important in the occult most important part of the human body is not the brain.

279
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:59,400
But the sexual organs because without the sexual organs the human race is finished in one generation.

280
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:10,400
And you see that's why you have all the guy Nick and phallic symbols it's even in scripture there's one I think in one of the later new testimony says there are organs in the body there are more important than others.

281
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:22,400
Right I think it was a show or Paul that said that meaning without procreation in other words look at one what what's the big complaint about GMO crops that you can't get seeds right right.

282
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:30,400
What's wrong with that well you're going to eat this year but you're not going to eat ever again right so okay so.

283
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:41,400
Divine economics that's something you could do in another find a I don't know it's a cell in someone else and do divine economics maybe we never did one like that but.

284
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:57,400
No but it would be useful I'm just you know throwing out the hint at this that this is something that could be understood if one wanted to explore it the material is available I'm just saying this is not hidden knowledge really it's just not pronounced.

285
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:08,400
It's not out front you're not going to find it easily but there is a very much something to the idea that blood is currency and I think that is something that.

286
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:17,400
For the god for the god yes yeah and when you're when you're going down that road again because of the state religions.

287
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:32,400
I think I'm the last time we spoke we spoke about Islam is not what people think right the Islam that was practiced a hundred fifty years ago was based on Torah or Torah the current islamic world is based on the Muhammad in Anglo treaties.

288
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:46,400
That were done in the 19th century the sharia law and all that extremism and all that stuff and I think we haven't discussed is that Islam was created to block Christianity from spreading because it was the same time that the crusades were going on 7th century.

289
00:32:46,400 --> 00:33:15,400
It was very well known that Christianity was a state religion to subdue and dumb down people right so it was a good thing to block it at that point but then it of course got co-opted as you see today or in the 19th century you haven't missed any so all of the you know if you look at the bond religion of the east you know like you have all these westerners that are you know they look at Judeo christian ethics in Islam and say I want to go with the Hindu.

290
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:32,400
The Buddhist stuff and they get into that that's the same thing it's a co-opted it's a very recent the current Buddhist Buddhism Hindu practices are again co-opted they're not the religion is really the bond religion.

291
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:52,400
So you have no choice at this point but to become academic and stature not an academic but academic and stature meaning you're going to have to know what you're getting into based on what was written about it in earnest before you came to this planet.

292
00:33:52,400 --> 00:34:19,400
No there is a need to separate the concept of what people generally consider is academic from what you're talking about the you know it's not about the degree I don't see me member of an academy or having a degree that is absolutely ridiculous you know I catch every professor I spoke into hundreds of professors in the past two decades and everyone I catch them with their pants down some of them literally believe it or not the few ones.

293
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:48,400
Cute ones years ago but I always say you know the American education system is been is is in shambles and it's irreparable it can't fix it and any education really passed the sixth of the eighth grade is useless and they all say yeah pretty much and their college professors so I said oh and they catch themselves are they kept I said so what happens they graduate from 12th grade as you literates and they go to your school in your class and all of a sudden they're magically you spray some pixie.

294
00:34:48,400 --> 00:35:03,400
You spray some pixie dust on them and they're magically competent good luck with that yeah yeah it doesn't work I wanted to go touch back to why the the the pandemic or this whole Corona thing is was done now.

295
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Well that's that's the key because again I do see this this is an interesting concept because the idea of compression where we have a lot of events occurring simultaneously.

296
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Nothing well by the way you won't notice that there's this compression until around the the the 2020 one and a half remember remember we were doing this in 16th 2017 2016 2015.

297
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:46,400
Yes and I said that this around 2018 this spring it's going to start but it won't really be defined by you know three and a half years which would be 2021 and a half in the summer of 2021 but as it gets closer to that point it will define it.

298
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Well and that's the weird thing because I am noticing some of these things being signaled before they arrive.

299
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:04,400
Oh yeah it's not because you know I'm a soothsayer okay the signs are obvious it appears to me.

300
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,400
Well what's not obvious is how they're going to do it but what they want to do is obvious.

301
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:26,400
Yes exactly which is why I say you know as we approach only days away from this event that's going to occur here in the United States where you have this selection process which is is not an election although.

302
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:33,400
It doesn't matter I wish they would get away from all that and you could do it digitally like 1984 it's purely ceremonial.

303
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:44,400
Yeah whether you have what they call a republic a democracy which is not a either or a dictatorship or whatever they have in Iran all of that is ceremonial.

304
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:59,400
None of that in other words if you've ever seen the person or heard them they have they they're not in power they have the power as a as a corporate official in other words the president would be like the manager of a restaurant chain.

305
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Right and your local officials in the state the governors would be like the waiter of the waitress you know they can they have certainly way yeah they they could kick you out of but they're not they're not it's not their restaurant.

306
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:22,400
They could be hired and fired at any time they're not in power if you suit Taco Bell or Kentucky fried chicken you're going to get PepsiCo attorneys.

307
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,400
Right.

308
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:53,400
If you know what I mean no of course because it is not necessarily the front name it is not the front people that you get to deal with that are actually in charge of the thing itself you know at the end of the day will yeah but here's the thing around the 2025 2027 period you will be very clear what I just said the PepsiCo attorneys will let you know that it's all owned by Pepsi what I mean you're going to have a one world leadership.

309
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,400
By default in other words.

310
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Okay what's going without talking about the the pandemic and all that if you don't wear a mask that give you a fine and if you look at the ticket it says public health code whatever it's not because you didn't wear a mask it's just some various sundry code because the law enforcement doesn't know any law they they have a little crib sheet a little book and they if you look through it which what are we going to put on the site you with which violation that's all right.

311
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:51,400
They don't know what's going on and they don't want to know because they're just they get a paid what's called a paycheck right which is not payment but just a paycheck so this goes all the way from the the guy on the street you know I call them pawns or grunts or whatever all the way up to the people that are exposed which are making fools of themselves so if you remember meaning like if you look at for example the major fools are like the governor of California New York they're all getting big criticism right.

312
00:38:51,400 --> 00:39:20,400
From their own a constituents let's say so what I'm trying to say is if we hearken back a few years and I kept saying there's going to be a Middle East union in an order for this to to relegate a world a central world power you're going to have to raise the Middle East you know into a higher civilized factor than it is now and you're going to lower the western world into a lower civilized factor so they kind of even out right.

313
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Well this is a sham I this is one of the questions because you're talking about this right now I want to enter it I'm sorry to interrupt but here's the thing you know that recent sham of a piece deal that was had there between Israel and the UAE which is another fabrication of various other countries if you don't believe me by the way one of the countries was was the first to put the image of John F Kennedy on a silver dollar that was a charge are wasn't a big deal.

314
00:39:49,400 --> 00:40:10,400
But it was a big silver coin I think it's five rupees but anyway charge are is now part of the UAE but that business deal right there somebody did ask if the Greek thought that that was the beginning of this formation that will be okay.

315
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:21,400
Okay it's going to be very fast when it happens literally it's kind of like you know an independence day where they wake up one morning all the ships are there right but they were detected weeks before.

316
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,400
Right.

317
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:28,400
Okay kind of thing I'm not that's just I'm using film analogies because they you know they tend to be up front in people's conscious.

318
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,400
Right.

319
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:39,400
This is another thing I'm going to say you have a small group of people or organizations that run everything there are no national enemies in other words Iran is not an enemy of the US and Iran is not an enemy.

320
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:49,400
Israel there is North Korea is not an enemy of anyone I mean look the Americans what they couldn't get the Americans off of Cuba Guantanamo Bay come on.

321
00:40:49,400 --> 00:41:04,400
They're all good friends like and I was I was very cautious and reserved once I was out in the west coast in a meeting and there was a member that were of the Persian or the Iranian mob.

322
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:14,400
I wouldn't say he's very high ranking but he was high ranking and a member of the Assad pretty high ranking and they work with the Yakuza in Japan.

323
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:33,400
And I said Israel and Iran are not enemies are they started laughing their ass off right you know of course because it's the under the world you know you can get rid of the government the underworlds it's the underworld that runs it so nonetheless there are no enemies whenever they tell you you have an enemy like China or whatever it's there were no enemies since the 19th century.

324
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:33,440
So what was World War II Greek well you go figure that one out we just talked about what battlefields and blood mean right so what you what I would suggest is when this Middle East Union comes about you will have an am

325
00:41:33,440 --> 00:42:02,400
amocity genuine animosity is developing and it's going to be very different because what one of the things that I haven't done is I'm not going to be a

326
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:09,400
lot of things that I haven't touted as I should have maybe I'll start doing it now with you here.

327
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:31,400
What is going to empower at least the the middle what is going to empower this loose Confederacy of nations what I call the Middle East Union that's coming around 2025 and beyond with with let's say everyone else is conscious focused on what's going on in the Middle East and almost taking orders directly and indirectly from the leadership there is that the people are going to be so fed up.

328
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:46,400
With their lives in other words how things have been going meaning also from what they understand from history and religion that they're going to be asking in unison for divine help right.

329
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:57,400
And the people the group that is going to be let's say usurping the position in the Middle East will offer it and the people will go for it.

330
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:18,400
You see I don't know how more clear to make it because you know even the most staunch atheist on their deathbed how many times have you heard they cry out to a God right on their deathbed usually they'll still profess atheism their whole life but they ask God for help you know like there are no atheists in it what do they call the military when you're in the hole in the ground.

331
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:47,400
Oh yeah there's no atheists in a flock of the flocks. Oh yeah right the same thing there's no atheists on their deathbed you see this is how the population is going to be but I brought up the shameful administrators you know how like you should read about comode to blossom all these other people knew some or whatever these governors are being touted as you know being bizarre and whatever that is going to shame and also with Trump and all these other guy call them Trump and Putin.

332
00:43:47,400 --> 00:44:00,400
You know what Putin is. Yeah I got it. Yeah okay so any of it. Trump and Putin all these other people they're not leaders there are managers at a Taco Bell but the manager at the Taco Bell could have you arrested can he not.

333
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:16,400
Oh yeah sure yeah okay and and then sent into put into a cage you know which is basically a prison you know no one has been in prison legally or lawfully in the past 80 years right they're all there for other reasons and there's not an attorney general in the world that will deny what they're doing.

334
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:23,400
They're all in the world that will deny what I just said in private but publicly say other things. I don't know because I spoke into plenty on them about it.

335
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:37,400
You even had I don't know if you remember justice book in the 80s one of the congressmen were asking if you're made justice of the Supreme Court what are you going to do about the growing prison population what did he say?

336
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:44,400
I'm not going to do anything because everyone in prisons volunteered to be there right and they cut it right there right well you mean I volunteered.

337
00:44:44,400 --> 00:45:06,400
It's true. Yeah it's more than you think it's pretty bad it's a religious system it's theocracy so here's the point if you have all these leaders that are shamed how easy is it you see to break so you bring okay when you have discerning levels okay meaning like a step something looks like something is higher or lower than the other thing.

338
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:33,400
Well you have to bring the higher one down and you have to raise the lower one up right and then if you you could you could have the lower one be the high one if you take the high one and lower it a lot right if you take to if you just if you have something that's tall and something that short if you just address the tall one and reduce it to one tenth its height then the one that was previously short next to it will tower over it without even making any adjustments to it you see right.

339
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:49,400
So what I'm saying is you're going to have the western society brought down and the people that are pretty much look like they're packing dust in the Middle East are going to be brought up which is very easy to do with construction and trade practices these days in other words.

340
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:56,400
The way cities are built right now you can have a metropolis built in less than a year and a half anywhere in the world right.

341
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:11,400
So so be on the watch but this is not until the twenty twenty five but what I'm saying is that this raising the Middle East and lowering the west will be very evident by what you call twenty twenty one by the summertime.

342
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:39,400
What like I you notice I see back in twenty fifteen I'm saying the same stuff it's back it's on track you see no it is I would say that one thing that we did not cover though at that time is is something now here's what I take notice of it's not a listener question I've got a couple more of those by the way one of them is by your reckoning what year we actually had because they've adjusted their idea of time.

343
00:46:39,400 --> 00:47:08,400
Well lawfully well lawfully what year we had yeah Adam Adam was the one that that everyone keeps time by by the way and you know year 6000 was nineteen ninety eight so it would be you know since the year counting is now it's the year six thousand twenty three roughly but I would say six thousand twenty two because the great if you go to the Gregorian calendar remember they shot it back a year like George Washington has two birds.

344
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,400
Right seventeen twenty two and seventeen twenty one right.

345
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:26,400
Well you look that up and also during the break look that up no yet and if you attempt to have a conversation about birthdays with someone from the Middle East enjoy that because they don't have the same concept of when to count.

346
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:36,400
Because you count from the one seriously because the day you're born the day you're born you're in your first year so on your birthday you're the next year right.

347
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:44,400
Right so honestly there's a one year differential between the way people in the Middle East count birthday and the way that we would count a birthday.

348
00:47:44,400 --> 00:48:01,400
Well here's an example I'm in I'm fifty five but I'm in my six decade because when I became fifty one and I'm in my six decade right right okay so I tell you so I hold you I'm in my six decade they think it's sixty because they're not listening I'm in my first century so were you.

349
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:15,400
Oh absolutely I'm forty eight so really you're within that first century in other words you're still chomping away at anything a century offers so when you're born you're in your first year because even though you're alive for a day or two you're chomping away at that first year right.

350
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:22,400
So is that year is complete now you're chomping away at the second year so you're actually in your second year.

351
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:36,400
No I understand that's why I'm in my fifth decade but I'm forty eight.

352
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:49,400
So what they you know like for example even today when I watch something on television you'll have a host and a guest you know how they sit back at a night show and they swing they cross their leg and they show the bottom of their shoe their soul.

353
00:48:49,400 --> 00:49:03,400
Yeah that would be that would be censored in the Middle East cannot show or in other words showing the bottom of your foot or the soul of your shoe on the Middle East television is a kin to showing the Middle finger in Western.

354
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,400
So they blow out here mostly.

355
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:32,400
And they would blow that out or they would edit it or change the aspect ratio so would raise above that you see so when you look at how they keep time or they're then now we're getting into the customs but mathematically or arithmetically it is correct to say that you're in your fifth decade I mean my sixth decade when you're born you're in your first year arithmetically mathematically it's different you know the difference arithmetic and mathematics arithmetic is counting like stuff you use in your life.

356
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:44,400
And you're not counting like stuff you use in commerce but mathematics is a fiction like legal or whatever right right right I understand and like they say black holes exist because we have the equations.

357
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:56,400
Well mathematics or subject to customary changes arithmetic is arithmetic right and they could tell you this equation proves that even though it hasn't been solved or can't be solved if welcome to Einstein.

358
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:06,400
But anyway yes the big the big anyway with a capital N yes well listen I got to do that because I mean you move so quickly.

359
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:25,400
Then I've got to catch up here in there and and stop for a second to to figure out where to pivot to because there's a lot of information actually contained in this conversation already even though it's not used to a dummy dummy load free conversation that's all chucked well you're spoiled now that's true.

360
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:47,400
I when when you and I would get together more regularly this was something that my mind caught up with a lot easier but I assure the listener that if you were to rewind this and go back a bit you'll you'll find probably information that you did not catch the first time I take a couple of listens actually.

361
00:50:47,400 --> 00:51:09,400
But anyway you and I are doing this live so I don't have a list of superior information is to put this unpackaging years ago superior oats or superior you know well not do you remember because I'm speaking back to the 1930s is stopped by the time world war two came around because of rations right.

362
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:38,400
Rations you know if you to the quality world war two just all it did was adjust people's palette to really inferior quality products right you were just happy to get sugar of any quality because right because they told you how to be rationed most people don't know that just like now for example there's a different type but if you looked at a lot of products they're called superior this superior that back in the day I mean 100 years ago and then you have superior information in there just not used to superior information.

363
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:44,400
I'm not saying I'm superior I'm saying the information I provide oh heck yeah it's way superior.

364
00:51:44,400 --> 00:52:07,400
Well and it's fascinating because the decline of all things is something that we covered also in those earlier sonic events and you know the decline in quality has well you know stood stood the same I mean really things are still declining in quality which I find interesting although the speed of information is not.

365
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:36,400
Speed of information is increased the quality of it has decreased there seems to be more of it it is abundance but a lot of it is garbage and gee that seems to be just like what the food is what the products are that people are manufacturing you know everything is commensurate with everything else as far as the quality of the time mostly now that's not to say you can't find things of greater quality which was funny because one of the things I want to close it up.

366
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:51,400
One of the things I want to close out the hour with was a question that was asked about an event that you and I did that's only in my member section on ocelli.com I think and I don't know if you ever took it anywhere else but we talked about water.

367
00:52:51,400 --> 00:53:12,400
And you gave some really interesting information which I have tested repeatedly which is correct about water and how to handle it so that the quality of it is at its best and stuff like that so now a listener took that and and and listen and follow the instructions that were given.

368
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:24,400
And you know increase the quality of their water by storing it properly and stuff like that and they have another question related to how people freeze food.

369
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:39,400
And what you thought about it because they wanted to know is there a better way to freeze food considering the fact that you know if you freeze chicken twice it's no good you know if you freeze it thought and freeze it again.

370
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:43,400
So well let me let me I see where you're going on the quality of freezing.

371
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:54,400
Unless you have a two stage freezer which means a two stage compressor double door where it goes down to minus 70 or better which is dangerous by the way.

372
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:12,400
You're going to get what's called freezer burn because I think below 30 degrees or 20 degrees Fahrenheit or 18 or 21 degrees Celsius water starts to evaporate faster than it does at room temperature or just as fast so you have all that freezer burn.

373
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:26,400
What I suggest is what I learned if you're going to freeze anything you know if you buy certain quality things in freezer sections are called ice glazed have you ever seen that before like ice glazed chicken parts or whatever I don't think I know what it is but yeah go ahead.

374
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:39,400
Well let's say when you buy organic chicken breast and it's ice glazed it'll always taste better and last longer than the ones that are not what they do as they freeze them on a conveyor belt they missed water on it so they has like an eighth of an inch layer of ice.

375
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:46,400
So when that starts to it increases the shelf life in a freezer that is in the standard minus 20 minus 30.

376
00:54:46,400 --> 00:55:05,400
I also learned this really young we were trout fishing and one of the guys just took a bag and put water in with the fish and said what do you do that is when you throw it out basically you know it's like the day you froze it basically freezing the fish in a block of ice right so it doesn't dry out.

377
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:23,400
So what I suggest is what I do here for example sometimes I'll get some organic beef and you know 150 bucks for a chunk of beef you know is is pretty pricey and you're not going to eat it all you know you could you could try be eating beef for quite a few days you want to you want to quarter its license freeze it.

378
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:50,400
What I do is I put it on a cookie sheet and in the freezer and once it gets hard after about a few hours I missed it with some water spray it with a mister water mister and then I put it back in wait 15 minutes spray it again I got a nice ice glaze on it then I wrap it in a plastic wrapper wax paper and put it back in the freezer because I don't have a two stage a two stage freezer.

379
00:55:50,400 --> 00:56:14,400
It's called a medical freezer they usually have double doors on them and there are some restaurants that do have them by the way they're very expensive to run and they're very expensive to buy I haven't I have never seen it in anyone's house I've heard of people wanting to get one after I recommended it but I have not witnessed one yet just like I have an witness you know how they say it's a man's world how many times if you witness to your own someone's house.

380
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:33,400
Fair enough why do we have to why do we have to aim you know why do we have to write why do we have to put the seat down if I'm the man of the house I want to urinal well I would think it's utility because you know you can use that one for both and therefore you know one one space one appliance basically.

381
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:57,400
Yeah actually I had someone of quote unquote high net worth a built the most expensive house in Tucson his wife was very dominating and I and I fixed that real quick by told him put a urinal in it was a 8000 square foot house at plenty of bathrooms and one day she pulls me to size I know you you convinced him to put this year and one of my supposed to do well with it when he's not using it I said put a flower vase in it.

382
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:26,400
Why not because he wasn't used he got so used to because they have so many bathrooms but here's the point is we're not as practical in these utilitarian in other words the majority of the people especially Americans freeze a lot of their food right if you go to if you go to a bonafide I have like a Chinese refrigerator you ever go to a Chinese person's house or career when you open their fridge there's nothing there's not it's empty except for some drinks and some condiments everything is fresh right you buy you go to the house.

383
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:34,400
You buy you go shot like you've ever been to a Chinatown how crowded it is it's because people don't store food they buy it every day right right.

384
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:54,400
Right so you if you want to be utilitarian ice glaze your food I don't know if there's any YouTube universities on that maybe or if it's small enough just go ahead pour away if you have like frozen french fries it might benefit better you know from the spring or just you know don't leave them in the freezer too long but if you have a precious piece of fish.

385
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,400
Like on occasion someone would send us salmon from Alaska.

386
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:06,400
Fisherman. Right and it comes in a styrofoam box wrapped in Alaska newspaper with dry ice you get the picture.

387
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:11,400
Yep. Yeah and if it's a big thing you know I don't want to eat salmon for a week so I ice glaze it.

388
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:20,400
I have a colony of cats I take care of and I go to Walmart and buy a 10 pound bag of fresh chicken parts for six bucks which is a lot cheaper than the canned cat food.

389
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:36,400
Right and I just laid on a cookie sheet and I ice glaze and throw it in the bag it doesn't stick together and all that and feed them fresh chicken well it's kind of funny because I actually got my hands on a second freezer which I keep it a much you know I keep it at maximum deep

390
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:52,400
freeze and I get it cold enough yeah well the freezer burn you got to get into the minus 60 minus when below minus 50 minus 70 is good but you know what happens if you touch it minus 70 will freeze an eighth of an inch of your skin solid

391
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,400
immediately and it will break off and you will be left with a wound right. Well see that.

392
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:04,400
Yeah actually that's that's one of the problems with this is that even though it is not quite at the level you're talking about you know the temperature.

393
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:21,400
I do actually have trouble I got a handle things with gloves or oven mitts you use gloves yeah right when I take it out of there because and usually yeah there's a pair of gloves next to it because it is that cold but also I use that technique you're talking about where if something is contained in ice.

394
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:27,400
It's better off it just it doesn't go bad in the freezer basically.

395
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:37,400
I don't have a lot of food that I store over a long period of time but it's just because I can't go I mean where is anything fresh I'm in making Georgia for God's sake.

396
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:51,400
Fresh food but also if you if you're by the way if you're a hunter I do recommend freezing to get rid of certain parasites like tricanella and Mary other worm that worm bodies that might be in the meat.

397
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:59,400
For example the standard high quality sushi is always frozen because there's lots of parasites in fish now right.

398
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:13,400
So you want to freeze it because the the worms will will will you know the certain parasites will perish or die in the freezer what's funny I ended up with the freezer because somebody having to bring to me to me to ask me you know what to do because.

399
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:25,400
There you go free that would freeze it that's what I did it and I put it into that deep reason I said look what it's going to do is now make sure you pulled all of the you know if you use buckshot or whatever make sure you pulled it all out of there.

400
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:35,400
But other than that you know if you've got those contaminants out of there this process here will actually destroy a whole lot of other things that you could be worried about.

401
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:47,400
And you know so I had that much of the formula in my mind but but I didn't want to answer that question because again you usually have some ideas here that I don't and again you did.

402
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:57,400
Now the ice glazing concept I never noticed that any food was ice glazed in in the markets you know but but doing it at home yeah I do that at home.

403
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:07,400
So same kind of certain high quality products are that are come frozen and state their ice glazed so you don't get freezer burn.

404
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:17,400
Well and see that's the thing is I never noticed it but you know in fact is that I treat the food that way especially I mean I don't treat every piece of chicken that way some of them it's like listen I'm just going to use this soon.

405
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:27,400
But if it's something that is you know organic and therefore was expensive and you know maybe came fresh from a farm that's exactly how I handle it.

406
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:37,400
Anyway we're going to take a quick break Greek and get into some other things now this next hour might be you know I don't know how you want to go we'll see.

407
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:43,400
But anyway I'll be right back like I've always been going so okay we'll see you on the other side.

408
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:49,400
Exactly. Anyway stick around I'll be right back with the Greek on Ocele.com.

415
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:23,400
I thought you remember the time when Benjamin Fullford said that the Asian secret society was going to dispatch ninjas to take out the Illuminati to change the entire world for the better.

416
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,400
That ain't never going to happen.

417
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,400
That never did.

418
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,400
It never did.

419
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,400
Yeah because there's a lot of false promises.

420
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,400
Fools.

421
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,400
I do assume.

422
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:39,400
We better not say be polite but there are no false promises at the Ocele.com radio network.

423
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,400
That's exactly it.

424
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:52,400
It's to the point white to the point and this would have straight to the point of telly.com.

425
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,400
Listen now.

Uncle do you remember that time when Benjamin Fullford said that an Asian secret society was going to dispatch ninjas to take down the Illuminati?

430
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,400
Oh that's interesting.

431
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,400
Yeah in the cartoon.

432
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,400
Yeah did that ever work out too good?

433
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,400
No.

434
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,400
It didn't it didn't.

435
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:06,400
But here on Ocele.com radio network things work out a bit better don't they?

436
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,400
Much better.

437
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:17,400
I mean it is clear and understanding about the programs, the programs, a much clearer, getting live, people into it.

438
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,400
They really have a good conversation going.

439
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,400
Much better.

440
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,400
Much better seen.

441
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:28,400
I say forget Benjamin Fullford and his ninjas and listen to the Ocele.com radio network.

442
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,400
I agree.

443
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:33,400
It's straight to the point, straight talk and I like that idea.

444
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,400
Ocele.com.

445
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:40,400
Uncle do you remember that time when the year 2012 was going to create the apocalypse end of the world?

446
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:41,400
Right.

447
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,400
And I thought it would come to the end.

448
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,400
Did it ever end up that way?

449
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,400
No.

450
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,400
Yeah.

451
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:54,400
Like we say, the only way to end is when he is ready for a team.

452
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,400
That's how it is.

453
01:05:55,400 --> 01:06:02,400
If you want the real truth about 2012 you better listen to the Ocele.com radio.

454
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,400
Radio.com.

455
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,400
Yeah forget John Q.

456
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,400
John Q.

457
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,400
John Q.

458
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:11,400
Doesn't know what he's talking actually about.

459
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:15,400
But we here at the Ocele radio network sure do.

460
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:31,560
do you understand and understand where it's actually coming from? potele.cai.com

461
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,840
I'm getting people.

462
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,540
I know most integrated group is the only.

463
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:35,280
All of us.

464
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,480
I see Google mall.

465
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:42,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

466
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:48,140
Oh.

467
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:52,140
Oh, the second arrow of the O'Cilly effect begins now.

468
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:55,740
And of course, this is a unique show because I have

469
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:56,600
the Greek with me.

470
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,900
And it is a rare occurrence now.

471
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,140
It used to be much more regular sonic occurrence

472
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:03,740
when we did O'Cilly and the Greek.

473
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:06,220
And then rebooted the show briefly,

474
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:09,780
kind of did a part two and ended it.

475
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:13,060
And I'll tell you, it's still relevant, still interesting.

476
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:15,140
We're referencing a lot of it tonight

477
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:18,300
because the majority of any questions you might have

478
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:21,300
were probably already answered five years ago.

479
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,140
By anybody's reckoning.

480
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:25,460
So there you go.

481
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:28,860
But it is interesting to look at the world around us.

482
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:31,020
And I want to address something and just kick it

483
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:33,140
over to you and then you can go in any direction you want.

484
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:37,380
But this again is all for me this time, not the listener

485
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:40,700
or listeners who have a contact to me

486
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:42,900
and ask me various questions.

487
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:49,340
But the thing is, I do note that there is a change

488
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,980
in these past few years.

489
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:52,700
And I didn't quite articulate it properly

490
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:55,940
in the first hour when I was talking about certain things

491
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:58,780
and is it a linguistic issue, is it a communication issue?

492
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:03,260
And of course, cosmic censorship is still in play.

493
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:06,100
But there's something else beginning to happen,

494
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:10,380
which is different and is slowly but surely having

495
01:08:10,380 --> 01:08:15,260
the knob turned up if it were volume on an amplifier, Greek.

496
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:21,420
And that is this, I call it the agitated apathy,

497
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,820
where yes, indeed, we're hearing again.

498
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:27,500
And this is a, you know, everything is a regurgitation

499
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,020
and something from before.

500
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:32,700
Civil War 2.0 is coming, get ready.

501
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:37,500
Tension between people has increased noticeably

502
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,900
in the past few years.

503
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:43,900
It is getting more confused, OK, more incoherent.

504
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:46,660
And yet people are aggravated now.

505
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:49,300
The laziness of most people, I think,

506
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:53,140
is what is preventing them from doing a lot more damage

507
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:56,300
to their neighbors than they already do.

508
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,820
I think that is one of the key factors that is preventing

509
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:03,220
some bloodshed, but I think the right push, you know.

510
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:05,020
You like to mention movies?

511
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:07,820
Well, remember the Joker character, right?

512
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:12,100
And the Christopher Nolan Batman, who said, you know,

513
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:18,180
everybody is on the edge and all they need is one good push.

514
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:21,180
I think people are beginning to emotionally

515
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:24,860
and psychologically, seemingly walk closer and closer

516
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:28,580
to that edge where that push is not going to require much effort

517
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:30,580
for them to jump over the cliff.

518
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:33,300
And that cliff, it not even a jump, they're just going to fall off

519
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:34,620
of it really.

520
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:39,420
And I think it is because they are insisting

521
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:42,180
on being aggravated, agitated, and, you know,

522
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:45,420
some people say it's mind control, but it seems

523
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:51,700
to be a general consensus of hostility that is growing.

524
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,100
Now, we're not in an extreme level,

525
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:56,620
because I don't believe, you know, the things that they tried

526
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:59,900
to promote via the different entertainment outlets

527
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,300
that they call news.

528
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:04,900
OK, have the country was not on fire, even when they were trying

529
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:07,140
to show us how the country was on fire.

530
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:08,540
That wasn't true.

531
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:13,900
But the idea, the tension, the strife, if you will,

532
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:18,100
that is being promoted, I think is succeeding, sure.

533
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:19,940
But there's something else at play here.

534
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:23,500
I think hostility is being, again, slowly turned up,

535
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,660
much like that boiling frog.

536
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:27,540
I don't think anybody's going to jump out of it,

537
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:30,220
but eventually things are going to get cooking.

538
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:32,420
What are you talking about?

539
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:34,220
Well, yeah, and no, you haven't seen--

540
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:36,420
if you think you've seen it, you haven't seen anything yet.

541
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:40,260
This is like the small little hump in the rollercoaster ride.

542
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:44,260
You know, when they send you out of the cabin

543
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:46,860
or wherever you load up into the cart,

544
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:49,660
what most people have in common is they take up space

545
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:50,940
and they give off heat, right?

546
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,940
So they're space heaters.

547
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:55,700
I'm not against the space heater liquidation.

548
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:58,460
If you told me the Earth's population was reduced down

549
01:10:58,460 --> 01:11:00,380
to 100 people, it'd be fine.

550
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:04,500
But the problem, or if you left it as it is, it's still fine.

551
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,500
Why?

552
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,900
It's the quality of the people.

553
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:10,500
So let's say you brought down the world's

554
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:11,900
population to 100 people.

555
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:17,820
If you have one attorney, a priest, a rabbi, and a doctor,

556
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:19,180
these are standard trained, you're

557
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:21,980
going to be exactly where you are right now in 40 years.

558
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:23,220
Exactly.

559
01:11:23,220 --> 01:11:26,500
You haven't done anything, right?

560
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:29,940
You can take the seven or eight billion people and upgrade them,

561
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:33,620
but the thing is, I believe that they're irreparable at this point.

562
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:35,460
It's not a direct condemnation.

563
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:38,340
It's a tangential condemnation.

564
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:40,740
You know how a car, when it's totaled,

565
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:42,100
they give it a salvage title.

566
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:43,540
You could still rebuild it.

567
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:44,940
I'm not talking like that.

568
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:48,260
I'm speaking on, they're not fixable.

569
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:51,260
Because it's divinely-- they've been divinely altered.

570
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:54,860
That's the divine economy talk.

571
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:58,220
But yeah, they're just taking up space.

572
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:01,780
You've got to realize that gods are numerologists and numerics,

573
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:04,100
and mathematicians, and arithmetic--

574
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:06,780
arithmeticians and mathematicians.

575
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:10,220
They don't do-- they rely heavily on counting--

576
01:12:10,220 --> 01:12:13,180
accounting, accounting, and numbers.

577
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:17,500
So why are there so many stupid people in the world?

578
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,340
And ignorant and apathetic?

579
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:22,100
It's because of the numbers.

580
01:12:22,100 --> 01:12:26,100
The quality aspect that I'm speaking of is different.

581
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:28,060
For example, you're not going to meet people

582
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:33,780
that have honor, dignity, lawfulness, and morality anymore.

583
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:36,420
And if you don't have that to me, you're already dead.

584
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:38,460
Scripture talks about that.

585
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:42,140
Why don't you let the dead bury the dead?

586
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:49,620
So yeah, I'm in total horror and shock when I leave where I live,

587
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,100
the dwelling, and go out in public.

588
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,100
It doesn't matter where I go.

589
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:54,860
I'm in horror and shock by looking at people.

590
01:12:54,860 --> 01:12:57,540
How they behave to each other, and not how they behave to me.

591
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:00,500
I try to be a silent bystander.

592
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,660
It's just an absolute horror.

593
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:06,180
And it doesn't get any better going from one country to another.

594
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:11,460
So what I'm trying to say is space-heater liquidation

595
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:15,460
will not begin until the late 2020s in earnest.

596
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:18,780
But you're going to have some of it now.

597
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:21,780
And what does that have to do with your question?

598
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:24,700
Not much, but this is what I can't answer it directly

599
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:28,020
because when I study and think, I do it in 10-year,

600
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:30,940
100-year, and 1,000-year swaths.

601
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:34,500
So when you say you've noticed recently, that's irrelevant.

602
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,980
The reason why I say that it's irrelevant is because this

603
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:39,700
is how people were two or 3,000 years ago.

604
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:40,780
Not much has changed.

605
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:40,980
Right.

606
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:41,740
Well, fair enough.

607
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:44,300
And me taking notice of it doesn't necessarily

608
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,140
mean that that's when it started.

609
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:50,700
I'm sure that we are talking about a 10-year time period here, though.

610
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:54,100
More than-- well, let's not forget.

611
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,340
Let's just say the 10-year time period is not really

612
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:00,460
relevant when you're doing the general perspective,

613
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:04,260
because remember, at one point, when the people--

614
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:06,340
they will not say they're looking for divine help,

615
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:09,940
but they will sure fall for it when it's offered,

616
01:14:09,940 --> 01:14:12,460
they will be promised a golden age.

617
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:17,300
That if they do these things, we'll put humanity on a new foot,

618
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:19,340
and it will last for 1,000 years, let's say.

619
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:22,540
They may not say that exactly, but a new golden age.

620
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:25,500
And they're all going to fall for it, you see.

621
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,420
So when you say 10 years, it's not really relevant when

622
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:30,740
these things begin, because now everything will be wiped

623
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:33,380
and they'll look ahead.

624
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:36,340
In other words, I haven't said this publicly before.

625
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:37,980
I might as well.

626
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:42,180
You know, a year zero is going to be declared in the near future.

627
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:43,420
Let me say that again.

628
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:44,540
Well, I don't have to say it again.

629
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:45,500
You heard me, right?

630
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,060
Oh, I heard you.

631
01:14:47,060 --> 01:14:47,780
I heard you--

632
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:49,460
Think about what that means.

633
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:53,380
Well, what does that mean?

634
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:55,460
Well, you have to think about it before you answer it, right?

635
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:58,340
Remember, put your mind in motion before you put your mouth

636
01:14:58,340 --> 01:14:58,860
in motion.

637
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:00,380
Let me just say-- I've never said this before.

638
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:02,620
There's lots of stuff I haven't said.

639
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:03,540
And I can't hold on.

640
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:05,340
Oh, this will be ready in a few years.

641
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:08,180
But, yeah, declaration of year zero coming up.

642
01:15:08,180 --> 01:15:09,420
Not next year.

643
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:14,460
I can't give you a date, but in the 2025, 2026, 2027 period,

644
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:18,740
to declare a year zero is a big, big deal, isn't it?

645
01:15:18,740 --> 01:15:21,260
Well, I'm wondering if that is only

646
01:15:21,260 --> 01:15:24,980
going to be a small part of a customary release.

647
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:26,700
Sure, changing the times, yeah.

648
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:27,180
Yeah.

649
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:30,940
And the thing is, I think probably even though it's

650
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:34,620
kind of a shocking statement you're making to some people,

651
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:36,540
I think that that's going to be the least shocking thing

652
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:38,140
about that time period.

653
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:40,380
It'll be-- it'll be least shocking because it'll

654
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:43,300
accommodate the rest of the ideology that they've already

655
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:43,900
absorbed.

656
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:45,580
Right.

657
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:47,620
See, and that's the weird thing.

658
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:49,540
I enter the last question, by the way,

659
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:51,660
because I just clicked over to my email,

660
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:54,460
and I see that a listener who asked a question

661
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:55,620
is listening right now.

662
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:59,300
So it's kind of an absurd question in my mind,

663
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:02,820
but I'm going to ask it anyway and let you deal with it.

664
01:16:02,820 --> 01:16:05,620
OK.

665
01:16:05,620 --> 01:16:08,620
They referenced the fact that I have often said,

666
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:11,860
I don't see why it is.

667
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:15,780
People are trying to make out Barack Obama to be an anti-Christ,

668
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:18,660
to be an anti-Christ, not be anti-Christ.

669
01:16:18,660 --> 01:16:21,460
But some people, the anti-Christ, OK?

670
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:23,260
And this concept of the anti-Christ

671
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:26,380
is pretty fascinating to me because I read it differently

672
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:30,100
than a lot of other people do, but we'll put that aside.

673
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:34,620
Well, let's just use this maxim, meaning something

674
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:36,980
you should know, even though it's not easily written,

675
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:38,940
or just you should know.

676
01:16:38,940 --> 01:16:43,540
Whenever you borrow a term or a concept from a particular source,

677
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:47,380
you must always look for the definition of that term or concept

678
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:48,300
within that source.

679
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:49,820
It's usually given.

680
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:50,100
Yeah.

681
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:51,980
So when you bring up anti-Christ, that's

682
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:54,660
in the biblical source material.

683
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:57,540
So the biblical source material, plenty well

684
01:16:57,540 --> 01:17:02,380
defines who, and what, and where, and the identity of the anti-Christ.

685
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:06,300
So putting that identity on Obama or what

686
01:17:06,300 --> 01:17:09,180
have you does not fit the source.

687
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:11,740
And now you don't have-- in other words,

688
01:17:11,740 --> 01:17:13,980
that's where the people are operating without license

689
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:16,060
and without right.

690
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:19,700
In other words, if you don't exhaust the source

691
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:21,860
that you obtain the term or concept from,

692
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:25,860
you are now unlawful in your application of the term.

693
01:17:25,860 --> 01:17:28,140
No, I understand.

694
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:31,460
But there's something further in this question, which

695
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:34,380
is related to our current times as opposed to--

696
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:39,020
because Obama is not in office at the moment.

697
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:42,660
So the thing is, when I look at this idea

698
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:46,460
that there is this ID concept to what's

699
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:49,180
going on regarding medical and all that,

700
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:55,580
they wanted me to ask you about what is the reality of the possibility

701
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:59,100
that we're looking at the rise of that figure now

702
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:01,820
because it makes sense with the idea that you're not

703
01:18:01,820 --> 01:18:05,420
going to have to comport with certain things in order to trade.

704
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:09,620
You're definitely looking at somebody who speaks out of two sides

705
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:14,780
of their mouth very much like is described in the biblical concept,

706
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:15,300
anyway.

707
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:16,540
Not necessarily the same.

708
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:17,580
Let me just interject this.

709
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:20,180
The anti-Christ will be a political figure

710
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:25,660
in a position of political power, but he will be a political,

711
01:18:25,660 --> 01:18:31,420
meaning not of the systems that you're used to seeing someone stand

712
01:18:31,420 --> 01:18:33,780
amongst.

713
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:38,180
He will be fluid and free to move in those systems.

714
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:44,340
In other words, the UN National Federal Capital high corporate

715
01:18:44,340 --> 01:18:48,340
positions, he'll be moving in and out of that, but he'll be a political.

716
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:50,860
Right now, he's about 223.

717
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:55,580
Actually, he was born a couple of weeks ago, around 1998.

718
01:18:55,580 --> 01:19:02,860
He's of usurian, not usurian, usurian, ASSYR, IAN, descend,

719
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:05,660
but he will claim to be Judean.

720
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:08,580
That's why I tell people, don't even bother reading the Bible

721
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:11,380
because you're not going to understand anything in it.

722
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:18,180
I'm not telling people not to read the Bible because that would be

723
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:21,140
suggesting they stay away from high source content material,

724
01:19:21,140 --> 01:19:23,020
right?

725
01:19:23,020 --> 01:19:26,660
Because it's got sources in it as well, but in other words,

726
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:30,700
if you listen to what I say, when I say that, don't even bother reading the Bible

727
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:33,220
because you're not going to understand anything in it, meaning you have to

728
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:36,860
approach it with reading comprehension.

729
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:39,980
And one thing that is really off limits to most people and hidden

730
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:43,140
plain sight is what's called the book of Revelation.

731
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:46,700
If you're a Christian and you could read the book of Revelation five times

732
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:50,700
a day, every day, for 50 years, you're not going to understand anything past

733
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:52,220
the word the.

734
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:56,620
If you subscribe to any religion because it's coming from a different level.

735
01:19:56,620 --> 01:20:00,460
So in that book of Revelation, it states that beware of those who claim to be

736
01:20:00,460 --> 01:20:04,540
Jews in the King James and are not, right?

737
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:09,260
And people use that on all kinds of, how are they want to use it?

738
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:11,180
But it doesn't say that it's Judeans.

739
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:17,980
So that book of Revelation is very specific to identifying many things,

740
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:24,860
star charts, how the earth, what the earth is really is about, and what mankind is going to

741
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:25,860
get into.

742
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:29,500
The long-time period that these events will occur?

743
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,820
It's about divine law.

744
01:20:32,820 --> 01:20:37,100
And you got to understand when you're getting the King James Bible, someone posted a video.

745
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:39,380
Actually, I thought it was funny to me.

746
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:44,620
And it's basically like reading a 12-year-old book report on the Bible.

747
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:46,020
There is no...

748
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:51,580
I have of King James is a door stop.

749
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:58,500
The New Testament is very difficult to get into because it was written in Aramaic then

750
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,740
a hundred years later in Greek.

751
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:05,900
Then into Latin and the people who translated into King James wanted a Greek version, they

752
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:06,900
couldn't find it.

753
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:12,660
So they took the Latin, translated it back into Greek and then translated that into English.

754
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:18,060
So it's a copy of a copy of a copy.

755
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:21,420
So you have to understand the law to put the things in the right perspective and you have

756
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:23,340
to understand Aramaic.

757
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:27,340
There's no source online that I can cite about doing that.

758
01:21:27,340 --> 01:21:32,420
You're going to have to find someone who is of usurian descent and you're going to have

759
01:21:32,420 --> 01:21:35,100
to go back and look at certain things.

760
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:37,660
But let's just not get on that topic.

761
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:44,660
So let's just state things that we can factually attest to based on studying the source of comprehension.

762
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:45,660
Okay.

763
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:50,120
The sticking point of the question though is actually about Donald Trump because he would

764
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:57,620
be a political and seem to share some of the characteristics that he's not of usurian

765
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:00,540
descent and he doesn't claim to be of Judean.

766
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:03,540
There you have a differentiation right there.

767
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:06,340
So I just want to make that clear that I asked the question.

768
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:08,340
I'd like it to be us 23 years old.

769
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:09,340
No, certainly not.

770
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:15,700
I'd like you to roll into that though with the question asked in the chat room while you

771
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:18,020
do this explanation if you don't mind.

772
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:19,580
What will we, let me see here?

773
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:25,980
What's going to be the events leading up to year zero is the question in the chat room?

774
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:26,980
Yeah.

775
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:27,980
Go ahead.

776
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:29,300
More of the same of what you see now.

777
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:34,180
Just stressing the human condition, which you can take a lot of stress.

778
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:37,860
In other words, it's going to get to the point where you're going to start killing.

779
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:38,860
We've discussed this five years ago.

780
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:43,100
I said people are going to start killing each other for no reason.

781
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:48,740
Look at various agendas that are going to be put in place that might take some people

782
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:51,420
by surprise, but they're going to be willing.

783
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:53,260
Everyone's going to willing to go for it.

784
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:57,460
Like one of them is the pedophilia agenda, the other one.

785
01:22:57,460 --> 01:23:01,900
These are agendas that have, besides the homosexuality and other things that have been put

786
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:02,900
out.

787
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:09,780
But the pedophilia, which has already been put out big time, and petrasty and all that,

788
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:11,220
into the cannibalism.

789
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:15,620
For example, there's no such thing as laboratory meat.

790
01:23:15,620 --> 01:23:17,340
You know they want to feed people laboratory.

791
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:18,620
There's no such thing.

792
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:22,900
It's reprocessed human whatever you want to call it.

793
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:26,300
There's no such thing as laboratory meat.

794
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:31,900
So the cannibalism agenda, on and on and on.

795
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:38,980
And around year zero, there's going to be a turnaround and using, let's say, a more draconian

796
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:44,900
approach or hard-handed approach to old classical law form overused.

797
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:49,140
You know what I mean by that is, law is good, like water is good.

798
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:54,660
But what you can drown in water, you can drown people in good laws.

799
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:58,740
So yeah, you're going to see these agendas coming around.

800
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:03,700
I will also restate what I've stated, been stating for past two decades is you're going to see

801
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:09,460
lack of adherence as well as abandonment of the, what are the major religions?

802
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:11,820
Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

803
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:16,300
People are going to be walking away from that and they're going to be walking away for many

804
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:17,300
reasons, right?

805
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:19,740
Well, statistically that's happening now.

806
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:25,060
Right, but it's going to be on the increase and within a year or two it's going to be

807
01:24:25,060 --> 01:24:26,980
pretty major increase of that.

808
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:31,780
So for lack of a better term, we're going to see a noticeable exodus from it.

809
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:32,780
Oh yeah, okay.

810
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:37,380
Yeah, to the point where there's a place called Align Light on 6th Avenue in Manhattan,

811
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:41,900
I know guys started it years ago, it was an old church and they turned it into a disco.

812
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:42,900
Great club actually.

813
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:47,580
They did not just the disco, not just the disco, but they used to see on the men's.

814
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:48,580
I'm going to head on it.

815
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:51,580
So I'll rent it out and then you could have bands play there.

816
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:54,700
You sure could, but yeah, I don't even know so around.

817
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:57,420
I think it's 16th Street and 6th Avenue.

818
01:24:57,420 --> 01:25:02,940
Yeah, it was a church before that, but I remember it well in the 90s played there even once.

819
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:08,540
Got to turn the Vatican into that make of great disco.

820
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:10,940
Oh, imagine the possibilities there.

821
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:12,540
Anyway, yeah, go ahead.

822
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:14,540
Yeah, I could go.

823
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:18,860
I mean, so you're going to see a lot of the ancient stuff that you've never so ancient

824
01:25:18,860 --> 01:25:22,700
and so hidden that you don't know about it revived.

825
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:26,860
And when I say you meaning the public at large will not know it's a revival, they'll think

826
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:29,180
it's something new.

827
01:25:29,180 --> 01:25:34,620
So what do you know about ancient culture, like the real quirky stuff, like real odd customs

828
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:40,660
and real odd religions, especially based around not the divine, what people call divine feminine,

829
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:45,700
but certain goddess religions, certain goddess religions, right?

830
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:46,700
Right.

831
01:25:46,700 --> 01:25:48,980
I always find that rather funny by the way.

832
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:54,980
The people that tell me they ascribe to the feminine goddesses and I'm like, yeah, you don't know

833
01:25:54,980 --> 01:25:55,980
which one.

834
01:25:55,980 --> 01:26:00,900
You don't know who you're talking to apparently because the each have a corresponding demon,

835
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:09,060
like the Shiva you read about it in the Hindu piranhas, a piranhas and well, that's a very

836
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:13,700
formative, constructive goddess, but she has a counterpart demon that's also named Shiva,

837
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:14,700
right?

838
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:15,700
That's a destroyer.

839
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:23,060
So they all have that counterbalance aspect to them that, I mean, justice herself is even

840
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:24,860
Yahweh has a destroyer.

841
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:25,860
Right.

842
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:26,860
Of course.

843
01:26:26,860 --> 01:26:27,860
But then's a destroying angel down.

844
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:28,860
Yeah.

845
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:32,300
No, they all have the counter, right?

846
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:38,740
And the funny thing is the intent, they believe that they're tapping into an intent, which

847
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:46,900
is this divine, warm, fuzzy, positive, "Oh, would never do any harm."

848
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:49,980
And I'm like, wow, you just really have no idea.

849
01:26:49,980 --> 01:26:50,980
Well, let's see.

850
01:26:50,980 --> 01:26:55,980
The emotion, it's like the candies, what is those chocolate candies with a hard shell on

851
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:57,860
them so you don't get it all over your hands.

852
01:26:57,860 --> 01:26:58,860
Yeah, right.

853
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:04,700
They take these demonic practices and ideologies and they coat them.

854
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:07,260
So it just melts in your mouth, not in your hand kind of thing?

855
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:08,260
Yeah, exactly.

856
01:27:08,260 --> 01:27:10,260
No, I know what they're swallowing, you know?

857
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:14,580
No, I see that and it's just so strange.

858
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:20,980
And anyway, back to what we're talking about here, which is where we're going in the next

859
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:24,620
few years.

860
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:26,100
More of the same.

861
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:27,100
More of the same.

862
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:33,180
But not as such, meaning it doesn't necessarily have to be a pandemic.

863
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:36,900
You will have the corresponding degradation.

864
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:41,460
In other words, you know when you hear about the disasters we've spoken about in the past

865
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:46,460
that you read about in biblical terms, the asteroids and the famines and the plagues and

866
01:27:46,460 --> 01:27:49,380
all that stuff, that's all ready to go.

867
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:55,060
It's just that it's not ready to go until the morality, the lawfulness, honor and dignity

868
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:56,700
of mankind goes lower.

869
01:27:56,700 --> 01:28:00,100
It has to go a little bit lower.

870
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:06,860
And one way to judge whether honor, dignity, lawfulness and morality are on the rise.

871
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:13,180
Or on the descend is to see people's desire to seek the truth.

872
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:17,980
Sounds kind of, I'm not being sarcastic.

873
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:24,680
So the less people desire to learn or seek what's true, the easier they, there are morality,

874
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:27,380
honor, dignity and lawfulness drops.

875
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:34,380
The more they seek the truth, the level of honor, dignity, morality and lawfulness raises.

876
01:28:34,380 --> 01:28:38,260
When I say the truth, I mean the real objectifiable truth.

877
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:40,100
Well, so what do you think?

878
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:42,220
That's pretty easy to predict.

879
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:46,860
So if the people start seeking the truth less and less, guess what's going to happen to

880
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:49,340
morality, honor, dignity and lawfulness?

881
01:28:49,340 --> 01:28:51,340
Well, I think it will go down.

882
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:54,260
But that's not coming in the future.

883
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:56,500
That's why you know.

884
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:57,500
It's coming.

885
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,260
In other words, I give the example of laboratory meat.

886
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:01,580
Do you think they're actually going to make meat in the laboratory?

887
01:29:01,580 --> 01:29:05,580
It's just like genetically modified organisms.

888
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:06,700
They don't know what they're doing.

889
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:13,340
What they do is they find similar organisms and they modify them by applying toxins.

890
01:29:13,340 --> 01:29:14,340
Right?

891
01:29:14,340 --> 01:29:15,340
Here's an example.

892
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:19,500
When you hear about, let's say, genetically modified oranges.

893
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:22,140
You know, you have an orange tree of various types of oranges.

894
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:24,340
You know, I mean, not just the orange fruit.

895
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:27,620
There's many types, right?

896
01:29:27,620 --> 01:29:30,060
You know, there's such thing as a decorative orange tree.

897
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:34,540
When I first had knowledge of that, I was in the Seagramps building in Manhattan once

898
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:36,940
and they had an orange tree and they picked an orange.

899
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:38,940
It opened new.

900
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:39,940
It's just something.

901
01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:40,940
Oh, great, great.

902
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:45,020
You got to watch your electronic interference there.

903
01:29:45,020 --> 01:29:46,500
It was a decorative plant.

904
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:51,900
Now the insects are not going to attack a decorative orange plant like they would one that

905
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:56,100
has a nutrition bearing flesh inside the orange.

906
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:59,220
So they're just cross pollinating and doing all that other stuff.

907
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:05,300
So when you hear genetically modified crops, this is an experiment some people are reporting

908
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:06,300
on.

909
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:10,980
You know, when you buy the seeds for that are genetically modified that they don't produce

910
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:12,980
seeds, you buy more seed.

911
01:30:12,980 --> 01:30:14,780
Terminated, if you can keep.

912
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:20,700
Yes, but if you can keep certain perennials alive, I mean ones that I think I'm not using

913
01:30:20,700 --> 01:30:25,540
the right term there, the plants that can go beyond one year, they will again sprout seed.

914
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:27,620
So you have to be very patient.

915
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:31,460
But it's not a way of doing it though, it's not conducive because you end up losing a

916
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:32,460
year.

917
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:34,460
It's an interruption in the cycle.

918
01:30:34,460 --> 01:30:41,060
So again, I would stress, I'm not going to stress, but let's say the underscore in air quotes,

919
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:45,100
the cannibalism agenda, right?

920
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:50,900
And I'm not talking about like when the Supreme Court did row versus way the abortion thing,

921
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:52,220
that was not because of women's rights.

922
01:30:52,220 --> 01:30:53,220
They don't care.

923
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:55,460
The rights is a terrible thing to entertain.

924
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:59,340
So they can supply their friends with a steady supply of baby parts.

925
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:03,940
Well, and in fairness, look, the truth about that is when it comes to, well, you know, that

926
01:31:03,940 --> 01:31:04,940
denies them.

927
01:31:04,940 --> 01:31:06,460
That's not true at all.

928
01:31:06,460 --> 01:31:08,780
Here's the reality that they don't care about rights.

929
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:12,220
If you have an, and the other thing is those that are striking it down, if you have enough

930
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:15,460
money, guess what?

931
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:16,540
You don't have to worry about that.

932
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:19,620
It's a private procedure between a doctor and a woman.

933
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:23,180
Yes, but my point is when it becomes public like that it's code.

934
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:24,180
Yeah, I understand.

935
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:28,060
But I'm just saying that it's irrelevant on both counts.

936
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:29,060
It's funny.

937
01:31:29,060 --> 01:31:32,980
But watch out for stuff like that, right?

938
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:35,660
So when they tell you abortions, okay, it's not because of women's rights.

939
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:39,100
It's because they have friends, you know, they take marching orders.

940
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:41,420
And Supreme Court, by the way, is not a court of record.

941
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:43,340
It's actually pretty low.

942
01:31:43,340 --> 01:31:46,100
It's an appeals court.

943
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:49,660
It always has to go back to the district court or a court of record.

944
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:51,900
So, but it's all part of the religion.

945
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:54,900
I mean, it's pretty, pretty sick, if you ask me.

946
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:57,660
So all of these things is-- who benefits?

947
01:31:57,660 --> 01:31:58,640
In other words, he'll bow no.

948
01:31:58,640 --> 01:31:59,400
All right?

949
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:00,200
Keyobono and Latin?

950
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:01,120
Keyobono, yeah.

951
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:04,600
If you look at the-- the Nuke-- they dropped on Lebanon

952
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,640
a month or two ago.

953
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:10,660
If you want to know who dropped it, who is--

954
01:32:10,660 --> 01:32:13,200
from a brand name perspective, it was the French.

955
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:14,820
Well, how do I know?

956
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:18,720
Well, because the French leadership is sticking their knows

957
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:23,400
way deep into Lebanon since that happened, right?

958
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:26,880
Meaning not that there really is a French government,

959
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,800
but the brand known as France is moving in--

960
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:31,840
do you see what I mean?

961
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:32,340
Right.

962
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:34,960
Well, in that brand functions on this concept

963
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:38,760
of control and destruction of colonies.

964
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:42,200
So if you look back at the history of them attempting

965
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:45,560
to insert themselves into the Middle East,

966
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:47,200
it makes perfect sense.

967
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,240
Now, I don't know about the evidence for that,

968
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,200
to be honest with you.

969
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,360
I haven't seen the evidence for it.

970
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:56,640
When I saw it, it certainly looked like not quite a nuclear

971
01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:00,280
explosion as I've seen it on film before,

972
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:02,280
but it looked like something else.

973
01:33:02,280 --> 01:33:02,760
And--

974
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:05,960
Well, the thing about calling it a nuke is based on the yield.

975
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:07,400
It's very easy.

976
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:10,680
There's a pact-- an unwritten pact for the past 40 years or 50

977
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:11,480
years--

978
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:16,040
to not do anything atmospheric anymore.

979
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:18,220
The 20,000 nuclear experiments is

980
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:21,920
a 90% of them are underground, so that's how they use them.

981
01:33:21,920 --> 01:33:24,720
In other words, they're not supposed to detonate on the surface

982
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:28,360
because it's too obvious you have the double flash, right?

983
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:30,600
You have the detonation and the reaction.

984
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,720
So they're always used underground,

985
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,560
but the way you figure that out is based

986
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,520
on the immediacy of the environmental reaction.

987
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:44,320
But I call it because it's very inexpensive to do--

988
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:48,840
but now that they've got people used to the biologicals,

989
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:52,000
I think the last time we spoke in what's called January,

990
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
and you brought up the possibility of war

991
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,400
starting because of Salmani being killed by intelligence

992
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,400
agencies to spark off a war, let's say.

993
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,600
I said, no.

994
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:04,280
I said, the wars are going to be done using biologicals.

995
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:05,000
Do you remember that?

996
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:06,560
This is the story that started.

997
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,880
Yes, I do, because what happened there

998
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,160
seemed to me to be exactly the kind of thing

999
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:15,040
that usually starts a conflict.

1000
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:15,680
But it didn't.

1001
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:17,680
Surprisingly to me, it did not.

1002
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:21,240
And I think the reason was that it couldn't be sold

1003
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:25,720
to whoever makes that decision that this was a good idea at the time.

1004
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:29,080
Right, and the only people who can defeat the Persians

1005
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,760
are the Greeks, and the Greeks are in no situation

1006
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:32,840
to fight the Persians.

1007
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,160
No, they have no--

1008
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:36,080
that's impossible at the moment.

1009
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:37,400
So-- That's not going to happen.

1010
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:38,560
So it's not going to happen.

1011
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:39,560
It's very easy.

1012
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:41,360
It's going to happen before--

1013
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:43,360
Well, the other relevant thing--

1014
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,880
Well, hang on one second.

1015
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:46,160
One second, the other relevant thing

1016
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:48,920
that you brought up at that time when we talked about that situation,

1017
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:52,360
because I do have a memory, is that you said

1018
01:34:52,360 --> 01:34:54,440
it was the wrong time of year.

1019
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:59,520
And what, using that idea and taking a look at the time of year,

1020
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:04,280
and what it is that you naturally do in a Greg--

1021
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:06,280
You know, a Greg--

1022
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:07,640
A Gregorian, correct.

1023
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:09,160
That's the word I was trying to get out.

1024
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:11,720
In a Gregorian sense.

1025
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:13,960
Yeah, you're supposed to be harvesting,

1026
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:16,960
guess what, around now.

1027
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:21,240
We-- Yeah, harvest is now, but the winter is transition.

1028
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:23,240
The harvest is now, the fall, correct.

1029
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:24,360
The winter is transition.

1030
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:27,000
When-- see, in the winter, you're done with your harvest.

1031
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,920
You have your winter crop, your winter wheat, winter rye going,

1032
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:31,960
and you might-- that's when you build your barn,

1033
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:33,760
your fixer wagon, or go on a long trip.

1034
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:38,000
No, I understand, but when you take--

1035
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,120
And you apply-- No, I get it.

1036
01:35:40,120 --> 01:35:40,920
That's what I was going to say.

1037
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:45,080
When you apply that figuratively to what's going on,

1038
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:48,200
of course, it was going to be no war then.

1039
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:52,480
That would not have been the time to harvest this kind of thing.

1040
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,560
I think what we have seen is an incremental increase

1041
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:58,440
again in that tension across the board.

1042
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:01,240
I don't see anywhere where things are getting more peaceful,

1043
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:03,040
and I don't care about that business deal again

1044
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:04,600
that they made in the Middle East.

1045
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:06,480
That is irrelevant.

1046
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,560
It's just another business deal.

1047
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:09,080
OK.

1048
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:11,840
Well, it's a historical-- you know, you have fake news.

1049
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:12,960
What about fake history?

1050
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:19,520
If the news are fake, isn't the history a compilation of news?

1051
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:22,960
Well, on one level, it is, but it is also

1052
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:25,760
the record that is recorded by individuals.

1053
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:30,360
When you look at the concept of historiography,

1054
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:32,320
it is more than that.

1055
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:36,480
But indeed, the individuals who write those histories,

1056
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,280
do it with particular agendas.

1057
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:40,080
And I don't care if you're talking about Joe Cephas

1058
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:41,640
or whoever the hell is keeping track of it

1059
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:43,720
at the Pentagon at the moment.

1060
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:46,840
There is a reasoning for why the history is written the way it is.

1061
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:49,080
It is always subject to revision.

1062
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:54,520
And quite frankly, there is the concept of the need for revisionism

1063
01:36:54,520 --> 01:36:56,920
on all of these histories, which--

1064
01:36:56,920 --> 01:37:00,880
listen, I agree to it-- there are things which are not known

1065
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:05,040
at the time of the history that become known later.

1066
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:09,040
So this is why, by the way, the French had the concept

1067
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:12,960
of perspective that you had to have 75 years

1068
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,960
between a historical event before you got a realistic writing

1069
01:37:15,960 --> 01:37:18,640
about it.

1070
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:20,920
In ancient tradition, it was 100, yeah?

1071
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:21,920
Yeah.

1072
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,000
And my next point is that in ancient--

1073
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,280
the reason why they see histories written 100 years

1074
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:30,680
after the fact is because that's the way it was done.

1075
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:34,880
That's why I mentioned Joe Cephas there and people like that,

1076
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:37,080
because sometimes they were writing about things

1077
01:37:37,080 --> 01:37:39,720
that had happened a century before.

1078
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,680
And people say, well, how do they know about--

1079
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:44,000
well, that is the way history was written.

1080
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,840
So you have to look at the process by which the history is written also.

1081
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:50,960
And again, subject to revision at all times.

1082
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,560
So no, I'm aware of all this.

1083
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:55,520
I want to get back to this thing about Lebanon, though,

1084
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,520
before we ran out of time, because that was the final question

1085
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:00,520
I wanted to ask you.

1086
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:04,720
Because you and I didn't get to speak around that time.

1087
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:06,360
It has fallen out of the headlines.

1088
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:08,040
There's no news about it.

1089
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:09,040
Basically.

1090
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:09,800
Right.

1091
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,760
But you do note that the French definitely got

1092
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,720
involved in investigation.

1093
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:17,200
And that is a key thing whenever you take note of who gets involved

1094
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:20,240
in an investigation after a major event.

1095
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:23,160
That's usually the person that's responsible for at least part

1096
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,200
of that major event.

1097
01:38:25,200 --> 01:38:25,720
That's right.

1098
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:26,040
Yeah.

1099
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:28,600
So I want to get into this a little more, though,

1100
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:34,360
because Lebanon is a little more significant than the modern concept

1101
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:36,200
of what people say about it.

1102
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:40,840
I mean, we know about the history and the different conflicts.

1103
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:44,160
And oh, well, the people behind Hezbollah and Bovon,

1104
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:46,640
it was just a government screw up here.

1105
01:38:46,640 --> 01:38:50,240
I found that hilarious, by the way, that it's just--

1106
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,160
the government has become so ineffectual

1107
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:55,480
that this is what happened accidentally.

1108
01:38:55,480 --> 01:38:58,000
I can't quite buy that.

1109
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,880
Well, forget about when you say government,

1110
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:04,320
use the word administration, which is just like a traffic

1111
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:05,720
cop, let's say, or something.

1112
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:08,320
It keeps things moving.

1113
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:12,800
Because there is no government as you're

1114
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:17,960
taught in civics if you are old enough to have taken that class,

1115
01:39:17,960 --> 01:39:19,120
which they don't teach anymore.

1116
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:22,040
Which I know what you--

1117
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:24,400
Yeah, what you will be looking at in the future

1118
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:29,920
is an decentralized power base between southern Iraq,

1119
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:34,680
like what would be the Arabian Sea there,

1120
01:39:34,680 --> 01:39:38,680
like the land of Er, if that rings a bell for anyone,

1121
01:39:38,680 --> 01:39:40,640
southern Iraq, like south of Babylon,

1122
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:49,480
to Babylon, Jerusalem, and the Levant of Lebanon.

1123
01:39:49,480 --> 01:39:53,720
Those three areas are going to be a decentralized power base.

1124
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:57,960
In other words, there's going to be a lot of action, both overt

1125
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:00,400
and covert in those parts of the world, which right now

1126
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:04,360
are very still, except for the Lebanon condition

1127
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:06,800
that we just talked about.

1128
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,840
Right.

1129
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:12,480
No, that's the Jerusalem is another major point.

1130
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:16,160
And all of this is based on divine consideration,

1131
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:20,000
not secular stuff that you see.

1132
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:25,960
Well, let me ask you why, because the way I see it is,

1133
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:29,920
is it just related to the fact that these are historically

1134
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:33,360
relevant spots on the internet?

1135
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,160
OK.

1136
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:35,160
And that's--

1137
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,720
Yeah, we're chosen a very, very long time ago,

1138
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:39,040
like pre-historical.

1139
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:39,960
Yeah, see, that's the thing.

1140
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:40,880
No, why?

1141
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:43,440
I've always wondered this, by the way.

1142
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:43,960
Why?

1143
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:44,880
It's a mess.

1144
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:47,680
If you look at the map of the world,

1145
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:50,960
and you do a cross-section, especially the flat maps that

1146
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:55,040
go against the wall, just do a cross-section.

1147
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:58,320
The major mass is Asia, Africa, and Europe.

1148
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:01,040
They're all connected, except for various canals.

1149
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:07,000
If you do an X through them, from the top right Russia

1150
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,880
to the south, bottom left of Africa,

1151
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:12,600
top left of Europe, to the bottom right of India,

1152
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:16,160
you'll see the X crosses right in the middle of those three

1153
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:17,120
places.

1154
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:19,560
It's also prophetic as well.

1155
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:23,200
Point of convergence, though, at center mass,

1156
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:26,040
based on the land mass that was known at that time.

1157
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:29,840
That's Asia, Africa, yeah, which is the major of the Earth, yeah.

1158
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:30,840
Yeah.

1159
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:31,080
OK.

1160
01:41:31,080 --> 01:41:32,040
No, fair enough.

1161
01:41:32,040 --> 01:41:33,360
That's simple question.

1162
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:37,920
Well, in essence, I get it from prophecy, biblical prophecy,

1163
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:42,520
which there are many other prophetic writings and rites.

1164
01:41:42,520 --> 01:41:45,160
I call them holy rites of the world that are all in--

1165
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:46,920
they can be harmonized.

1166
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:50,640
But the reason I mention the biblical narrative

1167
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:54,880
is because it gives the most information.

1168
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:57,480
Well, indeed, a previous--

1169
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:59,520
allegedly, in history, previous to this,

1170
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:06,920
you have many other seemingly divinely inspired texts

1171
01:42:06,920 --> 01:42:11,280
that did contain some of this information as well.

1172
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:13,800
Now, I don't know if it's a lack of preservation,

1173
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:15,720
or if it's a lack of information that

1174
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:18,560
was available to previous peoples or not,

1175
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:21,320
because that's a good question, I think.

1176
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:24,040
It's not that it's never available.

1177
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:25,560
Yes, it can be.

1178
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:29,000
Having a book even 200 years ago was very rare.

1179
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Like, if you went into a small town, what's going on here?

1180
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,240
They'll say, well, we have a butcher and a baker.

1181
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:38,840
And this guy here lives across the street.

1182
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:40,120
He has a book.

1183
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,760
Wow, he owns a book?

1184
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:42,920
Wow.

1185
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:47,280
I mean, that's how rare they were at one point, right?

1186
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:50,160
But on the other hand, if you had a secret,

1187
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:52,040
and you wanted to make sure it was kept secret,

1188
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:55,960
you make a million copies and put it in the public library.

1189
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:58,560
And no one will ever find out.

1190
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,600
This is true.

1191
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:00,520
This is true.

1192
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:03,120
Who even knows what a library is among people

1193
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:06,880
that are younger than us, Greek, honestly?

1194
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:07,600
So--

1195
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:08,600
But here's the thing.

1196
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:12,000
I wouldn't focus at all on the things

1197
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,920
that people tend to focus on.

1198
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:16,280
Do the opposite, and you'll be better off.

1199
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:19,560
You should always increase your honor, dignity,

1200
01:43:19,560 --> 01:43:21,400
lawfulness, and morality.

1201
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:26,280
But also increase the level of food, clothing, and shelter.

1202
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:30,000
There's a really great future that no one knows anything

1203
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,040
about that's coming.

1204
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:34,280
I mean, no one meaning the corporate, no one.

1205
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:36,760
There are plenty of people that do know, but not that many,

1206
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:39,440
meaning they're in the hundreds or a few thousand.

1207
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:40,520
They know what's coming.

1208
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:42,640
And it's going to be wonderful.

1209
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:45,800
And it's going to be such a wonderful surprise

1210
01:43:45,800 --> 01:43:51,200
that I think that all of this crap, recent or not,

1211
01:43:51,200 --> 01:43:54,680
will be forgotten.

1212
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:55,200
Right.

1213
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:55,920
Right.

1214
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:59,680
Well, and here we are, like I say, I do feel

1215
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:01,560
as though this is an interesting time period

1216
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:09,320
because the transition will be evidence within the next few years.

1217
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:14,120
I just-- I wonder about the difficulty of the road ahead.

1218
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:19,560
Oh, it'll get very difficult because it's going to test your--

1219
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:23,160
well, how do you say the level of tolerance

1220
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:28,520
or the robustness of the human, both spiritual and physical?

1221
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:32,040
The thing is, they're both-- humanity is both weak, spiritually,

1222
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:35,720
and both physically weak as well right now.

1223
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:37,720
And they're going to be pushed to the limit.

1224
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:40,360
And most will not make it.

1225
01:44:40,360 --> 01:44:42,520
When I say most will not make it in this--

1226
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:46,640
in this, what we call reality now, the reality that's set up

1227
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:49,400
by the corporations, the state, the secret societies,

1228
01:44:49,400 --> 01:44:53,280
the religions, your education system, all that.

1229
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,440
Yeah, it's in very-- you're in very bad shape.

1230
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:58,000
But you're resilient enough, ultimately.

1231
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,960
And you have friends in high places that will eventually

1232
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,920
help the general humanity.

1233
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:08,960
99.9% of the people are going to come out fine on the other side

1234
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:12,520
in the real reality, which is a reality of consciousness.

1235
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:14,400
Here's the interesting thing.

1236
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:17,000
It's all about raising-- when I say honor, dignity,

1237
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:22,080
lawfulness, and morality, that's a consciousness thing.

1238
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:25,080
So it's what happens in your heart and your soul

1239
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:28,680
and your mind, which is your spirit.

1240
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:31,520
And that affects your soul, your metabolism.

1241
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:36,360
So if you read ancient texts, especially the biblical text,

1242
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:40,960
what people don't understand is that it's one cohesive document.

1243
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,520
There's no old and new.

1244
01:45:42,520 --> 01:45:46,880
And it seems limiting because of the quote unquote laws.

1245
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,920
But once you do those laws, there are disciplines

1246
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:53,320
that raise your consciousness once you do them.

1247
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:56,040
It's kind of like the wax on, wax off karate kid.

1248
01:45:56,040 --> 01:46:00,200
He didn't understand what that whole discipline was about

1249
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:05,440
until he was made aware of what the discipline was about.

1250
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:10,000
And here's something that I've been discussing more in private.

1251
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,960
I call it the existential threat to the universe.

1252
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:17,960
And what I mean by that, I'll preface this this way.

1253
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:19,560
Let's just follow this scenario.

1254
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:23,560
One day, everyone goes outside no matter where you are in the world.

1255
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:26,120
And you see these huge spaceships, right?

1256
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:31,720
And it just scares humanity so much that all the countries

1257
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:33,560
put down their weapons and they stop fighting

1258
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:36,200
and they get into peace agreements.

1259
01:46:36,200 --> 01:46:40,120
We can depend on the state scenario again, basically.

1260
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:45,480
Yeah, a week after that, all the ships fire on the earth

1261
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:48,600
and kill everyone on the earth, except for one guy.

1262
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:53,720
And he says, well, you guys present themselves.

1263
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:55,400
And guys says, why did you kill us?

1264
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:56,400
We made peace on earth.

1265
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:57,880
He says, yeah, well, we didn't--

1266
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:00,720
we made you to be a warlike race.

1267
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:03,120
So we can take you and bring you out here

1268
01:47:03,120 --> 01:47:05,040
into the universe and fight wars with us.

1269
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:07,160
But since you wanted peace, we had no use for you.

1270
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:08,120
So we wiped you out.

1271
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:14,320
Where do you read and where do you not read that the gods are not

1272
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:14,840
warlike?

1273
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:16,400
They're always warlike.

1274
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:17,160
We're being--

1275
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:21,400
I am suggesting that we are being bred spiritually,

1276
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:25,360
as larva goes to the next metamorphosis,

1277
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:29,120
what I call resurrection reincarnation, what have you,

1278
01:47:29,120 --> 01:47:32,640
the next level or the afterlife, let's say,

1279
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:36,440
to be a warrior class to protect this universe

1280
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:41,040
as we can conceive it from an existential threat

1281
01:47:41,040 --> 01:47:46,000
of beings that are not created and are not gods and are not

1282
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:46,520
human.

1283
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:49,120
They are a totally different life form.

1284
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:51,160
And if you got this information now,

1285
01:47:51,160 --> 01:47:52,920
you would just scare the pitons out of you.

1286
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:55,160
But you cannot get the briefing on this

1287
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:57,320
until you go to the next level, in other words,

1288
01:47:57,320 --> 01:48:00,800
until you get into what's called the afterlife.

1289
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,040
Well, right.

1290
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:05,680
I'll end with that because that's a real fantastic approach

1291
01:48:05,680 --> 01:48:08,400
to what all this means.

1292
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:12,800
But you've got-- you know why I said that because no one else is.

1293
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:13,320
So--

1294
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:16,000
No, and fair enough.

1295
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,280
I recently slipped on a show.

1296
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:23,840
And because I was asked about prayer, basically.

1297
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:24,340
And--

1298
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:25,880
Stop right there, prayer.

1299
01:48:25,880 --> 01:48:28,240
Stop using the word prayer because it evokes religious

1300
01:48:28,240 --> 01:48:31,280
sediment, which could be negative in many cases.

1301
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,880
You know what prayer really is?

1302
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:34,160
Good.

1303
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:35,800
Telepathy.

1304
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:37,840
Anyway, well, just think about that.

1305
01:48:37,840 --> 01:48:38,480
True.

1306
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:40,360
But you're practicing telepathy.

1307
01:48:40,360 --> 01:48:43,320
I interpreted it to that level.

1308
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:45,520
And taking a look, I take people's words

1309
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:47,120
and I have to reinterpret them because they

1310
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:51,720
use very blunt instruments and prayers as a blunt word.

1311
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:54,600
And it evokes a whole bunch of connotations that don't belong

1312
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:55,840
to it.

1313
01:48:55,840 --> 01:48:58,280
But in the practice that a lot of people

1314
01:48:58,280 --> 01:49:05,200
would understand as prayer, I know who I'm talking to.

1315
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:08,000
And I know I'm talking to the gods of war.

1316
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:09,880
And I said that.

1317
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:13,080
And I got a little bit of crap for it.

1318
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:16,320
What do you mean of the ancient pantheon,

1319
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:17,160
these people bought?

1320
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:18,680
No, no, no, no.

1321
01:49:18,680 --> 01:49:20,680
Well, they're God, actually.

1322
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:22,440
Right.

1323
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:23,800
That would be Yahweh.

1324
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:25,320
No one uses that term.

1325
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:26,640
And that term has been hijacked.

1326
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:28,440
And that name has been hijacked.

1327
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:29,640
Which is why I don't use it.

1328
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:30,440
I don't use it.

1329
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:32,680
But the thing is, I also know.

1330
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:35,240
The aspect of telepathy, depending

1331
01:49:35,240 --> 01:49:38,360
on which circles you roll in is valid or invalid,

1332
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:41,840
but I believe is more accurate than saying prayer.

1333
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:45,240
But I know my telepathy is going to the god's poor--

1334
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:46,280
correct.

1335
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:47,080
OK.

1336
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:53,880
And I also know that I am passing whatever it is I can pass to them.

1337
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:58,480
I know that I am definitely addressing the gods of war.

1338
01:49:58,480 --> 01:50:00,280
I know this.

1339
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:00,800
And--

1340
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:01,840
Well, let me put it this way.

1341
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:06,080
If you're not a god of war, you're not going to be around.

1342
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,160
Well, there you have it.

1343
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:11,800
Because there is a war of the gods also, which is--

1344
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:15,920
that's the divine economics concept.

1345
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:18,160
Economics just means rules of the house.

1346
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:19,640
It goes beyond finances.

1347
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:24,760
So typically in academic circles, especially in the 19th century,

1348
01:50:24,760 --> 01:50:27,800
if you look at certain treatises, the economy of such and such,

1349
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:30,480
it meant how that culture functioned.

1350
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:35,800
So what I would suggest is that increasing one's consciousness--

1351
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:37,840
and I don't mean in the new age-- the new age

1352
01:50:37,840 --> 01:50:40,720
is bringing up the context and the subject matter,

1353
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:42,640
but they fall flat on their faces when they

1354
01:50:42,640 --> 01:50:45,240
try to resolve it in any rational way.

1355
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:47,800
You know, I say the new age movement at large.

1356
01:50:47,800 --> 01:50:49,320
But you'll notice in the new age movement,

1357
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:51,240
they talk a lot about consciousness, right?

1358
01:50:51,240 --> 01:50:55,400
And that's what this all is about, because that comes first.

1359
01:50:55,400 --> 01:51:00,800
The ether, consciousness, the mind is the station

1360
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:04,440
from which everything else emanates from.

1361
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:08,880
And that is based on a form of aggression

1362
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:10,680
that cannot be understood right now.

1363
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:14,680
It's a form of dynamics that cannot be understood or comprehended

1364
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:15,480
right now.

1365
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:18,880
But it doesn't mean that you can't lean on the subject matter

1366
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:21,960
in the way that it's been presented for thousands of years.

1367
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:25,320
And it's not the way that people think about it now.

1368
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:28,760
No, and it's certainly not this very--

1369
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:30,920
I don't know what to call it.

1370
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:34,000
Again, the new age is sort of generality

1371
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,200
that you see regarding this.

1372
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:39,600
There is indeed a way to elevate consciousness,

1373
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:41,480
and you already spoke to that.

1374
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:43,680
It is through the actions.

1375
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:47,560
Through honor, dignity, morality, and lawfulness.

1376
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:48,800
Right.

1377
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:49,520
Right.

1378
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:55,040
And that is not necessarily easily achieved.

1379
01:51:55,040 --> 01:52:00,240
It is a bit of work if you're accustomed to the customs.

1380
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:00,840
So--

1381
01:52:00,840 --> 01:52:03,320
Well, you can't do it without knowledge.

1382
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:04,640
True.

1383
01:52:04,640 --> 01:52:08,720
And martial art, for example, when I recently

1384
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:10,880
been on Skype, I'll talk about martial arts.

1385
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:13,840
And a lot of the things that you do here are true.

1386
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:20,040
But you have to practice all of your waking hours, 12 to 15 hours a day,

1387
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:23,680
every day, for a few years to be able to walk through a wall.

1388
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:25,480
But the moment you walk through the wall

1389
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:28,040
and say you've achieved it and stopped practicing for three days,

1390
01:52:28,040 --> 01:52:30,720
you can't do it anymore.

1391
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:33,760
You see, so consciousness is on the same thing.

1392
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:37,080
It's something that you adapt, like a higher operating system

1393
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:38,080
where it becomes natural.

1394
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:43,080
You don't have to think about it because it resolves itself

1395
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:44,080
through your actions.

1396
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:47,080
But without knowledge, you have nothing to resolve.

1397
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:50,800
Most people don't know what lawfulness is.

1398
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:52,720
And there's no need for it because they

1399
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:56,240
forfeited their position to.

1400
01:52:56,240 --> 01:53:00,040
In other words, the condition of the earth,

1401
01:53:00,040 --> 01:53:02,120
humans are a commodity.

1402
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:02,600
Right.

1403
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:05,160
You're no longer men and women.

1404
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:11,680
And commodities like doorknobs, nails, bananas, whatever, right?

1405
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:15,560
Don't require knowing the law because they're just a commodity.

1406
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:17,680
So, yeah.

1407
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:21,720
When you break out of that, you'll realize--

1408
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:22,680
here's an example.

1409
01:53:22,680 --> 01:53:24,760
You could look up a sovereign state, which

1410
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:26,320
is neither sovereign nor a state.

1411
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:30,120
Like the Federal Reserve is neither federal nor does it have reserves.

1412
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:33,600
A sovereign state is what everyone in the UN is or most countries

1413
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:34,680
now are.

1414
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:39,000
And it's a juridical fiction.

1415
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,200
Right.

1416
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:42,720
It's a corporate entity.

1417
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:48,200
And that has owners and shareholders that have everyone

1418
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:49,560
subscribed to that system.

1419
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:51,480
But if you look at all of the laws,

1420
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:55,760
they've left all of the lawful laws in place.

1421
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:57,280
You see?

1422
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:58,640
Because they're almost--

1423
01:53:58,640 --> 01:54:00,120
you know, the people who own the world

1424
01:54:00,120 --> 01:54:02,880
or think they do, or it's been granted to them

1425
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:05,920
to be in that position, like to have fun also.

1426
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:08,560
They eventually do like to see some people that will go

1427
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:12,480
and approach what's lawful and present it if they need to.

1428
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:14,560
The pawns don't.

1429
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:17,720
Like if you run into a regular attorney or a doctor

1430
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:20,120
or a cop or a priest and you bring up what's lawful,

1431
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:22,200
they're going to think you're crazy.

1432
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:24,720
But as you go higher and higher and higher in private,

1433
01:54:24,720 --> 01:54:26,840
never in public, they do honor that.

1434
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:29,680
Meaning the people.

1435
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:31,320
You know, as you go up the wrong.

1436
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:33,880
So if you bring up lawfulness or what's right,

1437
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:37,240
or what's in the law, for example, in the American laws,

1438
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:41,320
or whatever country you're in, they've still left,

1439
01:54:41,320 --> 01:54:44,720
they've still left laws in there that are pretty good.

1440
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:46,640
And actually, you'll notice the things that people

1441
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:48,720
are quote unquote charged with really doesn't apply

1442
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:50,960
to them based on definition.

1443
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:53,200
But if you're getting finding yourself in trouble,

1444
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:55,920
you're dealing with too low on the totem pole,

1445
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:57,920
which I call the pawns.

1446
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:01,600
And just to interject, one of the things, one of the reasons

1447
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:05,240
they did the the pandemic with the virus thing,

1448
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:09,200
because I think I've talked privately that contagions

1449
01:55:09,200 --> 01:55:10,240
are only contagion.

1450
01:55:10,240 --> 01:55:12,440
You know, we've talked on the container, nothing

1451
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:13,920
goes in or out of the body, right?

1452
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:16,640
The body has to reproduce it through induction.

1453
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:18,000
And there's plenty written about this.

1454
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,800
It's just not acknowledged as it should be.

1455
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:24,240
In other words, if you have a pandemic or a disease

1456
01:55:24,240 --> 01:55:29,800
that's contagious going around, you have to have the same format

1457
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:37,040
as the person who is carrying it to be subject to that infection.

1458
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:40,520
If you change the way you're formatted, let's say,

1459
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:42,720
I have something called, or anybody can make

1460
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:45,840
a acquiesce argentum, which is a silver solution,

1461
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:47,360
or even soda.

1462
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:49,880
If you take soda, you know, baking soda and water, anything,

1463
01:55:49,880 --> 01:55:53,200
if you have a certain diet, right?

1464
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:55,360
You will not be subject to that infection,

1465
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:57,240
unless it's extremely virulent, like the type

1466
01:55:57,240 --> 01:55:59,360
that if you contract, it kills you in a few hours.

1467
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,200
That's different.

1468
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:04,680
So the reason why they were able to pull this off,

1469
01:56:04,680 --> 01:56:07,960
as they did, is because you have these medical practitioners,

1470
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:11,200
by the way, they get a doctor's degree,

1471
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:14,280
and they get a state license, and they open up a local practicing

1472
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:14,920
clinic, right?

1473
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:18,080
You've seen them all over the place, all your life.

1474
01:56:18,080 --> 01:56:21,280
And their whole mode is to-- they don't know what they want

1475
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:21,480
to do.

1476
01:56:21,480 --> 01:56:24,480
They have no inspiration, so they just become a doctor.

1477
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:27,280
And they know that if they fill up their office

1478
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:31,880
with appointments, they get $150 to $500 per head per day,

1479
01:56:31,880 --> 01:56:33,960
and it's easy money.

1480
01:56:33,960 --> 01:56:38,240
And occasionally, if they can't diagnose someone,

1481
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:41,920
it's a writer prescription, because that's all they can do,

1482
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:44,320
is they say, oh, you need to find a specialist,

1483
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:47,200
because you have some viral infection.

1484
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:51,280
And they brush off people that they can't diagnose

1485
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:52,800
as having a viral infection.

1486
01:56:52,800 --> 01:56:54,920
And they've been doing this now for almost 30 years,

1487
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:58,560
and people have been buying it.

1488
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:02,160
So you can have something that's completely very simple,

1489
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:04,640
allergic, because of toxin, or whatever.

1490
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:06,440
And they tell you it's a viral infection.

1491
01:57:06,440 --> 01:57:07,760
Oh, and everybody agrees.

1492
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:08,800
So they plant.

1493
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:11,440
They created fertile ground for the virus

1494
01:57:11,440 --> 01:57:15,840
to be the new bookie man, based on these worthless medical

1495
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:19,640
practitioners known as local doctors.

1496
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:23,440
Well, fair enough, believe it or not, we're almost out of time here.

1497
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:25,040
And I believe it.

1498
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:32,040
I know you don't mean to say that there is not a actual contagion.

1499
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:34,960
It is, but it is not as described yet.

1500
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:37,000
Not as a contagion.

1501
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,760
Let's just put it this way, and this is for sure.

1502
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:42,480
It's never some vial in a lab or whatever.

1503
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:46,440
The people that actually know how to do it are mostly dead.

1504
01:57:46,440 --> 01:57:51,240
They kind of sequestered the information 100 years ago.

1505
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:52,920
And the way you create a pandemic

1506
01:57:52,920 --> 01:57:55,640
has nothing to do with laboratories with frozen samples.

1507
01:57:55,640 --> 01:57:59,960
And I'm not going to discuss that publicly ever.

1508
01:57:59,960 --> 01:58:01,240
So--

1509
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:02,640
Well, there you have it.

1510
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:07,280
And the Greek, I say again, always unique.

1511
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:10,320
And I'm not just trying to rhyme, my friend,

1512
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:13,520
but this was a fascinating two hours.

1513
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:18,480
And I appreciate you taking the time to speak with me

1514
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:22,240
because a lot of information has been packed into these two hours.

1515
01:58:22,240 --> 01:58:24,920
So anyway, guys, I am really a celly.

1516
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:26,440
All of you are indeed the effect.

1517
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:28,080
Please support the network.

1518
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:29,520
What else can I say?

1519
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:30,720
I'm not a good pitchman.

1520
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:34,600
But if you gained something from this,

1521
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:39,680
