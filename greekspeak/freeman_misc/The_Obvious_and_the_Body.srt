[Music]

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Beaming out across the galaxy.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is where conspiracy on the wall side

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
means the perspective of a lifetime.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This is the freeze-on-the-roost, free man.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
[Music]

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Well, the Francis Crick Institute just announced

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
that they are going to begin DNA altering.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's right, this is going to make the UK the very first country

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to start producing GMO children.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now, it is currently illegal to implant these genetically modified embryos

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
into women creating designer babies.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But as it is now, legislation has been passed, DNA altering

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
is going to begin occurring in the UK at the Francis Crick Institute.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now, when you start to tell people things like this,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
they tell you, well, I think you're watching too many episodes

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
of the X-Files, and people only hear what their own bias

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
will allow them to hear.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And they will throw this off into the fringe zone

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and never accept it into their real world concerns.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, today we're going to talk to the Greek,

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and we're going to offer some practical information,

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
not opinions.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We're going to look into all levels of our being and our media.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We're going to analyze the flip side coins of Alex Jones versus Fox News.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And the most important part that I want you to take from this,

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
tonight we're talking with the Greek.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And the reason he is coming to speak to you now is because

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
if you know something and you say nothing,

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
you are just as guilty.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So please welcome to the show, the Greek, as we lay out for you

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
some of this amazing research that he has been working on.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Welcome to the show.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, well, thank you very much for having me, Freeman.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's great to be here with you.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, we're going to focus some on how do we change our world today?

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And we're going to just get into this idea right now.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay, there's so much information coming out at people.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And we're starting their senses.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Nobody knows what to think about.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And we have what now is known as the alternative media.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But I saw that immediately as a flip side of the same coin.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Everybody's still focusing on the same issues and the same false reality.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And yet they want to say what we have the supposing opinion.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So therefore it's change.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Well, you see people naturally have a desire to learn.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's what separates us from the animals.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We require training where we have to dedicate a certain amount of energy

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
to learn and get input about the environment around us.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And especially how we should think and speak and behave.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And this energy is being dumped or damped out by what I call the dummy load.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's what most of the media is.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And notice it's just done on a weekly basis.

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
There's a weekly story.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's like what happened about, you know, we were supposed to end society three times already last year, you know, with comments and financial collapses.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And none of that seems to happen, but people seem to ignore it and go on to the next dummy load.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So we need to get more practical when I say we meaning because we're all here together.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And start really paying attention.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I think mentioned before the most occulted and the most secret knowledge is actually discovering the obvious.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
So we need to start looking there perhaps.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Isn't that the truth?

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I mean, everything I have ever said to anyone is straight data of resource backed up for you to find.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And yet I'm constantly bombarded with, oh my god, I can't believe you think this.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And I'm like, it's in the news. It is real.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You know, I explained how we sent a Doritos commercial to Earth's a major using the icecat antenna array.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
And I'm getting messages, well, you had me with your information until you brought up that we sent a Doritos commercial to Earth's a major.

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Obviously, you're just, you know, full of it.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And I find that people won't even hear things that don't relate to their own personal bias.

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
And then they come back and say, well, you said this.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
And I'm always like, I never said that. You heard that.

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah. And also, I don't think anyone on Earth's a major will really get that commercial because the type of wave provocation they're doing will not make it there.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's another thing about how people consider the state of technology that they're in as another form of deception or delusion because the quality of what's been given or portrayed as high technology or even like you said, the news is qualitatively very low.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And people just accept it.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yeah. Well, okay. So for 20 years, we've had alternative media host that let's use Alex Jones as an example since I'm friends with it. Well, I know him and I feel like I can talk about him.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,000
As simply being the flip side of the same coin, when 9/11 occurred, I said, don't freak out. This is all for your reaction.

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And in a way, I was predicting the Alex Jones type movement in saying that fanatics are going to rise at this time. And I mean, for 20 years, this guy's been the alarm bell saying it's the end of the world and people are all taking this into their soul and acting on this planet in a very skit-soid manner because of all of this information that's being bombarded on him.

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah, and that has to do with things that I discuss, like for example, what's fit and proper, what's lawful and unlawful. And if anyone hasn't noticed, the planet right now is under an unlawful society.

78
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And this is just to go back to Alex Jones. If it were a lawful society, people take what others say very seriously. And if someone is going to preach doom and gloom, especially and give a time period when these things should happen and they do not.

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Those people won't be walking around too much longer. They're held accountable in life and these life and death matters. And what's going on is because it's an unlawful society, people allow this to go on.

80
00:06:41,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Well, let's talk about that then. Let's understand our laws, legal advice and contracts and try to figure out where it went wrong because, you know, if we want to go back to the birth of America, Freemasons coming over with their goddess Columbia and establishing justice on planet Earth.

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You know, let's start there because I mean, people don't even know, first of all, that their nation was founded by the secret society. And they don't know that so much of what they're coming comes through this also religious programming.

82
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I mean, I don't want to jump topics too quick, but we're looking at laws legal and advice. We might as well also throw in there the clock because I mean, it was a regulation in the small towns in the back in the day in the 16, 1300s, 1100s where the church bell had to be able to be heard by the next town.

83
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And the towns would be determined the spacing by being able to hear this chime that sets you to the clock and folks. If you go around and look right now, you will see on every one of your cathedrals, that's where you get the town clock.

84
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This is where time comes from. So if we want to go legal and time, uh, agree with, let's, let's look at that world.

85
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah, and there's many levels to that as well. Maybe we could squeeze that in enthusiastically, the other levels as well. Like real quick, the church bell ringing.

86
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
If you look at the etymology of the word church, it came from Sirc, which meant the ancient circus. And it was borrowed and synchronized from various religions.

87
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The reason they're wearing these bells in public is because of the human sacrifices that were being done in public. So that wow, it's like, what did he just say? Yes, we could tie that back together again.

88
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But regarding law and timekeeping and all that, when we say law, I'm not talking about traffic law, attacks law or these things like that. I'm speaking about your basis for operating in the world.

89
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You know, what do you eat? What's fit and proper to eat or lawful to eat? What's fit and proper to wear or lawful to wear? How do you raise a family? How do you do business?

90
00:08:47,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You know, all of these things are your laws, like laws of physics describe the natural world when we say laws for mankind is that it affects or it's the impetus to how he will behave. All of that law comes from your deity.

91
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And I know it sounds kind of strange and many people wanted to bait me on this and when they do, for example, someone says, well, I'm an atheist.

92
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't have a God. So how do you deal with that? And I said, that's easy. Do you believe in the laws of the state? And they usually say, yes, I said, well, then the state is your God and April 1 is your holiday. Next, it's very simple. It's part of the operating system.

93
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Now, the legal aspect that we sense in the Western world today, when I say sense because it's very convoluted, you can only get a sense of it. If you actually put your handle and study the legal system, you'll see it's what they call legal based on legal fictions, representations.

94
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So when you look at the Western world, especially, if you look at the American Constitution and the preamble within the first preamble, it states that the people are to establish something called justice.

95
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's like, wow, what is justice?

96
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It seems to be a statue of a woman blindfolded carrying scales. And if we do some research on that, we will find that is the revival of the ancient goddess religion has nothing to do with law, never did, never will.

97
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And essentially, the people from Europe were coming west to escape justice because it was destroying them.

98
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So if you want to know something bad is going to happen, it's very easy to determine that when you see this term called justice arising in society.

99
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, let's talk about her for a minute because I was really the first expert on the goddess Columbia.

100
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes. And it was my second film and I laid it out there and I explained her connections to the pentagram, her connections throughout the different goddesses of Diana, Minerva, and Anna.

101
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And what I found also the connection with this pentagram, then it was a year later that Dan Brown came forward with the Da Vinci code and kind of bonded the idea of the pentagram with the goddess but never gave any explanation, which I had done.

102
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And so, yeah, let's talk about Columbia and this goddess justice and because I've asked Freemasons and people at the nation's capital, who is that standing on top of the capital dome and no one knows?

103
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yeah, the thing is also we have to throw in here believe it or not, there is a parallel society to this materialistic human animal type, you know, materialistic world that we look at sentient beings.

104
00:11:38,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And this is the spiritual realm and it is a multitude. And here's the thing, you know, if we're going to say that everyone that came before us that memorialized information, what they call the holy rites of the world, even in the mythological texts, if they're all just a bunch of ignorant savages, and because we have iPhones and we can, you know, spin a prop and fly in an airplane, where more advanced and we should ignore everything that came before us is quite foolish.

105
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:20,000
If we look at all the information that's been memorialized by what we might call from the ancients far reaching back even to the local, let's say, thousand years ago, what's been memorialized about the spiritual realm seemingly has been ignored and that there is a mass plurality.

106
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And yes, there are many gods, there is a hierarchy of gods just like in the military, there is a hierarchy from the private, you know, boots on the ground and listed guy all the way up to the colonels, generals and the emperor.

107
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:43,000
This is how the spiritual world is set up in other words, the military ranking system on the earth is not unique. It was actually conveyed from the spiritual realm.

108
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That's why you'll see almost every country in the world has a very similar ranking system.

109
00:12:48,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Now, within the ranking system of the spiritual realm, especially if we take heed to what's been memorialized, it seems like these lower level what we call ranking spiritual entities are interacting with mankind and have been for a very long time.

110
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
And it just so happens that one of the predominant, inspirational spiritual entities on the earth happens to be female.

111
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's not that it's because someone might say, well, Greek, that's an anti-female feminine sentiment. It's not. It says if you were, let's say robbed by someone wearing a ski mask, then you caught the assailant an hour later, you pulled the mask off.

112
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's a woman. If you say I was robbed by a woman, does that make you anti-feminine? No, it just so happens to be a female in this case, you see.

113
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And this is also memorialized in the ancient texts. Her priesthood is male and a lot of people have misunderstood as being a patriarchal system because of the male priesthood that she has.

114
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And when I say she, there's actually more than one goddess as well in name and in attribute.

115
00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But this is a long-winded preface before getting into the goddess religion because you'll see there's the concept of ISIS, Colombia, DK, in ancient Greece.

116
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:15,000
There's the Statue of Liberty, there's justice, Lady Liberty, all these things. They harken back to this very similar type of system.

117
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah, and it's being carried forth in near secret, but yet at the same time our capital is the district of Colombia.

118
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yes. You know, there's not a single person I know out there that ever asked the question, well, who is Colombia? I think I was the first.

119
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah, probably. And even though it's pretty obvious though wherever you go, you do see it, but no one wants to discuss it as you would have been probably the first to do it, as you say.

120
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But what needs to be looked at is very simply when you're brought into, let's say, the paradigm in the law or legal system is justice, for example.

121
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
And you ever noticed, it's in the language, if you listen to what's being said, you are brought to justice, you serve justice.

122
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:17,000
There's a miscarriage of justice. And where is the law in that, you see? Because when we study the history of it, these goddess religions impart great cruelty to the societies that adopt them.

123
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Now, it sounds kind of harsh, but not making this stuff up. You know, this is a fact. Typically, the societies that have adopted these, again, I'll repeat myself, adopted these goddess religions, end up falling into situations of great cruelty and apathy, and a level where humans intuitively sense things shouldn't really be this way.

124
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But yet, your common citizen or plebeian or person will say, or man or woman will say, I want justice. We need to bring him to justice. Well, if you keep asking for it, you're going to get what you're asking for.

125
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And henceforth, a lot of the complaining and bickering and whining about the justice system. There is nothing wrong with the justice system when they speak about corruption and cruelty and privatization and monetization.

126
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And all this stuff going on, that is inherent in that goddess religion or the revival of it.

127
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Well, so we've made these social contracts with these people. And really, as you're saying in our more, more atheistic mindset, I mean, we are controlled by daest, the free Masonic order, the orders in charge, you know, you have to accept that you have to state that you believe in a higher power, a deity.

128
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But yet, when we're looking at a Masonic lodge, you will see the Quran, the Torah, or the Bible all on their altar. Yet free Masonry has all the trappings of religion.

129
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So this obviously is a king underpinning of why we have a goddess, Columbia, in their religious belief system. But also just the idea that this religious programming, this tradition is,

130
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:17,000
is idolized and, you know, we're like, we're not going to allow somebody in that isn't in the club that believes in religious programming.

131
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And, you know, so let's look at where their mindset comes from in this religious programming. We already got into the idea of the time and we'll get deeper into that as well as that.

132
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Sure, but in terms of the religious programming, it's beyond programming, it's more of the operating system and use the computer model, you know, the actual machine we call computers these days.

133
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:48,000
When you first start one up, you don't install a program, you install an operating system. And then the program and then the files.

134
00:17:48,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The operating system of let's say nation building or nations or groups of people is that their government has a patron deity and you will find this throughout the entire history of mankind.

135
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What's going, what's unique and what's going on today is that that concept has been brushed not only under the rug, but out of the room and into oblivion.

136
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:20,000
No one is discussing what patron deity this nation has and this is the actual part of the operating system that you mentioned the Freemasons.

137
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,000
They tend to be, you know, like we like it said, a secret society and that they hold certain things in knowledge.

138
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:38,000
They do have this in their structure, the concept that each nation has a patron deity, but they don't discuss it and they can't cognitively recall it, but they do sense it.

139
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And part of speaking out publicly is that people go to a lot of these secret societies thinking that they actually have some deep knowledge and they don't anymore.

140
00:18:49,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And I know this might be like kicking them in the in the in between their legs, but what I mean by that is, you know, someone like Henry Ford, who started a car company on his own, do you think you can take his great grandson and give him all the resources and he can start a car company?

141
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Probably not. The people that originally formed a lot of these secret societies were very unique and very talented in that field.

142
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And the people that come after them are just simply going through the motions. If that makes any sense.

143
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh, absolutely. You know, I don't for a second believe that George W. Bush or even Jeb Bush is a devout Christian.

144
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And you know, what does that even mean? Can you can you get it?

145
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Sure. Well, this is a general thing like you mentioned in the Freemasonic lodge. They have the various holy rites of the corresponding religions. Let's say and I have made this statement and have been making it and have not been proven wrong for years now that there is not a religion on the planet bar none.

146
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That does what is allegedly in the text that they subscribe to.

147
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And this is the truth and it sounds shocking on its face. But it's true if you look at it now religion just means something you do regularly like if you you could be if you brush your teeth and tie your shoes every day that is a religious act that just means something you do regularly.

148
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And because religion tends to tie in with a spiritual side of humanity or the gods, let's say that ties in back where you get your law and what you do based from your God, but people are not acknowledging this.

149
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And this this type of discussion is typically not popular because again using the computer model.

150
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:38,000
If you're going to discuss computers, you might discuss like this program, how you like the how you interface with it or the color of the web page, but no one wants to discuss the machine code, the C++.

151
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You see, and this is what we're discussing is the machine code or the code behind what we call not just modern, but civilization at large.

152
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And this is also very, probably a good point or very opportune to go into what's called timekeeping because it is very important.

153
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So with that, maybe we should mention that there is anomalies in people believing that the calendar is a timepiece.

154
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Right, how many times have you heard, you know, ask someone what day it is and they emphatically tell you something between January and December and something between Monday and Friday with a number thrown in as if that is actually a timepiece.

155
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It is not what the people on the planet today are using as a calendar is not a timepiece.

156
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You cannot reckon time with that calendar.

157
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What I mean by that is if let's say you celebrate a birthday, you'll notice that it's on a different day of the week every year.

158
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What that calendar simply is, it is a work schedule for papal subjects.

159
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'll just say one more time. It is simply a work schedule.

160
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
That's why it's called the work week and the weekend. You cannot keep time with it.

161
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But just like a multiple choice question and answer test, they give you four months out of the year that similarly to note the correct correspondence of timekeeping.

162
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
For example, September means seven. Octo, like octopus means eight. Nova means nine and decenn means ten.

163
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
But everyone is writing December is 12 November as 11 and so on and so forth.

164
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So the way the time is being kept is part of the operating system as well.

165
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And this is a recent phenomenon that the entire world is under this papal work schedule, which is pretty fascinating to see in itself. How they've pulled that off.

166
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yeah, definitely. Do you have any thoughts on the fact that we now have a Jesuit Pope?

167
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Not much because here's the thing. What's interesting is if you look at Christianity as you brought up and with the modern Catholic system and just to make a quick slice of what that really is, first of all, you will not find Christianity in the biblical text whatsoever.

168
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And second of all, the biblical text, which was, which is delivered to the world today based on what's called the King James version is not a translation of what is known as the scriptures that are preserved in Hebrew and Greek, correspondingly meaning old and New Testament.

169
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:18,000
What is called the old and New Testament, which will not find that in the text either. That is subtitles that have been put in after have yet to be translated to this date.

170
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So what they have is a version that has been custom tailored and basically the world still does not know what is held in those scriptures unless you have done private research on your own.

171
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Now back to the Christianity and the Jesuit Pope, what is called Christianity is actually started by someone called Simon Magus around the first century AD because there were things going on in the world that no one can explain things that were done in secret.

172
00:23:46,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Because the reason I'm saying they were done in secret is because they were actually public events. So go figure. And they try to syncretize through syncretism. They try to explain modern day events in their time by putting together all of these, let's call them pagan religions from all over the world in concepts and traditions.

173
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And they formed early Christianity like for example if anyone does any referencing to texts that are preserved these are secular texts about the Christians being thrown to the lions in the Colosseum.

174
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Okay. If you go look at the texts that are preserved and what they were actually doing because they would actually announce a decree before the game start just like they sing the national anthem before baseball game.

175
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:48,000
And in those decrees before they allegedly threw the quote unquote Christians into the lions in the Roman Colosseums you will see that in the decree it states that the reason they are thrown into the lions is because they are atheists.

176
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:58,000
In other words they have an unidentifiable God this is really bizarre but you know this is I'm not making this up you can anyone wants to really do the legwork and discover this.

177
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Now what's interesting is that the syncretization of all of the religions then solidified around with the time of Constantine and up until the first century AD and you have what's called the Catholic church which means universal it's like we swept everything that we can and brought it up into one big pile.

178
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:27,000
And we've mixed it all together and we syncretized it and this is what it is it has no bearing on the biblical text whatsoever.

179
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah I don't think many people are reading in Greek or Hebrew in these days.

180
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Well yeah and even the thing you know what's interesting when you do read in Hebrew or Greek or even in English to understand the text it doesn't say that you need to learn any particular language it states that you have to have the ability to perceive with eyes and ears.

181
00:25:46,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Okay so on that thought and to take this to kind of back to the beginning and on to another level when talking about the 9/11 programming and the idea of the alternative media then saying it's an inside job it's an inside job.

182
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You know I was I was quickly one of the people saying no you're you're throwing yourself into the fire they are going to use your own homework to bring America to a war crimes tribunal.

183
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:31,000
And so with everyone that is out shouting the government did a 9/11 they are therefore throwing their own nation under the bus without looking at the whole picture.

184
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:47,000
And I feel that you know it began in the Middle East it's going to come to the Middle East it's in the Middle East right now and with America coming down and this potential of being called forward for universal war crimes.

185
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:55,000
What do you see going on in the Middle East why is this such an important time in place right now.

186
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Oh from a geopolitical and from a large let's say looking at the forest through the trees where you know we're going above the forest looking at the entire forest you'll see through history and I don't mean history like we started off alternative media just focusing every week on what happened.

187
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:27,000
But looking at history in thousand year chunks let's say or millennial or ages even in secular history you will see that is stated that civilization started in the Middle East.

188
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And there's a lot of preaching and teaching and all this stuff about where in the end times well we're really not but we are because it's not really it hasn't been defined properly.

189
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:59,000
What's interesting about everything starting like grandma said what goes around comes around it is established through history that everything started in the Middle East and things are going to sort of wrap up in the Middle East and what you're seeing right now is the precursor to the formation of a Middle East union.

190
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Unlike the EU see the EU is also a union of nations it's going to be very different than how the EU is operating today but just to give the EU meaning European European Union as an example.

191
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Like I said anytime you preach doom and gloom you'll be popular and when they were preaching doom and gloom during World War Two with all of the bombing and terror raids that were being done in Europe it was very convincing to say it's the end of the world and obviously it's not when I say world meaning man's rule on earth right.

192
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So what had happened during World War Two was like the pulling out of teeth out of very nationalistic governments because you can't have let's say ten nations forming a union if they're very if they're independent and nationalistic and don't want to work with each other so what people are witnessing is is that going on in the Middle East at the moment.

193
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:19,000
So Middle East union in the future yes and there are many many many details regarding that and it's not very difficult to see just as if for example if someone is trained in chemistry and you're not and you walk in and speak with this individual he might say well don't touch that or don't mix this with that you're like why they're just too perfectly clear liquids what could go wrong right.

194
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:47,000
So if you're studied in a certain field you then you then you can impart that information you see but most people seem to have wanting to get stuck in this myopic narrow or modern we can't we don't need to look at what was written before us and by the way when you look at history and other languages you know that every civilization before its fall or when it's when it was in the period of its downfall which could have taken decades or century.

195
00:29:47,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Always called themselves modern the Babylonians called themselves modern in their texts at one point before their fall so did the Egyptians so did the Greeks so did the Romans interesting parallel absolutely well in this modern age we are taking in tons and tons of data and you were talking about this info dump that you know this is one of the biggest problems I see in our current trying to change the world is the world.

196
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Is that we just don't even know what to focus on anymore and we get data data data and every day there's another thing that you can sweat and Skype and you know track and Facebook about social media all over the place and it's just going hey wire Greek and so yeah.

197
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:52,000
So I think we can talk about that sure a real simple way to do that is just a sidetrack here for a minute go right back to it let's say we got a job working in the sewer right so the only job you get it pays real well do you skinny dip and drink the water or do you put on a full hazmat suit with breathing tanks.

198
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Probably the second part okay so anyone that does any research in society will see that it's basically a sewer every aspect whether it's science you know within that system.

199
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Medical legal religious it's all really bad it couldn't be any worse you know like the frog being boiled kind of thing and everything is a little bit worse today than it was yesterday but not as bad as it's going to be tomorrow it's a very gradual.

200
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Downslide that plateaus okay so it so are you going to drink the water not really or the cool later whatever you want to call it so the what that means then if you're going into the sewer wearing protection.

201
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:53,000
You're actually setting yourself in part apart from the medium you're not you creating a buffer zone or a boundary layer and you walk away from it and an example for this just to fast track this thought is for example during an election season people are always bickering about following political leaders and whatever and how the government is bad and we can change it or whatever you notice there is no change when people get involved.

202
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:11,000
But this is an assurance that when they do have let's say an election and by the way voters don't elect electors elect the word vote means that you are vowing that whatever the electors do you'll stand behind it okay that's another that's like a bombshell right there but.

203
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But if people want to change let's say the way their government operates if no one at all this has to be an all or nothing if no one showed up to vote now to one person at all not even the crickets okay within 72 hours all of the government buildings local state city and federal will be empty why and then anyone could walk in and take the position why because they're going to say okay the gig is up the next thing is we're in deep trouble so we better leave now well we're still alive.

204
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:57,000
You see not violent revolution not protesting not all the stuff you hear you know just shut up and withdraw and then it goes away and now you can rebuild it that is the ultimate peaceful side of the perception of what is going on.

205
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I definitely see that and I was introduced to the sylistine prophecies by James redfield and it really described what was going on in my own personal view as life had swept me up and presented me an experience that I could have never imagined or thought up on my own.

206
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And at this moment I realized oh my god the world is alive and working in my favor but I have to be open to the opportunities and the possibilities that are being given to me and I have to be in a happy mindset friendly and and agreeable for miracles and angels to enter into my life.

207
00:33:44,000 --> 00:34:13,000
And I found that if the world followed these simple insights of connecting with beauty therefore finding your inner peace and then projecting this out as an energetic form of your soul that that will attract the right energies coming back and you will find miracles going on in your life where you're like wow I would have never thought to do this this is perfect.

208
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Wow how did this even happen?

209
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Well what's interesting about that it sounds wonderful but in order to get to the manifestation point we need specifics and there are certain generalities that work like most people that operate what they call it automobile don't know how to rebuild the engine but they know if they put the key here and push this pedal and turn that they are going to get the job done.

210
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:51,000
And when we're discussing help from the spiritual side most people have completely devoid of it like for example when people say angels and gods they are under the misconception that all of that is benevolent.

211
00:34:51,000 --> 00:35:11,000
And if you are not benevolent you are always going to show as being benevolent you see it's kind of like if you're someone is going to counterfeit a note do you use a crayon and draw a quick doodle of Ben Franklin and write 100 in the corner with a crayon or do you try to make it look like the original note as close as possible you see.

212
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:23,000
So mankind has fallen for a lot of this and we do need specifics and these specifics are part of what's going to be coming in the future regarding the spiritual realm.

213
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Well using the concept of the idea counter-fitting you know I would say at this time in space that money is the deity of most people right now.

214
00:35:34,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Sure and you know most people refuse to research things that they established as things to be worshiped like for example like we mentioned earlier you will not find anyone that categorizes themselves as having a particular religious faith is ever researching what that faith is supposed to be based on because if they do they retract and say I can't call myself a Christian or a Muslim or a Jew or Buddhist or a Hindu or whatever because I've researched what this is based on and I just can't do it see people.

215
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I don't want to idolize and worship things and once you they get into that realm of worship and idolization they no longer want to look at anything about it and then it's very easy to have it that system debased like for example all of the religions are debased currently all of the money is debased you know if you if you tell anyone this is fiat currency they say well I don't care as long as I go to the store and get something for it.

216
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:55,000
You see so there's this worship of things that makes mankind retract from using is cognitive rational ability and then falls into these debased things if you ask people why do they go to particular temple or religion they say I don't care I just like there because I have a good time I feel loved or whatever you know so the worship of money is an interesting concept because what is actually being used as money today is clearly not money.

217
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It is just a means of exchange unlawful means of exchange right because if you're going to do barter or exchange it should be of equal value and no one seems to care simply because they worship it and anything people worship for example even people that go to these better universities they don't care what the professor says they just want to say I went to an Ivy League so they can be worshiped right if someone walks into the room and says I have an Ivy.

218
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:53,000
I have an Ivy League education how dare you question me about anything you see so there's many things that are worshiped in society and money being the base of it and money is not the root of all evil it's the love of money and it's sort of like a joke that the spiritual wrong because they do have a sense of humor apparently is playing on humanity they probably said let's take money away from them and watch how much they still want it just to show that it's the love of money you see.

219
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:21,000
So these things are pretty much the money the religion all these aspects are debased there is nothing backing them up anymore and almost everything that mankind is dealing with right now is debased it has no basis whether it's scientific medical and so on and the money being the root of it because it's very hard to operate in society without it and by the way I've also said in the past

220
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:41,000
you hear a lot of these economic people making comments on the economy and money not a one of them ever says there's a difference between lawful and unlawful money and what the money is actually based on if it's not based on anything it is based on something because you see numbers and things flying around

221
00:38:41,000 --> 00:39:04,000
again escapes pretty much everyone but what I've said is that money just is portable land that's all it is because in a perfect society you'll be able to gardener everything you need from what's under your feet but when you travel and go to someone else's land you can't bring your land with you so you bring precious metals and or something that is based on representation of the land.

222
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:14,000
So these things are very simple concepts but again once they're thrown into the realm of worship no one wants to look at it.

223
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Well this also has brought us to the level of waste and planned obsolescence and the way that we are trying to make more money than we are you know things we're making more things than we need so that there's more empty houses than there are homeless

224
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:41,000
and we have this built in planned obsolescence which is only due to money you I mean what kind of idiot world would create such a thing.

225
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Sure well the thing about the homes is interesting is let's look at the western world remember we said what goes around comes around most of the western world meaning this hemisphere let's call America.

226
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:01,000
How did it start it started with slave labor and stolen land guess how it's going to kind of wrap up slave labor and stolen land.

227
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:19,000
So it's just these things are very simple you know like what I mean by slave labor is back in the 80s Ford was a motor company was hiring line workers for 20 to $28 per hour in the 80s right now they're hiring them for 10 or 12 an hour.

228
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Okay yeah so minimum wage according to lawful perspective should be around 23 bucks an hour about 2250 right now.

229
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Okay so and stolen land what I mean by that is there hasn't been a legal or lawful foreclosure in the US in the past 80 years it's all presumptive and people go for it.

230
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:49,000
So boy these are these are topics that people just don't want to look at simple to understand you know simple doesn't mean easy does it.

231
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Not usually no usually as you're saying the obvious is some of the hardest stuff to take in.

232
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Oh yeah you know here's an example throw this in maybe about the obvious you ever notice when you heat or cooler room the heat goes to the ceiling and the cold goes to the floor all year round.

233
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:19,000
So you have a hot head and cold feet but if you go out in nature it's hot in the valley you go up to the mountain it gets colder and if you go in an airplane towards the sun which is supposed to be a heat source it gets colder and colder and colder.

234
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Because could it be that in all natural biological systems cold rises and heat descends but in all artificial type situations you have the opposite so where are the people asking their air conditioning and heating engineers why don't you design systems that have an ascending cold and a descending heat like in nature.

235
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Because right now we're getting hot heads and cold feet I have never thought of that and how obvious is that I'm sitting here exactly in that condition I've got my slippers on trying to keep my cold feet warm and yeah I got a hot head.

236
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Doesn't make any sense so why would it be that way even.

237
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Well if you want to just give a quick slice for those that tend to be technically or scientifically inclined let's say whenever you have chemical decomposition or things being destroyed or exploded you have the heat that rises in the cold at descends but whenever you have a chemical agglomeration where things come together and build like natural growth you have a cold that rises in a heat that descends like for example if you called a medical person and said I'm not feeling well and they say well how do you know.

238
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Well my head is hot my feet are cold you're not feeling well but wait a second I thought heat supposed to rise and cold supposed to descend but you see an all natural biological systems whether it's the earth the planets a dog a cat a plant or you the heat becomes dense and descends and the cold becomes verified and lighter and it rises and no one is paying attention no one is going to follow that.

239
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Yeah but why because it's right in front of us the same what the time keeping schedule you know here's the thing you know the for for thousands of year the ancient.

240
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:35,000
kept time using the sun the moon in the stars be and we're very precise and very accurate like even today if you want to convey an accurate time event well by the way time is just the recordation of events so whenever you hear about time travel or this or time being a dimension that's all bunk if there is time travel it's traveling to a past event it's not time travel now Greek that's semantics but think about it all right so for thousands of years people settled the

241
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:48,000
debts with the full moon which is the new moon today don't you get a moonfully built yeah and the day starts at high noon like before the electronic banking conventions the banks if you made a deposit

242
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:57,000
after noon it was counted as the next day yes some people say after two o'clock or whatever but typically that's how it works and even this if you go to your time keeping

243
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:14,000
authorities in Greenwich or in the observatory in Colorado Springs I believe in their website they used to have a since I've started speaking about this I think they've taken it down but you can still find it under Julian calendar date that define the calendar and they tell you in their time keeping

244
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:29,000
the for is it tell you that for astronomical and scientific purposes the day starts at solar noon but for the people it's civil midnight now wait a second that is such a put down what I mean by that is when dictionaries in the

245
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:39,000
19th century were becoming coalesced to be put out into the public they didn't quite know how to define words because you see a dictionary doesn't give you the meaning of the word it gives you the

246
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:54,000
definition of the word how you should pronounce it so you seems like you know what you're talking about that's why when you look up a word in a dictionary it always shows you the phonetic spelling first you know like the upside down e means an a and all this other stuff but if you want to know what words really mean you

247
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:03,000
need to look up at a mology but back to the dictionary when they first started writing dictionaries they didn't know how to define words so like for example when you looked up in an old

248
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:17,000
word oats it's what they feed horses in England but it's the staple of the people in Scotland what a put down right so the scientific community and what you want to call them

249
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:26,000
illuminati or secret societies or the people that are in the know know that the the papal works schedule is not a timepiece

250
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:41,000
yeah webster was a free nason and he actually encoded many things into the dictionary like the bible that would one thing should lead you to another you know see this reference that it would lead you into this code so

251
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,000
you know even the dictionary was written by secret society

252
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:59,000
oh yeah and all the time you know how you know it's very important inside of free masonry as well yeah oh sure sure and that that's how you know your concept of equinoxes you know equal day equal night that's the same johns inside of free masonry

253
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:08,000
yeah and that is also erroneous because the term equinox equine meaning equal knocks meaning night means that there's an equal measurement that needs to be taken at night

254
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:22,000
we can discuss that later the real equinoxes and really freak people out it's very subtle so the equinoxes erroneous and even what they're calling solstices are erroneous because if you even look in their own

255
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:41,000
documentations like weather websites what they're calling the solstice you'll find like this year the day was still what they were calling solstice was about two minutes shorter than the then the then the day that would come after that so they're not acting but no one's checking right no no one wants to look at these things

256
00:46:41,000 --> 00:47:00,000
so because it's part of tradition but you know the time keeping the secrets and the secret societies all of these things are linked together and these secret societies all they all they do it's it's kind of like the sewer analogy they kind of look at the behavior of the masses

257
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:24,000
and they say do we really want to share this information and they say no so they keep it to themselves to a certain degree but here's the thing well then what they've done is they've removed the eyes of the people and then blame them for being blind so it's a catch 22 you see so you know the information should go to mankind and it will not now because there's a right time in a place for everything right

258
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:51,000
and but in the near future there will be a time where people will start to look at what things are based on and referencing them more properly absolutely etymology is an amazing study you know when you start to realize where things come from what they mean your whole language changes you start to understand the legal system in a whole new light you know why human being is classified as monster or things you know

259
00:47:51,000 --> 00:48:20,000
or nice you know you're a nice guy this is a nice show people are nice you know if you look up that word and I don't like to give the meaning of it because for some reason when people look it up on their own it has to have like 70% more punch to it and like they don't want to believe you when you tell them but the word nice if you look it up in an etymological dictionary it means foolish senseless stupid huh so yes that's just it we are we are really ignorant and and words are power and we know this

260
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:49,000
well what they are is the action to it's the pre action to action just like for example in the military and in an analogy you can have a commander sitting in one continent giving a word to someone on the ground in another continent and then the action is conducted so they are very powerful in that way it's communication and just like the military before you attack you make sure that the opposition cannot communicate amongst themselves now if you actually look at how society is on earth

261
00:48:49,000 --> 00:49:00,000
if you think people are communicating you're not paying attention because they're not one of the first things that has been taken away is people's ability to communicate effectively

262
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Amen, Amen. Well we open this show with the idea that the Francis Crick Institute is now legally altering DNA in embryos and opening the door to designer babies

263
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:28,000
and so I would like to close out this hour with you with the idea of the satanic view if you will the idea of stark materialism sure how we've gotten there and what that's going to lead to.

264
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Well there's two aspects to that when we say something let's say the mark of the beast or the end times or Satan or the Antichrist we in order to prevent those topics or notions from being debased we have to go back to where those things came from

265
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:57,000
and obviously they came from what's called the biblical text so we have to go adhere to what is memorializing the biblical text first before we start making up porky pies and things like that because then we are just drifting off into law, law land.

266
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:10,000
If we go back to the text where we get the concept of Satan we will find that the word Satan just means adversary like if I say black you say white if I say ugly you say pretty that means you're an adversary to me.

267
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:37,000
This is a cosmic thing now what's interesting is when we look at the ancient text and this has nothing to do with opinion of what you believe in that the entire world is run by a cosmic adversary and for example Satan just means adversary for example court TV if you turned on court TV in Jerusalem in the modern he break tongue the prosecutor is introduced as ha satan.

268
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,560
So it just means the adversary.

269
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:48,100
So what is interesting when we look at the ancient texts regarding Satanism, this cosmic

270
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:52,800
deity or entity known as the adversary, and he does have a name by the way, which is

271
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:58,300
memorialized in many texts is in control, you're ready for this, of every government, every

272
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,400
major institution that man is involved in.

273
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:06,680
So all of your religions, all of your sciences, all of your philosophies, all of your governments,

274
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,760
all of your laws are controlled by this satanic cosmic deity.

275
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,280
Wow!

276
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:17,680
Now what I want to say about that is when you have these groups calling themselves Satanists

277
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,920
that is erroneous, because if you look at, for example, these Satanists, that is not

278
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:26,200
Satan, they, like, for example, the temple of set.

279
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,760
Set is not Satan set is like the Lord of darkness from Egypt, and you'll have various

280
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:36,460
sects, the columns of Satanists erroneously, they are reviving these ancient balls or

281
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:40,600
lords or demons of particular geographic locations of the world.

282
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,480
So again, we are not communicating.

283
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:48,560
But what I mean about the darkness, the second part to this is that when you read in the

284
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:54,040
ancient texts, beware the workers of darkness, for example, that is not necessarily visible

285
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,120
light and dark, but that as well.

286
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:03,760
And what I mean by this is, for example, in ancient days, society garnered most of their

287
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,000
behavior and materials from the light.

288
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,560
The day started at high noon, the full moon was the full month, and they used the stars

289
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:15,320
and the luminaries to keep time.

290
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:21,680
All of their materials to make furniture, clothing, food stuff, buildings were garnered

291
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:27,400
from the light, surface minerals, trees, plant fibers, plant inks.

292
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:33,400
See now, this is the time of great darkness, because your day is reckoned in the middle of

293
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,400
the night.

294
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:41,360
Your new year is reckoned in the darkest season, in the darkest day, the darkest month.

295
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:47,200
Your materials are all garnered from petrochemical products.

296
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:53,960
And anyone really say that there is nothing that is petrochemically derived within five

297
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,640
feet of their reach.

298
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,040
All of your food is wrapped in it.

299
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,520
All of your materials are affected by it.

300
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,680
Petrochemicals come from the dark.

301
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,640
It's black crude oil.

302
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,400
And also the light destroys the dark.

303
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,280
If you leave petrochemicals in the light, they're destroyed.

304
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:14,200
So this is the light and dark and the satanic and satanic.

305
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:19,000
There's contrast within each one and people fail to understand them still.

306
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,800
Amazing stuff.

307
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,640
Folks, his name is The Greek.

308
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,280
And this is where he's going by.

309
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:28,280
Getting us out this information that no one else is sharing.

310
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:33,240
And so I can't give you a website or anything to share.

311
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:39,240
But you are now currently on AFR doing a bit of a block there and sneaking your way in

312
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:40,800
sometimes in the late night shows.

313
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,640
I love Danny.

314
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,120
That's American Freedom Radio folks.

315
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,400
Definitely check out their shows.

316
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,160
And you've got a slot right now you're doing, right?

317
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,160
Sure.

318
00:53:53,160 --> 00:54:00,360
And the site that we set up around that slot is called Ocele and The Greek.com.

319
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:05,520
Because I need adult supervision, Chuck Ocele, I feel very much indebted to him showing

320
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,640
up two hours a week to be the sonic counterpart to The Greek.

321
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,600
Because I just can't do it alone.

322
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,760
And it's called Ocele and The Greek.

323
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,600
And it is on AFR, yes.

324
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:21,480
And I do appreciate being here as well for these small bit of time.

325
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,720
Well I knew we were going to have a good talk.

326
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:28,560
And folks, I hope you gained some from this to really just to start to look at the obvious

327
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:32,000
again and take things in deeper.

328
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,680
And members, you know, it always gets stranger on the other side.

329
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,600
So when we get back, we're going to take this thing off this out of the world.

330
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:47,560
And get into advanced energy ideas, our future radio activity, end of the world, prophecies,

331
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:52,880
predictions and everything coming for you in the members section right now.

332
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,440
The rest of you, thank you so much for tuning in every week.

333
00:54:56,440 --> 00:55:00,000
And I love seeing you all there at freemantv.com.

334
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,640
And please give us thumbs up, shares, rates and all that good stuff whenever you're listening

335
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,280
to the show, especially on Stitcher.

336
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,360
I don't know of me bringing this up will make it go down even worse, but it seems that

337
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:16,840
on Stitcher, when you're listening on your phone, you can give a thumbs up and it seems

338
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,160
like only the haters give the thumbs down.

339
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:24,800
So I would love to rise up in those top 100 ranks so that this show goes out to more and

340
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:30,280
more and more people because, you know, we're doing this because if you know, you better

341
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,360
share.

342
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:35,720
And that's the last message I want to leave with you all is share this information

343
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:40,200
with everyone that you can because you want to feel like you had a part in making the

344
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:44,800
change and you don't want to live with the guilt of having done nothing.

345
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:50,000
So if there's no more else you can do, at least share the information and that is at

346
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,760
least, you know, the least you could do.

347
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,360
We all have a big job in front of us as we're learning to learn, to get this true information

348
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:03,560
understood and to know what to focus on and what not to focus on.

349
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:10,280
So I'm so happy we have people like the Greek coming around to hone in our focus a bit more.

350
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:13,880
So stay tuned members, we're coming right back with some really good weirdness, you're

351
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,680
going to really enjoy this show.

352
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:20,380
And the rest of you, we will see you next week and, you know, a Freeman TV completely under

353
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,380
construction.

354
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:24,560
So don't worry, it's going to be awesome.

355
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:28,440
So if it's down, just don't worry, it's going to be great when it comes back.

356
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,040
It'll only be days.

357
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,040
So don't worry.

358
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,040
The website is down.

359
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,160
All right, so thank you all so much for tuning in.

360
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:57,880
We will see you next week.

361
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,320
And welcome back, members.

362
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,800
So wonderful to have you all here in York growing.

363
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:08,000
I hope you guys are all using the friendship agenda to get to know one another.

364
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,080
It's there for you if you're in the members section, scroll down to the bottom of the page

365
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,400
and it'll be there.

366
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,080
I'll have it better linked up for you on the new website.

367
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:24,400
But there is a social forum and social media platform for just you to go and share your

368
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,480
information, thoughts and wonderful feelings with everybody there.

369
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:31,680
Check out friendshipagenda.com because it's yours.

370
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:38,080
Academic understanding of the word Satan brings you up to this interesting concept of a stumbling

371
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,280
block.

372
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:48,400
An idea that there is a divine force sent by God, deity, whatever you need to stand in

373
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:53,080
your way so that you will make proper choices.

374
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:59,240
So from academic standpoint, the idea of a Satan in the original Hebrew form was an

375
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:04,760
emissary of God that came down and stopped you from doing something stupid.

376
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:11,760
And one of the examples in the Bible of this moment is Belom and his talking donkey.

377
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:17,200
And the idea that the donkey could see the mastima or Satan and the donkey driver was

378
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,840
just whipping him, telling him to get going.

379
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:27,680
So this is the idea when we start looking at our world, we are controlled by our biases

380
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,120
and the words that we use.

381
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:35,960
And so when I say the word Satan or Satanist, I mean something completely different than

382
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:39,160
what you mean when you hear the word.

383
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:45,160
So this is a very critical moment in our understanding and we have the Greek here with us today to

384
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,000
help lay some of this out.

385
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
Now we're gonna...

386
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,120
We're gonna look at catastrophes, we're gonna look at stumbling blocks that are coming our

387
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:58,440
way and we're gonna analyze, you know, what is academic.

388
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:03,840
So let's get into this Greek and just start looking at our world with a whole new light.

389
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,600
Sure, let's go alphabetically real quick.

390
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,120
Academic, look it up in an etymological dictionary.

391
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:11,960
Just put an etymology, the first site that comes up put in the word academic in the search

392
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:12,960
box.

393
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:18,720
What you will find is the word academic means impractical, theoretical and never coming

394
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,720
to a conclusion.

395
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,800
Hmm, great stuff, huh?

396
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,800
Okay.

397
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,800
Sounds about right, yeah.

398
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:29,680
Yep, and this is not my opinion, this is not my belief, this is anything that anyone can

399
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,760
access.

400
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,600
But you know regarding the adversary, what is called Satan.

401
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:41,640
Again, go back to the multitude of spiritual beings.

402
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:45,160
This is, I'm gonna make a strong statement here and people will find this to be true in

403
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,440
the future.

404
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:52,600
Men does not interact with man, just as if directly, it does it by proxy, just as if a military

405
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:56,160
general or a high official does not interact with the public.

406
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,280
Like people might say, well, for example, in America, Obama bombed this country.

407
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,960
No, he didn't in reality.

408
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:06,560
He gave the word, but you'll notice there is a whole proxy of troops and administrative

409
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,240
things and boots on the ground that executed.

410
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:14,720
What mankind has always been interacting with our messengers or lesser ranking deities

411
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,560
or beings in the spiritual realm that approach him.

412
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:24,640
Like for example, do you know that what the chief adversary, which is known as Satan, has

413
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,080
never possessed anyone, ever, but he will in the future.

414
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:31,400
That is what makes the antichrist so unique, by the way.

415
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,800
He's the only man that has ever been possessed by Satan himself.

416
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,160
For example, and this is not my belief.

417
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:43,440
Now this is coming again from a level of study that anyone can approach.

418
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:48,720
And what I mean by a level of study is, let's say, Freeman, I said, you're going to get

419
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:53,240
a free airplane ticket to go international.

420
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,600
It's free, okay?

421
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,280
Do you want to sit business, coach, or first class?

422
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,840
Well, you're probably going to say first class.

423
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,160
It costs the same.

424
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,160
Absolutely.

425
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,160
Yeah.

426
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:08,960
So when you look at ancient texts, there is nothing to do again with what you believe in.

427
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,080
The biblical texts, not the King James.

428
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:15,240
Well let's say the King James for now, even though it's just a horrible document.

429
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:20,480
And I know this really sounds like I'm insulting people's religion, but I'm not.

430
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,360
The thing is, if you believe in something, you need to find what it's based on.

431
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:29,960
And furthermore, if you look at the biblical texts, you will find that it is first class

432
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:35,880
in terms of science, astronomy, health, history, all of these things.

433
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:40,560
There are many articles written by secular atheists historians that state that the biblical

434
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:45,160
text is by far the most precise and accurate historical document we have to date.

435
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,160
Okay.

436
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,120
But let me, hopefully not throw you off.

437
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:53,720
Hold that thought, but I want to throw these things in.

438
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:58,720
That one, folks, is the idea that this Bible in these ancient texts that have been around

439
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,120
for millennia.

440
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:01,320
And there is a reason for that.

441
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:05,640
We can't just toss these things out of a baby with the bathwater.

442
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:06,640
Correct.

443
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:07,640
You know, there is a purpose.

444
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,640
There is a reason.

445
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,760
We can't just be the ones that go, "I don't believe in that anymore."

446
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:16,400
We got to understand why it has controlled civilization for millennia.

447
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:23,280
Second, the King James Version, just as an example of mis-translations or misunderstandings

448
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:30,960
of what they were translating, if you go to the story of King David numbers, the fighting

449
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,560
men of Israel.

450
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:35,160
Now this story is told twice.

451
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:41,160
It's told in chronicles, second chronicles, and it's told in, I believe, second kings.

452
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:47,760
And it's the exact same story, but one was written 500 years later, which was the kings.

453
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,760
Right.

454
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:53,040
So when you start to look at this, when they open this puzzle in the Bible, in the King James

455
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:58,720
Version, especially, it will say, "And the Lord incited David to number the fighting men

456
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,720
of Israel."

457
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,280
And he paid such and such a mount.

458
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:07,760
And then the second one, the second telling, which was written 500 years later, says, "And

459
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,520
Satan incited David to number the fighting men of Israel, and this time he paid a whole lot

460
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,520
more."

461
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:14,760
But it's the exact same story.

462
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:19,440
So in the King James Version Bible, you go to chronicles, second chronicles, second kings,

463
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,880
and you will find the same story.

464
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,280
But in one, it says, "The Lord."

465
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,120
Now the Lord, that's a very obscure term too.

466
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:27,520
Are we talking about Jesus?

467
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,520
Are we talking about God?

468
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,480
What are we talking about when we say the Lord?

469
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,200
And it probably had some completely different word in Hebrew that meant something.

470
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,200
Correct.

471
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:40,040
And then you have, and Satan, in the second telling of the exact same story.

472
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:43,800
So is the Lord Satan in the King James Bible, you know?

473
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,800
Yeah.

474
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,120
Well, they don't translate the same word throughout.

475
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:50,880
Like, for example, they interchange soul and spirit, which mean totally different things.

476
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,320
It's gotten to the point with the King James, for example.

477
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:59,560
If you read the first verse of the first book in the first chapter, you're already thrown

478
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:02,000
into the meat grinder and you're done.

479
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,200
You know, in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

480
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,440
If you get past that without inquiring what is written in the original, you are just going

481
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,800
to be in the meat grinder for their entire rest of it.

482
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:15,720
That's why you'll never hear me recommend anyone go and read or study it because you're

483
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,760
not going to understand anything in any way.

484
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,520
So why waste your time?

485
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:23,560
But, you know, and not to discourage people, if you want to go, and for example, examine

486
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:27,280
the first verse of the first chapter of the first book in the beginning, God created

487
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,280
the heavens and the earth.

488
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:30,280
That's ten words.

489
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:31,880
But if you look in the Hebrew, there are sevens.

490
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,840
You might say, well, they added three to make it make more sense in English.

491
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:40,480
No, actually, they added four words because they're not even translating one of the words

492
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,480
there.

493
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,400
They're not translating the fourth word in the first verse.

494
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,400
And if you want, I could give it in Hebrew real quick.

495
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,840
In the first verse of Genesis in Hebrew, it goes like this, it goes, "Bet a sheath,

496
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:54,360
"Bad a' al-Alam, et ta'asham, a yeem, behet a' adhats."

497
01:04:54,360 --> 01:05:00,460
And if I could give you a directly translation of what that means, is beginnings of the

498
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:05,940
aloheem, which are the gods and plural, and the aloheem mean the emanators, okay, the

499
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,280
L, to be an L or an aloheem is to emanate.

500
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:13,040
And that just means very simply, if you're standing in an empty parking lot with an emanator

501
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:17,320
or an aloheem, and he says, "Farrari," a Ferrari magically appears in front of you.

502
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,880
That's all it is.

503
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,960
And that's been played upon by genies and things like that in popular, whatever.

504
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:24,960
Okay.

505
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:30,560
So beginnings, the aloheem, created, now this is the word that they're leaving out is the

506
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:34,040
aliph in the ta'av, and then the heavens and the earth.

507
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,320
What is the aliph in the ta'av?

508
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:39,880
The aliph in the ta'av is the first and the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet, or the Greek

509
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:44,060
alphabet, it would be known as the aliph in the omega, and the English would be known

510
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:45,060
the a in the z.

511
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:49,960
Now, if we look in Scripture very carefully, there's someone that identifies themselves as

512
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,200
the aliph in the omega.

513
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:56,540
So a very quick read of what it should say in Genesis 1 verse 1, "In the beginning, the

514
01:05:56,540 --> 01:06:02,080
gods created the first and the last, or the Christ, and then the heavens and the earth."

515
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,080
Now, how does that make sense?

516
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:06,160
It doesn't really tie in very well.

517
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:12,600
I want to give another quick example regarding something that's in memorialized in art by

518
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,180
Michael Angelo.

519
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:19,800
If you go to Exodus 34, Moses comes down off the mountain and the people were afraid

520
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,880
to look at him because his face was shining.

521
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,320
That's not what it says.

522
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,680
If you look at that word that they're using for shining, now first of all, why would people

523
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,840
be afraid of his face is shining?

524
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,440
Because we actually compliment people.

525
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,440
You're glowing.

526
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:33,940
You look great.

527
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:35,340
Why were they afraid?

528
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:40,680
Because if we look at that word, "shining" in Exodus 34, you will find that the Hebrew word

529
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:45,680
is Karen, and Karen is where you get the scientific word for "carotain," which is what

530
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,560
bones are made of.

531
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,840
And horns.

532
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:53,240
So if you actually read the text and it says Moses came down off the mountain, he had horns

533
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:56,600
and the people were scared, well, that makes more sense.

534
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,200
And this was memorialized by Michael Angelo.

535
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:06,320
If you go do a cursory research on Google, sculpture of Moses by Michael Angelo, you will see

536
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:09,760
a seated person with little horns on his forehead.

537
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:10,760
With that?

538
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:15,160
Michael Angelo, because that's what was in the original text.

539
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:19,320
Here's, I'll throw in another example, the main fixture in Christianity is a guy nailed

540
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:24,920
to a cross wearing a loincloth, and without being disrespectful, I sometimes call it other

541
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:25,920
things.

542
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:30,080
But if you read the text, even if you watch the Hollywood movies, when he was brought

543
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:34,960
to Pontius Pilate prior to execution, Pontius Pilate did a public hand washing, and in

544
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:42,320
various books, harmonized, book of Mark, book of John, for example, which are very nice

545
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,600
Hebrew names, by the way.

546
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,800
No, you're not.

547
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,480
Pontius Pilate says, "I see no guilt in this man.

548
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,480
You have a law.

549
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,720
Use your law on this man."

550
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:58,160
So how could, if he's addressing the Judean authorities, how could there be a Roman crucifixion?

551
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:01,960
Now here's, there was no Roman crucifixion, and this is easy to back it up.

552
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:07,520
There's a lot of people discussing, there is no historic reference to Jesus.

553
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,720
And that is true.

554
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,320
There are many people discussing this.

555
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:16,880
But if you look at the biblical Christ and the biblical story, you will find that the Christian

556
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:19,280
Jesus is not in there at all.

557
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:25,520
What is being depicted in the religion of Christianity is not in the biblical text.

558
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:30,200
But if you look at the biblical text and you look at history, you will find that they

559
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,440
are perfectly aligned.

560
01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:36,720
Now what this means, when Pontius Pilate said, "I'm returning this man to use your law,"

561
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:40,720
they used the Judean authorities, used the law of Moses.

562
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:44,440
The Bible punishment under the law of Moses was death by stoning.

563
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:48,600
But if you look at Deuteronomy 21, it makes an exception that a high crime, you are to be

564
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:52,800
nailed to a tree and taken down before the next day or noon.

565
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:56,560
And if you look at the book of numbers, it says anything that's been hanging on a tree

566
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,680
is a curse and to be burned.

567
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:04,760
So if we actually look at the event that the Christ was actually nailed to an almond tree

568
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:08,140
with two others on the same tree, we know it's an almond tree because there are over

569
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:14,340
30 references to something a specific event happening on an almond tree.

570
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:17,700
And it says that the people pass between the third and the ninth hour doing what?

571
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:22,820
Paddy cakes, hopscotch, watching someone nailed on a Roman crucifix or are they throwing stones.

572
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:27,420
Now remember that the Romans cast lots for his clothes because they knew everything would

573
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:30,060
be burned and he had herds robe.

574
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:33,580
And also when the Christ was being executed, he said, "Take care of my mother."

575
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:34,580
Why?

576
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:40,220
Because when you were killed in such a fashion, if you had any belongings in the world and

577
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:44,380
people went to, let's say, sell it or take it and said, "Do you really want that television?"

578
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:48,340
That was the guy that was, you know, a stone because he was blaspheming.

579
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:49,340
No, I don't want that.

580
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:53,460
So all of the personal belongings of the individuals were also piled up underneath the tree

581
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:54,460
and burned.

582
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:58,500
Now what's interesting about this is that when the body was put in the tomb, it had to be

583
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:02,660
guarded because of today's authorities wanted to take it to finish off the ceremony.

584
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:07,060
But here's the interesting part about the historical reference to this.

585
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:11,380
At the time of Pontius Pilate, anyone can do some research on letters of Pontius Pilate.

586
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:14,900
There are in the Internet better ones are found in books.

587
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:18,220
And what you will find in letters of Pontius Pilate during that time when he was sent as

588
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:23,820
the governor of Prefect to Judea, he was writing frequently to Claudius Tiberius Caesar for

589
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:30,380
backup because he only had a few hundred troops and he even told his men to walk around

590
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:35,120
in disguise to look like the people that lived there because if they found out how few

591
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,620
numbered they were, they would be endangered.

592
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:42,420
And Pontius Pilate had written in his notes of Tiberius Claudius Caesar that there's this

593
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:48,540
one Yahshua that should be looked at because he speaks against authority and he had gone

594
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:52,180
and heard him speak and he had said in his notes that he did not speak against the Romans.

595
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:55,460
He spoke against the Judean religious authorities.

596
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:59,740
And if you keep studying what he had written to Tiberius Claudius Caesar in secular documents,

597
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:05,260
he said that at one point they had brought this Yahshua to him for execution but then the

598
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:08,980
the mob of Judeans took him away to be stoned.

599
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:13,100
And this is in history records, not so if you look at the biblical text what actually

600
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:19,700
happened in the biblical text and in history, it's in perfect coincidance or coincidence

601
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:25,500
where in the religious side you will not find any evidence of any of that.

602
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:26,500
Very interesting.

603
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:29,900
I've always wanted to know more and more about that.

604
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:33,620
That's great places to start to understand and to look.

605
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:40,380
As we move this towards the idea of past catastrophes and coming global catastrophes, can

606
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:47,020
we focus a little bit in on another character that is often referenced and rarely understood

607
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:50,060
the rebel we know as Lucifer?

608
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:54,700
What's interesting about that, and this is a shocker to most, we have to adhere to what

609
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:58,460
the source is, you know how we say everything is debased, like the money is based on nothing

610
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:00,020
but we use it anyway.

611
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:07,420
The concept of Lucifer is being used very much so in all forms of media but it's debased.

612
01:12:07,420 --> 01:12:11,140
What I mean by that is again we need to go back to where it came from.

613
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:16,620
If we look at the biblical text very carefully in the book of Isaiah, Lucifer is not a spiritual

614
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:23,780
being, it is a man, it is a Babylonian king of no name, for example, just like for example

615
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:27,340
you will find certain pharaohs are not named but their title is mentioned.

616
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:30,380
Now I just want to back you up there, that is completely correct folks.

617
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:37,120
When you read the passages, the single passage in the Bible that mentions the word Lucifer,

618
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,580
they are referencing a king.

619
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:40,580
Correct.

620
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:46,380
You know if you read it then you know this and then if I just ramble a little more, the

621
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:52,900
idea that people then toss in because this one says he fell and this one says he fell

622
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,140
like lightning therefore Satan is Lucifer.

623
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:57,060
I'm like how does this match?

624
01:12:57,060 --> 01:12:58,260
How does this track?

625
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:00,060
There's no math here.

626
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:05,340
You can just grab these two partial sentences but when you read the passage about Oh Lucifer,

627
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:11,540
how thou has fallen that is in reference to what I thought was perhaps Nebuchadnezzar but

628
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:13,700
absolutely a man, a king.

629
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:17,980
Yes, it is a man and it is a king and one of the other giveaways is when you look at the

630
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:23,220
original language he is brought down to Shiel which is the grave, an earthly grave.

631
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:27,720
If he were a spiritual being, you cannot hold a spiritual being in an earthly grave meaning

632
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:29,580
six feet under when I say earthly grave.

633
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:35,220
I mean physically being put into the earth after you are killed or died.

634
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:40,780
The place where spiritual beings are contained is a place called Gehenna which is the pit let's

635
01:13:40,780 --> 01:13:45,020
say where it's a sensory deprivation chamber because that's how you punish a spiritual

636
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:48,740
entity by the way, another whole other concept there.

637
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:54,060
But yeah, the thoughts that you read about in the description of Lucifer are the thoughts

638
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:56,020
that this man had.

639
01:13:56,020 --> 01:14:00,380
Just like for example in the book of Exodus there is the thoughts that Pharaoh had if you

640
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:04,620
read where he says Pharaoh says, "I created you, I made the river, I made this."

641
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:09,060
You see and we know this is the thoughts of an individual, a very arrogant one for example

642
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:11,100
but Lucifer is dead.

643
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:12,420
Let's just say it that way.

644
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:17,220
If we're going to be factual, Lucifer died, I would say roughly three thousand years ago.

645
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:21,820
So all this stuff around, that's being discussed goes in the realm of the Easter Bunny and the

646
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:22,820
Santa Claus.

647
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:29,720
Well, I guess in that idea that I want to go ahead and lead you to a little more Easter

648
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,460
Bunny stuff.

649
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:35,100
We've been hearing a bit of a hum in your background and I know that you are into some

650
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:40,620
advanced technologies and so let's talk about another mastima or stumbling block in our

651
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:45,420
world and that is what is commonly referred to as free energy.

652
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:52,540
Oh, yeah, this is really the toppling of the psyche, I call it.

653
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:55,780
There is no such thing as free energy and what do you mean by that?

654
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:59,460
Well what you're looking, what people are actually, and that's put words in their mouth

655
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:03,660
with thoughts, what they're looking for is free power.

656
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:10,580
Energy is akin to let's say what people consider energy and matter and things like that.

657
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:14,860
Energy in its natural form is truly static unless there is movement.

658
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:20,700
What people are really looking for is free power so they can light their houses with lights

659
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:24,500
and machines and things like that.

660
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:27,900
Energy in a sense, let's just give an example.

661
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:30,740
For example, someone says this is an electrical generator.

662
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:32,340
No, it's not.

663
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:34,620
No one has ever generated electricity.

664
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:38,220
Any more than anyone has generated water with a water pump.

665
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:41,460
Someone going out and buying a water pump, even in the box, plug it in and all of a sudden

666
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,180
do you expect water to come out of it?

667
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:46,340
No, because the water pump is designed with certain features.

668
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:51,940
Let's say to give a certain volume or pressure for taking a static body of water and putting

669
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:55,940
it through the other side into a pressurized form.

670
01:15:55,940 --> 01:16:01,220
Now when you have what's called an electrical generator, which is a rotating coil and magnet,

671
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:05,740
in essence, what it's doing, like a water pump based on its design is taking the static

672
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:11,340
form of energy in the environment and turning it into power.

673
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:13,860
So how do you do that autonomously?

674
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:18,540
Now how do that's done is you have to have a very good comprehension of objectively what

675
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:24,100
is going on and seemingly everything that's being discussed regarding the subject is erroneous.

676
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:30,060
And I know that's a tall statement, like for example Tesla is completely misunderstood.

677
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:32,500
What is known as light is misunderstood.

678
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,380
Electricity is misunderstood.

679
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:37,140
Electricity is not a conductor, it's an obstructor.

680
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:41,380
So once all of these things are put together, then we can have actually a field of science

681
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:45,860
where we can get the people that have more than two sharpened pencils in their pocket to

682
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:47,100
start building things.

683
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:52,660
But what is being put out by academia and the alternative media regarding energy right

684
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:58,380
now is false and that's why I can infatically tell people you will never get that free energy

685
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:01,380
because you're looking for something that doesn't exist.

686
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:07,140
What they should be looking for is for what was announced let's say in 1918 I believe

687
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:12,500
by the American electrical engineers that within six months because of the work of Charles

688
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:18,140
Proto-A Steinmetz and Tesla and others like that that they would have an autonomously

689
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:21,620
rotating electrical device to produce power.

690
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:27,420
And this has been almost a...don't have it because there was a mass diversion with Einsteinian

691
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:29,100
relativism.

692
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:34,140
Now I know this is a lot for the listeners but let me just throw one more thing in.

693
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:38,820
There's a fellow named J.J. Thompson who's kind of credited with the founding of what's

694
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:43,420
called the electron and the way that it's shown now is by the way that Walt Disney wants

695
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:45,700
us to see it but that's not what it is.

696
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:47,100
And he's the one that propagated it.

697
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,980
It was pretty much buried before Walt Disney.

698
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:52,900
Walt Disney spent millions of his own money and today's money let's say to promote the

699
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:56,140
concept of the atom as we have it.

700
01:17:56,140 --> 01:18:01,940
But the most fundamental work of J.J. Thompson that's been buried is such is that weight is

701
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:04,460
not has nothing to do with matter or mass.

702
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:06,260
Now wait a second that sounds ridiculous.

703
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:09,660
You know if I pick up a brick it's heavy or it's the effect of gravity.

704
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:13,860
He had shown that mass has no weight.

705
01:18:13,860 --> 01:18:18,820
What is happening is when you move mass electrical lines of force attached to it and the more

706
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:22,700
you move it or the more it's moved more electrical lines of force attached to it creating

707
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,700
what we call momentum.

708
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:30,180
If you know how to disconnect these imaginary or let's say almost intangible electrical lines

709
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:35,460
of force and send them to ground now you have what's called weightlessness.

710
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:39,180
And an example of that would be if you put a brick on a scale you'll notice it's about

711
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:44,780
six pounds but if you drop it from 20 feet the scale will register 150 for a moment.

712
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:47,580
That's because more electrical lines of force attached to it.

713
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:50,180
Stop thinking about the gravity acceleration stuff.

714
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:51,620
Yes that's fine.

715
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:56,260
The physics with that is nothing wrong with the acceleration of gravity but what we're

716
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:59,420
actually talking about is how it actually works.

717
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:04,940
Now when they had discovered this and actually had bench top working models of being able

718
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:11,580
to disconnect electrical lines of force and make things weightless back in around 1905

719
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:17,680
they started promoting this and developing it and when they figure out that weight no

720
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,620
longer mattered.

721
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:23,780
They said if we're going to put some people in something where weight doesn't matter the

722
01:19:23,780 --> 01:19:28,340
pressure up there is not very it's very low and we need to have it pressurized.

723
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:32,780
So they had the early submarines like the World War One version of submarine.

724
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:36,860
So what they did is they took the rudders and propellers off and they elevated these things

725
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:41,980
and flew them around and they still are up until maybe 10 years ago it was quite popular

726
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:44,500
to see what's called a flying cigar shape.

727
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:45,900
Have you ever heard of that?

728
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:50,980
That is enough if you have a really good set of binoculars or a telescope and you actually

729
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:55,980
got a look at it you will see that the thing had rivets on it and it was really a submarine.

730
01:19:55,980 --> 01:20:02,940
I have read this description in many of the UFO research I never never knew that.

731
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:03,940
Yes.

732
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:04,940
It's a complete sense to me.

733
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:08,220
Yeah and all of these things you see the thing is you don't want to demystify too much

734
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:12,500
because people have nothing to grab onto because if you're grabbing onto fantasy and

735
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:16,460
the Easter bunny and things like that then it will suddenly get taken away no more security

736
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:18,060
blanket you see.

737
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:23,780
The scary part here is that the people that realize this is starting from J.J. Thompson's

738
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:30,140
work and also Faraday's work and all these you know we're talking 19th century they're

739
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:36,540
not sharing right and they're not sharing the same way as if let's say that's put down

740
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:37,780
the people that live in Chad.

741
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:41,700
If you take the continent of Africa right in the middle is a country called Chad.

742
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:45,580
It's a very difficult place to live they even have human road kill on the roads that they

743
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:48,540
don't clean up there.

744
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:52,260
If you went to a place let's say like that where people were living very differently with

745
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:55,980
your iPhone or whatever and they said give it to me give it to me give it to you're like

746
01:20:55,980 --> 01:21:00,660
oh we better hide our iPhone from these guys because they just want to take it from us right.

747
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:06,260
So there is a group of people on this planet that had their pulse on what was going on

748
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:10,180
quite scientifically let's say and these people were not known as scientists back in the

749
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:14,380
day they were known as natural philosophers so the term scientists is fairly new by the

750
01:21:14,380 --> 01:21:18,860
way and when you are a natural philosopher you either a naturalist or a materialist you

751
01:21:18,860 --> 01:21:25,420
know and this work of J.J. Thompson Nikola Tesla is not being shared and the key to figuring

752
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:30,580
out how to disconnect these electrical lines of force to get things moving is finding

753
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:32,660
what's called a virtual ground.

754
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:38,820
What do you ground to to disconnect these things from matter?

755
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:44,180
And that should be the basis of anyone in everyone's research on what's called free energy

756
01:21:44,180 --> 01:21:49,380
or free power or the autonomous movement of objects or anti-gravity.

757
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:55,060
Wow you have some technology that you're working on that you're not ready to divulge yet

758
01:21:55,060 --> 01:21:56,060
right?

759
01:21:56,060 --> 01:22:00,300
No and a thing is because it's always changing just like in nature if you are growing let's

760
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:04,700
say crops on a farm it's always at different stages and then you have to harvest it and

761
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:07,540
start all over right?

762
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:12,260
But each harvest brings a yield which you can benefit from okay?

763
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:17,900
So yeah so this is how it all is just like look at technology how cars were and airplanes

764
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:21,620
back it's just a progression right?

765
01:22:21,620 --> 01:22:26,900
Now the interesting thing about for anyone who is interested in experimentation is that all

766
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:30,620
natural energy goes from a low potential to a high potential.

767
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:34,220
We are taught that all potentials go from high to low.

768
01:22:34,220 --> 01:22:38,980
So once you comprehend that now you will understand how the weather works now you will understand

769
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:43,700
how to begin working on disconnecting these lines of force from objects and getting things

770
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:46,140
to move on their own.

771
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:51,340
You will also get a much deeper understanding on what chemical reactions really are and

772
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:54,580
you will get an understanding on what matter is and I just want to throw this one thing

773
01:22:54,580 --> 01:22:59,460
and you hear a lot about this Fukushima and radiation and all this other stuff is being

774
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:01,980
whatever it is that is completely misunderstood.

775
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:06,660
It was proved over a hundred years ago that there is no energy in matter.

776
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:12,180
E=mc2 just means Einstein equals a moron times a speed of light squared.

777
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:17,900
It was just a big diversion to get people away into Lala land or relativism.

778
01:23:17,900 --> 01:23:20,740
You really don't think there is any danger from Fukushima?

779
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:25,020
Well here is the thing yes there is depending on how you approach it.

780
01:23:25,020 --> 01:23:30,620
If you can take a block radioactive material and if you research it enough there is no

781
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:33,380
radioactivity in the material itself.

782
01:23:33,380 --> 01:23:36,780
This goes against a lot of there is a particular guy called a polymath.

783
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:40,300
I am not going to mention his name around the turn of the century.

784
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:42,100
A lot of people follow him.

785
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:46,580
His first name starts with a W as last one is with an R. He has done a lot of really good

786
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:50,940
work on harmonics but one of his biggest misunderstandings is that there is energy in matter

787
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:54,100
and there is no energy in matter.

788
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:57,500
Radioactive material what they call radioactivity material what it essence is they are called

789
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:59,500
heavy metals correct?

790
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,660
They end up being dense in a certain way.

791
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:08,060
All they are is reflectors of this cosmic energy and it reflect this cosmic energy into

792
01:24:08,060 --> 01:24:15,620
the environment very intensely and when I say very I mean that is what the capital are.

793
01:24:15,620 --> 01:24:17,220
They are intense reflectors.

794
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:21,860
Now an intense reflector anyone knows that if you stand in front of a concave highly polished

795
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:27,980
mirror in the sun that is very intense sunlight so much you can melt a penny on it right?

796
01:24:27,980 --> 01:24:33,180
Does that mean that all of that energy is coming out of that reflector or is it a matter

797
01:24:33,180 --> 01:24:37,140
of just reflecting the ambient you see?

798
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:39,740
And this was proven by Tesla and Wilhelm Reich.

799
01:24:39,740 --> 01:24:44,380
Tesla proved you can take material that is not radioactive and make it radioactive and Wilhelm

800
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:50,300
Reich proved that you could take radioactive material and render it un radioactive and

801
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:56,380
many people doing research with hydrolysis which is the degeneration of water into hydrogen

802
01:24:56,380 --> 01:25:03,300
and oxygen also found the able to render radioactive material neutral with that process as well.

803
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:04,300
So yeah.

804
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:12,180
Ed Lee Scalnan of Coral Castle fame said that he could do this with magnet magnetism.

805
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:17,140
Correct now what is interesting about magnetism is there is two components to it there is also

806
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:23,140
the dielectric component to it which is what is called a capacitor or magnetism would

807
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:29,460
follow an obstructive medium known as a metal and a dielectric side of this energy is our

808
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:35,180
things that are organic like wood, rubber, plastics things that we call insulators are actually

809
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:36,180
dielectrics.

810
01:25:36,180 --> 01:25:42,220
They also store material like for example if you're in socks in an apartment that has carpeting

811
01:25:42,220 --> 01:25:45,860
and you're walking across the room and touch the door knob you get a zap.

812
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:50,700
The ancient Greeks found if you rub wool on volcanic glass you get a spark.

813
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:54,500
You see that is the dielectric component and everyone is talking about electromagnetics

814
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:59,540
but no one is talking about the dielectrics which is the storage of this energy.

815
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:00,940
Sure yes.

816
01:26:00,940 --> 01:26:06,340
Now a lot of these guys getting into this also get into the human body and I think the orgasm

817
01:26:06,340 --> 01:26:09,740
has come up in this research as well.

818
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:11,140
Why is this?

819
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:12,460
Yeah.

820
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:15,020
So yeah let's take it there.

821
01:26:15,020 --> 01:26:20,620
We were talking about having to build pressurized UFOs out of submarines.

822
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:25,380
And the human body I understand that you have a different perspective on some of the inner

823
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:29,260
workings of this and maybe this inner body.

824
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:33,780
What I really wanted to work with you through is the body, the understanding of some of

825
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:38,780
the misconcepts and then also the soul and the spirit and then we'll take this into some

826
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:45,140
future predictions of coming mastamas and stumbling blocks and catastrophes but let's

827
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:47,260
understand ourselves first.

828
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:54,100
Oh absolutely very simply I love giving the analogy of what's considered to be blood pressure.

829
01:26:54,100 --> 01:26:58,740
Let's just look at this, let's just look at ourselves right where people, let's get up

830
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:03,340
on our hind legs you know, not a metaphor that we were dogs but you know a very often say

831
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:06,060
let's get up on our hind legs and pay attention.

832
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:10,820
When you put your hands in water and your feet water do they shrivel up or do they puff

833
01:27:10,820 --> 01:27:13,860
up like a frog and the answer is they shrivel up.

834
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:19,420
So guess why? because it's a negative pressure like if you're going to vacuum seal a piece

835
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:24,740
of meat in a bag when you pull the vacuum on it does it shrivel up or does it expand?

836
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:26,020
It shrivels up.

837
01:27:26,020 --> 01:27:31,740
The body is a sealed, it's we're not filter bags or everything is completely sealed.

838
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:39,100
The intestines the lungs the skin and it's under a slight negative pressure, slight vacuum,

839
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:43,580
not intense vacuum but very slight under the ambient.

840
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:48,260
What they're doing is they're strapping a cuff around people's limbs and inflating it

841
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:53,500
to block the flow of the fluids that are moving under a vacuum and telling you you have

842
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:54,500
blood pressure.

843
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:57,780
Now if you actually study what they're calling blood pressure it's not really pressure

844
01:27:57,780 --> 01:28:00,020
in the entire body they're looking for.

845
01:28:00,020 --> 01:28:05,340
It's a particular function in the heart but most people walk away thinking that the body

846
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:06,900
is under pressure.

847
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:07,900
It's not.

848
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:14,540
The biological things are under what's called what Victor Schauburger called a biological

849
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:17,860
vacuum which is a very subtle vacuum.

850
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:23,900
That's why when you cut yourself you need a few seconds if not longer for the vacuum to

851
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:26,980
be broken and the blood to reverse its flow and come out.

852
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:30,900
Even the femoral artery where if you see in the movies when it's cut the blood shoots out

853
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:36,100
three, four feet into the air once it's cut the vacuum is broken and then after a certain

854
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:39,900
amount of time then it starts shooting out from the artery.

855
01:28:39,900 --> 01:28:43,900
And what's interesting about how the body works were taught that were these porous filter

856
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,180
bags.

857
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:49,020
If you look at the how the intestines are structured in medical books you will see there

858
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:53,260
are three major layers and they're all hydrophobic.

859
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:54,540
They're not porous.

860
01:28:54,540 --> 01:29:00,860
For example in many countries they use bladders of animals to hold water.

861
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:02,980
You see.

862
01:29:02,980 --> 01:29:06,460
And intestines.

863
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:11,340
The body is a unique thing tying back to many of the sciences that were beginning to

864
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:12,340
give.

865
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:14,700
Initial research had shown this.

866
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:20,020
But somehow there was a fork in the road where we bring the stumbling block where we

867
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:26,100
know just enough about the body based on three thousand years of accumulated battlefield

868
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:27,100
medicine.

869
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:31,540
If you look at what's being applied today in the medical community the entire medical

870
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:36,660
establishment it is nothing more than derivations or expanding battlefield medicine that's

871
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:39,780
been gathered for thousands of years.

872
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:45,540
The actual true nature of the body needs to be understood as we'll evoke the name of Victor

873
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:46,540
Schauburger.

874
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:50,540
Anyone can look him up with its V.I.K.T.O.R.

875
01:29:50,540 --> 01:29:55,020
Last name would be Schauburger S.C.H.A.U.R.G.E.R.

876
01:29:55,020 --> 01:29:58,220
Talked about a biological vacuum in all things.

877
01:29:58,220 --> 01:30:03,900
So once we start understanding how the human body works and when we eat food we don't absorb

878
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:04,900
anything.

879
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:09,340
It passes through the body and becomes de-energized very much like Jean Roddenberry's

880
01:30:09,340 --> 01:30:11,640
food replicator.

881
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:17,660
These things are in the realm of science fiction almost when you discuss the reality of it.

882
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:23,500
That's why I was jokingly once someone said you have an organ donor card I said for what?

883
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:27,100
He says well you know donate your organs to science.

884
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:30,620
If something happened to you I said are you kidding I'm already donating these organs to science

885
01:30:30,620 --> 01:30:32,140
fiction?

886
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:35,140
But anyway.

887
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:38,860
So the reason why it's important to understand the body is because if you're deceived about

888
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:43,180
how your body works which is your headquarters you're going to accept if headquarters is

889
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:47,940
deceived anything that comes out of headquarters is going to be laced with this deception.

890
01:30:47,940 --> 01:30:53,340
So if people start looking at how the body actually works like for example here's another thing

891
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:55,620
let's talk practical stuff right now.

892
01:30:55,620 --> 01:31:01,140
You know how they tell us that we get the common cold because of bacteria and people believe

893
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:02,140
it?

894
01:31:02,140 --> 01:31:03,620
Well guess what?

895
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:08,020
If you believe that the common cold and these things are caused by bacteria and pathogens

896
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:12,860
what you just did is rendered the need for refrigeration useless because the reason we

897
01:31:12,860 --> 01:31:17,580
have refrigerators is to retard the growth of bacteria.

898
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:20,220
So how can it be getting sick?

899
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:22,780
How do why do most people get the common cold in the winter?

900
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:24,980
Very simply because of their diet.

901
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:32,500
And what I mean by that is that if you are living in a cold place and you eat food that is

902
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:37,980
grown in a tropical place when you pass that food through the body that will adjust the

903
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:40,700
body to a tropical climate.

904
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:43,540
Thinner blood, different type of metabolism.

905
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:51,300
The body tries to make balance with that by developing mucus because you're losing vacuum.

906
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:56,020
You see like whenever mucus is developed in the body it's because the body is losing vacuum

907
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:57,540
or it's trying to plug.

908
01:31:57,540 --> 01:32:02,300
Like here's an example, anyone can look this up when a woman is holding a baby in the womb.

909
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:07,660
If you go look at it anatomically there's a plug in the uterus to keep the baby from falling

910
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:08,660
out.

911
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:09,660
What is that called?

912
01:32:09,660 --> 01:32:11,460
That is called a mucus plug.

913
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:16,020
So in the opposite let's go back to why people get sick in the winter or the summer.

914
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:21,180
If you're living in the tropics and you eat a piece of salmon what does salmon come from?

915
01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:24,580
It's a cold water fish let's say.

916
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:28,460
If you eat that that will adjust your body temperature or your body metabolism and blood

917
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:32,420
quality to be in the Arctic or cold place.

918
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:36,580
And you will be in the tropics and you will turn the air conditioning down to near freezing

919
01:32:36,580 --> 01:32:39,580
and you will still be warm in ill.

920
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:43,320
Now what's interesting about that the opposite occur when you're in a cold place and you

921
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,820
have a fever it's hot.

922
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:49,700
When you're in a hot place and have a fever it's cold.

923
01:32:49,700 --> 01:32:52,060
So we have to understand the various things.

924
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:57,100
Now the reason I'm saying this to be practical is because we can get more into the science behind

925
01:32:57,100 --> 01:32:59,060
it, the real science behind it.

926
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:01,340
But I hear so much of alternative media.

927
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:05,740
How many alternative medical people, nutritional people are out there, thousands of them.

928
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:07,300
They have websites, shows and all that.

929
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:10,020
And how many are saying these basic practical things?

930
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:11,020
None.

931
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:13,580
As a matter of fact they're still using terms like viruses.

932
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:15,100
And viruses don't even exist.

933
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:16,900
No one has ever seen a virus.

934
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:21,580
All you're going to see is a computer graphic or drawing or a description.

935
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:26,500
But if you actually look up what a virus is even in Wikipedia they tell you the whole concept

936
01:33:26,500 --> 01:33:30,700
of virology is based on toxicology.

937
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:35,260
And what they call viruses are all come out of the liver.

938
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:40,300
So this is just, we're talking about fantasy land here but the best practical information

939
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:43,740
anyone can give is remember the body has to maintain a vacuum.

940
01:33:43,740 --> 01:33:49,140
Like for example, if you receive a bruise you notice how the material swells up on the

941
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:50,540
body.

942
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:55,860
That's because the interstitial spaces are rearranged in a way that the vacuum is broken.

943
01:33:55,860 --> 01:34:00,700
So one of the ways to heal a wound or something very quickly is to wrap it very tightly.

944
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:05,700
And if the room for a good amount of time let's say a day or so.

945
01:34:05,700 --> 01:34:09,420
And you have to release that wrapping when you start to get let's say a blue or purple

946
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:12,620
finger every few minutes and then re-wrap it very tightly.

947
01:34:12,620 --> 01:34:18,700
What you're doing is you're decreasing the volume of the body which does what?

948
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:20,980
Increase vacuum.

949
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:26,860
So understanding vacuum and also understanding what is causing most of the common illnesses

950
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:27,860
in people.

951
01:34:27,860 --> 01:34:31,180
I've actually experimented on myself when it's winter time.

952
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:34,060
I eat seasonally or cross latitudes.

953
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:38,500
So when it's cold out make sure that you eat food cross lateral.

954
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:41,380
You know take the earth and look across the line.

955
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:42,900
And this way you have some variety.

956
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:47,620
So let's say you live in middle America you go across the line and you'll see places in

957
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:50,260
Germany, middle China, places like that.

958
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:51,740
So you have variety in your food.

959
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:53,540
Eat cross latitude.

960
01:34:53,540 --> 01:34:58,620
Now it's interesting you ever notice the pagan holidays, Christmas, New Year's all those

961
01:34:58,620 --> 01:34:59,900
people get their colds.

962
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:00,900
Why?

963
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:03,620
Because they have their festivals and guess what they're eating?

964
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:07,300
Sugar, snacks, desserts, exotic foods.

965
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:09,980
Where do most of these come from?

966
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:10,980
Tropical places.

967
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:11,980
You see?

968
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:12,980
Amazing.

969
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:18,340
Yeah, I've done experiments where I've totally acclimated eating seasonally and I say okay, it's

970
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:19,340
a middle of winter.

971
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:20,340
I'm going to go buy a banana.

972
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:21,340
I eat the banana.

973
01:35:21,340 --> 01:35:22,340
I feel like crap.

974
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:24,180
It's about three days to get out of your system.

975
01:35:24,180 --> 01:35:28,220
And the other ridiculous thing is like, oh, I'm a school teacher and I caught a cold from

976
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:29,700
the children.

977
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:30,860
Total rubbish.

978
01:35:30,860 --> 01:35:34,340
Because I saw you in the supermarket buying bananas and tomatoes in the middle of the

979
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:38,460
winter just like the school children are eating them.

980
01:35:38,460 --> 01:35:39,460
You didn't catch a cold.

981
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:43,140
What happened, the reason why they say there's bacteria is because there's something called

982
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:46,060
an emergence, things emerge.

983
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:51,980
If I take a blood sample from you or a mucus sample and remove it from the host, a living

984
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:56,900
tissue, blood, whatever it is, now it is going into decomposition mode, put it in a slide,

985
01:35:56,900 --> 01:36:00,900
it's decaying and there's going to be an emergence of bacteria and things like that.

986
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:02,620
So this is what they're saying.

987
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:08,300
That's why most of medicine, modern medicine based on their chemistry is detrimental because

988
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:12,660
whenever they remove anything for examination from the host, whether it's a plant, animal

989
01:36:12,660 --> 01:36:16,540
or human, it goes into immediate state of decomposition.

990
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:22,460
So now they're designing drugs around decomposing things that would not exist in the natural

991
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:24,100
host.

992
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:28,220
So the simplest advice to give anyone, and it's not a matter of giving medical advice, it's

993
01:36:28,220 --> 01:36:29,780
a matter of giving good, common sense.

994
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:34,980
If you eat seasonally, you will notice that you are a lot of things called allergies and

995
01:36:34,980 --> 01:36:40,060
colds and even a lot of things that are quote unquote contagious will not occur to you.

996
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:42,940
I'm totally going to try that Greek.

997
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:46,460
Oh, you'll like, it's kind of difficult in the beginning because if you like coffee and

998
01:36:46,460 --> 01:36:50,900
it's real, and you're in two feet of snow, well guess where coffee grows, you know?

999
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:51,900
Yeah.

1000
01:36:51,900 --> 01:36:54,980
But hold on, you know during World War II when the shipping lanes were caught off, they

1001
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:59,620
did a lot of great coffee substitutes in Europe.

1002
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:03,180
You could look them up, they're made with chickery and hazelnut and things like that because

1003
01:37:03,180 --> 01:37:07,140
you know, there was more important to ship rifles and guns and bombs and coffee during World

1004
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:09,980
War II and the people in Europe love their coffee.

1005
01:37:09,980 --> 01:37:13,140
So there's a lot of good coffee substitutes and sugar substitutes.

1006
01:37:13,140 --> 01:37:16,540
Maple syrup for example is a good one because where does that come from?

1007
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:18,980
Pretty temperate, cool place.

1008
01:37:18,980 --> 01:37:19,980
Yeah, yeah.

1009
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:20,980
Yeah, so think about it.

1010
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:22,220
It requires a little thought.

1011
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:24,220
Don't take anything for granted.

1012
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:30,500
And the reason I'm giving this and emphasizing this part of a bit of information is because

1013
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:37,340
it, almost everyone who takes this information and uses it is spared the misery of what's

1014
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:40,340
known as the cold or feeling under the weather, you know?

1015
01:37:40,340 --> 01:37:41,340
I hate it.

1016
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:42,340
I hate it.

1017
01:37:42,340 --> 01:37:45,980
And you won't and it takes about, and here's the other thing specifically, unless your

1018
01:37:45,980 --> 01:37:51,860
under, you know, unless your body is so beaten up and you're, let's say you're even moderately

1019
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:57,220
healthy, it takes about two or three days for your body to turn around and I recently

1020
01:37:57,220 --> 01:38:02,180
did one where a woman said she was cold and I'm in the southwest, it doesn't get very rarely

1021
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:03,900
near freezing.

1022
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:07,260
And I walked into her house and she had one of these little banana trees and I said, what's

1023
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:08,260
that?

1024
01:38:08,260 --> 01:38:09,260
She goes, bananas, why do you eat them?

1025
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:10,420
Because of potassium, I forget about that.

1026
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:11,420
Get rid of that.

1027
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:16,420
We went out and bought a piece of salmon and poached the fish and she ate it two days later.

1028
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:20,020
She was out in just a long sleeve shirt instead of like a parcher coat in 40 degree weather.

1029
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:21,380
She said, I can't believe it works.

1030
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:23,900
I'm like, I'm not asking you to believe anything.

1031
01:38:23,900 --> 01:38:25,500
I'm just asking you to try it.

1032
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:26,500
There you go.

1033
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:27,180
Wow.

1034
01:38:27,180 --> 01:38:28,180
It's amazing.

1035
01:38:28,180 --> 01:38:29,180
Yes.

1036
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:32,780
And I must eat pretty well because I am rarely ill and if I am it's minor.

1037
01:38:32,780 --> 01:38:35,220
So I do eat salmon in the winter.

1038
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:38,660
I do love to cook and I think that's also critical.

1039
01:38:38,660 --> 01:38:46,180
I was once asked to train pizza hooks all around the United States because I made the best

1040
01:38:46,180 --> 01:38:48,180
pizza in the world.

1041
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:54,100
And I literally told those men in suits, you know, the regional managers had come to

1042
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:59,260
me to ask me to go train everybody in the region and I said, well, you know, love is an ingredient

1043
01:38:59,260 --> 01:39:00,940
and I can't treat that.

1044
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:02,260
What am I supposed to do?

1045
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:05,340
I just love to give people good food.

1046
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:06,820
All right.

1047
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:10,940
Let's move to the realms of science fiction and science faction because we're wrapping up

1048
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:16,180
the end of the show and I don't want to go out without getting some of your predictions.

1049
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:22,460
Just last month, bizarre news coming up all over social media and even making its way

1050
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:29,140
to my local news in South Carolina and I believe in news around the United States.

1051
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:33,100
Two major sonic boom events just occurred.

1052
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:38,820
One happened in Charleston, earth shook, building shook, sonic boom, people thought it was the

1053
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:44,700
end of the world, military government, everyone involved, don't know what it is.

1054
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:45,700
Have no idea.

1055
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:48,260
There was no subsonic, no sonic flights.

1056
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:49,260
There were no rockets.

1057
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:51,060
There was no nothing going on.

1058
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:55,620
There was no media just followed shortly two days later.

1059
01:39:55,620 --> 01:40:02,460
Boom, sonic boom's over new Jersey, earthquake, lightning shakes, not lightning, sorry, but

1060
01:40:02,460 --> 01:40:03,460
earthquakes.

1061
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:08,580
Uh, same thing, military knows nothing, government can explain.

1062
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:12,140
We are entering into a bizarre time right now, folks.

1063
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:17,140
And with all the things that we've discussed in these last two hours, the religious beliefs,

1064
01:40:17,140 --> 01:40:24,620
the ideals of the secret societies, the reason things are being done is all occulted to us.

1065
01:40:24,620 --> 01:40:32,220
And when you start to dig in and find out what's really known, then you can even take this

1066
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:36,420
and apply it, make projections and even get proper predictions.

1067
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:40,300
So I know Greek, you've worked on this very deep.

1068
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:44,380
Maybe you want to outline how you've come to your conclusions, but let's just get it out

1069
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:45,980
there because we're running out of time.

1070
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:51,860
Okay, real quick, you know, understanding the society on this planet, the gestures that

1071
01:40:51,860 --> 01:40:57,740
humanity has been making through their traditions and customs is quite offensive to the spiritual

1072
01:40:57,740 --> 01:40:58,820
realm.

1073
01:40:58,820 --> 01:40:59,980
And it's like, "Woo, wow.

1074
01:40:59,980 --> 01:41:00,980
Why is he saying that?

1075
01:41:00,980 --> 01:41:01,980
Who is he to say that?"

1076
01:41:01,980 --> 01:41:06,180
Well, unless you understand what cannibals, birthdays and dolls have in common, you won't

1077
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:07,700
understand human society.

1078
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:09,020
What does that mean?

1079
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:15,820
Well, back in the ancient days, where they spoke the Babylonian Caldien Hebrew tongue,

1080
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:21,180
like, let's say, the Latin tongue would encompass many others, the people that was called the

1081
01:41:21,180 --> 01:41:26,300
Caldien Hebrew back then, the people then were told to worship these balls or lords.

1082
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:31,060
And the way you worship the Lord is by having a child sacrificed and at the sacrifice, some

1083
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:34,540
of the flesh and the blood of the child was consumed.

1084
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:38,460
And this was done by the priests, known as the cahons, to worship the balls.

1085
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:43,580
So that's where you get the term cannibalism, it's cahon ballism.

1086
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:47,900
So literally cannibalism means priest of the Lord.

1087
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:52,620
And what's interesting about that, it sounds like an abominable act to most people to speak

1088
01:41:52,620 --> 01:41:58,020
about it overtly, but I assure you, you will find this as being very common in ancient times.

1089
01:41:58,020 --> 01:42:02,260
That's why there's thousands of archaeological sites going on right now, but very little

1090
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:07,860
is reported and the crews are rotated because all they find when they dig down is evidence

1091
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:09,820
of human sacrifice.

1092
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:13,860
The disciples cast in the shape of children with boiled bones, with scraping marks and this

1093
01:42:13,860 --> 01:42:19,060
is everywhere and it's so prevalent, that's why you don't hear anything about archaeology

1094
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:20,300
anymore.

1095
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:23,100
The second part, what do dolls have to do about it?

1096
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:29,600
Well once the child was sacrificed, the parents went back to the family and the other children

1097
01:42:29,600 --> 01:42:30,600
asked, "Where is my brother?

1098
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:31,600
Where is my sister?"

1099
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:36,020
So the altar boys of these priests of the Lord are cahon balls, made an effigy of the

1100
01:42:36,020 --> 01:42:39,580
child and told the parents to give the doll or the effigy of the child to the other

1101
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:41,100
children to play with.

1102
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:45,820
So now you know what the history of dolls are, why children are given dolls.

1103
01:42:45,820 --> 01:42:51,340
Now the birthday is interesting because of the 19th century, a small little book in a

1104
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:56,260
university archive, it was called Ancient Rites and Rituals of the Caldean Hebrews and

1105
01:42:56,260 --> 01:43:02,420
Rites was spelled R-I-T-E-S, stated that they started going away from human sacrifice

1106
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:08,380
and baking loaves of sweet bread and putting lights in it and having children and adults

1107
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:11,220
make a wish of prosperity to blow the lights out.

1108
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:17,260
And anyone attending the ceremony was to bring a present to show that the ceremony was effective.

1109
01:43:17,260 --> 01:43:22,040
Now if that is not a parody of the birthday cake or parody of human sacrifice, I don't

1110
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:23,040
know what is.

1111
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:24,640
That is so creepy.

1112
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:25,640
It is very creepy.

1113
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:28,500
So now you wouldn't believe how many people I explain this to and they say it's horrible

1114
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:30,780
and then invite me to a birthday party a week later.

1115
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:32,980
I'm like, are you guys listening?

1116
01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:33,980
But anyway.

1117
01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:34,980
Did you bring a doll?

1118
01:43:34,980 --> 01:43:35,980
Yeah.

1119
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:36,980
Yeah.

1120
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:39,060
So what are the chances of these things going away?

1121
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:43,420
Now this is a gesture being given to the spiritual realm because what people don't understand

1122
01:43:43,420 --> 01:43:48,860
is that the spiritual side or the gods, especially the chief deity, take the dealing of young

1123
01:43:48,860 --> 01:43:55,300
children as being un, as you might have read, they're uncorrupted, corrupting them is not

1124
01:43:55,300 --> 01:43:56,620
good, right?

1125
01:43:56,620 --> 01:44:02,940
They actually, the spiritual realm, the benevolent side actually loves children more than

1126
01:44:02,940 --> 01:44:04,180
parents do.

1127
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:08,300
This is a hard thing to say because a parent's love is something that's very strong and dynamic.

1128
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:13,180
But could you imagine a spiritual being that would love your children more than you love

1129
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:14,180
theirs?

1130
01:44:14,180 --> 01:44:17,780
And now you're putting them through dolls and birthday cakes and, boy, you're going to

1131
01:44:17,780 --> 01:44:19,580
have problems on the spiritual side.

1132
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:21,780
This is just this is not something I believe in.

1133
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:24,780
This is something I am reporting and imparting accurately.

1134
01:44:24,780 --> 01:44:27,500
What I mean, believing in, meaning there is no wiggle room.

1135
01:44:27,500 --> 01:44:32,260
You cannot wiggle out of this once you hear it is what I mean by that.

1136
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:37,100
So what is coming upon when you read about all the doom and gloom and the end of the world?

1137
01:44:37,100 --> 01:44:42,460
It's not the end of the world, but it's the end or stopping of these types of traditions.

1138
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:46,100
The earth is going to be just fine, you see.

1139
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:49,260
Right, absolutely.

1140
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:51,100
The world meaning that society.

1141
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:52,100
Yeah, exactly.

1142
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:58,460
Yeah, humanity that's on the chopping block here and we're definitely looking into, I

1143
01:44:58,460 --> 01:45:06,500
mean, the amount of reports that we get of coming solar EMPs, they're saying not if when,

1144
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:11,700
you know, and this of course would shut down global power networks and pretty much just

1145
01:45:11,700 --> 01:45:18,380
turn off the world or for us, we have the ideas that they're warning us of asteroids.

1146
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:24,220
We had a poffis, which of course is the Egyptian serpent deity of destruction that's supposed

1147
01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:28,020
to come back around in 2029 and destroy all life.

1148
01:45:28,020 --> 01:45:30,460
So yeah, let's get into that.

1149
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:35,420
And how does that relate to, yeah, this, yeah, you know, in many of the texts, you'll see

1150
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:39,420
that there are cosmic events that are going to be, I call them cosmic kill shots on the

1151
01:45:39,420 --> 01:45:44,180
earth because the earth isn't very happy either on what we're doing.

1152
01:45:44,180 --> 01:45:46,780
So we meaning the collective human race.

1153
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:53,020
I try to set myself apart by, by, by behavior and other things and try to give information

1154
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:54,020
to others.

1155
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:59,340
And we can't deny the guilt of the golems that are known as corporations.

1156
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:00,340
Right.

1157
01:46:00,340 --> 01:46:04,660
Now, a corporation could just be a group of people forming a fictional entity to make the

1158
01:46:04,660 --> 01:46:06,740
innocent pay for the guilty.

1159
01:46:06,740 --> 01:46:11,060
That's all it is because you're fixing to do something wrong, start a corporation and then

1160
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:13,540
just collapse and then no one can go after anything.

1161
01:46:13,540 --> 01:46:17,340
But not all corporations are like that, but that's essentially what they're doing.

1162
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:21,060
Yeah, I guess I had to throw that in there because I've found humans to be such wonderful

1163
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:23,140
beings just completely misguided.

1164
01:46:23,140 --> 01:46:27,020
So yeah, we are misguided all the way to birthday cakes and dolls.

1165
01:46:27,020 --> 01:46:28,300
So let's, yeah, sure.

1166
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:32,380
Now, the final, I just want to just because we don't have a lot of time.

1167
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:36,620
What you call the early 2030s, and this has been also interesting.

1168
01:46:36,620 --> 01:46:40,980
I don't like saying NASA and all that, but in scientists, but they do put out information

1169
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:45,280
quite accurately and then retract it or they cover it up or change it.

1170
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:51,620
But unmistakably with even the basic mathematics and observations that the mainstream scientists

1171
01:46:51,620 --> 01:46:52,620
are looking at.

1172
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:57,940
And then some major asteroids are going to be coming into the late 2020s, early 2030s.

1173
01:46:57,940 --> 01:47:02,620
I think they have one pinned around what they call October 2028, something like that, a

1174
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:03,620
poffis.

1175
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:07,460
Okay, that's pretty good actually because what we find in the ancient texts is that there

1176
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:08,860
are going to be three kill shots.

1177
01:47:08,860 --> 01:47:13,060
Two of them are going to be asteroid types and the third one is going to be solar.

1178
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:17,660
Now the two asteroid types, so we'll go through the first one is pretty common.

1179
01:47:17,660 --> 01:47:21,860
You'll probably be shown what it looks like, you know, that potato shape or cratered

1180
01:47:21,860 --> 01:47:23,860
rock kind of thing.

1181
01:47:23,860 --> 01:47:27,020
And that will hit a particular part of the earth.

1182
01:47:27,020 --> 01:47:32,300
And the second one, and it will kill many people, many casualties will be in the billions,

1183
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:34,300
but with a B, not an M.

1184
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:38,300
Let me just ask if you have any projections as to where that would hit.

1185
01:47:38,300 --> 01:47:39,300
Yes.

1186
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:42,860
What's interesting when we look, for example, at the biblical text, it says one third of

1187
01:47:42,860 --> 01:47:47,100
the sea, one third of the fish, one third of the ships, three times it gives you, so

1188
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:48,900
you got to look at something.

1189
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:54,780
When you, we have to define when the biblical text states the sea, it's specific about the

1190
01:47:54,780 --> 01:47:59,540
Mediterranean, unless it speaks about all the seas, right, in plural.

1191
01:47:59,540 --> 01:48:01,100
This one is singular.

1192
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:04,940
So if you look at a map of the Mediterranean, you'll see it's divided in three parts.

1193
01:48:04,940 --> 01:48:09,860
Greece and Italy comes down as a peninsula, if you will, and divides it into three different

1194
01:48:09,860 --> 01:48:10,860
parts.

1195
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:15,780
So one of those sections is going to be where the epicenter of this drop is going to be.

1196
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:20,100
And you can guess which one, it's probably going to be the one closest between Greece and

1197
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:26,260
the Levant, because that would be more towards where more people are inhabited, for example.

1198
01:48:26,260 --> 01:48:27,260
Okay?

1199
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:30,940
Now the second asteroid, if it's all right, will go on with that one.

1200
01:48:30,940 --> 01:48:31,940
Please do.

1201
01:48:31,940 --> 01:48:34,380
You will not be shown any imagery of that.

1202
01:48:34,380 --> 01:48:36,140
Well, wait a second.

1203
01:48:36,140 --> 01:48:37,140
Why not?

1204
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:40,820
Well, because too many questions will be asked if you're shown that one.

1205
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:44,300
And the reason why you will not be shown is because it has an extremely high degree

1206
01:48:44,300 --> 01:48:45,820
of manufacture.

1207
01:48:45,820 --> 01:48:49,700
It will appear as a flat disc with an aspect ratio of about seven to one, meaning it'll

1208
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:51,700
be seven times wider than it is thick.

1209
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:53,860
And I'll have a hole in the middle of it.

1210
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:56,420
Very highly polished stone surface.

1211
01:48:56,420 --> 01:49:01,060
Now the last thing you want to do is now put out a photograph, say we have this two mile

1212
01:49:01,060 --> 01:49:05,860
wide near-earth object that might collide, and they show you a picture of something of

1213
01:49:05,860 --> 01:49:07,700
high degree of manufacture like that.

1214
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:10,540
People will freak out too many questions.

1215
01:49:10,540 --> 01:49:12,900
You will not be shown that one.

1216
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:13,900
Quite interesting.

1217
01:49:13,900 --> 01:49:15,060
This is in the ancient text.

1218
01:49:15,060 --> 01:49:16,180
You don't have to believe in it.

1219
01:49:16,180 --> 01:49:18,260
I'm just reporting on it, right?

1220
01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:21,100
If you want to bring an umbrella or do what you, if it's going to rain tomorrow, you don't

1221
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:24,740
have to believe it, but when it does, it's up to you if you were or encoder not.

1222
01:49:24,740 --> 01:49:26,860
This is how I like to give the information.

1223
01:49:26,860 --> 01:49:31,780
Almost in a cold fashion, because I have to disconnect myself from this from things, whether

1224
01:49:31,780 --> 01:49:33,900
they're positive or negative, you see.

1225
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:34,900
Right.

1226
01:49:34,900 --> 01:49:35,900
Right.

1227
01:49:35,900 --> 01:49:36,900
Now the third thing is a solar event.

1228
01:49:36,900 --> 01:49:42,100
Most people are aware of solar flaring and types of things like that.

1229
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:45,820
This third event is going to be a solar event that has never happened in known history.

1230
01:49:45,820 --> 01:49:47,580
It's not going to be a solar flare.

1231
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:49,340
It'll be the sun.

1232
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:55,380
Imagine the sun has a dimmer knob on it, and right now it's been at one-seventh.

1233
01:49:55,380 --> 01:50:00,260
Around that time period, after people recover or sort of recover from these two hits, the

1234
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:04,740
sun will be turned up at full volume, and put that in perspective, what it will look

1235
01:50:04,740 --> 01:50:09,020
like, is the full moon will be as bright as the new-day sun.

1236
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:16,020
We're talking an ambient daytime temperature of well above 150 to 180 degrees Fahrenheit

1237
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:18,260
for about a week or so.

1238
01:50:18,260 --> 01:50:24,340
We know that it will be around the lawful timekeeping of the moon, because the reference

1239
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:28,260
is given that the full moon will appear as the new-day sun.

1240
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:30,980
The actual sun itself will be extremely hot.

1241
01:50:30,980 --> 01:50:32,780
You will no longer be able to see its disc.

1242
01:50:32,780 --> 01:50:37,340
It will be like the entire horizon will be lit almost as bright as the sun is.

1243
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:41,900
It will also cause probably damage or destruction of all vegetation.

1244
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:43,420
Now, most people hear this.

1245
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:47,580
They think it's complete catastrophe, but it's not because if you look at a forest that's

1246
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:53,660
been burned almost days later, you have an emergency of minor vegetation coming back, and

1247
01:50:53,660 --> 01:50:56,460
within a few months the shrubs and other things come back.

1248
01:50:56,460 --> 01:51:01,260
So it doesn't mean that there will never be plants on the earth again.

1249
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:05,700
So all of these clustered events are things that might people might want to, I never

1250
01:51:05,700 --> 01:51:08,420
want to send people to read and study the Bible.

1251
01:51:08,420 --> 01:51:09,420
Why?

1252
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:10,420
And I'm not being sarcastic.

1253
01:51:10,420 --> 01:51:12,540
You're not going to understand anything in it, so leave it alone.

1254
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:17,740
But if those that hear me say something like that are feel antagonized enough and want

1255
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:21,420
to prove me wrong, by all means, please study these ancient texts.

1256
01:51:21,420 --> 01:51:25,780
If you could even look at what they call the Mahabharata, the Rig Vita's, you could look

1257
01:51:25,780 --> 01:51:27,500
at the Biblical texts, the Quran.

1258
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:31,540
You will find that they are all in agreement in many of their points.

1259
01:51:31,540 --> 01:51:33,900
And how do you think they knew this?

1260
01:51:33,900 --> 01:51:40,380
Oh, what's interesting is, you know how people discuss source or creator?

1261
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:46,820
They actually make the source and the creator as being a dummy, or illiterate, or mute, or

1262
01:51:46,820 --> 01:51:47,820
dumb.

1263
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:52,520
Because if there is a source or creator, are they intelligent enough to communicate with

1264
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:53,520
us?

1265
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,340
That's a sounds like a stupid question, of course they are.

1266
01:51:56,340 --> 01:52:00,740
And would they communicate with us in a certain way that would allow us for still going

1267
01:52:00,740 --> 01:52:05,080
through the curing period of 7,000 years that mankind requires, with that being heavily

1268
01:52:05,080 --> 01:52:06,080
disturbed?

1269
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:12,260
Because if we look in history, the mankind accelerated his, let's say, evolution and he had

1270
01:52:12,260 --> 01:52:13,780
to be stopped.

1271
01:52:13,780 --> 01:52:16,580
And you know, Tower of Babel, things like that, right?

1272
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:23,380
There was also another cosmic censorship that was put on the planet around 2500 BC, 2500

1273
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:28,560
years ago, and that's where all the world's religions emerged pretty much from except

1274
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:30,700
for Islam later on.

1275
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:33,660
So we are being censored and held in a curing period.

1276
01:52:33,660 --> 01:52:37,640
What I mean by a curing period is like when you bake a cake, it's 45 minutes in the oven.

1277
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:40,580
If you take it out half way, it doesn't work.

1278
01:52:40,580 --> 01:52:44,540
So there's a curing period of 6,000 years which already ended in roughly 1998.

1279
01:52:44,540 --> 01:52:48,300
And we're in the credits part right now.

1280
01:52:48,300 --> 01:52:54,460
And all of these communications were given through man in very, let's say, inspiration.

1281
01:52:54,460 --> 01:52:58,260
For example, let me just give, and some of it was direct communication.

1282
01:52:58,260 --> 01:53:03,340
For example, if you read in the book of Jeremiah, in one of the passages, it says all the towns

1283
01:53:03,340 --> 01:53:07,220
paraphrasing here, all the people come and knock on his door and they ask Jeremiah, what

1284
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:08,220
were you told?

1285
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:12,660
Well, how would everyone in town know that a message was being transmitted to this one

1286
01:53:12,660 --> 01:53:13,660
particular person?

1287
01:53:13,660 --> 01:53:17,580
Well, maybe because it was like a hovering UFO over the house for three days and no one

1288
01:53:17,580 --> 01:53:19,500
could approach because of the force field?

1289
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:24,740
Well, you know, this is very much like the stories of the angels that visit and, and

1290
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:28,020
what, everybody wants to have sex with them?

1291
01:53:28,020 --> 01:53:31,620
Yeah, which is also, you know, there's three, by the way, I'll throw this in real quick.

1292
01:53:31,620 --> 01:53:34,820
There's three human type-looking forms.

1293
01:53:34,820 --> 01:53:36,300
No one has discussed and I'll throw this in.

1294
01:53:36,300 --> 01:53:37,900
It could be another show.

1295
01:53:37,900 --> 01:53:43,340
You have the sons of gods, the sons of Adam, and then the, the Nephilim, which are the

1296
01:53:43,340 --> 01:53:44,340
hybrids.

1297
01:53:44,340 --> 01:53:49,740
And the King James Bible says the sons of gods took the daughters of men and had the Nephilim,

1298
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:50,740
right?

1299
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:51,740
That's not what it says.

1300
01:53:51,740 --> 01:53:53,540
It says they took the sons of Adam.

1301
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:54,540
There's a big difference.

1302
01:53:54,540 --> 01:53:57,260
I mean, it's denoting a bloodline.

1303
01:53:57,260 --> 01:54:01,220
So you have a line of Adam, the, the sons of gods.

1304
01:54:01,220 --> 01:54:02,220
Let me just throw this in.

1305
01:54:02,220 --> 01:54:09,140
This is the members area only are the progen, or the, the offspring of the subcontractors

1306
01:54:09,140 --> 01:54:13,820
in the spiritual realm that help redo the earth because the earth is a redo, if you read

1307
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:15,820
in Genesis, by the way.

1308
01:54:15,820 --> 01:54:16,820
Yeah.

1309
01:54:16,820 --> 01:54:19,420
There's two Genesis accounts.

1310
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:24,220
There are two births of man and as you say, there's the line of Adam in the second.

1311
01:54:24,220 --> 01:54:25,220
Well, there actually isn't.

1312
01:54:25,220 --> 01:54:26,220
Let me just throw this in.

1313
01:54:26,220 --> 01:54:27,220
Okay.

1314
01:54:27,220 --> 01:54:28,220
This is a misunderstanding.

1315
01:54:28,220 --> 01:54:31,220
When you read Genesis chapter one, it shouldn't end there.

1316
01:54:31,220 --> 01:54:33,380
It should end around verse three of chapter two.

1317
01:54:33,380 --> 01:54:38,140
The reason why is if you ended at the round, verse three, chapter two, it has all the elements

1318
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:41,980
of an affidavit for putting evidence into a court case.

1319
01:54:41,980 --> 01:54:45,860
All chapter one is, is if you were going to court and you were witness to something, you

1320
01:54:45,860 --> 01:54:48,060
were going to, or make a claim to something, you're right.

1321
01:54:48,060 --> 01:54:51,700
What's called a legal affidavit and then sign it.

1322
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:52,540
So that's all it is.

1323
01:54:52,540 --> 01:54:56,100
It starts off with the legal precedent or lawful precedent.

1324
01:54:56,100 --> 01:54:58,580
Chapter two is where it gets into the story.

1325
01:54:58,580 --> 01:55:03,380
Now you also have to realize that the first five books of the Bible were delivered by Moses,

1326
01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:09,220
roughly 2,500 years after the fact to be given to the people of Israel, let's say, as one

1327
01:55:09,220 --> 01:55:12,060
would give a constitution to form a nation.

1328
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:17,340
So they put the first authoritative document known as the, what I call the affidavit, because

1329
01:55:17,340 --> 01:55:22,060
if you want to know more about creation, you don't necessarily go to chapter two of Genesis,

1330
01:55:22,060 --> 01:55:28,620
you go to the book of Psalms between chapters 102 to 108 if you want extreme detail on how

1331
01:55:28,620 --> 01:55:30,140
a lot of it was done.

1332
01:55:30,140 --> 01:55:31,140
Okay.

1333
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:32,140
All right.

1334
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:33,140
Good.

1335
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:34,140
Good.

1336
01:55:34,140 --> 01:55:37,060
I mean, we all need to understand this stuff because it does rule our world.

1337
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:41,180
And I think everybody would be quite a mess with me if I didn't ask you, do you have an idea

1338
01:55:41,180 --> 01:55:44,620
of when these kill shots might occur?

1339
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:51,180
The early 2030s with about a 95% right now, I would say, but as we get closer, we can give

1340
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:52,180
more accurate time.

1341
01:55:52,180 --> 01:55:53,500
The reason why is this.

1342
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:56,380
Let's say I'm going to drive a 2,000 mile road trip.

1343
01:55:56,380 --> 01:56:00,020
If you ask me how long it's going to take, I might say, well, it should take three days.

1344
01:56:00,020 --> 01:56:02,260
But half way down, there's a little glitch.

1345
01:56:02,260 --> 01:56:04,660
I need to stop for an extra time.

1346
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:06,260
Then the time spreads out a little bit.

1347
01:56:06,260 --> 01:56:10,940
But if certain events happen and I'm saying one exit away, then you know no matter what

1348
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:13,140
happens, I'm no more than 20 minutes away.

1349
01:56:13,140 --> 01:56:14,140
You see?

1350
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:17,580
So all of these prophetic texts never give dates or days.

1351
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:21,340
They give events when you see this, then the next thing will come.

1352
01:56:21,340 --> 01:56:22,340
You see?

1353
01:56:22,340 --> 01:56:23,340
Gotcha.

1354
01:56:23,340 --> 01:56:24,340
Got it.

1355
01:56:24,340 --> 01:56:25,340
All right.

1356
01:56:25,340 --> 01:56:30,020
So yeah, it's definitely keying up with the mainstream media's projection of catastrophes

1357
01:56:30,020 --> 01:56:31,020
on the rise.

1358
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:33,220
Yes, it is.

1359
01:56:33,220 --> 01:56:39,140
As you can see, this is, it's happening already with these sonic booms going on over South

1360
01:56:39,140 --> 01:56:44,220
Carolina and New Jersey, things are happening and no one knows what the heck's going on.

1361
01:56:44,220 --> 01:56:49,580
So I'm so glad there are people like the Greek out there to start to lay this down and

1362
01:56:49,580 --> 01:56:52,940
give us more insight to know what to learn.

1363
01:56:52,940 --> 01:56:57,780
You know, this is more critical to learning is to know what to learn.

1364
01:56:57,780 --> 01:57:00,820
And I find this all just really amazing, Greek.

1365
01:57:00,820 --> 01:57:04,060
I think this has been a wonderful show.

1366
01:57:04,060 --> 01:57:05,060
Well, thank you.

1367
01:57:05,060 --> 01:57:06,060
Yeah, I do my best.

1368
01:57:06,060 --> 01:57:08,660
And thanks for having me.

1369
01:57:08,660 --> 01:57:10,660
I had a problem.

1370
01:57:10,660 --> 01:57:11,660
Let's see.

1371
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:16,660
I had one thing I was going to go out with and I lost it in my notes and I asked it, they're

1372
01:57:16,660 --> 01:57:19,220
going, oh, what was that last thing?

1373
01:57:19,220 --> 01:57:27,740
But questions are being asked and answers are not always forthcoming and it's hard to know

1374
01:57:27,740 --> 01:57:29,740
where to trust your information.

1375
01:57:29,740 --> 01:57:35,540
And I just want you to go, folks, that we really vet our information and we also want to give

1376
01:57:35,540 --> 01:57:40,540
you all the resources necessary to go and learn this for yourself because everything

1377
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:42,100
we say is not opinion.

1378
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:43,100
It really isn't.

1379
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:47,580
It's based off of all the science and we're still out here going, well, what does it all

1380
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:48,580
mean?

1381
01:57:48,580 --> 01:57:52,180
There's much more to our soul and our spirit, something that we didn't quite get into

1382
01:57:52,180 --> 01:57:57,140
in this show, but we'll have a Greek back on to get deeper into that because that is

1383
01:57:57,140 --> 01:58:00,780
one of the critical factors for us to focus on.

1384
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:06,820
And I hope that we all can do that, come out there, become friends, share this information,

1385
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:12,980
share ourselves with each other and most especially share the proper food for everyone so

1386
01:58:12,980 --> 01:58:16,780
that we don't get sick and we can have the strength to do everything we need to do, right?

1387
01:58:16,780 --> 01:58:17,780
There's a Greek.

1388
01:58:17,780 --> 01:58:18,780
Oh, you bet.

1389
01:58:18,780 --> 01:58:24,260
Yeah, food is, yeah, it's that's food clothing and shelter and no matter how broke you

1390
01:58:24,260 --> 01:58:28,620
are or how rich you are, those are the three most important things we can do right now.

1391
01:58:28,620 --> 01:58:29,620
Physically.

1392
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:30,620
Yeah.

1393
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:32,900
Well, I don't think that thoughts ever going to come back to my mind.

1394
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:35,340
I'll think of it after I sign off of the show.

1395
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:37,460
But yeah, amazing, amazing.

1396
01:58:37,460 --> 01:58:39,580
Oh, I remember now.

1397
01:58:39,580 --> 01:58:46,420
Just one last thing I wanted to say was that I will be blown away if this discus thing

1398
01:58:46,420 --> 01:58:47,820
comes through.

1399
01:58:47,820 --> 01:58:54,020
I've seen something similar to that that's equated to the Syrians and it was something

1400
01:58:54,020 --> 01:58:58,620
to do with the Dogon tribe but it was actually a disc found in China that described a race

1401
01:58:58,620 --> 01:59:00,180
from Syrias.

1402
01:59:00,180 --> 01:59:02,180
It was, you know, and we're saying it.

1403
01:59:02,180 --> 01:59:05,500
You could play it, you looked like you could play it with a record, like a record.

1404
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:06,500
Yeah.

1405
01:59:06,500 --> 01:59:07,500
Wow.

1406
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:08,500
Yeah, very much so.

1407
01:59:08,500 --> 01:59:09,500
Yeah, you'll find these commonalities.

1408
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:14,780
Again, most of the time I advise to anyone is take the information, ruminate, meditate

1409
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:16,860
on it, file it away for later.

1410
01:59:16,860 --> 01:59:21,220
It's not going to do much for you right now but at least you'll be able to add it to

1411
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:24,940
a collection of things that when they do start coming, you can piece it together and

1412
01:59:24,940 --> 01:59:26,980
say, wow, we were told.

1413
01:59:26,980 --> 01:59:27,980
Yes.

1414
01:59:27,980 --> 01:59:32,060
The information will find a way and if you open that door it will find its way in.

1415
01:59:32,060 --> 01:59:35,580
I will forever say I never went looking for any of this.

1416
01:59:35,580 --> 01:59:37,260
It came and found me.

1417
01:59:37,260 --> 01:59:42,100
So take that to heart because it will come and I love you all.

1418
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:46,180
Thank you all so much for participating in this wonderful experiment.

1419
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:49,180
We call it the free zone and I will see you all next week.

1420
01:59:49,180 --> 01:59:50,180
All right.

1421
01:59:50,180 --> 01:59:50,780
Have a good night.
