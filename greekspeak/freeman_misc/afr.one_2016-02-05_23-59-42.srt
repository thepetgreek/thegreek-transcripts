00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Hey. Got you. All right, cool.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yep.

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Yep.

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Uh, no, we'll just, uh, I mean, yeah, I won't introduce it the way I normally do.

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I just, you know, there we go.

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hey, something, something, uh, to consider, Danny, I really want you to keep this in your mind

7
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:54,000
as if you get the RSS feed when you go through WordPress. All right.

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah.

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah.

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh, and we are live on American Freedom Radio at AmericanFreedomRadio.com.

11
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This is an unscheduled broadcast. It just is going to emerge like this from time to time.

12
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And in case you don't recognize my voice, this is Chaco Chelly host of the O'Chelly Effect.

13
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So meanwhile, who do I have with me?

14
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Well, and an unusual thing because there is no title for this. It just is as it is.

15
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And, uh, yeah.

16
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah.

17
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:54,000
There you go. And of course, people consider this, uh, at this time, most notably, because here I go, I always have to tie it back to something that can be related to, right?

18
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Of course, the discussions regarding land grabs, the Bureau of Land Management, G, what are people's rights, what is the process, what are they actually arguing over, where did this all begin, the bundys, the ranch, the ranchers, beneficial use, the government, the lines they cross, you know, I could just blur it all by you and it really doesn't matter.

19
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And it doesn't matter.

20
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yeah.

21
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah.

22
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah.

23
00:06:42,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah.

24
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Correct. And the other thing is, you know, I refer you to the O'Chelly and the Greek archive and look for something that references the Constitution.

25
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay. There you go. And we can dispatch with the discussion of the Constitution by making a reference. There you go. There's your point of reference for that particular document.

26
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's move forward.

35
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:18,000
[ Silence ]

36
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Well, let me just say something here, too. The fact that you go back to the newspapers of the time, the magazines of the time is always very helpful.

37
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I can tell you that personally, I own a few of the, say, the newspapers that were issued today that, because everybody knows I do a lot of JFK research, right?

38
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So one of the things that I acquired for my own personal collection immediately, of course, were the newspapers from around the country in various cities, the day he was killed, the day after he was killed during that entire weekend to show what the reporting was like to take a look at, not only that, but the context.

39
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Let's just say how much did things cost? What sort of stores were around then? What else was going on in the news that particular day, which, of course, was dominated by the Kennedy assassination?

40
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:24,000
But what was happening even the day before? All of these things are extremely relevant when considering how something was received by the society, because for a very long time, previous to internet time, guess what?

41
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Dissemination was through these paper artifacts at this point, I could call them artifacts because of what they are now. But I mean, in real time, this was one of the best methods of distribution to the public.

42
00:11:40,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So when you take a look at something and how relative it was and how widely known it may have been and what else was widely known at the time, definitely these articles are perfect for consideration when you want to take that look back and realistically step into the era.

43
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And there you go, that's only 50 years ago, but even so, it does give you a different perspective from that which maybe is produced in a modern documentary on the subject.

44
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And so I tell you that what you've done there is contextual research based on the publicly accessible information that was being distributed among the people.

45
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
So perfectly sensible. Anyway, that was just my commentary for that too.

Wait a minute, wait a minute, that's a problem because anybody who knows anything about what they call Native Americans and what I was quite satisfied to call Indians as children has a child.

96
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You know, it seems to me as though our history tells us, I mean again, guessing a bit because a lot of it has been obviscated, but truthfully I think that our history could easily reveal to us even in part that the majority of the land we now describe as America was actually occupied by individuals who were Native to it.

97
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
See how I'm stressing these words here.

98
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:40,000
And so therefore, doesn't that kind of mean that they should not invade or take over or do anything with what would be considered Indian land?

130
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Right. Now one thing, just one last commentary from me before we launch into this is this.

131
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I ask you the listener to this, whoever you may be at whatever time it is, to consider the fact that at the time the general population was not aware of the mechanism that was in play was not aware of the real legal consequence of it or of the system that was in place.

132
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:55,000
What they were being made aware of, why is this relevant? What they were being made aware of is that these very dangerous, savage people who had strange beliefs did not look like the general population.

133
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:11,000
They in fact were something to be afraid of. So to the general population it was very simple. They could be decimated and far beyond pulverized whatever word it is you want to use.

134
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I don't know what the active verb version of genocide is, but let's just say that this was all justifiable.

135
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Because the other people, and also to the public's mind, the body...

136
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Yes. Well they were acceptable and therefore it's just fine that you know I'm by my count at least a million Iraqis have probably been killed.

137
00:30:41,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I did say a million and countless other just will just be really blunt and nasty about it, but countless other brown people or slightly brown people have been slaughtered, decimated, whatever depending on how you limit the geographical container on the subject have been absolutely beset upon for similar reasons.

138
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:37,000
In the public's mind mind you, I'm just giving you the whole... yeah.

139
00:31:37,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Well, right. Well I'm just making the commentary because somebody might say, well gee you know that worked that way because all the people that were around at the time who were supposedly benefiting as the individuals who were being represented by the United States and their various entities etc etc.

140
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Well they acquiesced to this because why? Well if you demonize the people and you show that they are different and I'm just pointing out that the technique hasn't changed.

141
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Yeah that's all.

142
00:32:41,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Well right and I also advise you as a companion,

143
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I also advise you as a companion piece in case you're just picking through the archives to check on the Oceleon the Greek episode which I don't remember the number off the top of my head but I do believe it was about Satanism.

144
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Okay so yeah believe it.

145
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Yeah well but it does I'm not telling people just to go listen randomly though am I.

146
00:33:49,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Thank you.

147
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Right.

148
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:55,000
[silence]

149
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Right and part of the absolute necessity and I do mean absolute necessity of participation in just about any of the ancient goddess religions because there's more than one they all have their roots in the same very same sort of tenants but the truth is that you have to actually you know here we go I'll give it to you very straight and simple.

150
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:48,000
The concept that it is fully acceptable for you to be lied to is literally based on the fact that you accept it so if you accept a lie the lie therefore becomes perfectly reasonable it's it's a good thing to do in fact so if I can rob you if I can steal from you and get you to say thank you for doing it.

151
00:35:48,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Then I am fully in compliance with my adherence to the ancient goddess religion that's that's the truth.

152
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:23,000
[silence]

153
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:45,000
[silence]

154
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Right.

155
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Okay.

156
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Oh sure.

157
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Well Lewis and Clark for example yeah.

158
00:37:37,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yeah we're not saying that this is the original you know plan of action that was created in exactly that year as a matter of fact the point being made repeatedly by me in every presentation I do is that guess what the mechanism has not changed the motivation has not changed in fact it is the very same game being played over and over again no matter how many times you take out that monopoly game.

159
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Or whatever let's let's be a little more modern no matter how many times you take out your ps4 and you stick a disc in it and therefore and so on and so forth there's still a controller there's still a game being played there is still something which is being interacted with and guess what you can change the way it's packaged you can change what you call it but fact is the guts of it the idea that it is there for your amusement.

160
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And that there is still some sort of thing to contend with well the principles are effectively the same and that is the way the code there you go the history works this way.

161
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:13,000
There we go.

162
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Right.

163
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Well in fact even the the name America in some way relates to one of these explorers previous to it there was a guy named America vest buti that was sent out to do similar things of course he did not discover America or anything like that but anyway that's kind of irrelevant to

164
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:13,000
America.

165
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Much like a surveyor does today when engaging in a legal process right now guys that go out and measure it and say you have this type of property

166
00:40:42,000 --> 00:41:05,000
you have this many trees grass grows on it or doesn't grow on it etc etc right.

167
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:16,000
There you go.

168
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:31,000
All right the land in what's on it just like the surveyor there's a home okay there's also a garage there are three flag poles whatever same thing.

169
00:41:31,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Yeah.

170
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Yeah.

171
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Yeah.

172
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Yeah.

173
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Right.

174
00:43:31,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Okay today I'll give you for instance I got a notice from a PayPal which said that they were part of a class action lawsuit right where a bunch of people get together and actually target not a person but a thing which is a corporation okay and they seek damages and actually I have the right to fill out a form and make a claim.

175
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:10,000
To get a part of this class action lawsuit because I have been recognized as one of the damaged parties okay.

176
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Yeah.

177
00:44:38,000 --> 00:45:05,000
No but you know what it's very very real because I was actually involved in one of the situations once and that's precisely what happens they still collect their fees in some cases as part of the situation somehow or other the person they're suing lines of giving them money you know just to the attorney not to the damage party and and suddenly you have you know a failure to have.

178
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Those damages recognized in the case just disappears and yeah.

179
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Okay.

180
00:45:47,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Right.

181
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Right. No to the list there we are now entering the place where things don't make sense.

182
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Yes literally just to wind it back once more and then I promise I'll let you fly because it's going to get crazy from here on out but here's the thing yeah literally what you just said just to make make make it very perfectly plainly clear is that they created a description they create a piece of paper or they don't create a piece of paper.

183
00:46:39,000 --> 00:47:03,000
They put together a piece of paper which then becomes the representation of something hardly even matters what it is and then they literally because now that thing exists then create an action against that thing which they created did I miss a step here.

184
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Okay.

185
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Right. I just wanted to.

186
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Right.

187
00:47:46,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Right.

188
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:20,000
No.

189
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Right.

190
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Right.

191
00:48:45,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Right.

192
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Right.

193
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Right.

194
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Yeah. Right.

195
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Right.

196
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Right. Now look. Here's a couple of notes just real quick. First of all if you go to a post office today you will still find legal notices hung on the wall somewhere.

197
00:50:42,000 --> 00:51:02,000
If you look in the back of those things we call newspapers from time to time I do pick one up and guess what I see that there is on occasion something they call legal notices and these are perfectly acceptable menus to post such things.

198
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Okay. Just pointing out that you know just pointing out that this is not you know an ancient mechanism. Yeah. That's all.

199
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Right.

200
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Right.

201
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Right.

202
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Right.

203
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Right.

204
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Well yeah that's interesting too because just the word trespass I've often heard it used in other ways and it sounds to me like a singular trespass is something that in a lot of philosophical veins let's you say.

205
00:52:45,000 --> 00:53:00,000
And initial trespass is not a violation necessarily but.

206
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Right.

207
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Right. And so it's to note it to break it down once again just in case that was too fast coming from you the idea is that if someone wants to let's just say theoretically send a legal notice to be applied posted on your property.

208
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Okay. They do because your sign says no trespassing have the ability to go there that first time and do it without being in violation of trespassing so it is a notice it's a proper notice and literally they've left the loophole open for themselves.

209
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Now if the sign did say no trespass or do not trespass this is a bit different because that means that you're not allowed to be there without expressly given permission.

210
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:35,000
I mean yeah.

211
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Right.

212
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Mm hmm.

213
00:54:50,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Yeah.

214
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
That's the bottom line there.

Oh no no no no look this is this has nothing to do. Yeah. Right. I know. You could note that if you like but I mean we also weren't talking about how Abner Double Day laid down the rules for baseball either.

232
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000

00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Yeah. No, we all recognize that we're on the same rock and so on and so forth but not everybody's happy about it. Let's put it down.

[BLANK_AUDIO]

239
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Well, right. Yeah, that's a whole other thing but I mean that's like trying to tell you the entire backstory for situations that you see emerging now. Nobody, nobody really wants to hear that.

240
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Let's talk about the meat of it and the meat of it is here's the process which is being used so now you can actually understand why it emerges as it does. That's all.

241
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:53,000
[BLANK_AUDIO]

242
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Right. That was going to be my next point is that you know you can take this as a matter of fact because we haven't even bothered to to convlude the situation with the rest of that story.

243
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:23,000
You can take this and understand that this is applicable to various situations. You know somebody, literally this is why I keep going back to imagine your house and somebody coming to your property.

244
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Right because it works the same way.

[silence]

271
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:26,820
Hmm, like right now, we still have the territories to this day, two of them most notably

272
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:53,820
are what Puerto Rico, and I think the Philippines is still our territory.

273
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:54,820
Right.

274
01:05:54,820 --> 01:06:18,820
[silence]

275
01:06:18,820 --> 01:06:33,820
No, but that's what it is, isn't it? Yeah.

276
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:51,820
Hmm.

277
01:06:51,820 --> 01:07:07,820
Hmm.

278
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:20,820
Yeah, it could be tangible, even a coupon that's expired has what, a two tenths of a penny worth of value, or whatever, yeah, it actually has some value, but this actually is just an idea that's observable and doesn't actually have a physical value.

279
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:27,820
And actually have a physical manifestation behind it, and that's all it is.

280
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:48,820
[silence]

281
01:07:48,820 --> 01:08:16,820
Organ. Yeah, actually you could have heard in the alternative media from one person who said, "Why did they not attempt to exhaust the legal process?"

282
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:31,820
And well, there was two of us anyway.

283
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:57,820
[silence]

284
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:14,820
Hmm.

285
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:29,820
No, we only mentioned it in as much as it is not part of the conversation. I think that's about it, yeah.

286
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:44,820
Hmm.

287
01:09:44,820 --> 01:10:13,820
[silence]

288
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:30,820
Hmm, but, hmm.

289
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:45,820
Hmm, but, hmm.

290
01:10:45,820 --> 01:11:05,820
Hmm.

291
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:15,820
Hmm.

292
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:30,820
Hmm.

293
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:38,820
Hmm.

294
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:48,820
Hmm.

295
01:11:48,820 --> 01:12:03,820
Hmm.

296
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:28,820
Hmm.

297
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:43,820
Hmm.

298
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:58,820
Hmm.

299
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:21,820
Hmm.

300
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:36,820
Hmm.

301
01:13:36,820 --> 01:14:01,820
Hmm.

302
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:23,820
Yeah.

303
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:42,820
Hmm.

304
01:14:42,820 --> 01:15:02,820
Hmm.

305
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:30,820
Well, always does.

306
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:45,820
Hmm.

307
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:52,820
Yeah, I was going to say you are notified in one form or another.

308
01:15:52,820 --> 01:16:07,820
So, back to the meat of the issue because you really stuck to this really well.

309
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:22,820
I think we should just leave it there and continue on.

310
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:37,820
What happens next in the process?

311
01:16:37,820 --> 01:17:01,820
Hmm.

312
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:15,820
Well, let's finish up with the follow-through on the explanation though, just a bit.

313
01:17:15,820 --> 01:17:30,820
Now, enforcement comes in, this is where we sort of left it and then we talked about, you know.

314
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:48,820
Right.

315
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:56,820
Oh yeah.

316
01:17:56,820 --> 01:18:06,820
Right.

317
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:15,100
your head count. Guess what, you could have a head count and quite honestly scalps are impossible

318
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:20,100
to misrepresent. If you've got that many scalps, then that came from that many heads. It's

319
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:24,860
pretty definitive. And yeah, you've got an accurate head count and you don't have to actually

320
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:31,060
carry full bodies around to prove your point. So, go ahead.

321
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:48,900
[Silence]

322
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:54,380
You know, kind of like when you're faced with the idea of individuals who were supposed to

323
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:58,620
be terrorists because they showed up and they blew up people that had nothing to do

324
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:05,500
with their conflict and they actually did this on a massive scale and struck fear into

325
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:12,620
a population and therefore they are terrorists and in a lot of cases what you really have is

326
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:22,220
them responding in like manner to what was done to them initially. Again, I say that

327
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:28,940
the technique remains the same. Yeah.

Right. It actually gives a, you know, primary precedence.

384
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:23,660
That's what I was looking for, precedence is the word I was looking for, to your right to collect on the value of the thing.

385
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:35,660
You now literally have an interest in it in the same way that the individual who is supposed to be owning it has an interest in it and therefore has to be compensated.

Well, well I gotta tell you I am getting a little bit tired but here's the thing maybe it's just me but I think we need to follow through completely on the rest of the process because you got into some other explanations which were very valid and part of the story for sure.

400
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:31,660
We have lost sight of that initial process we were describing to begin with and you know what? It seems like that's part of the purpose in fact.

01:46:45,660 --> 01:47:00,140
I just had somebody teach me how to pull apart code, and then I would look at a Asian look

476
01:47:00,140 --> 01:47:04,620
at the code and then go, oh okay, that's how that's done.

477
01:47:04,620 --> 01:47:05,620
Yeah.

478
01:47:05,620 --> 01:47:06,620
OK.

479
01:47:06,620 --> 01:47:10,360
You take a look at my site look silly now, but you've got to remember it originated in like

480
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:25,800
these seven.

481
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:31,760
And I specially, I specially alerted Clever handle to be listening.

482
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,760
So.

483
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:44,080
Yeah, now she was a little upset about it and I was like, well, you know what, go go

484
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:49,600
over to AFR at midnight, you'll hear something.

485
01:47:49,600 --> 01:48:18,480
Yeah.

486
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:25,480
Oops.

487
01:48:25,480 --> 01:48:34,720
Yeah, that's all.

488
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:46,120
I just gave you the link from, yeah, I just gave you the link from my crappy old website,

489
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:49,960
but I put it in the wrong place there, but you guys can take a look at it.

490
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:53,800
You know, I just had text links that you could click on and stuff like that.

491
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:58,960
And it was mainly just for my poetry and then I had a black Sabbath fan website connected

492
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:03,840
to it and it still exists, but like I said, it began in the 90s.

493
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:08,400
So the structure of it though was like written by me code by code.

494
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:23,200
So, you know, that was my sense of humor, bro.

495
01:49:23,200 --> 01:49:28,280
I mean, I'm a little rough with that kind of stuff.

496
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:33,280
What can I say?

497
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:39,480
You got it.

498
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:46,600
Apparently Daniel wants me to join him tomorrow night, so I'll be back around then.

499
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:50,560
No, I know.

500
01:49:50,560 --> 01:50:20,120
So, he wants to watch it.

501
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:27,120
All right, guys.

502
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:30,120
Talk to you tomorrow.

503
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:30,120
All right.

Bye.
