00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,360
Greetings to everyone listening. This is the Greek Speak

3
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,840
live stream and podcast featuring the Archon in the Greek. I'm the Archon creator of

4
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,640
greekspeak.com, my co-host and originator of the name of the website. The Greek will be joining

5
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,960
me shortly but prior to that I want to thank everyone for tuning into this introductory

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,800
episode where the Greek and I will be laying out our intentions for the stream and the scope of

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,520
our discussions during the first season. We're going to be tackling a range of subjects,

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,120
some of which have already been broached in articles on the website and we're aiming to complement

9
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,160
those writings with some exposition of similar things and I hope that we succeed in making

10
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,400
these talks as thought-provoking and insightful as possible and hopefully we'll be able to

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,560
arrive at some conclusions rather than conjecture or open-ended interpretations. So I hope you find

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,920
it to be an enjoyable listen. GreekSpeak.com has no political religious or commercial affiliations and

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,280
is completely funded and managed by myself at this point in time. The podcasts will be available

14
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,000
to download in the Greek Speak Media tab menu on the website's homepage so thank you once again

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,280
for tuning in and I hope that you enjoy this introductory episode.

16
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,360
So Greek, are you there? Greetings yes, hello. Hi, I'll go things.

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,640
Okay, going well. This is the first time around and we're going to give it a go and see how things

18
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,000
work out and hopefully we'll have an audience that will grasp what we're saying and be able to use

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,800
it as well. You have done a few of these in the past which are quite spread out across different

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,920
lesser-known media outlets and I don't think that I'm remiss to say that none of them more particularly

21
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,640
structured from mass consumption, would you say? I would say no, not at all. Like I said,

22
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,360
in the past, if anyone's heard any Greek Speak, I've always introduced the Greek as someone who's

23
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,160
just visiting here taking notes. So the aspect of Greek Speak is, you know, why aren't these things

24
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,440
being said, why aren't they being considered? Because guess what, they're extremely obvious and I

25
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,800
leave out the extreme part and then I should say there are most things are quite obvious to anyone

26
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,840
that has any form of perception, you know, topically. And again, these are obvious points. I never

27
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,160
like to make references to things that are hard to access. It's good to bring up reference materials,

28
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,000
it's good to bring up, you know, things that have been memorialized, I like to bring up, you know,

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,120
the memorialized information as a reference. Memorialized just means that it's been in the record

30
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,160
or official or unofficial either way. And having people just look at things and, you know,

31
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,760
there's a lot of complaining and there's a lot of bickering and there's a lot of wondering and that's

32
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,160
completely unnecessary. So again, bringing up a topic and then bringing up the points

33
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:38,000
supporting the topic regarding the obvious. And I think as we go along with more sonic events,

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,280
I like to call them sonic events, what have you, there could be podcasts and streams, but I would say,

35
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:51,280
again, whoever is listening will notice that many of the underpinning notions and supporting

36
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:59,520
information is going to be pretty clear. Okay, yeah, as far as things that are obvious, I do think

37
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,240
that as we progress, we'll be defining exactly what the scope of that is because people find that,

38
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,160
you know, what's obvious should be self-evident, but because certain things are not self-evident to

39
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,240
them, then therefore they're not obvious, so we must be talking about something else. But I think

40
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:20,640
we'll get to that in time. Well, if there's a sober mindset and in quotations, you know, if you're not,

41
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:27,360
if you don't have a sober mindset or a sane mindset, I don't think there's a hammer big enough to

42
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,280
drive at home, so. Okay, yes, and we'll also get to the topic of mindset, which is a subject in and

43
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,120
of itself, but this is going to be episode zero of what will be a series of streams, which will

44
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,240
collectively be called the Greekspeak podcasts when they're made available for download. So I think

45
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,080
it's a good idea to start with some general introduction of who we are and what the purview of our

46
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,960
talks will be so that people aren't taken aback by the content or the tone and have a fair idea

47
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,200
of what to expect. So I'm going under the name, the Archon and the creator of the website and

48
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,080
originator of the streaming project, which is named after a term first thrown out by the Greeks

49
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,920
some years ago when he was making appearances elsewhere. I had become a listener by chance and was

50
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,000
prompted to take up my own line of study after hearing what the Greek had to say on various matters,

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,080
and one of the fruitions of that is now greekspeak.com. I run the site at my leisure and my hopes

52
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,480
for this podcast and stream is to see whether there are segments of the public that are responsive

53
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,520
to not only the kind of subject matter we're going to discuss, but the mindset that it imparts also.

54
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,160
I think the concept of having a proper mindset or mentality is a central theme within Greekspeak,

55
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,480
more so than examining any single piece of information about a subject because frankly much of

56
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,520
what we're going to discuss can be found online already, but it's not uncommon for people to be

57
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,600
selective about the information that they accept. So I accept that the content on greekspeak.com will

58
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:02,160
have varying degrees of interest from the public based on whatever mindset a person has, which is

59
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,280
fine, but regardless of whatever topics are presented on the site, my hope is that it will not only

60
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,640
impart the information, but also a new way of looking at things. So that's it for me. How about you,

61
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:20,080
greek? Oh, basically a surface dwelling earth inhabitant that's just taking notes and doing a lot of

62
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:27,040
telling it seems. That's pretty much the end of it. I think again, like I always say, I'm just

63
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:33,360
happy to be here with everyone else, whoever everyone is, and just like to bring up some points that

64
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,760
might, I don't like to use the words help anyone or make anyone better or whatever because that's

65
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:46,640
really up to them, but bring up things that you notice, that things that can be noticed that are

66
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,640
in contrast to again, we'll bring up the term that the current mindset to be contrasting and

67
00:06:52,640 --> 00:07:00,240
complementary, which actually might ultimately end up with the eviction of the thoughts that most

68
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,240
people have about things. I would garner from that and from our past talks that you're more in

69
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:14,240
the habit of talking at people than with them per se. Why does that end up being more common

70
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:22,000
than the other? Well, the thing is, when you're reading an introduction or when an introduction is

71
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,400
being made, it's basically a one-sided projection. And the introduction could be to let's say something

72
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,800
called a dialogue, just like we had an introduction here, and I believe that everything that is being

73
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,480
discussed under the purview of Greek speak is an introduction because to really get into anything,

74
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:49,120
all of its ultimate details is requires almost most people might consider an infinite amount of time

75
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,280
on any subject. So basically almost everything that I discuss publicly that we're using that term

76
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:04,640
in quotes is an introduction, even if it's an hour long. Because the ultimately then the dialogue,

77
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:13,040
I think, will begin when certain things are established. And it doesn't seem like there has been much,

78
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:21,200
should we use the term progress? What is progress? Within the human mindset or the human condition,

79
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:29,440
and there won't be, which we probably cover in other sonic events or extremes, and give the reasons

80
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:37,200
why as well. Yeah, so speaking at people is interesting because I think I've also brought up, there's

81
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,480
a social element that if anyone does public speaking, and you're looking into the eyes of the audience,

82
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,880
you very often they're wondering, you know, when is he going to shut up so I can say what I want to

83
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:54,880
say, right? Yes, that is common. A second thing we could do is to delineate how the term Greek speak

84
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,240
should be understood. It's a term that you used to loosely dub a certain kind of talk some years back,

85
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,840
and I've run with it to create this website as my own enterprise. My take is that it's a catch all

86
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,280
term for a kind of rhetoric encompassing anything from critical theory to natural philosophy or

87
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,480
scientific exposition and even common sense, which in parts are more objective understanding of

88
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:22,560
reality. What is your take on that term as the originator of it? Well, here's the interesting thing.

89
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:30,880
I like to say that I haven't originated anything. I merely packaging it in a sonic form and throwing

90
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,720
it at people and not necessarily see what sticks, but just tossing it out there so no one can say that

91
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:44,960
it's never been done. It sounds like an interesting endeavor. It's sort of like, if you look at even the

92
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:52,480
term Greek speak, that was originated by others. For example, I would have either private or public

93
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,240
conversations on the internet and people would say, "Here's the Greek, he goes by the Greek, and we're

94
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:06,320
going to have some Greek speak and a kind of stock." It just goes around, it's an organic thing.

95
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:12,960
I think most of the terms that I'll bring up people will, like a sonic event, for example,

96
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:19,840
well, what is a podcast? What is a stream? Well, it's an event and it's audible, so making it sonic.

97
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:25,680
So basically, just putting stuff together and having other people's input form the thing,

98
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:35,040
there's no convention or anything to Greek speak. There is no such thing. It is without a thing.

99
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,640
Right, so I think that by me running with it, it might end up becoming a thing, but I think the

100
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,720
contours of it will be fleshed out for everybody as the podcast progresses nonetheless.

101
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,760
There has been a reoccurring aspect to it, I would say, one which is central to its thrust, and

102
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,680
that is the idea that it's the kind of talk that is antagonistic to many prevailing conventions or

103
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,560
mainstream world views. The idea is that there exists this kind of communication that many people

104
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,280
don't want to hear or engage with because of how it sets them at odds with the world that they live in

105
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,560
and their understanding of that world in themselves. So, I mean, that's nothing new because there's always

106
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,400
been some kind of alternative media or independent journalism or even secret societies that operate

107
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,840
alongside the mainstream with their own view of things, but Greek speak, I think, you might say,

108
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,520
does not place itself alongside the fringe movements of the world, correct?

109
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:34,160
Sure, not at all. Yeah. Well, what are the fringe movements? I think they're just fringe movements

110
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:41,920
because they're labeled as such. I think we in the future, we might discuss more of the core reality

111
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,480
of the quote-unquote communities. You know, you have the mainstream, you have the alternative,

112
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:55,040
the fringe, right? They're called communities in some sense or groups. It's not really as

113
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:02,800
we're being told because ultimately there's an underlying culture that has to be considered,

114
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,480
you know, for example, I think it's been brought up in the past if you visited a culture of

115
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:15,120
or a society of headhunters, they would have a different worldview than, for example, a technocratic

116
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:22,640
or technological society that sort of forbids cannibalism and headhunting, right? Which one is right?

117
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:29,440
Which one is wrong? You know, for example, on aquatic society versus a desert society, you know,

118
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:36,160
which one is right? Which one is wrong? So I think transcending the culture is the aspect of

119
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:43,040
having a successful, I don't know, what would you say? Again, communication of the purpose of

120
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,680
communicating, of speaking. Otherwise, why critique something if it's not going to be objective?

121
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:57,040
See, the objective reality of various societies is the reality that you're a surface dwelling

122
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,600
earth inhabitant and you're in an anthropomorphic figure that interacts with your environment.

123
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,760
And that's the basic starting point. The reason I bring it up is because when people see things

124
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,560
as unconventional, they do tend to sideline it. So there if you have the mainstream that people

125
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,960
generally accept as being legitimate and the alternative stuff and the fringe stuff around it,

126
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:24,320
which unfortunately comes with also a sense of it being not worthy of your attention. Once it gets

127
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,280
into that alternative label and I wouldn't say that Greeks speak necessarily, strives to be that

128
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,840
or that this podcast strives to be that. I think the alternative media is, you know, a discrete

129
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,480
thing unto itself that I don't think that we're trying to necessarily stand next to.

130
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:46,480
Well, how about instead of saying alternative, mainstream, view it from a qualitative point of view.

131
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,240
It's easy to understand the qualitative, qualitative nature of things. Let's say regarding food,

132
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,160
is it of high quality or is it of low quality, right? You'd have like hot cuisine,

133
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,160
well-prepared food, well-sourced ingredients and then you have what's called junk food,

134
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,000
right, which is not well-prepared and not well-sourced ingredients. Which one do you think is more

135
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,800
popular on the outset and on the onset, the junk food, right? So I view things as being,

136
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:23,280
are they quality, you know, how are they judged? I use that word, judge, yes, I mean discern from a

137
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,760
qualitative point of view. So you can study anything, whether it's academic, theocratic, political,

138
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:36,480
physiological, you know, regarding natural philosophy, which is basically science. Any aspect that

139
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,440
humans can be involved in or people can be involved in from a qualitative point of view.

140
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,800
So let's just take a point that you've been bringing up the alternative or fringe or mainstream

141
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,760
for the contrast, perhaps someone who has more of a mainstream outlook,

142
00:14:51,760 --> 00:15:00,240
outlook meaning to accept information and sources versus the sources from the alternative

143
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,800
or the fringe. The thing is, let's just put that aside and look at the quality. It doesn't matter

144
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:13,200
what it's considered, I think, I think at the end of the day, you're going to settle,

145
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:21,440
always people will always settle better. This is again altruistic with a higher quality input.

146
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,640
And it just doesn't seem to be the way things are. I mean, just look at the, you know, again,

147
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:37,520
the food aspect, right? So, you know, so again, when you're looking at mainstream, whether it's on

148
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:43,040
the receiving end or the projecting end, you know, mainstream, let's say, would be the mainstream media,

149
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,800
academia, religions, whatever institutions, or you're looking at the alternative or fringe,

150
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,800
what is the quality of what they're serving? Their patrons or listeners or whatever. And look at

151
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,520
it strictly from that point of view, first. Well, to that, I guess if you're going to make a qualitative

152
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,600
assessment, you do need a reference because if you, for example, to go with the food thing,

153
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,120
if you've only eaten junk food your whole life and you don't know what anything else tastes like,

154
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,440
then it becomes hard to evaluate the quality of it. You know, I've met children who will tell me

155
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,840
that McDonald's is good for you because they're 12 years old and they don't know anything else,

156
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:23,200
and I ran into them when they were coming out of the store with their lunch. So, if somebody,

157
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,800
you know, lacks the discernment to make a qualitative assessment because the subject matter is so

158
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:35,440
unfamiliar, then they're caught in a bit of a weird place. At best, for some people, Greek speak is a

159
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,600
kind of pondrable entertainment by a, you know, well-spoken character in the form of the Greek.

160
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,440
So it might be interesting, but it's soon forgotten among the more pressing actualities of life, no?

161
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:52,560
Yeah, again, that could be qualitative in a sense, like, let's just go a little further from the,

162
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,000
with the junk food aspect, and let's say you were considering the culture of these children.

163
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,640
The reason they consider it such is because of their culture, if you were to go to, let's say,

164
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:09,040
a rural place in Asia, they would not consider that to be, you know, the food that they should have,

165
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:14,640
and if you want to even contrast it more, if you were to visit a society that was cannibalistic,

166
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,720
they wouldn't view it as such again either, right? And then you have, for example,

167
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,080
theocratic societies that have certain food laws and restrictions, and they would view things

168
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,400
differently again. Like, for example, in India, I think you mentioned McDonald's, they're

169
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,720
predominantly based on beef patties, right? Hamburgers, where somewhere parts of India would not be

170
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:42,240
accepted due to the Hindu culture. So again, it's best to focus on the qualitative aspect of

171
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:49,120
transcends those cultures because whether you're a cannibal or a Hindu or a westerner that eats,

172
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,280
you know, junk food, your liver is your kidneys and most of the things in your bodies based on

173
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:02,000
type or interchangeable. So there is an inherent aspect of quality affecting you, right? So we try

174
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,160
to transcend that. And of course, in the future, when we do more of these sonic events, when we

175
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:14,640
go cross subjects, let's say regarding what the people call science or what their theocratic

176
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:22,160
leanings are, religion or other cultural aspects, it might sound critical, like you said, to the mainstream

177
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:29,200
year, you know, one that's culture towards that, but it will be undeniable that it actually is part

178
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:36,640
of the undercurrent of what they like or don't like and it's sort of irrefutable. Like, you know,

179
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,960
for example, if you tell anyone, let's say, Santa Claus doesn't exist, no one will refuse that. I

180
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,840
mean, Sans, the children that are deceived into thinking that, right? No one will deny that Santa

181
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,760
Claus doesn't exist or what's Santa, what size, if you see a serious debate over Santa Claus's shoe

182
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:02,320
size, it'll be dismissed as not being can't be serious, right? But yet people celebrate them as they're

183
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,960
in the most Western societies as their chief deity, right? So, I don't know, that sounds harsh and

184
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,360
critical, but it's actually true because you look at what they say, what they do, not what they say.

185
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:20,400
So again, when we bring up the different subjects, we're going to go into the qualitative aspect,

186
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:27,440
like, for example, factor fiction, one can say that something that is factual takes president over

187
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:35,600
something that is fiction. And again, to be sort of on the outset critical, you'll look at any culture

188
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,720
and you'll see that many aspects of what they believe in or function with is fictional, whether it's a

189
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,160
legal fiction, you know, regarding matters of law, whether it's religious fiction, medical fiction,

190
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,560
science fiction, and I don't mean science fiction as the entertainment venue, but actually what they're

191
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,760
being told is science is actually mostly based on fiction, not because it's an outside criticism,

192
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,840
but it's actually recorded and memorialized in their own official documents as such.

193
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:10,400
So, then eventually you'll see that we're going to be basically speaking about the earth-based

194
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:18,160
society with its different cultures that is basically insane. And that's basically the moral of the story.

195
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:25,280
You're surrounded with crazy people, and of course, anyone that has just the mainstream mindset

196
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,760
right now might say, well, that's crazy, that's not for me. Well, you know, that's again, that's an

197
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,360
interesting part of what I might call filtering, right? You know, there's an ancient saying, a friend

198
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:45,280
to all as a friend to none, right? So, are you trying to please everyone or look for approval for

199
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:52,800
everyone or you just have to say what has to be said? And I think the latter part, it ends up with

200
00:20:52,800 --> 00:21:00,320
unfavorable results in the mass mindset. Well, in terms of society, let's take a look at that,

201
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,960
because to lay out some key themes that will underlie future discussions, I think,

202
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:12,560
would be helpful. So, the basis for a lot of Greek speak is a kind of diagnosis of a universal

203
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,360
condition that has been fallen human societies all over the world, which no one is exempt from,

204
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,240
except that each person is affected to it by a different degree. So, we want, in some way,

205
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,200
to sum up that state. And the question I put to you is, by way of an analogy that you've used in

206
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,960
the past and kind of touched on here, which is that if you were a dispassionate outside observer of

207
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,760
this world, say an alien from another planet on a reconnaissance mission, what is the report that

208
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,600
could be given about how human society is currently constituted and operated? Well, that's a,

209
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,840
is that a question or a statement? I think it's more of a statement because that can only be followed

210
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,920
through by hours and hours and hours of discussion or presentation, or quote-unquote talking at people.

211
00:21:53,920 --> 00:22:01,280
But I think one thing which might have been the theme of today's stream, in some respect, is

212
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,600
what I call cosmic censorship, right? Is that something we might want to get into or?

213
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:12,400
Yeah, I don't mind a section of that briefly. Well, I think is one thing if you were visiting this

214
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,920
planet and making a report back, the report back would probably go thusfully, you'd say that no one

215
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:28,320
is paying any attention as a group, as a whole, with very little, very little exception to that.

216
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,760
And in that sense, paying attention to what's specifically because clearly things function in the

217
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,200
sense that there is, you know, a forward movement of some kind and activity going on all over the place.

218
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:48,640
I'd call it their activities or wrote at this point, meaning that they just just have a habit and

219
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:55,200
they do what they do because they've become accustomed to it. How many times have you heard, like,

220
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,520
most of cliche, "Well, I don't know, I just work here." Or, "I was just following orders."

221
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:09,680
Or, that's the way it's always been done. Well, that's what I believe, and I'm entitled to it, right?

222
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:15,040
The worst thing I've ever heard is, "I will defend to the death, you're right to say it." And I'm like,

223
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,400
"Well, be careful of saying things like that because someone might accommodate you."

224
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,320
So, I mean, how many times have you heard all of these things that are borderline cliche? I mean,

225
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:33,280
actually, they are clichés. And that is the norm, right? This is the way we do things. This is the

226
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:40,160
way it's always been done. I've only work here. I was only following orders. All right? And then you have

227
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,040
the spectrum, that's the central spectrum, then you have left or right of that or up and down of that,

228
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:51,440
the more extremist vocalization, which is, "How dare you insult, my belief? How dare

229
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:59,760
you insult, right? Who are you, you know, to say that, right?" And on the other, more mild,

230
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:06,960
here, let's say, still respect it to the same framework, the apathetic. Well, I don't care. It really

231
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:14,480
does it matter what you believe, you see? Perhaps we can look at some concrete examples, even though I'm

232
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,400
sure things come to people's minds because it's quite common what you're talking about.

233
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:25,200
Well, a concrete example is even setting things in concrete. Once concrete is poured, by the way,

234
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,680
and set, it's not easily moved. So it is, in a sense, everything we just mentioned is part of the

235
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:37,920
concrete pour, you know? You know, concrete is very malleable. It's actually a fluid while it's

236
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:44,560
being worked. And once it's cast and set, it's very difficult to remove or change. So in a sense,

237
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:50,880
this is a good concrete analogy, even though there's not much there. When people say all those things

238
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,360
that we just, I just brought up, there's really not much there. It's just fluff, let's say, right? Again,

239
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:08,640
I would suggest that there are people, maybe not part of the multitude, that have had knowing

240
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,600
questions or knowing thoughts regarding what we just brought up. Why are things the way they are

241
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,080
in the apathy? Let's just say on one end, there's the apathy on the other end, there's the

242
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,800
aggressive aspect of it. And then there's the central aspect of it, which is, well, this is the way

243
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,840
it's always been done. I just work here. I'm just following orders. And this is the way we do things.

244
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,680
And then you have the more passive, I don't care. And then the more aggressive, how dare you?

245
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:42,000
Aspect of that. And that is pretty much any subject. For example, in the medical society,

246
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,560
there's a lot of discussion regarding how the human body should be treated or dealt with from

247
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:54,560
a medical perspective. And anyone and everyone always encounters, if you're pursuing what's

248
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,440
called alternative healing methods, which actually if you understand the concept of the way the

249
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,280
standard medical industry works, that is an alternative. It's not the way it should be done. But

250
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:11,680
nonetheless, they always ask, well, who are you to discuss medical methodologies? Are you a

251
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:18,000
doctor? Where did you get your degree? So there's the of the plausibility. If you're going to discuss,

252
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,920
let's say, theological or religious concepts, where did you get your degree in theology? Are you a

253
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:32,960
priest? Are you a rabbi? So you have all of these other systems around the systems. Actually,

254
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,120
things that people say again, that support, that mindset that no one is paying any attention,

255
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,480
and they're just doing things because they're on autopilot or they're wrote, you see. And this, of

256
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,840
course, is the norm of the planet. So you can actually progress forward if we're going to do more

257
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,640
of these streams and say, well, then the Greek speak is actually hopeless then. Well, not really,

258
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,680
because again, there are people that have annoying questions and thoughts regarding why things are

259
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:05,200
the way they are. And then I guess is the benefit of understanding what's being said here.

260
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,680
In all of this, I would like to acknowledge that there will be some or could be some skepticism

261
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,640
that some people will receive, you know, these kinds of claims and assertions with because for

262
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,120
a person to accept what you're saying right now on face value means that they have to redefine

263
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,600
their understanding of the world at a level that involves some discomfort to, you know, the way

264
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,960
that they live their lives. So how does somebody reconcile the lifelong mainstream perception that

265
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,360
they've had with the claims of Greek speak when the mainstream perceptions have the force of

266
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,520
society or world governments or mass media and plausible deniability on their side?

267
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,160
They don't have to redefine it. They just have to define it because right now they lack definition.

268
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:54,160
They have no definition. It's like the blob, right? The culture itself is the container

269
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,760
and everything and everyone within it takes the shape of its container. So they can't define the

270
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:07,120
shape of the container. I think just again, go back and see what's been memorialized about the subject,

271
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,520
any subject and you'll see it's a very deep contrast to what people believe about that subject

272
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:22,400
and how they function in it. And then here's the ultra, the ultra esoteric, mysterious aspect is

273
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:29,440
that when you see the contrast of how people function and think versus the real reality of what

274
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,640
these things really are, one has to wonder it's a mystery how anything is getting done.

275
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:43,040
In other words, if you see what the medical industry is doing or the food industry or the political

276
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:50,560
industry or the religious industry or any aspect of human involvement, based on what the reality of

277
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,200
those things are, there shouldn't be anyone here. There should be complete chaos. But there isn't.

278
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:03,600
So there's another underpinning a reality to it. One might call it the non-physical side, I believe,

279
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,480
has a strong influence on it. Also Tesla, by the way, Nikola Tesla, which is not mainstream, but

280
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,680
if you like using things that are electrical and electronic, he's one of the main people to credit.

281
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,800
He said that when man starts researching the non-physical aspects of reality, that's when he will

282
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:30,480
make more progress in a year than he has ever before in any scientific field. So again, when you talk

283
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,680
about things that are not physical, like thoughts and let's say many things that are not that do

284
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:40,640
influence the physical world, are seem to be infinite because they can't be quantified.

285
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:47,200
And I think that scares a lot of people. But again, just to go back to what you had asked, I think just

286
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,600
what one can walk away with after listening to Greek speak is that is based on definition. One of the

287
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:59,920
earlier things that I used to do years ago, and Greek speak when I was being interviewed or speaking

288
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:06,720
publicly or even privately is bring up the notion of words, what words mean. Like, etymology is very

289
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,560
different than a dictionary. Dictionary just is how to pronounce the words or all the subjects can sound

290
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:17,440
uniform. That's why when you look up a word in a dictionary, it shows you the phonetic spelling first.

291
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,160
Where etymology would be the root meaning of the word. So I used to bring up word concepts,

292
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,320
and a lot of people actually discovered the word nice, for example, is not a very quote-unquote

293
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:33,360
nice word, right, for the word academic or on and on and on. So again, bringing up definitions,

294
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,080
for example, you go to back, I brought up medicine a few times, like people are always concerned

295
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,520
about viruses, right? Where years ago was about hygiene. Well, if you actually look up the history

296
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:50,240
and what's been what is really known about viruses, it's part of the field of known as toxicology,

297
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,120
and it has to do with the liver. It's not something that you get when someone sneezes.

298
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:01,040
So, you know, and again, I brought up the Santa Claus aspect, you know, how can he be a chief deity

299
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:06,960
when everyone admits that he's a fiction? Right, and we go on and on and on and on.

300
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:13,760
So basically just define the thing and then hold it up, and some people might feel like a victim when

301
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:20,240
you do that, right? When you criticize any aspect of society, just by they view it as a criticism

302
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,320
because you're defining it, they might consider themselves a victim, like you're gesticulating

303
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,400
something towards them to offend them. And then you have the other ones that are like, well, thank

304
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:39,040
you for that because now it makes sense. You'll hear that often once definitions are brought up,

305
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:45,200
what things are, and it's more than just a consensus reality because we agree on it. It's that,

306
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,920
no, there's a level beyond that, which is very simple. But once you bring that up, then a lot of

307
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:57,600
people that do appreciate the definition of things, they will say, well, thank you. That makes things

308
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,320
more clearly, and now things make more sense is a very common. So again, as this

309
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,440
Greek speak, I believe is geared towards more of the quote unquote sensible person.

310
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,840
There is, of course, a very popular strain of thought that is currently circulating where

311
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,280
they say the definitions do not matter because that is to put a constraint on an understanding of

312
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:26,640
things, whereas to go with a purely subjective outlook where your feelings are going to determine

313
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:33,040
which direction you're going to take is more reliable. Well, they say that until things

314
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,920
break down completely, and then they say we have to go back to look at the definitions we shouldn't

315
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:45,680
have taken that route. Again, with the medical, a very simple way to look at that is pharmaceuticals.

316
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:53,040
I think it's over 80% of commercial pharmaceuticals are banned after about a decade because they're

317
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:59,120
deemed dangerous, but when they're introduced into society, they don't look at the definition or what

318
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:05,200
the composition of these things are. They just look at the advertised benefit, and then after a decade

319
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,760
of suffering, maladies, and side effects, they say we should ban it. Because why? Because it just

320
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,840
pharmaceutical morph into something dangerous, or is it always dangerous by definition?

321
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:25,280
During the course of Greek speak, people will arrive at a number of crossroads, I think. A person could

322
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:31,440
on one hand take the left fork in the road and reject what we're putting forth here and take it as

323
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,400
somewhat curious talk, but ultimately benign and purely subjective. Or on the other hand, they could

324
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,400
take the right fork in the road and acknowledge that what's being said is an indication of things

325
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,720
that they've already suspected on their own, and so they could continue to listen in hopes of

326
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,200
working those things out. And we know what happens if a person takes the left fork and discards,

327
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,320
the subject matter, their life continues on as it was before. But my question is what happens if

328
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,760
they take the right fork and alter their convictions? How is Greek speak ultimately useful to someone

329
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,520
who recognizes it as something important, even though they're still bound by the constraints of

330
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:10,080
their circumstances? Well, I think you just answered it there. Are you seeking something that's

331
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:16,880
going to add clarity or do you just want to go on with how you've been? That's fine. And when I say,

332
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:22,320
go on, how you've been because the great majority are pretty much within that category.

333
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,960
You know, they don't know why they're doing what they're doing, but you dropped out there for

334
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:34,880
about five or six seconds. I think you're asking, is there a benefit or how do those that accept it

335
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:44,880
or understand it or use it? You know, what is the outcome? Well, you know, again, it's not going to

336
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:54,640
change much, but it'll add clarity to whoever is seeking it. That is a thing in itself, too,

337
00:34:54,640 --> 00:35:04,560
of known. Is it better to have known or better to have not known? And again, these are not these

338
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:11,520
thoughts, these things that you'll hear in future streams as well as today are not based on conjecture,

339
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,320
opinion, or desire. And again, one thing I was thinking about while you were asking that is,

340
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:27,280
I personally am not seeking approval. So that's another, you know, in air quotes, a category.

341
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:34,400
You know, if you, for example, both if you look at mainstream and alternative, they're, guess what?

342
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:41,440
They're both seeking approval. And when you do that, you have to accommodate who you're

343
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,320
audiences and then nothing changes, you're stuck in a vicious cycle. Because if you've made an

344
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,360
objective determination that no one is paying any attention and what I mean by that specifically is

345
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:57,120
by the definition of things and what things really are as best you can define them. Right?

346
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:04,480
If you're, if you're going to accommodate people that are living in a fictional or, or, or plausible

347
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,320
reality, you can only accommodate them with more fiction and more plausibility. Right?

348
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,560
You see? So I, again, to go back earlier, like you were saying, the mainstream and alternative,

349
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,760
the purveyors of that kind of stuff are always accommodating their audience.

350
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,000
So in that, they're, and they're stuck in a dog chasing its tail scenario. And that's pretty obvious.

351
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,120
I mean, you can go, there's so many venues on what's called the internet or even in print. And

352
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:39,040
they're all accommodating the audience. Even if you look at, for example, classical texts that are

353
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,840
supposed to inform that's reader, let's say the biblical texts or other things like that, if you

354
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,880
look at an under-bridge version, they'll tell you in the introduction, they're accommodating

355
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,600
a certain mindset. It's not, it's not really how it is, you know, regarding the, the subject matter.

356
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:03,840
Again, again, with science, medicine, religion, politics, it's, it's very, very different.

357
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:09,360
You know, in other words, it, meaning what it is memorialized about those subjects is in high

358
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:14,240
contrast to what people think it is. And I think I've brought up in the past the concept of someone

359
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,080
called Gustav Leban, who wrote about the crowd, who was analyzing the phenomenon and how crowds

360
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:26,080
form. And I've distilled it down basically his work to say that in order to gather a large group

361
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:33,520
or a crowd with approval, any concept has to be simplified so they do accept the concept. But the

362
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,600
problem with that is that it becomes so oversimplified that it no longer represents its original form.

363
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:46,480
You know, it's the same thing like, for example, you could look at any political system,

364
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,480
what is shouted by the pundits or the politicians themselves or even in print is very different

365
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:59,520
than the political reality that is documented and memorialized in their codes and laws

366
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:06,240
and got in, in reference materials. Very, very different, right? The same thing with every religion.

367
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,960
Like I, I always say there's not a religion on the planet that knows anything that's in the text

368
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:17,920
that they let you subscribe to. Or they don't even do anything in it because it's again, you know,

369
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:26,240
with medicine, same thing, right? They definitely have everyone believing it's one thing,

370
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,800
but if you actually spend some time studying quote unquote medical documents, you'll see it's very

371
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,320
different. So there's a contrast between what's been memorialized again. If you bring up the concept

372
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:42,640
of visiting this planet taking notes and now we go into their records department first before I've

373
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:48,800
used society, I would view society. It would be very easy to view society as being insane

374
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:55,280
because everything they're doing is contrary to what's memorialized. Now if you were to view the way

375
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,920
they were doing things and then go look at what's been memorialized, you might question what's

376
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,480
being memorialized as not being true because everyone is almost acting in the opposite way

377
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,960
regarding these subjects. You see? So it depends on which approach you have first. If you're well

378
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,240
versed within the reference materials of any subject on human society, it's very easy to view them

379
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:24,560
as being clinically insane or just insane or not well on the onset very quickly. But again, if you're

380
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:31,840
well adapted to the way they do things and then look at their definitive material or what's been

381
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,080
memorialized, you might question that and say it doesn't matter because obviously everyone

382
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:41,280
also is doing the opposite. And the reason I repeated that is because that is a typical resultant

383
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:50,160
comment that you get from people. You know, if you were to not even... you must remain fundamental by

384
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,440
the way but not even in a conservative way, fundamental, it just means staying true to it, right? But in

385
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,280
conservative means that you're rigid and dogmatic. Regarding any subject, if you were to run into anyone

386
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,520
in any society on the planet right now and present them with the reference materials of what they're

387
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:13,680
engaged in, they will almost immediately dismiss it as not being true or not mattering. You see? Not

388
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,680
matter. They're not having a matter on what they're doing. And that seems to be the classic resultant

389
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:27,280
with what I call the surface dwelling, earth and habitant. We're maybe doing the opposite here. We're

390
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,280
going to bring up the notion of what the reference materials first and then putting it out, you see,

391
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:39,040
without looking for approval. Yes, I think that as time goes on, we'll definitely get into some

392
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,280
some details that are tangible that people can reference. For now though, since we're still in

393
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,400
the introductory episode, I think we'll look at one of the more central themes to Greek speak,

394
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,400
particularly on the website. One of the first things that people see when they visit

395
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,720
Greekspeak.com in the menu option is cosmic censorship. It's a central concept within Greek speak,

396
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:04,000
though by no means a new one, to human history. I think it's been spoken of in everything from ancient

397
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,280
Vedic writings of godism and Hinduism where it's sometimes called the Maya to modern portrayals,

398
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,720
perhaps most famously the matrix movies, but in countless others of course. So it's this idea that

399
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,800
there exists primarily two realities, one which is secondary and home to most human beings and

400
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:29,760
rules their perception and the other which is primary yet concealed and exerts a shaping

401
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:36,640
influence on the secondary one. So unless I'm wrong, cosmic censorship is an epithet that the

402
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,320
Greek is used quite often to describe a state of affairs and the force which maintains the separation

403
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:49,440
between these realities. Correct? Oh I'd say so. Only because it's easy to communicate that once

404
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,640
the listener understands what is being communicated regarding the term cosmic censorship.

405
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,920
I've had in the past some people message me and say, "Are you talking about this cosmic

406
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,640
censorship?" Meaning if you do a search on a browser they bring up some Einsteinian

407
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,240
quackery and relativism and things like that regarding singularities. That's not what I'm

408
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:18,560
talking about. I actually was not aware of that term until I had a fully functional way of expressing

409
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,600
it as cosmic censorship and later on finding out it was used by academia regarding the existence

410
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,640
of black holes or something like that. And the reason I put that term together is because censorship is

411
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:37,440
the act of censoring and cosmic meaning broadly placed and cosmos believe it or not is the Greek word

412
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,040
regarding the world. But it's been applied to mean beyond the world even if they're discussing

413
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:49,200
universal things, meaning physical or conceptual. So I figured putting the two words together

414
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,840
would be a good way of expressing how people just don't see things and how it's because of

415
00:42:53,840 --> 00:43:00,320
another force that is implying that. And again I just want to restate that it has nothing to do

416
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:05,520
with the cosmic censorship that you find in academia which is regarding their whole

417
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,680
again science fiction. It's might sound critical at this point but in the future I might explain

418
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:15,280
away what people consider to be science is actually fictional. For those people that are curious

419
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,000
there's an article on the website you can read about that that would be introductory body of work.

420
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,920
How did you come to be made aware of cosmic censorship? Do you remember that or was it something that

421
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:32,160
came to you at a relatively early stage? Well in short I was seeking ancient texts regarding

422
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:40,400
matters of law. It's a big subject people tend to go away from it and I figured well why not start

423
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,800
from a historical point of view when was the concept of law first brought up. And for example if you

424
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:53,440
study something known as the biblical text you'll find a mosaic laws in there but then if you move

425
00:43:53,440 --> 00:44:00,640
ahead and study what's called the prophet the prophets you'll find that there's a decree made

426
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:09,200
by the gods to close the eyes and shut the ears so they don't see and don't hear meaning they

427
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:17,040
meaning the people. Right so I started then again looking and looking and looking at ancient texts

428
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:23,280
and like you said the maya in certain traditions and there are many traditions that speak of the man

429
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:32,080
being blinded or shortsighted and I started seeing that is part of the reality of which people

430
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,960
how people function and it's a reality and it's part of their culture believe it or not.

431
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:46,080
So I saw that it is part of the reality and again it's a form of censorship and it's cosmic

432
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:52,640
and again cosmic again if one studies that it means just the world but it's also extended beyond that

433
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:58,320
and that's why I chose that term. And this you found evidence of this looking at various texts this

434
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:04,720
is something that you found in say eastern texts western texts esoteric things. Let's just say east

435
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:09,760
west north and south. And what's interesting about since we brought up ancient texts you don't know

436
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:17,200
where ancient texts are there dumb people or stupid people or I'd people with low IQ the people's

437
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,640
perception and ability is judged by how well they can see in here. It's an interesting western

438
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,840
phenomenon how certain people are called ignorant well ignorant means ignorant or just of lower

439
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:36,400
mental capacity. All right that's a psychological fiction I think. I mean these are things that can

440
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:43,280
be discussed in great depth later but I found that from a more neutral and objective

441
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:51,600
perspective it's a perception not what they call intelligence. Ultimately everyone has the same

442
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:57,520
as long as you're functionally there just like having a warehouse of computers with given

443
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:02,400
specifications on memory and function they're all with equal. It's the ones that have a better power

444
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:09,200
supply or a better operator that tend to see it perform better. So again I just want to bring up

445
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:15,760
the point that the the the concept of people being more intelligent than others again which we might

446
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,880
discuss if we ever go into the education system which the critique on that would be how well can

447
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,560
you repeat what you've been told. It's called a grading system how many times have you heard of

448
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,760
you know a valedictorian or this guy you know what makes this guy or gal smarter than everyone

449
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,320
else well they got a better score than everyone else. All right so that just means they could repeat

450
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:44,640
things back. So it's very what you know the interesting part about intelligence the definition I found

451
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,560
objective objectifying the definition of intelligence is how well can you perceive

452
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:56,400
eyes and ears again lack of cosmic censorship. It doesn't mean you'll be in a better place because

453
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:04,880
again in this given your culture if you don't adhere to the plausible normality you'll be ousted right.

454
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,520
Perception certainly matters we're going to get to that in later episodes there's an article on that

455
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:15,040
on the website for anyone that wants to take a look also but concerning cosmic censorship if it is

456
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:20,240
indeed a universal condition then it implies that the primary distinction between people who wish

457
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,600
to gain a better understanding or perception of reality is to what extent are you censored. So on

458
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,080
one hand you have people who are so censored that they don't know that the censorship exists and

459
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:36,320
then moving on from that you have varying degrees of clarity at different stages so what differentiates

460
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:40,880
the cluelessly censored person from someone who has gained enough realization to acknowledge the

461
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:49,680
censorship in the first place. That's really up to them because that gets really sticky let's say

462
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:55,200
you're the latter someone who bully you know who not let's not use the word bully but has

463
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:01,520
noticed that there is a censoring factor to human participation in reality right use that term

464
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:07,920
when you approach someone who is let's say doesn't acknowledge that they're being limited and

465
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,720
is quite happy with where they are there is going to be a violent opposition eventually and violent

466
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,000
doesn't mean physical violence either right it could be verbal or intentional violence which you

467
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,160
know is emotional so many times I've said if you notice someone is censored to the point where they

468
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:30,320
can't even acknowledge the censorship or can't even see anything evidentiary put in front of them

469
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:36,080
just walk away because it's not going to end up well right so this is part of the reality that's

470
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:41,920
why it's you know when people are confronted on a social point of view regarding why is there so

471
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,640
much war misery and starvation they just say well that's the way it is they don't want to address and

472
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,280
look at look at it deeper and then of course you'll have the alternative side well it's the

473
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:57,920
bankers doing it well not really right you know as there was war before there were bankers right true

474
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,640
so so you can say you know one thing or another but are you objectifying it in the answer to what I

475
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:08,400
see out in the world is no there is no objectification but again going back to the question

476
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:17,360
it's a very well it's self-answering in other words as again going back to the ancient history

477
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:23,600
the less censored the individual the sage is the wise men so off forth and so on you know

478
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:30,720
what did they do in regard to their culture and society and the masses did they

479
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:36,320
they interact openly and look for approval did they separate themselves go out and live in the

480
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:40,800
mountains or the wilderness and some secluded place they usually separated themselves they set

481
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,760
themselves apart and minimize contact and I know that doesn't sound like something I know this is

482
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:51,200
we're just starting the stream and this is the beginning I mean are we laying down the idea that

483
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:56,160
if you listen to Greek speak and try to put into effect in your life that you'll have to separate

484
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:05,360
yourself and not and not garner approval from others can I say yes right I would say be careful

485
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:10,640
yeah you'd have to be careful and also you're and this is both mainstream and alternative and you know

486
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:15,680
it does because they're this to me that again they're they're all the same everything out there is

487
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:23,840
the same until it's delineated from a qualitative perspective right so yeah but it doesn't mean

488
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:28,720
that it shouldn't be said and it doesn't mean that it can't be said so hence you know the Greek speak

489
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:35,120
mm-hmm I would say people recognize this understanding of the wise men that isolate themselves you know

490
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,760
I think for me the most tangible references Obi-Wan Kenobi and Star Wars you know he's living on

491
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:45,280
Tatooine somewhere not really interested in what's happening the rest of the the world so to speak

492
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,840
until it's this time to do something and you see that over and over again in various fictional

493
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:55,120
depictions but that is not to say necessarily that you should go live into Himalayas because you

494
00:50:55,120 --> 00:51:00,320
might find that what you're trying to escape from is there also and it's it's it's it's by the way

495
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:07,360
is it misanthropic I'd say it is to a degree but is it only misanthropic meaning Greeks speak no

496
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:13,360
because ultimately you know people say all you need is love or God is loving you hear that

497
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:18,880
bantied around I dare them to define it and they can't but ultimately leads to that point because

498
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,440
you know ultimately and I'll just put it out there in any culture the true word or the word that

499
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,080
can be defined as love actually just means doing the right thing even if you don't feel like doing

500
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:38,880
it at the time mm-hmm so we'll define again the these it's about definition yeah I think some people

501
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,040
will intuitively recognize that definition of love and for some other people it's completely

502
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:50,240
foreign time will tell whether that bears out to be something reliable and I think we'll get into it

503
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:55,920
in later episodes but as far as the misanthropic stuff there is there's something that has to be

504
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:02,080
said for the fact that the world is not constituted the way that we're told that it is and whether you

505
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:09,360
want to see it as a hatred for the ways of the world or hatred of institutions or hatred of people

506
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:15,200
that's going to vary from my point I do have a certain disdain towards the way that things are done

507
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:20,800
and towards the forces that drive things I don't have any personal beef with people per se because

508
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,720
they're gonna do what they're gonna do anyway but you have to understand the way that things are

509
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:29,920
constituted otherwise you're just you're not being vigilant at all well the thing about having a

510
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:37,760
personal beef is difficult put the judgment of that aside and say objectify it because most

511
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:43,680
persons are the same yes they're told that they're all different and unique and wonderful but if you

512
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:48,480
delve down deeply they want everyone to be the same they meaning if you've ever dealt with anyone

513
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:53,440
in the legal society or the medical society or the religious society they tell people that openly

514
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,880
that they're free but when you deal with them on a personal basis they say well what are you

515
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,120
why are you coming to me with this you have to be just like everyone else right they always say

516
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:08,080
that in private so there's an dichotomy or schizophrenia there but to personally hate someone or

517
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:13,760
personally whatever is is in a sense foolish when you start objectifying things you'll see within

518
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:21,840
a culture high everyone is pretty much the same right not let's just use the word similar

519
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:28,240
not exactly the same they're not carbon copies even clones are not carbon copies by the way but

520
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:35,760
you can you can see that again you've heard of the term mass as we've used it right or the general

521
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:43,840
group right are they that implies a similarity or oneness all right again what would the obi

522
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:51,440
one can obi seclude himself or sequester himself if there was that much variety no it's them and me

523
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,680
right now it doesn't mean it has to be antagonistic or polemic it's just the reality we you know

524
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:02,800
is objectifying something in his reality something to be liked well that's to be determined later

525
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:08,320
determine what the reality is first determine if you want to personally hate someone

526
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:12,480
after you determine what an objectified why they are the way they are

527
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:19,520
let's wrap up this episode by talking about the idea of mindset i think you've touched on it once or twice

528
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,480
and i may have mentioned it also which is of course interchangeable with mentality that word

529
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,000
what has become trendy i think in the past 20 years or so is that when people

530
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:34,160
realize that the mainstream channels are perpetuating nonsense those people then turn to alternative

531
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:40,080
media and conspiracy theories as a source of information and they go down a rabbit hole of equally

532
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:44,720
fallacious nonsense we see that with youtube it's very easy to get caught in the youtube

533
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:50,560
recommendations sidebar for different things and you're on there for hours watching videos by people

534
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:56,720
who really you know may or may not be making sense so people overload on this new information but

535
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,560
ultimately they aren't much better off than they were before because they haven't switched out their

536
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:06,720
old mindset for a new one can you give a bit more exposition on that and what exactly is the

537
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:12,560
proper mindset would you say again you're going to need a reference something to stand on firm

538
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:19,200
footing good foundation how do you get that well what's the easiest way that anyone can access a firm

539
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:28,000
foundation on any subject or any matter is by defining it and again to go back and you brought up

540
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,720
the youtube venue i would say that you have university then you have alternative universities same

541
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:41,280
junk and it sounds like an overt criticism of it being low quality it is right you have met a

542
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:49,280
conventional medicine and then alternative medicine same junk right so and and what the reason

543
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:54,320
that might sound a little over critical at the moment you're just going to have to hold on

544
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:59,680
your hat and wait and we'll explain that and i will say that if you have discernment and there's

545
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:04,000
a level of discernment that you can bring to bear on how you interact with various fields of

546
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,920
knowledge then there isn't this sort of one-size-fits-all criticism of junk that you would

547
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:14,800
necessarily apply to that because of course you can get something profitable out of alternative medicine

548
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,640
or mainstream medicine but not if you don't have any discernment then you're just going to have to do

549
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:26,480
what you're told you know a lot of cherry picking uh i wouldn't say that there's anything worth

550
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:32,160
throwing out in in in wholesale also you know how i brought up qualitative and quantitative

551
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:39,840
earlier uh the numbers don't mean anything when you're looking at quality like for example

552
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:46,160
uh when i go out to the shops and for example i was looking for some kind of a anti-bug lotion right

553
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:53,360
a lot of mosquitoes around especially for children and uh the clerk at the shop said well this is

554
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:59,120
the one that everyone gets everyone buys and i'm like oh that's the one i don't want because

555
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:04,080
and she goes well why and i said well because have you met everyone do you see how people act on this

556
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:10,960
planet and she didn't quite understand it a rejection of what is commonly accepted is a healthy way

557
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:17,520
to objectifying reality by the way you know the patent office does that by the way when you apply

558
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:22,960
for a patent it's commonly rejected and then you have to go in and do what's called a defense

559
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:31,040
for it right you have to uh expound on why you deserve a patent if you patently reject what's been

560
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:38,320
commonly accepted wholesale again and then go back in with scrutiny and uh a diverse discernment

561
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:43,360
and diverse discernment meaning you have to know why it got that way too not just that it is that way

562
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:53,440
you'll be better off always understood and i think that as time goes on um that will prove itself out

563
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:59,680
as we continue to do these episodes okay i think that um we've covered the full gamut of

564
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:04,640
introductory topics that we need to that should do it for this episode unless there's something else

565
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:09,440
you want to touch on in conclusion no and not at all again in conclusion i would just say no one on

566
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:16,160
the planet is paying any attention with very few exception and uh paying attention was just uh

567
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:21,040
basically be defined as you do you understand what something is based on what's been memorialized as

568
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:26,960
it being defined as and then applying it properly because there is a proper way to do it um

569
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,760
i mean it doesn't mean like for example if you're working on a car engine you can't use kitchen

570
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:37,760
utensils to pry off a valve cover because you don't have a right tool but that is not the right tool

571
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:45,520
for it you see so in essence uh i think uh time will tell if we come back and do more of these which

572
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:51,040
i think we will will be more topical in nature and we'll expand on it and show how simple it is to

573
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:57,680
do what we've proposed yes that is correct anyone who listens to this should have

574
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:03,200
a good idea of what to expect moving forward the Greek speak podcast will continue to tackle this

575
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:09,360
kind of subject matter and um the articles will give an indication of the kinds of things will be

576
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:16,000
