00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,840
Greetings to everyone listening.

3
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,560
This is the Greek Speak live stream and podcast featuring the arcan in the Greek.

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,300
I'm the arcan, creativegreakspeak.com, joining me for episode one of this streaming series

5
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,480
is my co-host of the Greek, who will be with me in a minute.

6
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,560
Episode zero has been posted to the Greekspeak.com homepage beneath the subscription box where

7
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,240
it will remain indefinitely as a fixed feature.

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,240
The subsequent episodes will be posted in the newly created podcast page, which is accessible

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,840
through the media tab in the top right corner of the homepage.

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,280
GreekSpeak.com has no political, religious or commercial affiliation and is completely

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,600
funded and managed by myself at this point in time.

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,360
So that does it for my introduction.

13
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,960
I hope you enjoy the rest of the show and thanks again for listening.

14
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:21,460
[Music]

15
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,480
Hi Greek, are you there?

16
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,800
Yes greetings, I'm here.

17
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,120
How are you doing?

18
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,680
All right, yeah, I think we have quite a bit to talk about today or speak on.

19
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,880
Yeah, since the introductory episode, since we did shed some light on the direction of the

20
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,320
series, I'd like to move forward with some in-depth discussions on the various subjects that

21
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,560
are covered on GreekSpeak.com.

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,320
I think we were quite spread out across various subjects last time, but if we could allocate

23
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,920
this one to the issue of cosmic censorship, I think that would be a good start.

24
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:01,240
I started off one of my articles on the website with the sentence that what is oddly absent

25
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,400
from most people's perception of life is the suspicion that there is something problematic

26
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,400
afoot with the general existence.

27
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,440
So we do know that at some level, everybody can detect the presence of malevolence in the

28
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,760
world around them, particularly of the painful kind.

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,920
What is less remarked about though is how people's perceptions essentially fall off a

30
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,480
cliff when it comes to contending with the more ambiguous yet more sophisticated forms

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,280
of malevolence that chip away at them in part because of what they subscribe to willingly.

32
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,000
What can be said about that reality, Greek?

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,920
Wow, okay, that's like a merry go round and it's like, what horse do you want to jump on,

34
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,760
right?

35
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,480
But essentially the two things that I picked out are the malevolent evil, let's say, and

36
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,960
the way that people exist with it, let's say, right?

37
00:02:52,960 --> 00:03:01,280
I would say that would pretty much gather that thought into a very simple way to present it.

38
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,520
Just to start off, again, since we're discussing cosmic censorship, what is it and why do we say

39
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,520
it that way?

40
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,480
Well, I would suggest the word cosmic is originally a Greek origin, meaning the world, meaning

41
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,000
society, but through time it's taken on a meaning to mean pretty much all-encompassing.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,560
So I would just define that almost like a personal definition, it's anything and everything

43
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,960
mankind perceives.

44
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,000
So I just wanted to define that from the sense that I think about it, but now we tend to

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,160
relax and just say cosmic just means, well, you know, the cosmos is space and cosmic meaning

46
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,000
something far out or esoteric, just all-encompassing based on our perception, because basically

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,920
if you lost your perception, nothing would exist in essence.

48
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,840
So just to make the definition, I think, more clear, and the definition of the word censorship

49
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,680
means to obfuscate block or prevent from being viewed or even seen.

50
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,120
I think the cosmic censorship, the term takes it a little bit further by implying not only

51
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,480
things that are obfuscated, blocked or not seen, but also things that are not comprehended

52
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,360
or acknowledged.

53
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,280
Now on the question of evil or malevolence, what's interesting again, let's define the word

54
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:26,400
evil, you go to etymology, etymological reference or what they call etymological dictionary, and

55
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,640
you'll see there's a pretty, you know, showing the origin, pretty elaborate sense of how the

56
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,520
word can be defined or what it means, but what took hold of my interest, as you go down

57
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:45,520
on the definition, you'll find that it also includes being subject to disease, which brings

58
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,720
it home for more people, because when you understand the word evil, well, it's basically

59
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,720
based on the cultural norm.

60
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,240
Society of headhunters would find it evil if another group came in and prevented them

61
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,660
from harvesting human heads.

62
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,560
So then there's the relative morality there, but this, I think, transcends that when you

63
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,760
look at the aspect of being subject to disease as being one of the definitions of evil, which

64
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,560
is actually what we find in a lot of the ancient rites when a society or group of people were

65
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:23,160
deemed evil, they were subject to disease and war and famine and pestilence and maladies.

66
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:31,680
So this is also one of the attributes in discussing cosmic censorship, because, for example,

67
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,200
I think I've brought up the medical system several times recently, because it's hand-in-hand

68
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,120
with the agricultural and food also intake.

69
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,480
What's interesting is if you look at what's put out is terms of pharmaceuticals, which

70
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,640
mean poison, by the way, look up the word pharma, and what's called medicine, most of those

71
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:57,760
drugs within, or medicines within a decade are deemed unsafe, right?

72
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:04,000
And the people do suffer what is considered the side effects or that makes them unsafe

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,680
while they're aspiring to acquire them and use them.

74
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,520
So nothing changes.

75
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,760
So is that evil?

76
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,600
And, yes, very simply by definition.

77
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,160
But then again, what drives people towards that, you see, is the cosmic censorship.

78
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,920
In other words, yes, you can say that the people are drawn to it through means of propaganda

79
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:33,800
and marketing, meaning advertising, which essentially is the foremost breeder of covetedness in the

80
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,280
world, which basically makes people aware of things that they were not aware of before.

81
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,440
And then not only that makes them want those things, right, at cost or whatever.

82
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:50,400
So this aspect can also be explored, but the aspect of cosmic censorship kicks in with

83
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,600
something with the harmful remedies and medications that are put out in modern society,

84
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,520
when you present all of the facts and the truth of the matter, historically and present

85
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,200
to the willing victim.

86
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:11,480
Willing victim would be easy to encounter at a line at a pharmacy, which are pretty common

87
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,080
in the Western civilizations.

88
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,920
And you say, hey, by the way, I see you're online here to acquire some of these drugs,

89
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
whatever you're for.

90
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,520
Do you know statistically this or the facts are this or even more informally that have

91
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,760
you ever considered the side effects?

92
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,440
And most of the time, if not all of the time, it's disregarded.

93
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:38,200
Now if we're supposed to be rational, logical creatures, how can we we meaning they, the

94
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:45,080
person that you just addressed, deny what you had just said as the potential of causing

95
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,440
harm, but yet they still desire it.

96
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:54,680
So, and again, let's for go for now, the aspect of propaganda advertising and marketing,

97
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,880
then there's the aspect of personal gain or the person is suffering some illness and

98
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,120
this has been put in front of them as relief.

99
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,200
But yet the truth of the matter is outside of, let's say, something that's a pain killer

100
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,360
that would dull the senses, the none of them really work.

101
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,720
And this is pretty much well known as overall beneficial to the body, right?

102
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,760
You know, of course, there's the compromise.

103
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:26,600
So I use this as a metaphor because this model of presenting what is real or truthful to

104
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,560
someone is often negated in an unreasonable way.

105
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,400
And there can't be any explanation other than there is a force or a condition called

106
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,600
cosmic censorship that prevents them too.

107
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:45,000
And I think the cosmic censorship can be considered to transcend cultural norms, personal

108
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,920
desires and things like that.

109
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,600
So again, bringing this through as an idea is just a metaphor.

110
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,160
You will see goes across many fields of study, many aspects of human society.

111
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,400
So the malady and the evil and the, that that, that, that, that, that befall the people

112
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:10,280
because of their negation of reality or the truth of a certain matter, can be considered

113
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,080
to be a testament to their, to their robustness.

114
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:19,320
So you know, the way that the humans are made or people are made, but also unnecessary

115
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,080
suffering if you view the whole situation on what's going on because the, the access

116
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:31,960
to the information to avoid it is there, but it's negated and constantly negated.

117
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,520
So that's the, the essence of the cosmic censorship.

118
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,320
Now that, that has to tie into where does the cosmic censorship come from and, and more

119
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,760
of what it is and how it's done.

120
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:49,540
It's quite a sophisticated interlocking web of, of deceptions then that would power the whole

121
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,080
thing I'm thinking because when you make a statement like pharmaceuticals generally don't

122
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
work other than for pain relief.

123
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,280
I mean, that's a big statement, but clearly they do work enough for people to feel compelled

124
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,800
to use them beyond just the relief, right?

125
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,860
The, the reason why I say that is because if you, overall it sounds, it sounds to most

126
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,400
of being absurd statement and then to some they would, they would be highly speculative.

127
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,760
And then a very few know that and what, so let's just bypass the first two and the ones

128
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,600
why do they know that?

129
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,640
Because first of all, those that know the pharmaceuticals don't work and this goes also

130
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,120
with many techniques and methodologies that the medical systems use is because look at

131
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,680
the outcome, whether you want to look at a very short outcome, which would be the, while

132
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:39,880
the person is being treated with these, the results are not, let's say as, as conclusive

133
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,720
and as complete as, as predicted or promised, right?

134
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,840
Then you have the long term effects and within the, between the initial taking of these things

135
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,920
to the long term effects you have what's called side effects.

136
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,560
So it all boils down to the operation was a success and the patient died.

137
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,320
You see?

138
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,760
So you can do your own study on this.

139
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:09,000
It's not really popular because you have to also understand how the money system works

140
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
when there is no money.

141
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,520
That sounds kind of crazy to say that.

142
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:19,760
But again, to go back to the cosmic censorship aspect, where is it coming from?

143
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Why?

144
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,720
What and how is it being caused is beyond like you mentioned deception because in order

145
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:35,440
to provide a deceptive condition, the condition has to appear truthful and correct to the victim.

146
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,360
And most of you couldn't, if someone wanted to deceive someone else, they wouldn't wear

147
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,360
a t-shirt.

148
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,600
I'm here to deceive you and hold up a sign.

149
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,760
I'm here to deceive you and say I'm here to deceive you.

150
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,800
They wouldn't, you see, that's an extreme.

151
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,120
But so it's, it goes more in the realm of counterfeit and it has to interlock with what the

152
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,880
person believes is correct.

153
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,640
Notice I didn't say right or good.

154
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
Right?

155
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:05,200
Because again, in a society of headhunters, if another group came in and persuaded,

156
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,840
attempted to persuade them or prevented them from harvesting human heads, that group would

157
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,400
be viewed as evil by the headhunters who want to harvest human heads, you see.

158
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,280
This is not relative moralism or anything like that.

159
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,880
This is just, is the being going to survive in the condition or thrive in the conditions

160
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,600
that it's in or not.

161
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,680
That's why I brought up the term of, one of the definitions, one of the terms included

162
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,120
in the definition of the word evil is being subject to disease.

163
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,600
Because that is not a matter of opinion anymore or moral relativism.

164
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,600
Right?

165
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,880
Remember, you know, back in the medieval ages, people would go through the streets and

166
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,440
carts and say, you know, bring out your dead, bring out your dead.

167
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,360
You know, it was quite normal.

168
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,400
But as it, even though it was normal during the plague times, was it evil?

169
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Of course.

170
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:02,840
You see, and that's how you can contrast what you think is evil and what is good by just

171
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,400
basically looking at what is it actually being performed by this description?

172
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Right?

173
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:15,240
Or what is the condition that is prevalent, but that can be described with the term evil?

174
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,320
Usually until it, that term evil is brought down to pestilence, destruction, war, disease,

175
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,000
it's, it's just argued or negated.

176
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,400
Good is thriving promotes life, pleasantry, pleasantness.

177
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:36,280
And evil promotes death, promotes struggle, promotes disease, which is sometimes worse than death.

178
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
Right?

179
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,600
And, say, and, and malady, right?

180
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,960
Unpleasantness.

181
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:50,320
And because here, people are more interested in quantified support.

182
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,440
They, most people have lost the ability to understand qualitative support.

183
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,560
The quantity of evil in a society can easily be measured by how many people are dropping

184
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,600
like flies or sick or are killing each other or bickering with each other or warring with

185
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
each other.

186
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:14,120
You see, in essence, mankind is still in a place where you're going to have to quantify

187
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,360
in a material sense.

188
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,400
But if people's conceptualization of good and evil have largely been limited to the material

189
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,160
terms of their well-being, what are you implying are the alternatives to that if we want to

190
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,720
use quality as the measure instead?

191
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,920
In other words, how else would we conceptualize good and evil when we live in a material reality

192
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
anyway?

193
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,680
Well, I wouldn't say that the reality is, is material, actually, a very small aspect of

194
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:49,320
it is, especially if you understand electrical engineering, how the weather works, what, what

195
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:57,000
scientists are wrestling with the real microcosms of things looking under their telescopes as

196
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:06,000
well, the microscopes and how small can they see, what is everything made of and any material

197
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,480
scientist, even with their, I would say, training because their technicians, in essence, will

198
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,600
tell you that the closer they look at matter, they find that there's nothing there.

199
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:26,560
And if you look at the fulacious model of the atom, right, they have a planetary model of

200
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:34,080
an electron spinning around a central body known as a proton or neutron, the size of that

201
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:41,640
atom is mostly undefined or defined as space.

202
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:50,200
So I would suggest that in the future people will start to discount that we are just in a

203
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:57,480
material world over the reality that we're, most of reality is immaterial.

204
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:03,680
They'll find that the actual significance of their reality is intangible by their five

205
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,640
senses or six senses.

206
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:13,160
So to address the question specifically though, the good and evil thing, how do we move away

207
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,960
from the quantitative assessment to the qualitative assessment if that is to be had?

208
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,760
Well again, this is a subject that people find as a category that's something that they

209
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,800
want to just slip over to the side or make it, make it something that is optional to think

210
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,640
about and it's a category again based on if we go back to what is morality, what is

211
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:44,200
law, what is good or bad and these are things that if one were to study history from any point

212
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:50,760
of you, we'll see that references were constantly made to a group called the gods or an essence

213
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,680
something that people might say intuition.

214
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,560
Oh, it doesn't feel right in all this, right?

215
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:05,400
So again, it's something intangible but the dictates are accessible, you know.

216
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,160
If you look at, for example, moral teachings, all of the dictates whether it's Eastern or

217
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:18,960
Western religion or Eastern or Western philosophy, people can access the dictates of what

218
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:24,560
more good morality is or good and evil is but when they start examining just like the

219
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:29,640
atom, the closer you get, the less you find is tangible.

220
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,240
Meaning if you're looking for a source, you know, if if I were to come into your, your

221
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:41,360
presence and drop a heavy object on the table and say, this is a rock, you'll say, yes, it

222
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,360
is a rock.

223
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,360
Well, what is it?

224
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,920
Is it a sedimentary limestone or is it a granite?

225
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Right?

226
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,720
You know, we can examine it and materially.

227
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,240
And you're not going to find that kind of direct examination with morality and good and

228
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,720
evil because there are so many different societies on the planet now.

229
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,160
Here's a simple analogy.

230
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:11,280
You have someone who lives in a dwelling that has a quote unquote, roach infestation, right?

231
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,000
And they have to stay in that dwelling so they go out and either hire an exterminator or

232
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,760
try to exterminate these roaches or create a condition where the roaches are no longer infiltrating

233
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,640
their living space, right?

234
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,400
They're considered vermin or pests.

235
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,440
Okay, take that person, put them on a planet where the predominant species and inhabitants

236
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
are roaches.

237
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,520
What are they going to do now?

238
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
You see?

239
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,280
They'll be out of a job to say the least.

240
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,400
Yeah, they'll be very uncomfortable in misplace.

241
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,520
Now, that's an extreme example.

242
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:51,280
So what some people view as being beneficial, other people view as being not beneficial.

243
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,280
One man's junk is another man's treasure.

244
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,680
One man's floor is another man's ceiling, you know, on a two story building.

245
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,680
Yeah.

246
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:05,040
And the other things, I think that this is, this might sound dogmatic to most people, but

247
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,840
no one, I believe, and I say I believe because I don't want to argue with anyone over this,

248
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,680
either past, present or future.

249
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,480
I'm going to say it this way.

250
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:22,440
You don't have license or a right to redefine these things if they've been memorialized through

251
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:33,320
history in a way where they are so clear and so potent that if you find yourself in a

252
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:40,080
society where your history regarding morals, what's good and evil to be ignored, I would

253
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:48,680
say that is a sign that you're not living in a, let's say, intellectually harmonious state.

254
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:55,040
In other words, when you have everything laid out for you in the past, the reason you keep

255
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,860
records, for example, is so you can procure it to the progeny.

256
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,520
People come after you because it's important.

257
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:12,560
So people, once they begin to examine prior records of what's been said about this and have

258
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:19,760
distilled it down to a way where the commoner can also, not only the commoner can only examine

259
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,720
it, but also comprehend it, you'll see that there's not much of a question about defining

260
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,400
these things.

261
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,520
I mean, one of the red flags I should say about society is when they seem to complain or

262
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,360
ask questions about things that have already been answered, regardless of their materially

263
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,360
direct, you know, like dropping a stoner or rock on someone's table or just a concept like

264
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,320
what's good or evil.

265
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,720
These things have been defined for thousands of years.

266
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:52,880
Now if you live in a society that is arrogant enough and ignorant enough to believe that

267
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:59,320
they can redefine it as they go along, I would suggest that you learn to set yourself apart

268
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,560
from that kind of a society if you're stuck in living with them.

269
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:09,000
It's a harsh commentary on the current society, but I would suggest that it's about as

270
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,080
true of a statement that anyone can make.

271
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,440
During episode zero and even during this stream, you've brought up the analogy of the headhunter

272
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,400
society as a means to make a juxtaposition between different moral systems or to illustrate

273
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,120
how morality differs from culture to culture.

274
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,040
And I don't think most people are averse to the idea that morality is not a set and stone

275
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:36,280
thing, but someone hearing your headhunter reference for the first time may very well think, well

276
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,200
wait a minute, why is he using such a gory analogy?

277
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,480
Like, do we need analogies of a murder-approving society to illustrate moral concepts?

278
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,880
And maybe the guy giving the analogies when we need to consider for examination and not

279
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,280
what he's saying.

280
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,080
So can you explain a bit why you use that analogy and why do you say that it's not moral

281
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,240
relativism, even though for most people it does sound like that?

282
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,960
Well, I wouldn't say it's moral relativism as much as it's a moral contrast to perhaps

283
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,240
have someone look over towards the headhunter and then turn around while they're looking

284
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,120
at the headhunter from a vantage point and create that same vantage point looking at

285
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:20,280
their society or their concept of what's associated or characterized as the right behavior,

286
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,920
which is probably a definition of what is moral.

287
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,360
And that'll mean right and left, but I mean what would be correct or even in a sense

288
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,360
of altruism, right?

289
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:35,440
Or you've heard, do no harm or help your neighbor and do unto others as you want done

290
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,440
into you.

291
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:43,720
Every culture has some moral, I call it a dogma because there's hypocrisy that underlines

292
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,600
all of that, of course.

293
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,440
And when you talk about morality, I think that in the future we might have to define a

294
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,720
little bit more of the mechanisms behind it because if you say something is right or

295
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,320
wrong, there's a much more.

296
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:03,880
Much deeper structure associated with morality that goes into what's been communicated to

297
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,760
people regarding other sources and forces.

298
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,760
So again, that's a big term.

299
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,760
But I think that examination based on what people have translated as being right and wrong

300
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,760
is a good place to start.

301
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
Sure.

302
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:26,280
It does feel a little bit like you're talking around the answer, but well, it's not really

303
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:32,920
because simply like for example in the Western society, more a moral would be something that

304
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:39,040
is not approved by their quote unquote legal or justice system where moral is something

305
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,680
that would be approved by their legal or justice system.

306
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,000
And you notice I didn't say law.

307
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,360
So we'll eventually will have to get into showing whoever's listening that there's this

308
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:59,960
concept of deification, heavenly God's spirits, something that mankind has engaged in as a

309
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,720
society.

310
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:08,320
And it can be also be posed as a secular argument because even though the most secular quote

311
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,080
unquote atheistic people is not about whether you believe it or not, it's whether it exists

312
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:19,640
or not is that you'll see in the most secular situations as well references to deities.

313
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,080
All the way through science as well.

314
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,200
You know, what's that thing that looks like a mountain that spews molten rock?

315
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,000
What do they call that?

316
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,480
In English it's called a volcano.

317
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,480
Well, guess what?

318
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,440
There's a god called Vulcan, you know, justice.

319
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,440
Who's justice?

320
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,080
Why is it always a woman holding scales blindfolded?

321
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,400
Well, could that be a revived goddess religion?

322
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:49,000
So in essence, people consider when they hear someone is very religious, they immediately

323
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
associate them with being moral.

324
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,840
Well, what if your religion is to sacrifice children for breakfast?

325
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,840
Right?

326
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:02,080
Well, then that group that would be considered moral and this is not relative because when

327
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,880
you're in that society, the morality is the underpinning structure of what you're allowed

328
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:16,520
to do without, let's say, a quote unquote punishment and what you're not allowed to do with punishment.

329
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,960
I know you say that is defined by the legal system in a sense.

330
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,640
Of course, people understand that when you commit a crime and you get put on trial, there's

331
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,280
this aspect of almost shaming that you broke a law or whatever, but people have their own

332
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,960
or what they believe to be their own personal outlook and their own personal morality.

333
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,440
So when you ask somebody what's the right or wrong thing, they don't make reference to

334
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,320
a law, they make reference to their own convictions or what they think are their own convictions

335
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,240
and what feelings good.

336
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,840
So that goes beyond the legal system.

337
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,700
Right, and I think eventually you might even show that most people don't have original

338
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,840
and authentic thoughts.

339
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,840
Okay.

340
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:57,560
Yeah, that can be approached or broached.

341
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:04,320
Yeah, there've been an essence if you were to state the reality, you're on a planet called

342
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,480
Earth at this particular time in history.

343
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,480
However, again, you want to state that history.

344
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,400
And the status of most of the people on the planet currently are subjects.

345
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:22,080
They call them citizens, but they're subject to some form of authority and that authority dictates

346
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,520
whether it's overt or subliminally what the morality will be.

347
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,800
That's pretty obvious.

348
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:36,600
It's not considered and it's not discussed even in minor or major podcasts or sonic events.

349
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:42,560
These are subjects that people don't want to broach because they even have their own view

350
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:49,080
upon the subject as being relatively unstable and find safety with what the masses or the

351
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:56,160
numbers of people find to be correct as their point of view as well.

352
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:02,360
When we look at the known timeline of human history with civilization going back around

353
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,560
five to six thousand years ago with the Sumerians, at what point is one thing?

354
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,200
Is it possible to detect the emergence of some kind of censorship that is clearly acting

355
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,640
on people's ability to decipher the reality in front of them?

356
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,840
And do we include natural disasters and wars in the censorship classification?

357
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,560
Yes and no.

358
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:28,240
I would say generally if you understand that, like something like the Art of War, SunZoo,

359
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,680
that the Art of Negotiation to win without fighting is probably the most optimistic way

360
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:39,120
to resolve a feud or something that leads to war.

361
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,160
I would say yes, that cosmic sense.

362
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:50,360
The brutal, in other words, to jump to brutality and violence without a formative understanding

363
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:57,760
that negotiation and compromise leads to a better situation, I would say so.

364
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,320
And he said five or six thousand years ago could go back further than that, but I would

365
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:09,720
suggest that what we see at that point is not by studying, let's say, secular stuff, but

366
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,640
non-secular stuff, which would be let's say the ancient rites, because most of the ancient

367
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:19,840
rites or ancient writings, whether they're biblical or otherwise, tend to lean on a spiritual

368
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
side.

369
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,760
You know, they always evoke the presence of a God or a demon or an angel.

370
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,160
And in essence, you know, if you say the gods that should encompass all of that as well,

371
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,760
all spiritual beings.

372
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:36,040
And we will see that or anyone can see by studying the ancient rites that there is an involvement

373
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
there.

374
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:46,040
And in a modern society, you can consider depending on what fashion, what's in fashion

375
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:51,480
for the day or the decade or the year is the now there's the question that people speak

376
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:58,600
about ETs, you know, malevolent ETs perhaps, you know, but the cognitive mind can easily

377
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,000
encompass all of it.

378
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,800
If you going to bring up how the effect of cosmic censorship started, you can easily say

379
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:11,240
it's the gods, which would be gods, angels, demons, and so forth, spiritual beings that you

380
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:17,320
see evoked in ancient texts, you could also consider that there are other civilizations

381
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,320
that are doing it.

382
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,560
Let's say, you know, this is a psychological, you know, and unperceptable condition that

383
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,160
they project that mankind is basically blinded to many things and develop certain attitudes.

384
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:34,640
You can also view it as there is a group of humans or people, let's say, that have technology

385
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,080
that is far advanced to others, meaning it doesn't have to be the technology that we speak

386
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,360
on today, it could be technology where that is integrated with them that they've developed

387
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:49,080
like what they call "ciability", you know, a spiritual ability or psychic ability.

388
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,200
That is another possibility.

389
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,120
And you just or it could also be purely mechanical.

390
00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:00,720
You can have a little box that you turn a knob and everyone in the room or within an area

391
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,040
can't see, you know, their head from all on the ground anymore.

392
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:11,400
So you see, the reason I'm bringing these up is because you need to entertain the possibility

393
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,600
of all of these things.

394
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:21,240
And ultimately, is there something that is preventing people historically and presently from seeing

395
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,200
things that are quite obvious and can be presented to them in an obvious fashion that they can

396
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
understand?

397
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,520
Yes, there is.

398
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,840
And hence the term again, cosmic censorship and it does go back in history.

399
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,600
Anyone who is even slightly familiar with the biblical text is aware of things like the

400
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,520
Tower of Babel and the writings and prophets where the prophets are told that they are to

401
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,200
close the eyes and ears of the people.

402
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,440
You see?

403
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,440
And you'll also see it in many other ancient rites.

404
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:54,280
It's brought up here and there, but essentially the lean heavily on what we call the gods.

405
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:59,200
Again, angels, demons and gods, God heads, Demi, God.

406
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:07,160
But I would suggest also to fully encompass the study that it can be done, you know, by

407
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,680
beings that are not gods as well.

408
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:14,000
I'm just throwing it out as a speculative, speculative condition, but the condition does

409
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,560
exist in ancient times all the way through.

410
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:23,520
And how it's, again, just back to the question, it started very early on and seems to prevail.

411
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:31,440
And one way to, to, let's say, do a quick judgment on that is the concept of war, a provocation

412
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,920
where the parties are not aware that there is a third party provoking them is a form of cosmic

413
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,920
censorship.

414
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:43,760
Yeah, you did mention at one point, I don't know if it was in the last week's episode

415
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:50,240
or privately that there have been, you know, wars around longer than they've been other

416
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,800
things like banks.

417
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,000
So therefore you can't just blame war on bankers.

418
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,280
Obviously it has to be something that goes a bit further than what we can perceive the presence

419
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,800
of longstanding issues of tension.

420
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,800
Sure.

421
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:06,680
Then again, one day we'll probably touch on it in short, but even the concept of what people

422
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,280
call the bankers, how can there you have bankers when there's no money?

423
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,360
The entire world's on a credit-based economy.

424
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:19,920
So again, it's very Alice in Wonderlandish, you know, very, it's almost in a, it's like a

425
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:25,880
sec, if you start studying the bankers, for example, it's like a psychedelic acid trip.

426
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,440
And all of the information, by the way, can be corroborated and supported with their own

427
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,720
writings and laws.

428
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,680
So the question, I guess, harking back to how early the cosmic censorship started, I would

429
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:47,520
say as far back as anything recorded, not only about human society, but by human society,

430
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,880
meaning, well, you could take that however you want.

431
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:57,440
You will see that there is a force interfering not for the best possible outcome, which

432
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:03,520
not necessarily means to bring pestilence and disease, but to just carry mankind along

433
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:08,360
over a duration, kind of like the metaphor that I've used before, the waiting room.

434
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,160
It seems like a human society throughout history has been in a waiting room of some kind,

435
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,840
and I mean, the term waiting room, as I would, like you were waiting at a dentist or a doctor's

436
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,400
office, were waiting in an administrative setting where you're told to sit down and wait

437
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,160
and take up time.

438
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:30,120
Yeah, I think that there's going to be more space to explore that theme a bit later.

439
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:36,400
But one thing that you talked about in a previous episode was the idea of the blob, describing

440
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:41,760
how mass society is currently akin to like a formless sludge that simply takes the shape

441
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,760
of its container because of how thoughtless it is.

442
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,840
So, I want to get back to that a little bit.

443
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,960
So Western society is essentially upheld by two pillars.

444
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,960
One of them is the Judeo-Christian tradition, which was the state-sponsored religion of

445
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,160
the Roman Empire.

446
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,480
The second pillar is the Greco-Roman, which generated the enlightenment and the Renaissance, and

447
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,680
shaped Western culture around its philosophies and traditions.

448
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:09,960
However, what is curious to me is how, despite the heritage and the legacy of the enlightenment

449
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:16,120
and Renaissance period, it seems ironically that the typical 21st century Western person

450
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,480
is not the cultured intellectual that those periods revere.

451
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,280
It's rather become the disinterested and almost proudly ignorant every man or plebeian,

452
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,440
the aggregate of which is this blob that you mentioned.

453
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,120
Can you lay out what some of the key developments in modern history have been that have led

454
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:39,160
to this current state of mass uniformity of which I think cosmic censorship plays a role?

455
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:46,400
Well, I would say, even if you laid out an elaborate scheme that is prevalent today about

456
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,640
the cosmic censorship in modern society, I would suggest that the same scheme was overlaid

457
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:56,000
in mass in past societies, it's just that we may not know about it.

458
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,200
And with research on how people have been guided as you would see their cultures permit is

459
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,000
very similar.

460
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,000
So in essence, when we just bring it up in a modern context, it's also the overall outcome

461
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,280
is the same in older contexts.

462
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,480
Except for now, people are walking around with what I call the stupid rectangles in their

463
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:25,440
pocket, a little touchscreen, or at home or wherever.

464
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:33,200
They do it using light and sound versus just hearing or reading.

465
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,400
It's a technological, let's say, evolution where people are more connected, where people

466
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,880
are more connected, where time seems to be shortened for the message.

467
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,880
So in modern times, the only difference again, because you'll see the control that goes

468
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,880
back all throughout humankind, is that what would probably took weeks, months, or years

469
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:01,240
to accomplish in the past, can be accomplished now in a matter of minutes or hours, or maximum

470
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,400
days.

471
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,480
And the reason I say maximum days is because you'll notice how the interest changes over

472
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,920
a few days sometimes.

473
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:17,120
So the danger of, let me just retract that term, danger.

474
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:24,320
The condition that the quote unquote "modern" is in right now is far more extreme than any

475
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,600
other time in history because of the almost instantaneous exchange of information with

476
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,080
the stupid rectangle.

477
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,920
And for people who just to clarify a stupid rectangle is, if you have a smart device in your

478
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,360
pocket, just take it out and just hold it about three feet away from you, what does it look

479
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,200
like?

480
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:50,480
So I would suggest that the main element of modern society and cosmic censorship is almost

481
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,920
instantaneous censorship, right?

482
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,960
And just to go back to the blob aspect, that has to tie in if anyone wants to study the

483
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,280
crowd by Gustav Leban.

484
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:08,760
Now I'm not endorsing that piece of work or Gustav Leban, but it's something that sticks

485
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:14,580
out notably if you just want to study the subject of how people form groups and why the groups

486
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:19,320
are formed and just a study on group think.

487
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:25,520
And the reason I call them a blob and such is because the individual is consumed and consumed

488
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,520
by the group.

489
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:32,680
In other words, his individuality or the interest of the single person no longer is of any

490
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,080
avail to the group.

491
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:39,200
This is a group actually, there's so many single people are eliminated that there is no more

492
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,440
group other than that.

493
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,280
That's why I referenced it as a blob.

494
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:53,160
And essentially if you're going to promote through this new way of instantaneous communication

495
00:37:53,160 --> 00:38:00,360
to the group, you in essence view them as a blob, you see, or taking the shape of the

496
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,640
container.

497
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:09,480
But we are living in an era where the idea of individuality is sort of at the apex of

498
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,040
human striving and there's a lot of effort in a lot of media and a lot of marketing that

499
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,960
goes into pushing that idea.

500
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,680
So if you have people that are partaking in the crafting of their individuality through

501
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,600
the means that they know or that they've been shown, how do you reconcile that with

502
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,200
the idea that also they are more blob than they are person?

503
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:38,080
That is part of the Alice in Wonderland or Wellian or just plain out deception.

504
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:45,280
What I mean by that is the extremeness of the current reality is just that.

505
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,440
It's so extreme that it's become almost esoteric, meaning the point that you just brought

506
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:56,000
up about the accentuation of individuality, the reality of it is quite the opposite.

507
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,760
Someone who is ever, let's say, if you're older than 30 or 40 and you've been through various

508
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,440
administrative authorities through your personal experiences or even education system

509
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,600
or religious system, what I mean by that is if you've ever had a sit down with a priest

510
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:20,880
or a rabbi or an imam regarding, critical questions regarding one place in society, if you've

511
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:25,440
ever had a similar conversation with, let's say, what they call a legal judge in the

512
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:32,160
legal administration system or the political system or the education system from a point

513
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,520
to point or person to person conversation with an authority in one of these administrative

514
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:45,000
institutions, they will always tell you you have to be just like everyone else and the

515
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,280
entire thing just falls apart.

516
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,400
I've actually even recently in passing had overheard a conversation with what they call

517
00:39:53,400 --> 00:40:00,320
police officers and someone bringing up points in the law and the police, so-called police

518
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,400
officer said, "I'm not interested in that you have to do what everyone else does."

519
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,840
I personally have had conversation several lunches with Supreme Court Justice bringing up

520
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:15,320
five points of the law and they say you have to do what everyone else does because no one

521
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,400
knows what you're talking about.

522
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,760
I've had conversations with people in clergy and they say the same thing of many different

523
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,760
religions.

524
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,760
You have to do, we go by tradition and if you're interested in what we do, you have to do

525
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,640
what everyone else does.

526
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,000
So again, I just want to bring up the point of the individual being accentuated or emphasized

527
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,920
as a complete farce.

528
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:42,560
But even if you say that the premises of a period like the Renaissance are farce, there

529
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,800
are still events or agendas that were put in place to specifically create today's

530
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,160
world of homogenized reactive consumers.

531
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,520
And the Renaissance could perhaps be said to be one of those events.

532
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,800
What I'm curious to hear is what other events would you point to within the last 400 years

533
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,440
of modern history that contribute equally to that?

534
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,280
Because I mean, surely we can talk about industrial developments or timekeeping or population

535
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,400
changes or the rise of contemporary art or things like this.

536
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,680
Well, I think those are secondary to what one can examine regarding what's called a

537
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:22,280
authority because at the end of the day people sleep better if they feel like they're in

538
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,880
line with what the authority wants them to do, quote unquote, the authority, right?

539
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,920
So if you look back at something called the concept of the nation state, Westphalia,

540
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:40,560
agreements, 1600s or so and all the way forward to the post-Napoleonic upheavals to what

541
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:47,480
they call the early world wars, you'll notice that there is a vacuum of information

542
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,920
regarding on how these authorities are being set up.

543
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,920
So I would suggest that the quest for power over societies, known as nations and countries

544
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:04,160
and just societies in general, whether they're subdivisions of the main country or whatever

545
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:10,200
has not gone away, but the information about how it has been done has, you see.

546
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:15,320
So for example, you have a society that's led by a king in an ancient times and you have

547
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:23,960
some even today, but I would suggest that that notion of a type of political system or

548
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,880
authority set up as a monarchy or what they call a democracy or parliamentary administration

549
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:38,560
or whatever is all part of, let's say, a charade now or it's just theater, it's just theater

550
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:46,520
that if one were to examine why does he say that it's theater and come up with a clear answer

551
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:52,360
that you're basically the entire world has been subjugated by a very small group of people

552
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,600
that do not want to be known.

553
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:59,880
You'll see there is a vacuum of information in the past 400 years on how this has been

554
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,880
achieved as it is today.

555
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:07,640
And evidence of why you live as a subject basically as property of a very small group of

556
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:12,080
people is just by looking at quote unquote how the legal system is set up.

557
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,840
Everyone is registered as property.

558
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,200
You're given a number.

559
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:25,640
All of your actions are recorded and categorized not only by gender, you know, whether you're

560
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:32,360
male or female or man or woman or also by your race and your creed.

561
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:43,280
You'll notice that the entire set up as it is as it's landed today is all based on commerce.

562
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,960
Basically there is no concern for people other than in a commercial sense.

563
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:59,480
So if you again understand the early ways of authoritarianism and you understand the current

564
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,800
ways of authoritarianism, this is also based on what's good and evil and morality and how

565
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,440
society is being run.

566
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,880
You'll see there is a vacuum in the past 400 years of how things have gotten the way that

567
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,360
they are today.

568
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:19,520
Most people don't make any quam that they're registered and they're given a serial number

569
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,400
like a toaster or washing machine or a car.

570
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,440
You know, most people don't worry and are concerned that they're living under a credit

571
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,120
based economy with no lawful money and circulation.

572
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:38,300
Most people don't understand how there is a hierarchy being set up through academia and

573
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,720
political systems, how it got this way.

574
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,360
They don't see it.

575
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:46,280
And that's where I would consider there's been a vacuum of information in the past 400

576
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:52,960
years because in order for it to succeed into the stable, or semi-stable environment, it

577
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,960
is today.

578
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,840
That would suggest it's more stable than semi-stable because when you hear of instability, that is

579
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,400
also manufactured to a degree.

580
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:06,500
There is no question really about how in the past 400 years you've gotten from one way of

581
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,200
society living with a certain mindset and then the current mindset that there is today.

582
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,960
So I would suggest that there is more of a vacuum than anything that I could point out and say,

583
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:20,600
"Hey, look, this is an interesting notable thing in the past 400 years."

584
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:26,880
Okay, that gives a lot of food for thought.

585
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:34,600
For people that are unused to hearing polemics against the canon of modern history, I still

586
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:40,480
think you could better buttress your claims that what is touted as the most defining period

587
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,560
of modern history, namely the 17th and 18th century, are farce.

588
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,520
Like why was the Renaissance, for example, a farce?

589
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,600
And can that be shown objectively aside from your view of things?

590
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:59,720
Well, look at what it's led you to, not you, but specifically the society at large.

591
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:06,280
You're essentially now reduced to a piece of property.

592
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,200
And most people don't see that and they never will.

593
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,280
And when I say never, I mean in a very general sense, no, they won't see it.

594
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,240
And then one would go back and maybe ask a philosophical question, "Is mankind supposed

595
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,560
to be this way?"

596
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,480
You know, that's the question.

597
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:28,360
Is mankind supposed to be numbered and labeled and registered as it is today?

598
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,240
And how did it get to that point?

599
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,240
And I'm not asking that.

600
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,560
I know how it got there.

601
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,560
Most people do.

602
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,240
Most people don't.

603
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:47,120
So I would suggest that any kind of a renaissance that leads a society on a planet known as Earth

604
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:52,600
into abject slavery, which is in a sense what it is.

605
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,120
And this is not a comment.

606
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,400
This is an actual fact.

607
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,320
You can call the slaves whatever you want.

608
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:05,720
You want to call them citizens or subjects or Americans, Iraqis, Russians, Colombians, whatever.

609
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:14,440
I would suggest that if you look at the past 400 years and the post renaissance period,

610
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:21,840
having a vacuous body, in other words, the situation just didn't happen by chance.

611
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:31,440
And to see the vacuum and the lack of body of work to explain how you've gone from being

612
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:39,600
even surfs on a field, harvesting wheat to being registered with numbers and living in a

613
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:49,640
credit-based economy, with everything being in a pseudo state is quite the achievement.

614
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:55,120
So in essence, when you say it was a renaissance, who would you say it was a renaissance for?

615
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:59,640
I wouldn't say it's for the mass population on the planet at large.

616
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:06,040
It was actually their defeat, the cosmic from a cosmic point of view.

617
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:10,800
If you traveled anywhere in the universe and said, "We're going to take this planet here

618
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:16,920
and turn everyone into our property," you wouldn't be viewed as a hero.

619
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,160
Well, would you?

620
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:25,520
Depends on who you're talking to.

621
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:31,720
How's on the topic of the aspects of the Greco-Roman legacy like the renaissance?

622
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:36,280
You've mentioned to me in the past privately that the Romans were not that interested in truth

623
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,120
despite the lofty facade of what could be seen in their writings about virtue and honor

624
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,360
and so forth.

625
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,360
Can you expand on that because I think it has implications for the age that we're living

626
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:50,560
in in terms of how to contend with truth in light of cosmic censorship?

627
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:59,840
The Western society has adopted a lot of the, not only cultural, but most social aspects

628
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:03,880
of authoritarianism from the Roman civil aspect.

629
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:13,240
The Roman society that I would say started around 200 to 300 BC from that time, the later

630
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:19,000
Roman Emperor, where the first god Emperor Augustus Caesar around the first century or BC

631
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:27,440
or so at the end of that time, they kind of solidified what we now define as a Roman system.

632
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,000
And the Romans have never been interested in the truth.

633
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:40,080
They are an authoritarian group that has assimilated other cultures, especially the Greek culture,

634
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,080
for example.

635
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:47,040
You will find in history that the artisans, philosophers, scientists, what have you,

636
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,320
of ancient Rome were not Roman at all.

637
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:56,440
They were essentially adopted from other cultures, I would say, mostly the Greek culture.

638
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:03,480
And there were a, might makes right, which, you know, where is there, you know, is there

639
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,480
a truth and might makes right?

640
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:12,680
Yes, if you stated as such, you know, but they are not interested in truth, for example.

641
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:19,760
One example, politically, the political system of the, of Rome at the time was very corrupt

642
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:26,000
in terms of being, you know, hypocrisy, waste, theft, immorality.

643
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,400
And there was an apparatus, a very strong apparatus to cover that up and always painted white

644
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,400
wash it as, you know, as being honorable and dignified, right?

645
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:40,280
And you can notice that this is through all the modern political systems as well.

646
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:46,400
The Roman system of quote unquote justice or law or legal system, again, was not based

647
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,400
on truth.

648
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,600
It was based on authoritarianism, right?

649
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:58,960
Again, you can almost view it as, as one would view their timekeeping, for example, no one

650
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:06,480
is questioning the Gregorian calendar, you know, the current timekeeping, the year, date,

651
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:12,520
and months for the, the, the, the commercial, in a commercial sense and social norm is to

652
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,160
adopt the Gregorian calendar.

653
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,800
People never address it as such.

654
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,440
They just ask, you know, what day is it?

655
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,400
And they spout off something off of that.

656
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:26,960
And if you look at the history of it, they'll even in today's modern timekeeping authority, they'll

657
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,880
tell you that it's an arbitrary system.

658
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,120
Well, this is solar calendar.

659
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,440
Well, the sun's movement is an arbitrary.

660
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,440
Sure they are.

661
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:38,440
Sure they are.

662
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,440
You ever heard of a leap year?

663
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,440
Yeah.

664
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,440
Yeah.

665
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:48,520
So, I would suggest that, you know, looking at anything from a lawful perspective, you will

666
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:57,040
find it to be again, shown in a very authoritative way when it's under the Roman system and then when

667
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:03,280
it's to, you try to define it, you know, what's being put in front, forward from a Roman system

668
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:07,280
and you will see there's no truth in it or it has no lawful base.

669
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,720
But I don't make great, a lot of, you know, people who hear this who perhaps are versed in

670
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:17,000
classical studies or ancient studies would say or claim that the Romans had all these philosophers

671
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,360
like the Greeks did and they, they had an output that clearly showed what their intentions

672
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,600
and culture was and that is not an accord to what you're talking about.

673
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:30,520
Well, if you look at their, name some Roman philosophers that don't have Greek backgrounds,

674
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,520
you can't.

675
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:35,600
They do exist, but they're not, they're very minor.

676
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:40,680
Name, name architects that are a Roman that don't have a Greek background or Greeks themselves.

677
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:43,520
And this goes all the way to the Renaissance time.

678
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:49,240
And also when you, when you bring up the, the aspect of the Romans, I'm not interested in any

679
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:54,200
truth, this is actually, you will find this as a criticism throughout history about

680
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,200
Rome.

681
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,960
I've been moralized in people's writings.

682
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:58,960
That is.

683
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,960
Oh, yeah.

684
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,960
Yeah.

685
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,960
And I'm saying this because I'm fair.

686
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,960
I'm not a, a, a, a, a, a, or against it.

687
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,960
I'm just objectifying it.

688
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:19,360
And fair would mean, you know, bring up something and present something that anyone can access,

689
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:25,840
not just your opinion or your belief because eventually those are unsubstantiated and because

690
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:31,400
I think as we've discussed and maybe we will in the future that the, the individual is a

691
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,040
very little import.

692
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:40,320
And it, it sounds contrary to what people are being told, but, you know, once you start

693
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:46,840
to do some study, you will find that the, the quote unquote society has been groomed a

694
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:51,120
certain way, not individual by individual, but a group at a time.

695
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:55,240
Would you say that there is a, I mean, obviously if you go back in time, you end up with different

696
00:53:55,240 --> 00:54:00,240
circumstances where perhaps you could say that people were more at the mercies of nature

697
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:05,120
or certain forces or circumstances that we perhaps have alleviated somewhat today with

698
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,440
technology.

699
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:10,320
But would you say that there is a dividing line somewhere as far as perhaps ancient era

700
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:16,600
versus modern era or medieval period where this sort of homogenization started to become

701
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:22,440
very adamant because at some point you did have some kind of a flourishing of individual

702
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,880
sensibilities, which, you know, would have been notable at that point, which perhaps don't

703
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,400
exist anymore today.

704
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,320
The only thing that doesn't exist anymore is the, the amount of time that it takes to

705
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,640
communicate.

706
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:35,840
That's been shortened.

707
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:40,680
Everything else is still, you know, I would say prevalent because, for example, if you take

708
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,840
what's called the education system, if you look at the standards that were held as a

709
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:50,760
good education, a hundred years ago, in any country, by the way, or any culture to 300

710
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:58,000
to 500 to a thousand years ago, you'll notice that diminished, that has diminished drastically.

711
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:06,640
So again, that is more of the macrocosmic censorship versus the microcosmic censorship.

712
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,120
People are being, I call it, dumbed up.

713
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:15,760
They like, most like to refer to it as being dumbed down, but when something is increasing,

714
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,760
it's going up.

715
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,720
So that's why I call it being dumbed up.

716
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:25,280
I think a lot of the history that we've been given is merely a farce, and that needs to

717
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,280
be revisited.

718
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:31,560
I think we were all walking around with this glorified romanticism about things like the

719
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,880
Renaissance or certain societies.

720
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:39,720
I think right now, ultimately, without putting, without regret, I could say, we're in the best

721
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:47,160
condition, potential condition, currently, than ever any other time in history.

722
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:54,720
By looking at the modern era, particularly since the arrival of mass media, it does seem

723
00:55:54,720 --> 00:56:00,720
like the 20th century has introduced to sort of hitherto unseen social state.

724
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:05,720
So as a result, we're confronted with this sort of widespread existence of a type of person

725
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:12,040
who acts less like his own autonomous agent of his life and is more of a reactionary subject

726
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:17,160
with a flavorless identity that sort of melts into this blob.

727
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:21,320
This has happened in spite of the Renaissance and light knew, and as you mentioned, perhaps

728
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:23,200
they're overrated.

729
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,520
But from these movements, we've both this idea of the individual, where a person who is

730
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,480
removed from a group control can be his own sovereign.

731
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:36,480
So this quandary of having really nothing to choose from other than the unintellectual

732
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,440
individual on one side or the impressionable masses on the other side has been a source

733
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,960
of frustration, I think, for a long time.

734
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:49,320
And one of the statements that has been birthed of that, that I think we hear now in the

735
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:53,200
last two or three, maybe even four decades is that people are stupid.

736
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:59,800
You see this a lot of movies and cartoons, and it's sort of taken in jest, even as we

737
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:05,440
see it in articles and memes and books that sort of decry how unbearable or unreasonable

738
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,440
mankind can be.

739
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:11,200
It's taken as a sort of satire so people have an excuse not to really address it.

740
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,400
Why is it that a statement like people are stupid or some variation of that is still popular

741
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,680
despite all of the outcry and the polemics against humanity that we've seen over the thousands

742
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:23,600
of years in the form of literature and media?

743
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:28,440
Okay, let's replace the word stupid with the word broken because I think when you say

744
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,960
the word stupid, it evokes a little bit of humor, well, you know, just like half ingest

745
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,120
all in earnest, right?

746
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:38,760
Let's replace it with the word broken where people made to be broken.

747
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:39,760
No.

748
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,760
Are they broken?

749
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,760
Yes.

750
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,800
You can even see in a poetic way, you know, when something or a living is broken, it means

751
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:52,840
that they lose their will, they lose their capacity to act as to any potential that they

752
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:55,840
would have had before or do have.

753
00:57:55,840 --> 00:58:02,080
So I would suggest that one way to view people are stupid as people are broken because then

754
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:04,480
you can answer the question very simply.

755
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:10,760
And again, you sort of skimmed by the concept of individuality again.

756
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:16,280
And while you were saying that, I thought of a very simple notion that the propagandists

757
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:22,840
like to use is that when the propagandists are or any control mechanism, social control mechanism,

758
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:27,920
promotes individuality, they're simply doing that because they know that once the individual

759
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:32,920
is promoted, the individual tends to feel more alone and they're easier to control that

760
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:33,920
way.

761
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:41,340
You see, albeit if one studies Gustav Leban, let's say, or the crowd or group mentality,

762
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:47,480
inside the individual has to abandon the self to become so adherent to a group.

763
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:57,720
So again, just tying it in, again, these are complex matters that can be simplified easily,

764
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:02,760
believe it or not, but they don't appear to be as simple as they are because of all the

765
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,640
various overlays on it.

766
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,560
Again, there's a romanticized history.

767
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:13,600
There is a constant changes in culture and what's fashionable.

768
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:19,000
And then of course, again, to lead back to the overall cosmic censorship that is our humans

769
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
being censored.

770
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,160
In other words, are we being blocked?

771
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,400
And the answer to that is clearly yes.

772
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,880
And it can be supported more qualitatively than quantitatively because, for example, recently

773
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:35,760
I read an article about someone remote viewing moon bases and it was a quite esteemed remote

774
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,760
viewer in the past.

775
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:41,320
And the critique on the book was that, well, there is no supporting evidence on what he's

776
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,320
saying.

777
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:46,000
Well, that's just quantitative, not qualitative, you see.

778
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:53,480
So what people are looking for and what exists when it coincides, then the coincidence of

779
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:57,240
those two things is the direction of society.

780
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:06,000
So for example, if you have people that are being manipulated or blocked and their expectations

781
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:12,480
are limited to the resulting of that blocking, then the society will remain in harmony.

782
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:19,040
But if the individuals will say blocked or cut off or censored and their expectations

783
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:24,720
are not met, then you have uneasiness and then the formula has to be redone because you

784
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,720
won't be able to control them.

785
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:33,560
I do agree that broken is functionally a more suitable word than stupid to address this

786
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,800
condition.

787
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:39,960
But I will return to the word stupid for a second because it does have a meaning, right?

788
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,000
So it's not just this pejorative, nothing that we treat it as.

789
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,840
But if we were to take the word seriously for a second and we could replace that with

790
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,840
something like folly instead.

791
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,760
But this is still something that has been talked about for a very long time throughout

792
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:56,320
human history in more than just a pejorative way.

793
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:01,400
So the curious thing about stupidity or folly for me is that society doesn't seem to

794
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,800
know much about it.

795
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:08,520
I don't know of any center for the study of willful ignorance or any serious academic investigation

796
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,120
into the subject.

797
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:15,480
And you will find a lot of people bloating nowadays about gratitude and happiness and

798
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,960
things that are very much in line with the new age movement.

799
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:24,200
So it's not out of the question to make a foray into various mental conditions or mental

800
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,200
states.

801
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,160
But when it comes to stupidity, we don't really see that.

802
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:32,560
And when we broached the subject of mental capacity or intelligence, people would defer

803
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:36,520
to the idea of IQ scores as being the only way to measure that.

804
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:41,720
If we can't really define what people refuse to define what stupidity or foolishness is,

805
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,280
how can we then claim to know what knowledge or wisdom is?

806
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,280
Yes.

807
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,320
Well, just while you were saying that.

808
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:53,600
I looked at the etymological definition of stupid, mentally slow lacking ordinary activity

809
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,000
of mind, dolly, name, or stupid person here.

810
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,320
It has an insensibility, numbness, dullness.

811
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:02,440
You hear that very much in society.

812
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,640
People are not sensible in terms of common sense.

813
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:06,640
They're numb, right?

814
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,360
Apathetic and dullness.

815
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:10,480
Where's the creativity?

816
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:15,760
So I would say that in terms of the other terms being used, they can be defined.

817
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,200
Iran can be defined, idiot can be defined.

818
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:22,760
But I think what overshadows all of it is the prevalent use in the, especially in the English

819
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:27,840
language, the use of the word nice misused, all right?

820
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:32,840
And I think that without getting into just, we can do just do one hour podcast and just

821
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:38,000
the word nice and the implications of using it the way it's being used versus what it really

822
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,320
means.

823
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:43,320
So if you were to say people are nice, isn't it the same as saying people are stupid?

824
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,320
Well, then we have to define nice.

825
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:47,480
Right, we have to define nice.

826
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:51,840
It's in essence, we use foolish, stupid and senseless.

827
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:55,720
The interesting thing, depending on, again, this to turn away from you and I speaking and

828
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,880
turn to the audience is, are you a fool?

829
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,160
You know, whoever is listening.

830
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:07,880
Well, one way to judge a fool is if you bring them competent, sensible and objective,

831
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:14,880
objectively good information and it's rejected, without being considered, you're a fool.

832
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:15,880
Right?

833
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:20,360
I think there's an ancient RIT that talks about don't suffer fools, you know, or if you

834
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:23,320
you mess around with fools, it's your fault.

835
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,040
And that's to the audience, by the way.

836
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,880
So, you know, are you a fool?

837
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:31,360
You know, how many times have you come across in your own personal life information that

838
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,360
you didn't want to consider?

839
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:37,160
Now, that goes beyond, for example, something where you'll hear people say, well, I just

840
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,680
did something stupid.

841
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,160
How many times do you hear that?

842
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,160
Well, let's go back and look at that very closely or not.

843
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:44,560
Actually, let's not look at it very closely.

844
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:47,400
Just came over it because it's just the same as looking at it closely.

845
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:51,400
It means that you knew better, but you didn't implement that knowledge.

846
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,400
Right?

847
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:58,840
Because if you never knew that or you never knew better, you would never in, in, in, after

848
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:02,000
thought say I did something stupid.

849
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,160
Now what if you didn't have the, this basic knowledge?

850
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:10,040
Well, it's, I wouldn't say wisdom is basic, but let's just call it the knowledge, let's

851
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:12,400
say a wise mindset.

852
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:17,720
Would you, is it possible, either a group or an individual to continuously do things that

853
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:21,400
are, quote, unquote, stupid and never know it?

854
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,160
The answer to that is yes.

855
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,160
Right?

856
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:29,440
And if you want an example of that, if you're probably sitting in a room with a door, just

857
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,720
open the door and go outside.

858
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:39,200
So in connection with that as far as wisdom, it does sound like you're saying that wisdom

859
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,920
is something that is in, in scar supply.

860
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:48,200
So we can say that there is a current, a widespread proliferation of stupidity or foolishness

861
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:49,360
or folly.

862
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:53,840
That to me doesn't seem to be insignificant in terms of analyzing cosmic censorship.

863
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:57,800
Well, analyzing cosmic censorship is interesting in itself.

864
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:03,240
And I think it's going to be ongoing until, you know, you, you run into the quandary where

865
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:08,040
you have, let's say here in quotes, the, the next few sentences here, an individual that

866
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,880
is so evolved beyond the current norm.

867
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:17,000
And it's so perceptive and knowing that they view more of reality than the others.

868
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,220
And they notice that the others that don't view and don't have those abilities can't be

869
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:24,720
changed because of an external force.

870
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:26,520
Then you can have it defined.

871
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:31,600
But the, the catch there is who you're going to define it to.

872
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:37,640
Because there's only, let's say, a select group, whether it's by divine implication or

873
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:42,600
random numbers or whatever you want to call it, a percentage, a very small group of people

874
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,600
that could see beyond others that can perceive beyond others.

875
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,120
Let's say comprehend beyond others and perform beyond others.

876
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:54,720
They, themselves, will contain this knowledge within their group.

877
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,480
Because they'll view the other group.

878
01:05:56,480 --> 01:06:01,520
It wants it to establish that the rest are not capable of going down that path or even

879
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:04,400
comprehending the condition that they're in.

880
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:05,400
You see?

881
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:11,560
It's going to be the true understanding of cosmic censorship will never be public or you can,

882
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,560
but it wouldn't matter.

883
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:17,000
It would be speaking Chinese to an all-inglish audience.

884
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:23,480
That's why many, many conversations can be held regarding, look how many secrets are

885
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,240
hidden in plain sight, right?

886
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:30,680
Look at how all of this was shown to you, but it didn't really matter until this happened,

887
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:33,040
yeah?

888
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:37,720
One can say then what's the importance of discussing cosmic censorship or defining it

889
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:38,720
now?

890
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,720
Very simply.

891
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:46,600
And again, if anyone's heard Greek speak before, the motto of Greek speak is, be set apart.

892
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,680
You have to set yourself apart from it first.

893
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:54,600
And anyone that's taken basic survival training, let's say a ship goes down and you're on a

894
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,240
lifeboat.

895
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:01,920
The training, the one that is trained for that situation to prevail or help others or

896
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:06,840
to have a special team in high survivability or survivalist would be that you have to set

897
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,240
yourself apart from the panic.

898
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:12,160
You have to set yourself apart of the ignorance of what to do.

899
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:17,520
You have to set yourself apart of the potential, the being disabled by the potential danger.

900
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:20,080
And you have to think clearly and you have to be calm.

901
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:24,440
How many times have you heard that people in harsh situations remain calm?

902
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,440
Think clearly.

903
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,880
Just remember what you're training taught you, right?

904
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:36,040
So quote unquote, special forces, people that are highly trained with very highly specialized

905
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:41,800
abilities to prevail in risky situations or harsh situations have to set themselves

906
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,360
apart even from these surrounding conditions.

907
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,360
You see?

908
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:53,200
So ultimately, what one can consider with the cosmic censorship is you're on your own

909
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:57,240
with this meaning it doesn't mean that you can't converse with other people.

910
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:02,760
And there ultimately can't be a group, quote unquote, very loose group of people that study

911
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:08,560
and ponder this, but it ain't going to change anything because it's part of the prevailing

912
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,200
condition.

913
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:15,720
But hold on now, it's not going to change anything, but we can see in the world that there is

914
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:19,960
this universal disacoolerbrum which refuses to write itself.

915
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:24,480
And in response to that, we have had people over the past two or three decades that have

916
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,840
begun protesting very noticeably.

917
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:30,880
It's obviously older than two or three decades, but as far as the most recent modern period

918
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:36,960
that most people remember, we have the alternative media having come to the sort of forefront where

919
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,440
the likes of a David Ike who becomes famous in the mid to late early to mid 90s for his

920
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:46,200
political talks is on the scene in Alex Jones follows soon after with his radio show in

921
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:50,520
the late 90s to early mid 2000s and his documentaries.

922
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:56,920
But from what I see, it really is in until 2007 with the zeitgeist movie that we do get a distinct

923
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:01,520
tipping point for what is generally called the consciousness movement, which has now become

924
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:05,440
a permanent fixture at the edges of the mainstream society.

925
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:10,440
And it does occasionally penetrate that mainstream when groups like anonymous become popular.

926
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:16,840
So now over the past ten, fifteen years it's become invoked to be questionable of society.

927
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:21,600
Why is it Greek that despite the efforts of various alternative media personalities to wake

928
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,680
up the masses that we don't see this large scale awakening taking place?

929
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:29,200
Okay, let's backtrack the names that you mentioned.

930
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,960
And let's just not limit it to the names, but just for the sake of the next few minutes,

931
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:38,080
let's just bring evoke the names that you brought up and consider that.

932
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,240
These people that you just mentioned are popular.

933
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:41,920
Yes, yes, they are.

934
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,320
Many people have heard of them, not everyone, but I would say most even people on the street

935
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,600
would have heard of them.

936
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:55,120
Now, in order for them to be that popular, they would have to accommodate the current audience.

937
01:09:55,120 --> 01:10:00,960
And one would summarize that before they started speaking the way they did, the audience

938
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,560
was in one condition.

939
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:08,560
And when the people started hearing these people that you mentioned speak, the people

940
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,080
now in this other condition, that's the presumption.

941
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:15,120
You know, quote unquote, these people are more conscious awake or whatever.

942
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:20,320
And they're not because in order to be popular, you have to accommodate the prevailing condition

943
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,720
and maintain it.

944
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:27,280
So the people that are attracted, generally, now I would say that I wouldn't say I'm directly

945
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,280
attracted to.

946
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:31,800
I look at, try to look at everything broadly, but the people that are generally attracted

947
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:40,000
to this consciousness, consciousness, conspiratorial, alternative, whatever, even the peacenix

948
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:46,640
are, they're, you know, they used to call them in the 60s and 70s, are not any different

949
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,720
inherently than the rest.

950
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:55,000
In other words, they have a limited perception while they're engaging in their alternative

951
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:01,240
means as well, because the people that brought them in on this, meaning the names that you

952
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:07,440
brought, had to initially start their campaign by accommodating the current mindset.

953
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:15,320
So it's, again, if you go to the zoo and you want to feed the animals, well, you have one

954
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:19,080
bag for the lions with a certain type of food, a different one for the monkeys, a different

955
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:25,360
one for the birds, and that does not change as long as there are monkeys, lions and birds

956
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,360
and fish or whatever, different types.

957
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:35,560
So the type that all of the alternative campaigns, let's call them, and individuals, of people

958
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:40,560
that they attract, they have to take them out or present it to what's called mainstream

959
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,680
or the common consensus.

960
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:48,600
And what they do is they lead them around and it'll be one specific subject, isolated

961
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:55,520
and sequestured from all the other pertinent ones and nothing changes.

962
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:00,160
But is that to say that that sphere of knowledge should be ignored completely?

963
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:05,000
I mean, there are things that come out of it that do contrast to the mainstream know

964
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,440
that do seem to offset that.

965
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:11,600
Well, as I said earlier, not ignored, but considered.

966
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:17,400
For example, personally, I'm not attracted to the alternative stuff anymore than the mainstream.

967
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:22,040
I consider it though, meaning consider it like when you're presented with something,

968
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:27,120
whether it's mainstream or alternative, accepted or unaccepted, when you consider it,

969
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,920
well, you look at what's being presented in the various ways you would look at any other

970
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,840
piece of information.

971
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:38,920
And then once you're depending on if it peaks interest or how significant it is to the

972
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:43,440
individual, how much time they want to invest in it.

973
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:49,080
For example, I'll go on the stupid rectangle and if it's a particular news item that's

974
01:12:49,080 --> 01:12:55,440
brought up what's called the news, you know, you will see whether it's limited to the mainstream

975
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,280
or limited to the alternative.

976
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,280
Right?

977
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:03,080
For example, again, using medical stuff, the mainstream will never bring up negative points

978
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:05,720
of vaccines, but the alternative seems to just do that.

979
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:10,160
But you look at both sides, consider them equally, and then you're going to say, but wait

980
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:14,120
a second, what is the concept of vaccination?

981
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,520
And then you'll see the whole premise is a farce.

982
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:24,480
So either way, the premise and the underpinning or the foundation of the subject is never

983
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:27,520
considered in both sides.

984
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:35,120
Or I would say the alternative appears to be doing it, but even they are off the mark.

985
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:41,520
And I think in previous Greek speaks over the years, I have brought up how simple it is,

986
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,840
not always easy, but how simple it is to get to the root of the matter.

987
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:50,680
In other words, go in reverse of what you're being told as far back as you can go with a

988
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:55,000
certain level of efficiency, find what it's based on, and then bring yourself back to

989
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,600
what's being discussed and see if the two are pertinent, and you'll find that in almost

990
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,600
it.

991
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:05,040
99% of the things that people consider to be serious topics or matters are false, or based

992
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:07,280
on a farce anyway.

993
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:12,120
But then I have to wonder, what is the end of all the commotion that is created by things

994
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:16,800
like social unrest or protest or criticism of the mainstream if the condition of cosmic

995
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,200
censorship is unchangeable?

996
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:24,080
Certainly, people have over the past decade, two decades begun to use a different vocabulary

997
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:30,920
or to redirect their interests or their focus, and yet the implication of what you're saying

998
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:33,320
is that it's all futile.

999
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:39,240
It's futile in an altruistic sense, but it's not futile in the way that things have to be

1000
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:40,760
until they're not.

1001
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,920
That's not quite frantic.

1002
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:44,600
Well, okay.

1003
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,600
It's, all right.

1004
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:51,760
Let's just say, it's futile when you say that we have to go out and form this political

1005
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,600
party to make the country better.

1006
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:55,600
You've heard that before.

1007
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:01,960
Or, it's futile to say, let's put these people in jail because they're causing harm, right?

1008
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:05,720
It's futile to say, let's make the world a better place.

1009
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:11,560
Well all those things happen and the world will be better, humankind will be better overall,

1010
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:18,600
yes, but not within the realm of what people consider to be their reality or reality as such.

1011
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:22,920
Are there examples of people throughout history that you would point to and say that person

1012
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:26,880
did a pretty good job of escaping as much censorship as you'll ever see?

1013
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:31,320
No, no, I believe they do exist, but they were not public.

1014
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:36,320
Again, the problem with being a historical figure is that it has to accommodate the masses

1015
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,240
to be historical.

1016
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:43,120
Even when you look at, let's say, ancient Greek philosophy or other things like that,

1017
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:47,680
as they're presented to the public, it's not at all as it was memorialized.

1018
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:51,240
In other words, you're not given proper translations.

1019
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:56,720
Meanings are twisted, you know, the actual, the essence of the story or what the philosopher

1020
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,400
or scientist whatever said is changed.

1021
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:05,280
So I would say no, there isn't, that I'm aware of, but those people not exist that were

1022
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:10,800
set apart or let's say not a subject to cosmic censorship, of course they existed, but they're

1023
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,800
not public figures that we know of.

1024
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:19,060
In allegory we do, in metaphor we do, I think in the last episode zero, you brought up,

1025
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:24,320
you know, let's say in the Star Wars story, the concept of the Jedi, right?

1026
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:29,520
You know, they were, they extracted themselves or set themselves apart from the rest.

1027
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,320
Right.

1028
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:35,720
Well, I think we've been able to say a lot about the subject of cosmic censorship, though

1029
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,080
by no means having exhausted the subject.

1030
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,640
Is there anything else you want to highlight about the theme before we wrap up?

1031
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:49,800
Yes, ultimately I would put a very heavy leaning and let's say define the meaning ultimately

1032
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:55,200
that it is put upon mankind by the gods.

1033
01:16:55,200 --> 01:17:01,800
Now if you want to take what I just said and define a term by term that would be most advisable.

1034
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,280
There's not such thing as the gods, Greek, don't you know that?

1035
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:05,680
Yeah, that's right.

1036
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:06,680
Yeah.

1037
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:10,000
Well, the thing is, in order to say that there is a thing, you have to define that thing.

1038
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,320
So because there is a problem in definition, it's easy to hold that statement up, isn't it?

1039
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,320
Yes, that's true.

1040
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:19,320
I do remember, and weeks ago I met somebody who was like, we don't even know what the word

1041
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,320
God means.

1042
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:23,840
And then he proceeded to try to find a definition and wasn't really successful.

1043
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,840
Well, they're immature.

1044
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,960
You see, in past events, I've always spoken about how most people stop developing it about

1045
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:32,000
between nine and twelve years old.

1046
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:36,280
And your most esteemed academic intellectuals, I could prove to you through questioning and

1047
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:39,680
dialogue that they're really not beyond an adolescent.

1048
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:46,280
They just, the thing about academia and university and the intellectual elite in their circles

1049
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:52,320
is not to really have knowledge and wisdom, but it's to present things that they sound

1050
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,640
that they do.

1051
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:59,320
It's the way that they speak and how they speak and to spend a lot of time formulating presentations.

1052
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:02,240
It's just a different language.

1053
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:06,640
I haven't found any academic suitable that I would call wise at all because if they were,

1054
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,880
they wouldn't be considered academics, by the way.

1055
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:11,240
They would be ousted by their own group.

1056
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:15,760
I know that sounds like a tall statement, but if you, initially, if you look at, I'd say

1057
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:19,840
Greek, that sounds ridiculous because, yeah, I could see generally what you're saying is

1058
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:24,360
true because they're basically prostituting themselves to the academic society, but here's

1059
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:25,640
a guy he's pretty good.

1060
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:28,880
Yeah, but the closer you look, you'll see he's still selling out.

1061
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:29,880
You see?

1062
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:36,080
Yeah, there's the concept of the road less traveled, but I don't think what I'm talking about is

1063
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:37,080
even a road.

1064
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:41,800
You're on a hovercraft and you basically float over all kinds of things regardless of how

1065
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,800
it's paved.

1066
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:43,800
That's the thing.

1067
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,320
People are on most people are on a wagon.

1068
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:49,080
I'm not talking about now throughout history also.

1069
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:54,640
And now that the road isn't paved well enough for the wagon that they're driving, they don't

1070
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:55,640
go down it.

1071
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,920
I'm saying that there is no road.

1072
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:03,080
Can you navigate the entire terrain and the best way to do that is not by touching it.

1073
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:07,760
You can go really close, but hover above it.

1074
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,440
All right then, that does it for this episode.

1075
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:16,960
I think the podcast recording will be available to download later in the week on GreekSpeak.com

1076
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,520
and we will hopefully do another stream next week.

1077
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:24,920
I'd like for it to be a weekly affair though, as I mentioned, it's all about scheduling,

1078
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,880
so we'll see how that goes.

1079
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:30,680
Thank you to the Greek for joining me once again.

1080
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:34,600
And thank you to those who tuned in as well as future podcast listeners.

1081
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:40,880
Feel free to shoot any email queries about the podcast or the website to info@greekspeak.com

1082
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:45,240
and unless the Greek has anything else that he wants to sign off with, I think I'm good.

1083
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:46,240
Not at all.

1084
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,840
Let's just see what we talk about next time.

1085
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:48,840
Okay then.

1086
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:50,240
Well then until next time everybody.
