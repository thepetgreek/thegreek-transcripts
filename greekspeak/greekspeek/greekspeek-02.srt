00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,720
Greetings to everyone listening. This is the Greek Speak podcast featuring the

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,040
Archon in the Greek. I'm the Archon creator of greekspeak.com and joining me for episode 2 of

4
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,120
the podcast is my co-host the Greek who will be with me in just a second. So it's been a few weeks

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,800
since episode one and I would have hoped to do these streams at more consistent intervals but my

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,000
schedule hasn't allowed that to be the case. Luckily though I've just offloaded a bunch of work so

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,680
I think we'll have less time between the recordings moving forward. The previous podcasts have been

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,160
getting some plays and some downloads so thank you to those who have shown an interest in that.

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,120
I've hit the download limit for episode zero at 100 downloads so I'll have to switch to the

10
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,600
soundcloud premium tier before people can get more of those but I'm working on it. With regards to

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,400
this stream you can use the live stream group chat in the greekspeak chat room if you have

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,720
any questions and I will be checking that regularly. As usual greekspeak.com has no political religious

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,000
or commercial affiliations and is completely funded and managed by myself and that's it for my

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,440
introduction. I hope you enjoy the rest of the show and thanks again for listening.

15
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:46,240
Hi greek. Are you there? Yeah greetings. Yeah how you doing? As we said we'd meet up and do

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,920
another sonic event as I call them. Yeah that's that's how I'm doing and let's get started.

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,560
So for this stream we're going to be doing the themes of mindset and objectivity. You've talked about

18
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,040
that in the past a separate subjects but I do think that there's a relationship to be found there

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,600
so I'd like us to highlight that and we'll see if we can perhaps merge the two towards the end.

20
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,920
By the way for those who are interested there's an article on greekspeak.com called the question

21
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,600
of perception that you can check out if you want and it's my first writing on that theme.

22
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:27,200
So yeah let's get started greek. A lot has been said historically about people who know versus

23
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,640
people who don't know and I think one of the reoccurring sort of boasts throughout history is that

24
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,040
people get to a point or mankind gets to a point where he becomes enlightened through access

25
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,440
to special knowledge whether it's the Greco-Roman philosophical text during the Renaissance or

26
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,280
the scientific achievements of the 20th century and we see some things similar to that in ancient times

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,160
with the Nostics and various mystery religions but when I look at those developments I don't really

28
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,280
see any suspension of cosmic censorship that we talked about in the last episode. So that same

29
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,400
censorship sort of persists in the face of whatever knowledge has abounded and you've talked about in

30
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,200
the past how having knowledge is not actually the key to arriving at true insight but that having

31
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,320
the proper mindset should actually proceed that pursuit of knowledge. Can you expand on that a bit?

32
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:21,760
Well yeah maybe work around what you just said. Let's say well in the mindset and the knowledge

33
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,600
aspect of it it is knowledge is very important but the mindset does not let one arise to knowledge

34
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,400
objectively. In other words there's plenty of knowledge of many events that are rationally

35
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:42,080
proven as being false as they are projected publicly. In science and medicine and religion for

36
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,280
example in the Christendom they project all of these high holy days which are blatantly false

37
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:57,360
and no one seems to care. What kind of a mindset do you need to gain knowledge of that?

38
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:04,400
You see but if you gain knowledge that Christendom's high holidays are true let's say based on what

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,840
they say they're based on that is the wrong mindset. I mean there's a lot of knowledge on Easter egg

40
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,480
hunting right? Or Christmas isn't there? A lot of knowledge about that but if you actually put it

41
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:22,800
in a perspective you'll notice that it's a farce. So the mindset is what puts the perspective you know

42
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,960
or dictates what category it'll be and how it'll be sorted. Think of mindset as sorting as a

43
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,520
sorting mental or spiritual or you know the psychological sorting mechanism if you will. Yeah.

44
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:43,200
The sorting mechanism will always hold up what sorting mechanisms do which are various bins or

45
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,120
categories or placements for what's coming through that sorting mechanism. So you have knowledge and

46
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,520
then you have how is that knowledge sorted? And then there's obviously the cultural aspect but

47
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,520
you mentioned also about the mystery schools and censorship and the no-six and all that. All

48
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:10,800
religions are mystery schools meaning the recently they're in the American intelligence agencies

49
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:18,000
one of the former leaders there came out publicly in some news articles and says yes the CIA does have

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,480
classes and how to cheat lie and steal. Right? Okay well intelligence agencies all over the world

51
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,160
through time have always been part of the ruling class and the ruling class always had a some kind

52
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,080
of deity or you know what you might call in modern-day's church synagogue or some kind of convention.

53
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:43,840
So the religious aspects of the current faiths in the world, desoteric all the way to the mainstream

54
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,320
are mystery schools in the sense that they employ several layers of perception. They have the

55
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,840
mass control perception you know the faith of the people categorically you know like in today's

56
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,920
world it would be Judaism Christianity or Islam generally and they kind of leave out the Hindu culture

57
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:09,760
but let's include those and if you look at each one of those cultures religious institutions

58
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:15,040
they have many layers in there they have the layer that they publicly put out then they have the

59
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,880
working layer the administrative layer which is what allows them to influence other institutions to

60
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,640
maintain a position of power and remain as an institution and then you have another layer which

61
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:33,360
is the secret goings-on behind closed doors where only you know the initiates are into and yes it

62
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,720
sounds like a lot of the what you hear in secret societies Illuminati Freemasonic.

63
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,440
You know other societies like that they're they're all based on the same template so the same

64
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:52,160
goes with science the same goes with medicine that's why for example in medicine you'll see that for

65
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,640
example cancer treatments that are prescribed to the public at large are never used by the higher

66
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,160
ups within the medical community right what are they doing right see so there's many levels you

67
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,800
know to it you hear now there's a lot of stuff talking about the deep state that runs the regular

68
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,440
state that's kind of a spurious thing because they don't understand what a sovereign state is

69
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,960
you know there is no hidden government that government is simply an institution that is

70
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,560
corporatized and it has a private shareholders it could be anywhere from you know a handful of people

71
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,560
to several scores of people owning groups of countries and people just don't understand that

72
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,760
and that's fine it doesn't mean that we shouldn't say it so there is a secret aspect to everything

73
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,280
even food people go to the supermarket and they purchase food to eat or whatever or even if they

74
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,080
grow it they don't do it autonomously they engage in commerce to obtain things and they're

75
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,040
you know how many times do you find out later on that something was dangerous or cancerous well why

76
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:55,680
wasn't it explicitly shown when when it was initially introduced to market it was always known

77
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,360
to be such I mean they're not that devoid of the knowledge of what they're putting into the food

78
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:09,760
chain let's say so every aspect of what people engage in consciously whether it's the mindset sorting

79
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:16,240
mechanism or the knowledge there's many layers to it I like of referencing Demetri Callizov he's

80
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:23,280
a sort of a nonchalant internet celebrity regarding the events of 9/11 he talks about the three

81
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,600
truths you know the first truth is what you give the public the second truth is what you give

82
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,440
those are administer the public and then there's the third truth which is really what's happening

83
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:40,400
right now from from the sorting mechanism there's many ways to discuss it you know the mindset like the

84
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,760
average they call them the masses the public at large seven billion plus whatever the number is

85
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,480
they're not viewed as individuals are viewed as a single group or an entity just like you would say

86
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,840
I went to the beach you don't the word beach does not include all of the billions or

87
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:02,960
millions of grains of sand it's just a single entity made up of many components you see so when you

88
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:09,440
address the masses it's one way because they're actually a single component forget about all the stuff

89
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,960
you're told about you you're an individual and you have a right to do this and you're for you're not

90
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:20,160
actually in private whenever you're confronted with this authority in any institution they always

91
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,160
say you have to be like everyone else so you know that's another part of the that that third truth or

92
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:34,240
that what I call the bovine reality right bovine excrement reality then there's the second truth

93
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,920
let's say or you go higher up behind and then there's the story or the ideology of those that run

94
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,640
these institutions whether it's educational religious governmental medical scientific whatever

95
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,320
they have another credo another mindset to run you know they need to keep things in order because

96
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,960
that's their task they're the administrators the facilitators and then you have those that are

97
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:02,560
behind that make all of the deals and how to maintain something an institution through time or

98
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,400
actually evacuated from a memory or eliminate it right there's institutions that have gone by the

99
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:14,640
wayside over the years those guys that are or and gals that are behind the scenes that are

100
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,560
maintaining power or negotiating to keep the power or monitoring the system have a different ideology

101
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:27,040
in mindset again now just to interject something when you go into the whether you want to consider them

102
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,240
higher or lower as irrelevant when you go into the first tier with the let's say the oligarchs or

103
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,320
those that are running the the administrators that are running the public they their mindset you

104
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,200
can discuss the things we discuss on Greeks because they get a chuckle and they laugh they're like

105
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:50,160
yeah it's totally fine that's exactly how it is right and when you go to the second level

106
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:57,600
the administrative level they're all like well you know well yeah who are you going to tell that too

107
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,680
right meaning like you know your information we can discredit then when you go to the masses which is

108
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,520
the seven but with this in for this type of Greek speak information they're like oh that can't be

109
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:13,120
true that I get out of here I don't believe that see so that is again another form of sorting is

110
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:22,240
in it so same thing religious medical scientific whatever all of these institutions and parts of

111
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,000
the human culture have the same structure what is told to the masses what is told to those that

112
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,160
are running the masses and then those that are actually in control of those running the masses

113
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:39,680
right and and just in short in summary Greek speak is not a dialogue or a narrative directed

114
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,080
towards the masses or the mass could whether it's seven billion or a million or a hundred million

115
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,720
they're all just consider them one thing they you know you you know you've seen one you've seen them

116
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,880
all kind of thing with slight difference of course people have their individual traits but

117
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:01,760
it's like if you go to a bread a bakery a bakery where they bake millions of loaves of bread a day

118
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,960
they're monitored so they all look the same but I'm telling you no two loaves of bread or bake the like

119
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,880
but they're all packaged and they're discounted and they're thrown away very easily they're not

120
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,000
considered very important but they do make the substance of the food chain people are the same way

121
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,560
they tend to have individual qualities individual character individual thoughts but really when

122
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,640
when you are on the level thinking and absorbing as truth what is put out to that group you're just

123
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,520
you're all the same you meet you meet one in other words you go outside your door and you run

124
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,640
in someone on the street chances are how many more people you run into the street on any day or any

125
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,920
week or any year they're all going to be generally the same that's what I mean by the masses and then

126
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,400
you have the administrators of the more privileged type they have a different mindset on their

127
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:54,560
position is to make sure that the masses act like the masses should based on whatever script has been

128
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,120
determined and then you have again those that are beyond those those that own or control the

129
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,200
administrators right in other words those are control the president or the CEO or the administrator

130
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,400
and they have a different mindset again so just to repeat myself the Greek speak is not

131
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:18,640
directed towards or anyone but it is more in line with that first group okay but let's look at it

132
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,880
at the level of an individual say right because ultimately there's always an exception and

133
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,920
if we're talking about a number of seven billion then the exception that pertains to that could

134
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,400
be in the several hundreds of millions right so we could still make a significant pool of people even

135
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:40,160
though they're spread out all over the place that could use this kind of information so in your

136
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,360
appearance on other podcasts you've mentioned something called the quote unquote proper mindset so

137
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,080
let's look at that and you also did mention an episode zero that definitions are important so let's

138
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:56,960
emphasize that here also if I were to venture the definition of mindset as being something like an

139
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,560
established set of attitudes held by somebody or a characteristic way of thinking how would you

140
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,880
triangulate those conceptions into understanding what a proper mindset is okay simple let's say this

141
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,240
is the earth and things are done a certain way well what is that way how are things done ultimately

142
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,080
you're going to figure out that it is a dictatorship meaning not the way that people are told

143
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,840
what a dictatorship is meaning there is communication and within those those communications there's

144
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:33,040
hierarchy the highest hierarchy within communicating on planet earth is what's known as a vow a pledge

145
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:41,760
or a contract okay so once that that is embedded within the society and just to go back for a moment

146
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,800
when I say this society we could balance back and forth between the three levels there that we just

147
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,920
mentioned but just like the old rits have written you know the poor man and the rich man or the king

148
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,760
and the popper are both born naked and dying naked right they all bleed the same they all need food

149
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,560
and water and drink so when I mentioned the three groups prior yes they all generally come from

150
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:09,440
the same pool bloodlines aside right so well and you mentioned also that there might be someone more

151
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:15,200
exceptional that can use this information in any one of those positions right so so we we

152
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:20,480
toggle back and forth to the general group that's been sorted and subdivided the way that we

153
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,840
mentioned earlier with the ultimate top controllers the administrators and the masses they all

154
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:31,920
come from the same pool essentially that have been sorted into those positions but essentially

155
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:44,160
to go back to to the question I would say that the how would you how would you align in other words

156
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:51,040
what you say do you mean what you say and you say what you mean right the concept of a contract that

157
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,520
is basically the the idea on how everything runs give you an example and this is actually how you

158
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,480
keep the masses in control and why they need to be kept ignorant giving example in the financial

159
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:09,760
system anyone even even if you're not considered with sharpest tool in the shed and not that smarter

160
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:16,400
intelligent now with the what's facilitated called the internet and information access anyone within

161
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,000
five or ten minutes that has a clear mind and seeks comprehension can discover the world financial

162
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,600
system is a credit based system and when then in other five minutes if you ask where does it come

163
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,320
from you might start going on the fringe because it's not polite to ask where to credit where to

164
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:39,360
the credit comes from but actually comes from a system of pledges right so for example again

165
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,680
and spend another five minutes and either fifteen minutes into researching this on the internet

166
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:50,080
let's say or even a law library you'll find out that there is no money and essentially when you

167
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,520
make purchases with financial institutions or government institutions or corporations or banks

168
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,880
what they call banks they have no money to lend you they actually take your signature and whatever

169
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,880
is written on the paper that you sign to is created out of thin air essentially based on the credit

170
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,880
that you have basically the credit you you you've been pledged as as a child to a birth certificate

171
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,920
and that has a certain value right this is very easy to discover and this is actually

172
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:27,040
not discredited or or denied by anyone in the first two that we mentioned earlier sections of society

173
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:34,320
this is absolutely agreed to but then how can someone who's walking around with a long frown on

174
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,440
their face they hey why are you so sad is because I am in debt and I am in trouble if I don't pay

175
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,680
that debt well how could there be a debt if there is no money it's a credit based economy and they

176
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,480
actually just took your signature and monetized it all right and gave it to you in the form of an

177
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,200
account that you can draw from or something right and the reason these are not really accounts because

178
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,520
in reality an account has to have something in it but this is how the merchant system is always

179
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,560
worked by the way within merchants so the people are actually sad they're people being harmed

180
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:10,080
by not being able to quote unquote pay a debt now if you go back to try to counter this on the

181
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,600
very regular convention in the what they call the courts or the bank they always say well we

182
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:23,600
have a contract here you agreed that this is a debt even though there was nothing right you see

183
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,120
now the same thing goes with religious all the religions with the stuff they put in front of

184
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,280
people if you start bringing up the let's say usually there's a text an ancient writ that that that

185
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:41,040
leaders of that religion professed you adhere to well if you read any of those texts in any religion

186
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,720
you'll see that the religions are not doing anything in the text or maybe resembles it but not

187
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,520
not doing it well at all when you bring that issue up they'll say well we don't go by that really

188
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,960
we go by our tradition and you agreed you see your how dare you question is you agree to be part

189
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:04,880
of our congregation the same thing goes with the medical system right you when you go to a doctor

190
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:12,320
you have to sign a consent form which really releases them of liability of anything they do to you

191
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:18,400
if you ever read the consent forms the doctors it's pretty scary you see it goes on and on and on and

192
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,840
on so what pretty much most of what people are engaged in is based on falsehood and it's a falsehood

193
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:32,320
that we can can be described succinctly like I just did with the financial system but the true the

194
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:39,280
the reality of it is that what's pressed upon them well it pressed meaning to oppress them is

195
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:46,240
that they vowed to do it anyway see the issue with people with for example money and debt the

196
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,000
issue is not whether they let you anything you sign a contract saying you're going to do it but

197
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,600
right but I never got anything well that that's irrelevant that's your concept what are you talking

198
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:02,880
about know what you know everybody knows you know the plausible aspect dream you see so this is

199
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:09,360
basically how the earth is run it's by pledges and by agreements that's why for example even today

200
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:18,160
one of the well actually in many ways yes in many ways no even today one of the gravest things you

201
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,280
can do to someone other than extreme physical violence is to insult them i mean times that you heard

202
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:30,400
that right right they feel insulted or humiliated or dishonored right so it's basically what you say

203
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:36,320
and when you say it and and if you mean what you're saying that holds everything together

204
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:44,240
and knowing that would lead one to actually be more careful about what they say and what they

205
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:52,160
agree to especially if it's in what they call legal contract form right or or beyond you know

206
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:59,120
because the proper mindset because you have the faculty is to investigate or read or study

207
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,160
a little bit about these things before you engage them but you have something called culture

208
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:15,040
and tradition which is which is what steers the individual into doing how and what they do right so

209
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:22,080
I mean it's very easy to to if you were to visit the earth from somewhere else where they did have a

210
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,840
proper mindset and there is such a thing as a proper mindset by the way as you brought up and hopefully

211
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,440
I'll bring that forward a little bit more is they would say they would come to the earth and say

212
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:40,080
these people are insane it's not a meaning not healthy as a group it doesn't matter what country

213
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:46,960
you go to again the masses right so but then again if you go to the administrators those that are

214
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,720
controlling the masses and you poise the same you know or come to them with the same posture let's see

215
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,520
if they're doing the right thing they they don't even know what to do right they're just they'll just say

216
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,680
this is how we do it and this is how we've been told by who well eventually when you find out who

217
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:07,280
is telling them what to do and how to do it in any institution or any aspect of human society you

218
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:14,080
will find a small group of people that are let's say we've brought up the word esoteric

219
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:22,240
nonetheless extremely sublime and esoteric and their belief system and their mindset has absolutely

220
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,480
nothing to do with who they've hired as administrators and ultimately not only the masses that they

221
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,640
rule but actually the masses that they believe they actually own and if you ask them how do you

222
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:44,560
own the people they say well they pledged everything to us right so people also have an idea of

223
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:51,360
knowing things when they have not studied it simply hearing about something is not knowing it or you

224
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:58,400
know hearing hearing or listening or engaging something as it is done superficially by most people

225
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,000
through their whole lives about everything even how to raise children for example is not studying it

226
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,960
example would be let's say studying an ancient manuscript is not the same as reading it

227
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,240
right study means to actually look at it and comprehend it so if you were to say that the majority of

228
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,640
the people if not if you were to put let's say a giant rubber stamp on the earth and say no one

229
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,320
here is paying attention statistically that would be very accurate statistically there's a very

230
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,880
small group of people that do I mean even from the three levels that we've discussed so the proper

231
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,120
mindset based on what you're saying is the ability for somebody to assess reality based on the

232
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,640
empiricism of their surroundings to commit themselves to studying that as opposed to just going off of

233
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,960
assumption well study it and also understand that the most important thing on earth is what you say

234
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,840
and do you mean what you say and are you going to do what you say it's one of those things

235
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:02,880
people don't discuss it for example years ago there was a one of these law enforcement

236
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,040
TV shows back in the 60s or 70s and the as the as the show opened they have the opening credit let's say

237
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,400
and they have the star of the show I forgot the name of it but it was a detective speaking and he

238
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,200
says well we're going out to stop crime and make sure people fulfill their contracts and make sure

239
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:26,800
that what this is a made for TV thing back in the six they actually just set it you know so

240
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:35,040
the thing is it's very simple in other words the things that people find

241
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:42,560
disharmonious in their lives are there because they put themselves there well how because

242
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:49,440
what happens is the the disharmony that they're experiencing is nothing but the follow through of

243
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,840
what they said they were doing going to do and not doing it so again the financial system is an

244
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:02,400
easy one there it's you cannot be expected to fulfill an impossibility of law right if something is

245
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,600
impossible the law cannot demand you do it well one of those things believe it or not is debt in a

246
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:13,920
credit-based economy you can't be a lender and a creditor the same person can you have let's say a

247
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:19,520
silver coin or coin in your right pocket and say I'm going to lend it to myself when I move it over to

248
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:27,120
the left that's kind of ridiculous and this is the way this financial system works the same with

249
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,800
the medical industry but in order for people to properly comprehend that because we do understand

250
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,960
that too so a certain extent you're speaking over people's heads because they haven't studied it

251
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,760
so we'll get we'll of course have to take it on the face of what you're saying and then people

252
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:48,320
have to go and look into it themselves but when we talk about developing this proper mindset which

253
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,280
perhaps we could do a little better job of quantifying it but at least we can say that it escapes most

254
00:25:53,280 --> 00:26:00,640
people so whenever people discuss mental phenomena such as mindset things get a bit abstract which is

255
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,120
what I want to get away from because it's not like the material world for example when it comes to

256
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,520
feeds a physical prowess you either run the distance or you don't you either climb to the top of

257
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,200
the mountain or you didn't and the difference between success and failure is pretty well defined

258
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,000
and understood but when you're trying to encourage or build up a mindset it's easy to encounter

259
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,640
resistance in the world where people don't agree on what's proper what's not or what's important

260
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:29,040
or what's not so the development of a proper mindset why is that so difficult for people?

261
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:35,920
Well which people is it going to be the masses which are seven billion that are all act as one

262
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,480
and then you have the within the society who are you running into an administrator like someone

263
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:47,280
who's been tasked by the owners let's say to make sure that the masses are in line or in check

264
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,840
or going about you know certain amount of stability which I want to talk about also what stability

265
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,440
in peace means to man right now and or you can run into albeit and secret they don't show up with

266
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:04,560
pomp and circumstance and limousines and big announcements the people that own everyone they

267
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,360
think they own everyone on the planet at least and they can prove it on paper. So then we say it

268
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,680
like this you're talking to there's three people behind a curtain you don't know who's who and you

269
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,400
don't know who represents what mindset so now you have to make a sort of general all encompassing

270
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,800
statement so that whoever is behind the curtain will be able to absorb what you're saying.

271
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:28,080
Well then what I would say to them is I want nothing to do with any of you until I find out a little

272
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,240
bit more of what's going on on this earth right and as you start to find out what's going on

273
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,720
on this earth then you you have to address each one individually like for example a simple way

274
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,320
to do that is with the masses you completely avoid them you know but it doesn't mean you have to be

275
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,520
on civil and if you're running a business and you have employees you just deal with people on a

276
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,360
level that is strictly what you're dealing with them on right and sometimes you have to be cordial

277
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,480
and you have to always be polite and impeccable and how you look how you perform you know

278
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,280
what you especially when you say you're going to do something but there is no hope in them there's

279
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:12,960
no you just you know if the one emerges that it seems to be extraordinary then you take account of that

280
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,920
the administrators are also to be avoided right because they're not in that position because they were

281
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:25,120
chosen for their merit they they they look for merit but also they're heavily heavily compromised

282
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,080
and then you have those that think they own the world and they'll just laugh at everything you say no

283
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,440
matter what okay so we're going to make we're going to have to operate based on a presumption that

284
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,880
we're talking to an extraordinary person who happens to find himself among the masses by being a

285
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:50,240
victim of circumstance well then you have what's called a potential for a fellowship right because

286
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:57,680
the typical aspect of fellowship is people that share things in common right but let's say you find

287
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,680
this person and even if you want to fellowship with them that's very fine and well because you realize

288
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,080
that there's something to be developed but that person is still going to be censored to a certain degree

289
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,760
and that person is still going to have a lacking mindset to a certain degree so my wondering is

290
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,440
why would it be difficult for even that person to escape the norm that has infected everybody else?

291
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,600
Well the thing is well okay you could look at it from many ways from the initial aspect of you

292
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,640
determining that this person is extraordinary they would have already overcome most of the pitfalls

293
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,160
of the censorship and the poor mindset or the low quality thinking or the pitfalls that the masses have

294
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:41,200
right so you've they've already that one of the ways you would determine or qualify that they

295
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,200
are extraordinary is that they've already passed many of the hurdles that would be considered

296
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,160
basic which would be why you would be very simple to say avoid the masses because they can't even

297
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:56,800
overcome the most basic thought form right so this person obviously in most cases if they

298
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,480
if they deem to be extraordinary has overcome that so now you're going to be working on another

299
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,400
level of the censorship which again goes back to perception studying observation discussion

300
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:12,000
good science for example right we don't know about this but we could be this it could be that

301
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:21,920
take good notes and observe it right so the the aspect of some you know when we break away from the

302
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:29,280
the general three groups let's say and the the person who is extraordinary has already

303
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:35,760
overcome many of the these basic things and I think we've gone into in the past what the cosmic

304
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,840
censorship is because initially it's very easy to lean heavily on these three categories that I

305
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,880
just presented but essentially there's an even higher category because we just don't perceive it

306
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,320
directly at this point and that's called the divine or the things that we don't perceive that we

307
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,560
know control or we we we don't see them but we see their effect let's say and the the only reason

308
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,480
we actually give in e credence that that's such a condition exists is because it's been memorialized

309
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:11,200
meaning recorded throughout history and you know of course the people preempt

310
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,280
study into these things based on their upbringing their personal desire and all that and the

311
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,720
other thing is if you lean heavy on your own personal desires what you like in other words your

312
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,480
favorite color your favorite food your favorite shirt your whatever if you lean too heavily on that

313
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,240
let's just not even say to being narcissistic but if you still lean heavily on what you prefer strictly

314
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:41,120
you're not going to be able to see things objectively anyway you see so the object

315
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:47,760
of thought form is not your own right because if something is clear in other words for something to

316
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:56,080
be objective it should be presented with clarity and anyone can see it but no not anyone can see it

317
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,560
so what's going on if it's so clear and so visible and so discernible yet very few can see it

318
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:09,200
is it really that clear and discernible or is it still hidden or is it that those that can see it

319
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,440
are blocked and I would guess the latter actually more than guess let's just say softly I guess

320
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,720
but I know it's the latter and it's for sure the latter meaning the people are blocked

321
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,640
and why do I say this because you can you could see it's been memorialized.

322
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:32,400
You've talked a lot about the elite classes whether it's the people that you know we want to

323
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,240
presume are at the top or the people that have administrative positions that are still considered

324
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,920
to be elite and in the past you've lampooned for example the academics by describing them as people

325
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,480
that only have the appearance of having knowledge and some of the markers for that is you know

326
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,880
the circular way that they talk or their system of peer review where they just approve of each

327
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,080
other for not breaking rank so to transpose that kind of analysis to what we're talking about here

328
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,400
what are some of the markers of somebody who doesn't have the right mindset but does have the

329
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,560
appearance of having the right mindset just so that you know people can recognize that whether

330
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,680
it's somebody who looks wise and isn't or somebody uses it kind of rhetoric that falsely indicates

331
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,160
what they understand. Simply put like you said the academics are typically going to find them in

332
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:21,440
the educational institutions from the preschool kindergarten all the way up to the doctorate level

333
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:28,640
what they call university though that's a very you know again the institution you know this is let's

334
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:35,280
say a pork sausage factory do you expect to go there and see millions of gallons of strawberry ice

335
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:41,040
cream being made. No you're going to be seeing slaughtered pigs so this is the academia for example

336
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,640
and if you study the history of academia you'll see it is another one of these tools

337
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:52,320
and if you study for example the educational institution is a well-known fact very well

338
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,920
established especially in the western world that over 50 years ago education has been brought

339
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:06,000
down the level is been brought down that it's actually laughable right so to pursue a higher education

340
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,960
is to pursue higher laughability and ridiculousness. I used to have a saying that if you actually

341
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,520
believe anything that you've been taught beyond the eighth year of school it most likely will do

342
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,640
irreparable damage to you. So with these academics they typically want them to have higher

343
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:27,840
university degrees so that means another eight or ten years of school right at least so what we're

344
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,320
talking about people that are at this point lost and they're basically tools being used by that

345
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,720
first group as a buffer zone and if you study some of the ancient societies I remember coming across

346
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,560
over a decade ago how the academics with the law merchants which are known as attorneys

347
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,720
where are held firmly within society as a buffer zone between the elite and also to keep society

348
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:57,680
on a normal path let's say right an example for that would be let's say someone invents a small box

349
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:03,680
or something you put in your pocket and it powers an entire house well the first that that's determined

350
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,640
that news goes up to the if they the way things are now they would know it as you were doing it

351
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,360
because you go online and order things and talk and all that's being flagged for example

352
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,200
but once you establish that or on your way to establish let's say a device that can do such a thing

353
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,240
the first thing they do is sick academia on you where did you get your degree let's say this is a

354
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,360
bus driver that did this you know it basically no he's not even a high school education let's say

355
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:35,040
the first thing they do is they sick academia on you where did you get your PhD in physics oh he

356
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,280
doesn't listen everyone he thinks he has a device in that that's all fake you know all the

357
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,360
demonstrations that he's showing it powering a house little tiny device doesn't use any fuel as we know

358
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:52,800
that's all fake and he doesn't even have a physics degree ha ha ha 99.99% of the masses will agree

359
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,880
with the academics and this man will be shunned you see the same thing if someone comes up with

360
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,920
quote unquote a cure for cancer the first thing they do is sick academia where did you get your

361
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,600
medical degree ha ha he doesn't have a medical degree all those are fake testimonies you see how it

362
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,320
goes on and on and on the same happens with the legal stuff the same thing happens with the science

363
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,920
stuff same thing happens with the religious stuff you go on and on and on categorically and this is

364
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:26,400
how academia is being used also it's to waste your time also it's a form of entertainment in the old

365
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:33,600
Roman courts they used to bring in Greek scientists academic academic admissions to demonstrate things

366
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:40,960
to the royal court of the seizures and others as entertainment many of the magicians the illusionists

367
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:48,160
that you see a borrow from they always have their ear on the door or know a quote unquote scientist

368
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:55,920
to use their right to deceive the public right you see how it's used so it's basically a buffer zone

369
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,960
that's that's a simple way to see that you know are what kind of a tool are they right another thing

370
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:09,680
is by just sheer experience if you're working amongst institutions that are educational or academic

371
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,160
and you start revealing things that just simply aren't true you're kicked you're ousted from the

372
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,440
institution right the same thing let's say a doctor comes up with something that really cures

373
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,880
something in a simple way what's the first thing that happens to him that's you know that gets him

374
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,560
out of that field he will be no longer practice medicine if you try to do it we'll put you in prison

375
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,880
for practicing about a license because we took that from you right people people in the religious field

376
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,880
the same lawyers don't know attorneys don't know the law how do I know that's a very general statement

377
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,040
but it's very accurate because if an attorney knows the law and he tries to actually use it in the

378
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,560
court he will be disbarred right doctors don't know how the human body works because if they actually

379
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,320
learn how the human body works and they started practicing that way they would lose their medical

380
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:05,200
license so so the way you get real information is by some form of congregation in other words of

381
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,800
extraordinary people communicating and this is the way it's been for thousands of years I'm not

382
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,600
just this is not news even though some people might tune into this and say this is really different

383
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:21,600
than what I've heard before but however we can already establish and we have already established that

384
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:27,120
the elite classes act as a buffer so what I'm trying to say is if we turn away from the elite classes

385
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,120
because people still go about their daily lives interacting with each other for example their

386
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:35,520
family members or their friends particularly the young children are influenced by celebrities and

387
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,360
so on and so forth so what is the identifying marker to look for when you're going about your

388
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:48,400
daily life and you aren't in constant connection with an elite person like how does it child even look

389
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,720
well hands to see that she doesn't have the right mindset well the people that are

390
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,760
administering and controlling are not elite at all they're actually even less

391
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,280
they seem like they have privilege but if you knew what they had to go through or to sustain

392
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,200
that position you would you would turn your stomach right this isn't any field right

393
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:15,760
in other words be compromised heavily so the elite are just sitting back it's just livestock

394
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:23,600
management for them and the way that you know how discerning it is by if you if the person is

395
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:30,160
functioning in an institutional capacity they're full of crap because they can't be there by telling

396
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,400
but with true knowledge and really you see what I mean this has been throughout history

397
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,840
even during the times of the Renaissance the European Renaissance it was the same thing

398
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:45,360
right so if a person in that this is a long this is the long in the short of it

399
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:50,000
essentially you're going to have to spend more than five minutes in your lifetime discovering the

400
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,000
truth about any subject you're interested in on your own right and within five minutes of studying

401
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,920
it meaning you have to know the history of it right you go back from the beginning when this was

402
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,200
introduced in the culture or humankind and then move forward you you can make a personal determination

403
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,560
there and say well this is not for me or you might say this is not for me but I need to know it

404
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:16,560
because I run into this stuff all the time it's an anarchistic point of view and our means without

405
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:24,000
our coast means leader it's a leaderless thought pattern you know like all revolutionaries

406
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
are actually closet aristocrats right a Frank Herbert said that there's no such thing as

407
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,880
someone that wants to be a leader or free of people or change society that is not

408
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,400
in a secretive way just like those that are ruling right now and he's just envious of it and

409
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,840
they may not be personally responsible for such a thought but they're raised in that concept

410
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:54,320
so don't buy into any form of a lead movement organization with a human leadership that's based

411
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:01,440
on the the normal way you people have been taught society goes through changes is done the normal

412
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,240
way we've been taught there are changes is there is a discarding absolessence of old things new

413
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:12,320
things come in or revival of new old things or there's revolution and that's I wanted to touch on

414
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,400
that also this might be pertinent to the question but I wanted to get it in there and how much

415
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,720
we are on time but people essentially if you want to learn how these creatures work meaning the

416
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:29,520
masses they hate peace and harmony now if it sounds crazy Greek because I could go out on the

417
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,000
street and interview a million people in the next 10 years and they're all going pretty much say

418
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,560
they like peace and harmony yes but don't listen to what they say watch what they do peace and

419
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:48,160
harmony to the average masses is is really a stagnative death to them how do I know this well

420
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:57,920
for centuries newspapers in print have been sold based on what sensationalism how many times have

421
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:07,280
you heard people gathering together and forming you know unity and productivity for I don't know a

422
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:14,960
holiday or some cause that should be let's say to edify or help other people on what scale is that

423
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:25,120
done compared to people coming together and productivity when war is declared right so you're

424
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:31,280
going to see that people get they do like violence if you look at their what they call current events

425
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,360
for the nightly news or whatever if there isn't anything violent or scandalous it's I was the news

426
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:44,560
out there was nothing on the news tonight right people like violence they like scandal and this goes

427
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,400
all the way up because aren't you going to have the principle let's say presidents or the chief

428
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,400
administrators say we have to go fight this enemy don't you have the religious leaders say the same

429
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,160
thing on and on and on people just hate peace and harmony what who was put in front of you as the

430
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:09,840
head of a religion is the administrator he's just a figure you see the same with governments it's the

431
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:16,000
same you know you know all the even the if you study your monarchies in the world today

432
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,520
they're they're not real monarchies right they were just like if you look at the Middle East they

433
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:27,280
were put there by the British and the French in the 1920s if you look at the English monarchy the

434
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:34,480
Queen that whole genealogy fell apart in the late 1400s King Edward that lineage the real for example

435
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,920
the real king by lineage and bloodline lives somewhere in Australia in a small you know thousand

436
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,760
square foot house I think he's like he operates a rice mill or something all right it's not hard to

437
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,920
who he is yeah he does yeah he it's well he found out later on in life but it's not hard in other

438
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,280
words it's not these are not these are actual things anyone can look up the king of Jordan is not

439
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,600
he he's he was just a bunch of people that the British and French that you're the king now okay

440
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:09,040
that's your might kingdom yeah I mean all the all they're all like that the the only one that

441
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:18,320
might have survived something was is the the show of Japan right so this is a ridiculous ridiculous

442
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:26,960
world and it doesn't mean you have to plunge into it as you've been told wholeheartedly you know reserve

443
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:32,160
yourself in other words the advice that I would give to especially young people I feel sorry for

444
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,440
the young people because the older people have nothing to say worthwhile anymore but if you're going

445
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,960
to do anything other than food clothing and shelter see if your belly grow growls you need something to

446
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,280
eat if you're thirsty should drink something and if you need to sleep you should find a comfortable

447
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,840
place to rest but anything else outside of that you should spend at least five minutes studying

448
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,960
what it's based on let's move on to talk about objectivity and then perhaps we can tie that back to

449
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:03,120
the idea of having a proper mindset so it's safe to say that it's better to know something than to

450
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:07,360
think that you know something right although people endlessly debate the difference between those two

451
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:12,480
things but in any case I think most people appreciate the comfort that comes from acting out of

452
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,920
assurance rather than assumption so I bring up the concept of objectivity because I think to fully

453
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,920
make sense of something you have to be able to first grab a hold of it with your rationality and

454
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,120
examine it so what I want to ask the Greek is how would you say that objectivity is brought to

455
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:31,440
bear on the process of parsing the world and you sort of touched on that a little bit but to make

456
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:37,040
it more concise well to make it the most concise right now what's called the information age people

457
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:47,440
are being dying a slow death through information the same way it's been any institution is there to

458
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,520
protect those that control pretty much what they think is everything right so you so again just to

459
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:59,280
go back to I guess maybe how do you object to find how where is the knowledge and knowing versus

460
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:08,080
thinking you know on one hand you could say it's shameful for someone to walk around saying that

461
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:14,640
they have a credit card debt it's actually absolutely shameful for me to even hear that right and

462
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,560
if you listen to them they'll say well they'll come and take my stuff away now they're being

463
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:23,360
motivated by penalty right they look at all the stuff that's been put in front of them as being

464
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:30,240
knowledge when reality there was right it's they agreed to pay it back right if you ever look at a

465
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:36,240
credit card application it says we can report on our credit experience with you doesn't say that

466
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:43,920
you have to pay your debt there's no debt the same thing goes with the medical people on both

467
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,120
ends the patient you know those receiving the care and those dishing it out they think they know

468
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:56,960
but they don't know so on many aspects of it again five minutes spend five minutes researching it

469
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,320
and then you'll know if you want to continue researching it or not right now people are having

470
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:08,800
death by internet right and in some cases literally with the type of power and am putting meaning

471
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,480
an amplitude that they want to put out with cell phone towers you know you hear a little bit about

472
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:19,040
that some of those rumors are are spurious but the truth of it is that it's true it is a very

473
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:26,400
un and there was death by information indeed so what is the importance of the objectivity aspect

474
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:32,880
for parsing that reality when to get the objectivity allows you to operate in a higher on a more

475
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:39,360
efficient level I've given the the example prior to years ago when there was a big

476
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:44,880
good survivalist movement in the u.s. about prepping for a coming disaster that was supposed to come

477
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,680
around whatever 10 years ago and it ever did right there are people that went out and invested in a

478
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:55,440
lot of photovoltaic panels 12 volt systems off the grid type stuff that's just sitting around

479
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:01,600
doing nothing now what kind of efficiency was that because they took in the information thinking

480
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:08,560
that they knew but it was just bovine excrement so how do you discern that you know I use the

481
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,880
thing about edible corn you know if you're really hungry would you eat corn digested corn

482
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:19,040
in out of someone's poo how tempting would that be well depends on how hungry you are

483
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:25,760
but the I noticed that the masses are always eating they're not even corn they're leaving the corn

484
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:31,200
they're eating the poop I would rather have fresh clean corn not stuff stuff that's been eaten and

485
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,680
that how many times have you heard spinning of information or it's been processed you know

486
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:40,400
it's been filtered out that's what the mass is you know everyone agrees to how many times you

487
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,480
heard that that's what everyone agreed to right going back to what I said earlier everything on this

488
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,520
earth is based on what you agreed to your contracts your your vows do you say what you mean in mean

489
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:58,000
what you say it's a it's a place of secrets but yet the secrets are hidden in plain sight

490
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,800
and so what I'm trying to sort of look at is the interplay between objectivity on one hand and

491
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,000
subjectivity on another hand in how you either uncover those secrets or come to understand those

492
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,480
secrets of their presented to you because what you've said quite often is that these things are

493
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,800
hidden in plain sight so the secrets are still there for people to observe but they don't necessarily

494
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:25,120
know what they're seeing so right let me present this there's a way that the world has been conceptualized

495
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:29,280
in modern times which is that there's an external world and it's full of objects like buildings and

496
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,160
vehicles and people and such and these things exist whether anyone likes it or not independent

497
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:39,600
of your belief or your opinions or your preferences so that is said to be an objective existence and

498
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:44,720
then you have the subjective world which consists of internal states of mind that are not ontologically

499
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:51,760
objective so if we presume that to be accurate then what I'm seeing is that modern man has a sort

500
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,720
of difficulty in in describing the objective reality which is a little bit of what you're saying

501
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:02,480
and as a result of that though what you have is a form of skepticism that has arisen where people

502
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,120
discount the objective reality altogether now so we see that with postmodernism we see that with

503
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:12,880
social constructivism and so my question is what kind of response should you have to this over

504
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:17,760
emphasis that we're seeing in the world on subjective worldviews where people just make stuff up?

505
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,320
People would rather have the subjectivity because it's a known assailant

506
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:29,600
right it's a known assailant they've already agreed on what is not known and is known and even

507
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:36,640
what is known as false it's okay because we seem to be living another day where when you begin to

508
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:41,520
know the more you do know the more you subject to yourself to what you don't know

509
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:48,720
where the subjective person will say well I don't know anything about that but I'm just going to do

510
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:55,280
what everyone else is doing so at least the assailant there is known at least the unknown is known by

511
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:04,240
others and I have some protection by numbers where the one who is objective the more he begins to

512
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:09,440
know and he moves on to another thing to know he's actually does because he doesn't know of it yet

513
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,320
or know much about it yet he is subjecting himself to pure unknown it's an unknown assailant

514
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:24,400
on the psyche so it actually takes the bold and the strong to know and the weak and the cowardly

515
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:33,280
to be subjective. Another thing that is reoccurring that I see a lot is this idea of the truth right

516
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:38,960
sometimes stylized with a capital T and we see it talked about quite loftily by philosophers and

517
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:43,920
politicians and religious leaders to the point where a version of that kind of rhetoric has been

518
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:50,320
created for the masses now and promulgated mainly through new age and you know leftist media

519
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:54,480
and public figures who encourage people to speak their truth right so it's not the truth but

520
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:00,320
speak your truth and so people have a lot to say about truth today either way but when you hold

521
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,720
their feet to the fire it's revealed quite quickly that their truth is just conjecture and subjectivity

522
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:09,680
like I like this or my belief is that how would you say that that becomes the de facto mindset?

523
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:15,520
Well just like that they're cowards and they're weak it's very simple and that's the norm

524
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:21,600
actually the what you hear when you hear people being in the military and proud of it those

525
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:27,120
are all the cowards and the weak ones the special forces even the special forces of subject to

526
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:33,360
that the character right now I believe it or not but a true warrior will never admit that he's gone

527
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:44,400
into a campaign in with pride you see another way to say it is truth to a pig is just pouring

528
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:52,000
slop into a trough it's time to eat the same thing the same truth for the pig would be if you had

529
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,880
a let's say hut cuisine five star meal prepared imported into the trough that's truth also now which

530
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,920
one is more effective for those managing the pigs to just get whatever slop and satisfy the pig

531
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:09,040
or to be more perfect and get a five star meal and put it in the trough for the pig when the

532
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:17,200
pig really finds them both to be quite adequate so what you're actually witnessing with the crap that

533
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:23,600
the masses feed on and the different levels is actually operating on a high level of efficiency

534
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:29,680
based on the fact and the known established observation that humans do not like peace and harmony

535
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:40,640
they say they do but a pig snorts and grunts right he grunts the same way and snorts the same way

536
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:47,120
when he's happy and when he's sad the pig does but when he's in extreme discomfort they let

537
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:54,240
out this really your piercing squeal right so most people will say they want peace and harmony

538
00:53:54,240 --> 00:54:02,080
but i see them get very excited when there's controversy um scandal and war yeah but can you show

539
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:06,400
me a time in history with that's not the case i'm not saying that there it was not the case at any

540
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,840
point i'm just saying this is a cross sectional view if we're going to take a cross section of

541
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:18,240
humanity at any time in history it'll pretty much be the same the interesting thing of it the shameful

542
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:26,160
interesting thing of it is most times most people that are apologetic uh try to like they're representing

543
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:31,920
the good side of humanity will say well they didn't know any better that's the shameful part

544
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:38,560
because okay it was not difficult to know better okay where hold up though

545
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:43,280
because if it's if it's not difficult to know better than we should be able to find some

546
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,720
reasonable sample size of people that knew better so if we're saying that that cannot be found at any

547
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:54,320
point in history then we're talking about a condition that is internal to the human existence right

548
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:59,680
you can't separate a pension for violence from what it means to be a human being so how can you

549
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:05,360
then also say that it's an indictment when it's a permanent condition it is well the those

550
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:12,160
you'll never hear of the of the reality of what's happening on earth institutionally because you

551
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:19,840
can't exist in an institution unless you tow the the bovine extraments right but if you look closely

552
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:25,920
there are how many times have you heard of writers philosophers scientists have very stark

553
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,560
criticism about the things going on in their day throughout history all the way all the way back to

554
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:40,640
ancient times right so there's always been a small group uh that might be you like we said earlier

555
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,200
the extraordinary ones if you read any of their ancient rites in any culture there's always a

556
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:50,720
small extraordinary group and there's actually two there's the one that's put in front of the

557
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:56,480
masses which is total you know crap usually they can't be substantiated and then there there's

558
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:01,840
the reality of the extraordinary group that are just sit by the the wayside patient whether they have

559
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:09,120
a good life or not for whatever you know age they live to is another story this is just the way

560
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:17,040
this planet operates and the reason this is quite obvious the reason we discuss this is for

561
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:23,200
anyone who can grasp this and comprehend it and actually apply it right this is all a pliket of

562
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:30,080
you have a more efficient mindset again back to the financial people say well there's going to be a

563
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:35,200
big financial crash is going to be problems right well they change a lot of financial systems by

564
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:41,120
first creating a depression well what does that mean well on paper that happens often but it

565
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:45,440
doesn't happen often when they're when the people lose their ability to gain food clothing and

566
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,600
shelter then it's time to put on something that they wouldn't have accepted before

567
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:57,680
so right now they let's say there's talk about a financial let's say meltdown or whatever they

568
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:02,240
whatever they put out there you have to say to yourself well we know it's a credit-based economy

569
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:07,120
and we know that the amount of currency that's put on the market is based on the birth rate we know

570
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:13,840
that for sure meaning the individual to himself and as all the facts to prove it so the only way to

571
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:18,960
actually crash the financial system which actually it would actually raise the the value of the

572
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:25,440
currency very highly for whichever country did it first was to lower the birth rate so if you lower

573
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:30,000
the birth rate because there's less babies being born there's less currency put into the market the

574
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,400
value of that currency will rise according to others and it could rise to the point where no one

575
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:39,520
else can use it because it's too expensive to use it and then you can you can't do trade and that's

576
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:44,960
the really how it works and you won't find this on the internet really even though it's the truth

577
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,480
and this is actually you know this is common knowledge amongst the first and second groups that we

578
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:55,760
mentioned earlier but the masses don't even bother because if you throw in the pick trough that

579
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:01,040
information next to it oh you owe debt they're going to eat it up the same and they're going to be

580
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:06,320
more focused on the one that's going to come after them later right so when you hear us something

581
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:11,280
about this or that or the other you have to see what is the topical nature of you know what's

582
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:18,240
being discussed right and what do I know about it and then you make a judgment call is it a really

583
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:23,360
call to urgency or is it just another thing they're feeding all the you know the trough put the

584
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:28,000
feeding trough and you'll find that the majority of anything and everything you've encountered

585
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,680
outside of providing food clothing shelter for yourself is that way it's just rubbish quality

586
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:40,880
let's unwrap up on the objectivity a bit with one last thing so when you try to bring

587
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:47,840
objectivity to bear on a situation the pushback that people give is that you're being cynical or

588
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:52,880
pessimistic or even judgmental right they don't want your evaluation to be based on the observable

589
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:58,080
reality but rather on an attitude or a belief so the conclusion that I draw from that is that

590
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:03,280
a certain type of judgment has become taboo in popular thought and we've all heard someone say

591
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,920
that you shouldn't judge or don't judge and they say that as a sort of transcendent moral claim

592
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:13,120
that they feel is backed by let's say the biblical text or some other text if we fall back on a

593
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:19,120
definition that I've heard you use previously then judgment is essentially making a decision that

594
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:23,040
allows you to navigate objectively versus saying I don't know what's going on so let's just close

595
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:27,920
our eyes and hope for the best can you expand a bit on that as far as how you can't be an effective

596
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:33,760
judge of things without being objective well of course it's another word for judgment is discernment

597
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:39,760
the reason we're having this stream right now or sonic event is because I've been very judgmental

598
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:45,760
today meaning that when I was out traveling in an engine driven wagon known as an automobile

599
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:52,560
I had seen a red light at intersection and I made a judgment call should I speed up or should I slow

600
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:59,200
down and stop yield and stop now that when the people say it's too judgmental it's because they're

601
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:04,960
just more interested in you know is he filling the trough the way that I'm used to you know having

602
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:12,960
the trough filled right give you an example on that years ago I was those a particular group this

603
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:18,400
is more 30 years ago so they they had a lot of pride in doing organic natural food and it was a

604
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:23,280
holiday and it was New York City so they said well we have all this like a food left over from this

605
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:28,320
banquet it was really high cuisine and so let's go down and feed the homeless great so we took a

606
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:33,360
bunch of plates and covers and all that and prepared all these meals with wonderful food you know

607
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:38,000
dishes and we went down to the homeless in New York City and we present this plate to them that you

608
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,920
know you it would be very expensive at a restaurant and the homeless people look at it and they

609
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:50,400
threw it on the floor and I said no I want hot dogs right so so at that point do you do you become

610
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:57,120
judgmental if you say well look at the sun grateful son of a bitch or do you just avoid the entire

611
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:03,280
thing saying of course because that's what you're right the reason they're in such a condition is

612
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:08,800
because they don't recognize you know this or they are mentally unstable there's many reasons

613
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:14,640
do is that a judgment call to actually make a determining factor like that right so that's what

614
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:19,760
you see in front of you I mean some homeless people wouldn't do that but ones seem to have done that

615
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:25,200
not all of them I'd say out of the 50 that we encountered half of them did that which is actually

616
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:34,320
pretty damning right so when you look at the masses and when I say just leave them alone unless you

617
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:38,800
have minimum just keep it in a cordial you want to look like a spot you want to act like a

618
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:43,280
a the spy in another country you know you're you're you're far and you're just observing you know

619
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,040
you're not going to say well you're not going to tell in your life story but in what they're doing

620
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:52,800
wrong you just you know you go to the auto part store hi how are you great okay I'll eat this part

621
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:58,000
thank you very much by and in the background you might hear the guy saying well my way for it not

622
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,880
my credit card it or I have high blood pressure I mean you're going to stop and try to educate the

623
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:09,760
fool now he might be one of the extraordinary ones you might just give a an investment in the

624
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:14,960
opportunity not in him but in the opportunity because if you don't say anything and you walk away

625
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:20,800
there's an opportunity lost there for you to discern whether this one is an extraordinary one

626
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:24,240
that'll actually understand what you're saying or take heed to it and change his life and be

627
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,680
more efficient instead of saying he has credit card debt and high blood pressure which none of

628
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:33,440
those things exist it unless you agree to it right so if you don't say anything there's an opportunity

629
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:38,720
to lost but then let's go back to the homeless people chances are if 50% of the people you talk to

630
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:43,920
about objective things to to kind of like change or make what they're doing better based on a

631
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:50,560
judgment call of what they're saying is false or on the general perception if 50% accepted 50%

632
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:55,600
rejected that would still be pretty high acceptance factor but I'm telling you you'd have to go through

633
01:02:55,600 --> 01:03:04,320
a thousand people before one right 0.01% so you're going to have to learn to live your life with

634
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:11,520
efficiency right and of course fellowship with those that can only because from a spiritual sense

635
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:18,320
meaning to keep your own peace in harmony which you hopefully you strive for it's best to have

636
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:24,640
others to speak to about these things but guard yourself because the general group is is not

637
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:32,000
is not ready for it and you can take that whether it's mis-entropic or not objectively it's very

638
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,680
mis-entropic but it doesn't mean you have to act as such on each individual level in other words

639
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:42,640
the healthiest way to perform on earth to anyone visiting this planet you should learn to

640
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:48,480
hate the entire culture and society and ebb and flow of our things are done but love the into each

641
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,240
one that you encounter as much in other words do the right thing that's what love means right

642
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:59,440
the actual group the institutions the structures the religions the culture is hateful

643
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:05,840
is hateful and can be hated very easily as something abominable something improper something

644
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:14,800
repugnant but the individuals themselves if you can if if they are open and if they are want to act

645
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:21,520
in a more efficient manner right they can be addressed maybe on an individual level not in a

646
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:27,920
group form though it doesn't work in a group the ending point of this stream is to find a way to

647
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:34,240
tie together this idea of having a proper mindset and being objective so if i were to ask the Greek

648
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,880
what came first the chicken or the egg you would give me an answer because there is an actual answer to

649
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:44,000
that it's not just this kind of open-ended question it's a clear case of cause and effect so to

650
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,520
transpose that idea to this case is there cause and effect relationship between having the proper

651
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:54,560
mindset and being objective so basically which one comes first the proper mindset or the pension

652
01:04:54,560 --> 01:05:00,640
for being objective the proper mindset's assorting mechanism oh this is this is bulk this isn't

653
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:07,280
right this is going to waste my time this isn't right this is this is this is the how i'll get hurt

654
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:13,760
here here i won't assort you know you sort out perceptions and information leading to you know

655
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:21,600
you might say established knowledge and you can't do that without having objectivity now the

656
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:30,800
masses that are that are subjective they are not this is not this doesn't apply to them right you see

657
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:40,080
what i mean because if you run into the masses for example they go to the the the which doctors

658
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:44,880
in white lab coats and the big buildings that are expensive for example and they tell them they have

659
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:50,400
blood pressure right and their blood pressure is too high so they have to take medication well what

660
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,840
happens when the medication kills them they get the sympathy from all the other ones because saying oh

661
01:05:55,840 --> 01:06:00,400
i'm sorry that didn't you know it's so sad you know that he had blood blood pressure it took the

662
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:05,360
medication maybe you could sue the drug companies but you can't but whatever you could try but

663
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:09,840
you know and this is they have this harmony in this disastrous mode that they're living in

664
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:14,160
but you know when i see when i hear someone dying of blood pressure medication like that's ridiculous

665
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:18,080
because there's no such thing as blood pressure in the body at all anyway if you go study it you'll

666
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:24,160
see that it's not even based on blood pressure itself it's based on heartbeat right so um

667
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:29,520
in other words there's no positive pressure in the human body whatsoever it's all slightly negative

668
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:35,920
and everything moves under a slight vacuum but if you if you actually try to bring this forward

669
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:40,240
well there's no sympathy there what are you talking about you know this person is dead they always

670
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:45,520
bring this up you know let's say you look at a story that's put out by government institutions

671
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:51,520
science religion or whatever you know um let's say let's play their role let's let's do their what

672
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:57,920
they do this is a very simple way of saying it right uh you're gonna say uh for example you're

673
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:05,600
gonna say oh i went to this restaurant and i enjoyed the meal now if you study that let's say

674
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:10,080
i'm a government or an institution science religious whatever well the Greek just said he went to

675
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:16,400
this restaurant i checked up on it that restaurant doesn't exist right it doesn't even exist how could

676
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:22,080
he go there and eat well my response to that person that says that is are you trying to question

677
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:30,080
what i like to eat how dare you question what i like to eat right never address the point that the

678
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:38,320
restaurant never existed you see so you see how it's not clear objectivity and subjectivity is mixed

679
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:42,480
if someone dies from blood pressure medication and you go to them and say there's also just

680
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:48,240
thing as blood pressure and say oh well they're dead how dare you right to hip-hop because

681
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:53,520
you say you can't there's nothing to work when there's nothing to work so what's being put out by

682
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:58,080
institutions in mainstream for thousands of years even now even more because like i said death by

683
01:07:58,080 --> 01:08:04,720
information you can't work there's nothing to it to work with their in reality uh the best you can

684
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:11,200
do is is reform it in other words take what you need and leave the rest right and then you might have

685
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:16,480
to process it you know like the other day i went out and picked some carrots right i can't just pick

686
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:21,120
them out of the garden throw them on a plate and eat they have to be washed they have to be peeled you

687
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:26,800
know whatever you know depending prepared so what's the you know so there's an objective and subjective

688
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:34,480
mixing that has to be sorted via the mindset so let's say that someone wants the right mindset

689
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:39,840
and they want to be objective so that they can better parse the world but like you say it's a sorting

690
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:43,600
mechanism so you have to know what to sort you have to know what's important versus what's

691
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:49,360
unimportant which takes us back to judgment how would you even identify what's important or develop

692
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:57,040
the right value system to judge things simple uh the easiest way to do that is uh you prioritize

693
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:03,280
your existence now objective you can't be more objective than that food clothing shelter meaning

694
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:08,960
your physical existence because if you don't have if your physically ceased to be your your consciousness

695
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:14,400
goes into you know the abyss let's say right in other words you're you're you're uh you're dead

696
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:19,520
so in other words the opposite of that would be alive you need food clothing shelter food drink right

697
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:24,400
clothing and shelter here it well there's but there's also mental identification

698
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:30,720
well uh if you're seeking out to be objective and raise the quality of your food clothing and

699
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:35,760
shelter there's going to be a tremendous amount of mental edification on just on that path alone

700
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:42,400
that's enough to take up several lifetimes alone to do it well right or you could just get public

701
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:49,520
housing and food stamps let's say right yeah no thanks but actually that is the proper thing to do

702
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,600
because when they took money out of the society you were supposed to sign and get all the things

703
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,960
that you needed but they figured out that if we told people they just signed their name and get

704
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,400
everything they didn't know one's gonna want to work so how are we gonna maintain the streets and

705
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:07,760
the industry and farms and see ultimately you hear a lot of commentary about how the earth is set

706
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,640
up and the power structure and oh the pope is bad oh the government's corrupt oh the deep state

707
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:18,960
oh the drug companies oh the bankers you know there's no one out there discussing you'll find

708
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:25,440
to you know podcasts uh and all this alternative media but no there's no one out there um being

709
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:31,600
apologetic for the elite yes even though they worship the dark demonic beings that you read about and

710
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,520
all those things you don't want to read about let's say things that you've never read about like ancient

711
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:41,680
rits they they have discovered that you know how many times you heard like you know satanic Hollywood

712
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:48,240
which is true right all these actors that you see on tv in the movies yeah they all took it up the

713
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:55,040
butt right uh all of them not some of them is as it's called the 20 million dollar club right and

714
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:00,640
this is i mean this is wicked and where it comes to human sacrifice uh this is prevalent and all

715
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:06,800
of your industries uh uh and institutions right i don't mean defending that aspect of it that's

716
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:13,520
horrible and that needs to go but what i mean is uh let's say you were put in charge of controlling

717
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:18,880
what the masses see here educate their religion their food their medicine system would you want to do

718
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:24,400
that i wouldn't want to do it right so the people that are controlling the the administering is the top

719
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:28,480
let's say those that believe that they own the world they do have a pretty even though they laugh at

720
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:35,200
everything pretty much and they're foolish themselves they are um they've got quite the task right

721
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:41,520
because they have to have remember people hate peace uh and harmony so they have to throw in

722
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:46,720
enough chaos to keep the people happy but at the same time maintain enough peace and harmony that

723
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:51,440
there isn't it doesn't go out of control the other way right because then you can't control it all

724
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:59,120
right because even they even these let's say quote unquote Satanists that rule the world um do want a

725
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:06,160
certain amount of beauty also let's say right at least up until now hey that's the other thing you know

726
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:13,360
there's um people are very naive uh when you go look above the middle and higher part of society you

727
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:17,600
know the first of the guys that and gals that think they own the world in the middle is the administrators

728
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,560
which are your president's kings leaders of industry and then you have the masses right and then there's

729
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:26,640
you know it there's these are not distinct lines they're they're in medium lines because when you

730
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:30,000
look at the people that rule the mass as the presidents and kings will they have mayors and governors

731
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:35,600
below them right and then like assembly people and people below that and finally you get to the

732
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:45,840
masses um what when you start to look at how they're all set up um it trickles down in other words

733
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:51,200
it's not a when I said earlier that the people that run this world are satanic or worship dark forces

734
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:57,120
that is not a conspiracy theory that is a known established fact because you if you see how it

735
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:03,760
trickles down right they consider the masses their slaves or their property uh threat human history

736
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:10,240
when you were a slave you had the religion and the culture of your master right so if a Chinese

737
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:18,720
lord bought an Italian slave that Italian slave now has to take on the religion of his Chinese master

738
01:13:18,720 --> 01:13:25,200
you see it and so forth and all the ways now if you look at the way architecture is presented

739
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:32,960
right uh it go it it it it goes back to ancient gods that were malevolent let's say or

740
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:40,640
what we call pagan gods if you look at for example the dollar bill on the us right on the back that is

741
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:45,520
all free Masonic stuff you know free mason's you know say well that's a conspiracy theory know it's

742
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:51,440
true that it's secrets you know and eventually it's not difficult to study that it is malevolent

743
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:57,840
at the top but again all of your all of your religious institutions are male all of your medical

744
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:03,760
scientific governmental whatever social sports anything Hollywood are all malevolent at the very

745
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:09,200
top in other words they have allegiances to malevolent beings whether it's human or nonhuman all of them

746
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:15,120
there's no exception to this you've heard of the pete felia rings in the in the Vatican right it's

747
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:21,360
even mainstream and not the pete felia rings but the abuse right Hollywood is made it's been put

748
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:26,480
mainstream you know and they always financial it's been put mainstream years ago to give an

749
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:33,680
example there was a guy I won't mention the company lie Lilly anyway he walked in a little early to

750
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:39,840
work one day was like a 40 story high rise somewhere in Chicago I'm any 80 story hires on the 40th floor

751
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:44,320
he goes in there it's early it's like five in the morning it wasn't supposed to be until 7 30

752
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:49,280
and he goes down he sees the hall the lights are up but there's a door open and the chief executives

753
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:54,240
of the company were in there doing a satanic ritual sands with the candles and the pentagram and

754
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:59,520
chicken blood and all that stuff right over a bunch of paperwork that they had formulas of new drugs

755
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:05,920
that they were going to put out right this was told to me this is pharmaceutical people praying over

756
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:13,680
their their formulas you know with ode to anyway very often when I speak on these matters I don't

757
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:19,280
want anyone to to say oh well I'm going to follow the Greek or I believe or I don't believe him or

758
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:25,280
where is he all of the speculation and the way people hear because the very few people are actually

759
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:30,480
listening is a difference the way people hear Greek speak is irrelevant what is relevant is

760
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:38,240
that you've heard it and file it away for a later date I think we've gone quite far as far as time

761
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:46,320
so we're we're gonna have to wrap up and I will endeavor of course to get these podcasts uploaded

762
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:52,000
as soon as possible undoubtedly we're going to revisit some of this material in the future hopefully next

763
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,360
week so unless there's anything else you want to conclude with greek I think I'm good you have any

764
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:03,600
finishing thoughts all the finishing thought is always considered would you would you always deal

765
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:09,280
with an enemy you know or an enemy that you don't know and the objective one that seeking knowledge

766
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:15,440
does not mind encountering an enemy he doesn't know because he's brave and bold where the coward

767
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:21,120
and the weak will always want to encounter an enemy they do know right one is subjective one is

768
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:27,440
objective the subjective masses that are weak and cowardly well if they don't know about something

769
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:32,240
what do they always say this is just a recap I'll just do what everyone else does and I'll be fine

770
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:37,200
and I agree with them because of we've already made a judgment call that those that say that are

771
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:43,280
not extraordinary at all right and they're all the same yeah they look different they smell different

772
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:48,480
they speak different but they're generally the same just like no two loaves of bread baked alike you

773
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:53,360
can go to the store and see all these loaves of bread pat kitchens identically and they all look the

774
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:57,680
same just grab one but I'll tell you go look very closely you'll see there's a small discerning

775
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:03,040
difference but for general purposes and statistically yes they are the same so most people you'll ever

776
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:09,840
meet whether they're friends family they're all the same don't be fooled and on that note I thank

777
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:16,000
everybody for listening and for tuning in and greek speak will be back next time with a podcast

778
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:25,440
on a different theme

779
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,320
