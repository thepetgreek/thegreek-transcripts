00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,120
Greetings to everyone listening. This is the Greek Speak podcast featuring the

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,320
Archon in the Greek. I'm the Archon creator of GreekSpeak.com. We've reached

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,960
episode five of this series of talks between the Greek and myself which marks

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,480
the halfway point of this season of streams and I'm glad that we finally got

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,800
in here as the series is dragged on a bit longer than I thought it would but

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,320
there's been a lot going on that has slowed things down but I anticipate we'll

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,760
certainly be done by the end of the year. I say that fully in earnest but

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,560
half-in-gest but we'll see how things go. So the live stream group chat is always

10
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,260
open for those who want to ask questions during the stream and

11
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,840
GreekSpeak.com continues to have no political religious or commercial

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,000
affiliations since this is a project that is solely run and funded by myself

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,080
and that's it for the introduction. I hope you guys enjoy the rest of the show

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,160
and thanks again for listening.

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:32,920
Hi there Greek you there? Yes greetings. I'm here. All right what are we going to

16
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,360
talk about today or speak on? Well today we're going to look at the topic of

17
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,960
media which is obviously wide-ranging in its themes but we'll try to cover the

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,280
most salient points and perhaps shed some light on some of the less talked about

19
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,920
aspects of how that sphere works. So in the broadest terms media is generally

20
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,560
broken down into mainstream and alternative and so for ease of use purposes I

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,920
think we'll use that categorization and start with the first one. Does that sound

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:08,280
good to you? Yeah it works. Cool. So when we talk about an enforced condition of

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,740
universal ignorance or lack of comprehension that we call cosmic censorship I

24
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,240
think that's something that seems closely tied to the proliferation of mass

25
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,160
media and I think it's more than just keeping people ignorant but also you feed

26
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,400
them lies and you teach them how to love their lies and so the media sort of ends

27
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,640
up becoming a stage on which journalists and entertainers perform fictions,

28
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:37,840
scripted fictions. As somebody who was around for the mid to late 20th century at

29
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,560
what point did you start to realize that that might be the case? You know I always

30
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,400
had a sense that it could not be trusted even as a child very simply you know

31
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,600
sitting in front of a black and white TV in the late 60s or so seeing a

32
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,320
commercial television commercial for a breakfast cereal and as you know it's

33
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,400
being promoted as being good tasting let's say and then going out and actually

34
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,560
getting that breakfast cereal and finding out that it was not good tasting was

35
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,360
was the one of the initial ways I know this sounds very rudimentary and primitive

36
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,680
was one of the initial ways of letting me know that the media can't be trusted

37
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:30,000
and if you just think about what I just said it is something that needs to be

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,120
paid attention to you know can they be trusted right and how did I mean how did

39
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,240
that unfold from breakfast cereal as a child into things that you would have seen as

40
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:47,400
a teenager or a young adult? Well ultimately you know I would say being mid

41
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,400
century beyond mid century you know born in that this kind of a world where I

42
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,800
think television came before both you and I were born so did radio and newspaper

43
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,920
and most other you know forms of media were born into it so there's no way we can

44
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,960
actually you know discreetly separate it from our existence meaning you know our

45
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:16,640
perceptual existence so it leads into you know something that is you know

46
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:23,800
something that's a part of your life and to actually market as with a sense of

47
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,360
distrust is no different than marking let's say one's community parents family or

48
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,400
friends with a level of distrust or authority with a level of distrust religion

49
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,440
with a level a certain level of distrust academia with a certain level of

50
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,560
distrust you see what I'm going with this in other words you can say buyer be

51
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:56,720
where caveat emptor and in a sense you know you are buying this stuff it's being sold

52
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:07,920
to you right so I would sense that a healthy level of distrust is what would be

53
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:13,200
let's say a good foot to start off on once you start sharpening your perception

54
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,800
and as far as you know the time period still though like were there any landmark

55
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,560
programs other like you put aside commercials and sort of generalities like that

56
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,840
but were there any landmark programs that made you realize that in fact this is

57
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,200
not your friend and something that shouldn't be trusted or could be antagonistic

58
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:36,600
you know what's interesting on that is you could look at it from a cultural

59
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,160
point of view that's the main thing that programming whether it's in print radio

60
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,920
or visual you know video has to be in accord with the traditions and values and

61
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:52,920
culture that it's being shown to and what's interesting enough being of a

62
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:59,040
multicultural meaning a born in American but a Greek descent I saw that the I was

63
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:05,200
able to see clearly through the heavy promotion of white middle America as not

64
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,320
being something that I want to associate with if you know what I mean

65
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,400
you know the white middle American culture is very different from the European

66
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,840
culture in many aspects right so especially when it comes to food and the way you

67
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,000
you know perceive basic things like food shelter clothing things like that

68
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,440
right so that right away showed me that it's possible that when you do look at

69
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,560
something like the media with objectively or from another point of view from a

70
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,200
different culture you'll see that it's it's basically a selling game or something

71
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,200
to accommodate the the majority but well I think we'll touch we'll touch on that

72
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,840
dynamic a bit later because certainly there's something to be said for how the

73
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,480
audience is react to to what the media does but could you contrast a bit 20th

74
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,920
century media to say 21st century media aside from the technological changes

75
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,000
brought on by computing what has been this cultural shifts that you seem to be

76
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,760
alluding to well you can't really change it in other words you mean you can't say

77
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,360
that there's going to be change without taking the technology into account so

78
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:22,000
the way the media changes is with technology you can look at historically first

79
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,960
it was oral and then it was oral and written and then it became oral written

80
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,320
and oral again through what's called transmission means the radio and then it

81
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:40,440
was again oral written transmission through audio and video which is also written

82
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:46,160
because you will see labels and writing and titles and things like that right so

83
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:53,680
basically capturing the the the message in with different types of technology does

84
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,240
change it I mean are we then going to insinuate that if the technology of let's say

85
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,440
FM radio had generally remained the same and television as well and say we hadn't

86
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,120
had laptops and smartphones that the media would still look the way it did 40 years

87
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,840
ago as far as the presentation of it well yes and no again the culture is

88
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,840
changing there's a agenda is in the culture to change the culture you know the

89
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,720
way people perceive reality and if anyone disagrees with that you have to

90
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,960
give it to them in braille because they're clearly blind you know there's clearly

91
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,080
an unseen hand that has agendas that are rolled out over 50 and a hundred year

92
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:40,360
periods and obviously that is part of the change you know I give a quick

93
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,080
example and by the way I don't think we need to touch on the the aspect of the

94
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,160
technology of the internet because that just brings everything much faster but

95
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:58,880
an example of the the agenda is the gender bending idea right where you can

96
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,780
choose your gender now that's been in place for thousands of years in certain

97
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:09,000
ritualistic rights and it was also put in place by the power elite in the late

98
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,600
60s as an agenda that should take hold by the 90s there are a little behind

99
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:20,700
schedule there are many other agendas that you see if you're aware of them you know

100
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,360
climate climate change you know whether you know man's effect on the planet

101
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:32,240
things like that which is actually minimal you'll see that the the messages

102
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:39,160
that have been planned out are played out through the media yeah I'm aware of what

103
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:46,120
you're referring to I also remember from last stream you spoke a bit about how

104
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,560
sometimes the intentions behind an age get expressed through entertainment or

105
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,520
literature and the example that you gave before was like George Orwell or

106
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,360
Alder Sucksley that their books are examples of that something that was either

107
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,840
commissioned or demanded or nudged into existence personally I think of a

108
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:10,360
movie I forget the year but the 80s movie was that they live right right I'm more

109
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:15,720
modern modern example what did you think about the 1976 movie network I think

110
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,400
that's another example of that do you think that that fits into that sort of

111
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:25,640
pressiant far-sighted category sure sure I would suggest there's a more

112
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,000
disclosure than people want to admit you know there's an old thing that they

113
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,660
say that they they being the the the power base that runs the planet earth ink or

114
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,940
one-world corporation let's say they have to tell you what they're going to do

115
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,260
before they do it that's part of their credo and they whether it's done very

116
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:49,540
secretively or encode up in the open it's it's still being done so that the

117
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,860
the film network I think includes some of that go and just to harken back to the

118
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,140
they live glasses if you had those now you wouldn't see them as aliens you would

119
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:03,180
see most people as little piggies oink oink but anyway that's another discrete

120
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:08,380
comment that could be expanded on later you'll see pigs goats and dogs no I think

121
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:13,980
that I think that is worth expanding but yeah maybe later the traditional idea

122
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,620
I think is that news is the manifestation of journalistic work done by people

123
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,780
whose job it is to mediate some kind of civil order by keeping the public informed

124
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:29,620
but in recent times because of how blatant the news has become its lies and it's

125
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:34,300
easy to go on youtube and google any outlet and put lies at the end of the search

126
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,940
term and you'll see that there's a lot that's been said about that because of

127
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,500
things like that many people have come to become disillusioned about the position

128
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,300
of the media and see them perhaps is more of a circus act that distracts more

129
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,540
than they inform but was there ever a time when the mainstream media was an

130
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,380
effective watchdog of the public interest because one would think that something

131
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,500
can move from a position of being virtuous to being less virtuous or esteemed

132
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,100
rather than having started out as something that was objectionable never in the

133
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:11,260
mainstream throughout entire history of mankind has it been has that had any

134
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,100
honor or dignity you can go back to what people call biblical times it was the

135
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,900
same it was all crap the the underground aspects of it you know what's called

136
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,700
let's say alternative in an altruistic way that did exist at some points but

137
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:33,260
had no effect just like it is today there the you know the the actual alternative

138
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,500
things that people can get on the internet that makes sense are actually truthful

139
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,940
if not entirely but mostly true have no effect on on the reality of the the

140
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,900
mainstream point of view of things is that something that we can back up with

141
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,620
say some more facts because yes fine to say that but you sure I can give you

142
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,860
discrete examples like for example let's just go to the internet would have been

143
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,620
and what made aware of for more than a decade and then someone more recently all

144
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:05,060
name names and people could actually look at this stuff if they want to give you

145
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:12,860
example one of them regarding the 9/11 event is Demetriak Hallisov he whether

146
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:16,700
you believe his credentials are not as not as relevant as taking a look at his

147
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,420
accounts and what really happened to the towers on 9/11 and he backs it up with

148
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,900
as much technical information as you'd like and actual you know good perceptive

149
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:33,500
reality that's easily discerned and unnotenable yet he gets there is a quote-unquote

150
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,860
9/11 truth movement that doesn't acknowledge him and if there is it's minimal

151
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:44,780
and just to compound that the the the American government did something called

152
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:49,180
an investigation which means when a government says they're going to

153
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,980
investigate something means they're going to do the opposite but anyway the one

154
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,260
of the chair people of the 9/11 commission publicly it's even on the Wikipedia

155
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,900
page for the 9/11 commission stated that the information in that investigation is

156
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:08,300
not factual or true nor does it reflect what really happened that day okay another

157
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:13,420
one is I think I've gotten a message to him and he didn't like it was a

158
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:20,060
fellow named Cody Snaudgris so SNOD GRES he's been making rounds the past two

159
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:25,260
years giving testimony that he was offered a a million US dollars to blow up the

160
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:30,700
Murrow building you know as a CIA asset you know not working directly for the CIA

161
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:36,060
but like a contractor right and his testimony is very valid and very solid

162
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:40,620
but I had messaged him I said you know your testimony is great but you know you have an

163
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,260
audience of morons basically you know this is whether they're American morons or

164
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:51,180
worldwide morons no one cares about this is nothing's going to come of it and of

165
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,980
course the response was not positive to that but obviously it's true right so

166
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:02,300
again it contradicts the government story and which again is is admitted

167
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,780
through investigations that it's not how it's been told so here we have two

168
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,340
quote-unquote whistleblowers let's call them with very good testimony that can be

169
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:17,660
comparatively analyzed within each subject one being the Alfred R Murrow building

170
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:25,100
Oklahoma City and the other one being the 9/11 disaster let's call it that and no one really cares

171
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,820
and it's on the internet and it's easy to access right and not only that it's not even being

172
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:35,660
promoted as a body of work or a testimony that should be looked at or considered

173
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:42,380
right so I mean there are many more examples on that you know there's a movie called

174
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:49,340
Vaxed regarding the negative effects of vaccination and even the agencies and authorities that

175
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:54,460
promote vaccination say we've never really done any substantial scientific tests or that there's

176
00:15:54,460 --> 00:16:02,540
any proof that vaccinations are viable in preventing disease you see but we do know that they're very toxic

177
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,580
so I mean you can go on there's hundreds of subjects you can cover in this way that you know the

178
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,460
the information or testimony that's given through what's called the media is pretty much

179
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:20,060
rock solid but it's being ignored or not considered hmm I follow what you're saying and a lot of that

180
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:26,620
does seem to pertain to a more modern landscape of manipulating the public in a certain way

181
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:31,900
but what you're essentially saying before is that that pertains to an even greater swath of

182
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:37,980
human history so what I'm trying to see is that if we go back to ancient times why would we presume

183
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,860
that that was the case then I mean obviously what was then has led to what is now so there has to be

184
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,740
a red thread that runs through all of it but are we going to discount you know the philosophical

185
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:55,020
schools the mystery schools the library societies of ancient times as well you could discount what's

186
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:01,500
being pervade as what those things are about or those schools are about yes meaning if you were to

187
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:07,740
pick up any of a Greek philosophy and read it in English it's not being translated accurately

188
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:16,140
regarding any religious for religious philosophy or religious text scientific text on and on

189
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:22,620
and on you know Tesla you know just the bounce around you know Tesla never worked with electromagnetism

190
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:30,060
maybe maybe a little bit when he was asked to build an AC motor but his research did not include

191
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:35,900
electromagnetism no one brings if you go to any university in the world they'll tell you electricity

192
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:42,940
is electromagnetic I know it sounds kind of strange to bring that up out of the blue like that but just

193
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,900
think about that for a minute what did he work with right a different form of electricity so when

194
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,780
you hear people talking about Tesla technology it's a bunch of rubbish because they you know because

195
00:17:52,780 --> 00:18:00,060
they don't go and look at what Tesla wrote about hmm well if indeed it is the case that the the

196
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:05,340
the media is a joke from the ground up then isn't the term fake news and oxymoron meant to deflect

197
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,980
from how observed all the news is in fact or all the media is in fact then not just a certain segment of

198
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:15,100
it very much like a term they have the legal society has sovereign citizen how could you be a sovereign

199
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:22,620
in a citizen citizen is essentially a subject or a slave yeah it's it's it's all it's all a

200
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:29,340
form of dichotomy and paradox if you look at it that way I'm using the word paradox the way the ancient

201
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:36,460
Greeks did it which is it's not the way people say today it's basically something ridiculous so

202
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:43,900
George all in the comedian you know fire fighters fight fire and what a freedom fighters fight

203
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:52,940
that's funny you see yeah so so the essence of it is what do you know about the human society

204
00:18:52,940 --> 00:19:00,540
wholesale and this planet from history on on to today would be the question you know there's

205
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:05,980
something here we'll just side skirt the media for a moment something called a right of passage right

206
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:13,020
like you're not considered in certain countries to be of a good standing let's say nationalist or

207
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,980
citizen unless you've served in the military and even better if you've served in a war and killed people

208
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:24,300
right another right of passage is academia you're not considered to be a viable worker or

209
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:33,580
respectable in society unless you have a college degree you see so but let's just to take the second one

210
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:39,820
in terms of right of passage if you let's say you could pick an academic subject astrophysics regular

211
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:46,860
physics chemistry history 99% of what they teach you in university is on the media and it's fake

212
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:52,060
what's the difference why do you need to go to university if they're teaching you the same BS that

213
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:57,580
you learn on the media by watching documentaries well one is the right of passage you have to pay to

214
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:04,220
get you know the you know the x amount of years and what they call credits and the ceremony

215
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:12,060
and what they call a diploma in other words if you are in let's say an avid a watcher of television

216
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:19,580
or on the internet regarding astrophysics right or you have a degree in astrophysics from the best

217
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:25,740
university you pretty much have the same BS but the person that's sitting at their armchair

218
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,900
can't say he's an astrophysicist because they'll ask him for a degree and but the guy who says he's

219
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:37,900
an astrophysicist and respected as such because he has a doctorate degree from a Ivy League university

220
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:45,580
right he knows the same stuff that's on television it's mostly BS you see so there's a difference

221
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:51,500
here between right of passage that gives you know humans people certain people in human society

222
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:57,820
the accolades or the respect where everyone kind of knows or has access to the same information

223
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:07,420
so what's interesting about the media is the BS or the the the falsehood and the fake stuff that's

224
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:14,380
on the media is exactly the same stuff that's in the universities right but very few very seldom

225
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:19,420
will you see someone saying well I've watched a thousand hours of astrophysics on television and

226
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:25,180
though they'll never be respected as someone who has a PhD in it even though it's the same information

227
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:33,820
and which is fake you see it's low-level garbage really so you know what what what it kind of does is

228
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:41,260
mix one scratch their head and say that this is basically a level of quality in in other words

229
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:51,900
humans have are are prefer a low level of quality within their existence and that's why they have

230
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:58,300
the media that they do or the education that they do or the religious traditions that they do or

231
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:03,340
on and on and on or the medicine that they think they have so basically the question to ask here is

232
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:10,220
why are humans so attracted to such a low-level quality existence well I think that part of the answer

233
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:16,460
would be that there is some kind of a pleasure there that's being offered alongside with the low

234
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,740
quality information or conditions because if it was painful I think people would run from it

235
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:28,940
well they lack reference for example the painful aspect I find personally many of the things

236
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:35,740
that people see as being normal is being painful right whether it's the way they eat the way they

237
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:42,060
keep their their their person the way they perceive things I find that to be very painful I mean

238
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:48,300
torture for me would be to be transplanted and live with a midwestern white American family

239
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:57,820
it was very specific Greek well speaking of this idea of the the sort of the masses or the audience

240
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:03,980
who consume the media there's this idea that the media is a behemoth that manipulates the masses

241
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:09,980
who are helpless before its influence but I would say that the general sense of reality is created

242
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,940
actually by both groups of people those who produce the media and those who consume it so

243
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,460
the audiences are not as passive as they're made out to be because they are allowing the lies in the

244
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,820
misrepresentation to go unchallenged and I think you've talked before and recently about accommodating

245
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,580
the audience so to speak and that leads me to wonder and to ask which of those two things come first

246
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:36,460
the media creators with no regard for the masses or the sheeple audience with no regard for their

247
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:43,500
own well-being well it's very simple here I'll give you an example back in the 80s I knew someone

248
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:50,220
who was really good at writing you know what's called rap songs hip-hop songs right and we were

249
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:58,060
standing around one night in the Soho area Manhattan before it was developed and sort of like a

250
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:06,060
limousine open opens his doors and there's a bunch of older men standing around and the guy is doing

251
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:11,100
some freestyle rapping and they pull them aside and they said why don't you hang with us and we'll make

252
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:21,660
a lot of money together these these older you know I would say more Ashkenazi type in their 60s

253
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:28,380
upper middle class men or wealthy men have no interest in developing rap music

254
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:34,860
right but they know that if they accommodate those that are interested in that they'll be wealthy

255
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:43,820
do you see the point yeah yeah so I would suggest that anything that you see in mass is there to

256
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:49,340
accommodate the masses and this is the beef that I have with what's called the alternative media on

257
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:56,140
the internet is that they're always putting out this spouting altruistic verbosity about we need to

258
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:00,140
do this to make America better or the world better or humanity better and they're full of crap

259
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,900
better for who did they ever stop and think that the people actually like that like being this way

260
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:14,940
take for example the film the matrix where one of the characters the main characters is tied

261
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,740
down to a chair and the one of the agents of the matrix says to him well we had a perfect

262
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:27,500
environment for you but you you you couldn't prosper in it you needed the the destruction the chaos

263
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:34,700
the violence the vialness right in order to feel normal more furious I think was tied down yeah

264
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:43,420
Lawrence Fisprin but anyway I think that ultimately making the world a better place was to do a

265
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:51,180
reset you have to start all over and this by the way is in all of the ancient rites and prophecies

266
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:59,100
and philosophies so didn't you want to say that well maybe not on on a stream but I think I've heard

267
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:04,940
you say that news corporations at their heart you know behind the smoke in the mirrors and if you

268
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:10,940
go into the actual legal departments and you know the high level parts of the corporation they will

269
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:15,820
consider themselves as entertainment companies first and if you put your feet to the fire and you

270
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:21,420
make them sweat they'll say well we're just we're not really trying to educate people but we're

271
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:25,820
here to provide entertainment but they're hiding behind the plausible deniability of being news

272
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:31,580
companies can you explain on that a bit sure there are precedent cases in there you know the kangaroo

273
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:37,420
courts what you call federal courts or state courts or whatever someone had prosecuted fox news

274
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:42,300
regarding libel and the case outcome was that well they're an entertainment company

275
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:49,820
right the news is entertainment but yet they take it seriously like for example if if you've got

276
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:55,740
more than two sharp and pencils in your pocket go back to the 9/11 event you know only the people

277
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,540
on television witnessed airplanes going into the into the buildings and of course they have some

278
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,860
plants on the ground that say they saw airplanes going to the buildings but the public at large

279
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:10,380
never saw any airplanes I personally had spoken to someone a month later who was crossing

280
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:17,580
headwalks to work by crossing the Brooklyn bridge and wasn't was doing a project in that area and he

281
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,740
saw the building explode he said there were no airplanes he didn't see an airplane if there was

282
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,100
he didn't see it and there's no way he wouldn't have seen it because he had a vantage of three

283
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:31,100
sides of the building you see and also there's a lot of testimony on that and if you do a little

284
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:36,780
bit of research you'll find that there's a company that puts these visual effects in sports games

285
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:42,460
you know like you know you'll see an advertisement on the field or something it's a video effect

286
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:50,060
right and this particular company was heavily involved in making sure airplanes were on TV if you

287
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:56,220
know what I mean and they were granted later on the ability to get big lucrative contracts

288
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:02,300
with sports you know with television shows that play sports you know if you've ever watched

289
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:07,900
an American sports game you'll show an advertisement or movement on the field that doesn't exist it's

290
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:17,740
only a video effect so you know you you have this reality being totally twisted you know

291
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:26,780
from I don't know something that is tragic and as disastrous as 9/11 as being put together by

292
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:34,140
entertainment groups I mean think about it right and just for most people if you whether you know it

293
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:40,060
or not believe it or not or whatever it's irrelevant 9/11 was a nuclear event right it was a

294
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:48,140
nuclear event so meaning atomic thermonuclear so what I mean by that is being a disaster it is

295
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:56,460
disastrous to have a nuclear event in a main city like that and have it covered up by entertainment

296
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:02,460
interests such as the news and investigative reports and other companies that allowed that

297
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:10,860
visual effect and persuading the public that it was you know whatever I recently came across a

298
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:17,820
quote about the nature of the media I don't remember who said it but it reads something like this

299
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:24,940
that exaggeration is every sense as essential to a newspaper writing as the writing itself

300
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:31,500
because the point is to make as much as possible about any occurrence so that essentially all

301
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,780
that newspaper writers are for the sake of their trade is to be alarmists right and that's their

302
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:43,420
way of making themselves interesting so when I think about that a bit it leads me to wonder what is

303
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:49,500
the alternative to landscape driven by commerce as far as the media where being alarmist is sort of

304
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,860
essential well if you're going to write something to simply edify you better try to keep it a secret

305
00:29:54,860 --> 00:30:01,500
because eventually if the subject to matter or the body of work that is written to edify is

306
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:07,020
broad enough you're going to be stepping on a lot of toes that would want the contrary to being

307
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:14,140
public view do you see what I mean by that but by doing so who is it exactly that you're making an

308
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:20,300
enemy of in that situation well you know like I said earlier it's earth ink or the one-world

309
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:27,580
corporation right let's just bring it down to a national level there's certain countries today

310
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:33,180
that have in their policy that certain ideologies are to be stamped out and not allowed

311
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:41,660
so imagine that on a global level it could even be you could even be on a local level certain

312
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:48,940
municipalities do not allow certain ideologies or actions to take place right at all very strict

313
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:55,740
against it for example imagine that on a on a global level it's very difficult people to imagine

314
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:01,820
even though it's a very simple concept that the entire planet is controlled by a small business

315
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:08,540
interest I mean you could fit them all in a nice size or living room and they pretty much run the

316
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:14,940
planet but they run it in a subtle way and they've been granted that from cosmic forces until the time

317
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:20,220
for them not to to do it anymore it comes which is not which is almost around the corner or so

318
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:28,780
and so in a world where establishment media and technology corporations control the public realm

319
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:33,260
in the way that you just described I think people end up running into a lot of dead ends when

320
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:38,620
they're trying to get answers they start to realize that a lot of the promises offered up by

321
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:45,180
their society are pipe dreams and what you're what they're left with is more of a zombified consumer

322
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:49,980
existence than anything else and then when they try to escape that by turning to either alternative

323
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:55,740
media or things like the wellness movement that borrows a lot from eastern traditions they do it

324
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,420
with the same lack of discernment that they apply to the mainstream media and so ultimately when

325
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:04,220
something like yoga becomes mainstream they're back where they're started being fed a water

326
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:09,660
down version of something whose true meaning has been cast aside have you been able to discern a

327
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,820
way to escape that kind of dynamic where the media seems to continually encroach on everything

328
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:20,300
that there is to make it as dumb down as possible well just use a broad brush over anything that's

329
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:25,500
in the media as a lie let's say you brought up the yoga idea let's say that's in the media for

330
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,460
whatever reason positive or negative if you have an interest a personal interest in yoga then

331
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:36,700
then you go back and use the standard forms of discernment on the subject which the first thing is

332
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:43,420
where to learn the history of it where did it start who started it and why go back as far as

333
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:50,060
you can and and then make sure the information you're getting is somewhat contrary to what's the

334
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:55,580
what the public perceives and you're probably closer to the truth and just to reexamine that word

335
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:02,460
probably go back and see how valid and how much verification you could have on the history of the

336
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:09,420
thing right and any all the subjects are the same so essentially what you see in the media is just

337
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:17,740
a 180 of what it actually is that's the safest thing to perceive the the there's an old saying in

338
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:23,660
this in the Soviet Union that people were interested in buying the the newspaper probda which

339
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:29,820
which means the truth if translated to English and they said well why is everyone so interested in

340
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:33,900
the newspapers as well because we are interested in what's in the newspaper because whatever the

341
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:39,500
newspaper says it's a hundred what's really going on is a 180 from it so once you have that

342
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:45,420
diametric opposition established you you do get the truth from watching the fake news or the

343
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:52,140
mainstream media right all you have to all you have to do is apply that it's diametric or or

344
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:59,340
inverse of what they're telling you and you've got the truth it's like the simple but it's not

345
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:06,780
it's not as simply related here here's a simple way to look at it a baseball and a baseball bat

346
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:15,260
together cost a dollar ten right and the baseball bat costs a dollar more than the baseball how

347
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:20,700
much is the baseball cost right together the baseball and the baseball bat or a dollar ten

348
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:25,980
but the baseball cost a dollar more than the baseball so what's the price of the baseball most people

349
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:31,260
say ten cents well can't be if it's both a dollar ten because that means the baseball cost zero right

350
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:38,300
so what is it you have to do a little bit of algebra there again most people will say ten cents

351
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:43,340
because they take the hole and they subtract this a dollar more no because that means the baseball

352
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:47,580
then is it is zero no it's not zero see so how do you do that algebra it's very simple

353
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:53,420
and we don't know i'm not going to give the answer it's not come on just give the answer okay well it's

354
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:59,820
a simple you know a plus b equal c right and you just plug everything in and the

355
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:07,260
using common parlance well you'd say well if one is a dollar more than the other the total

356
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:13,340
is subtracted from that so if the total is a dollar ten and one is a dollar more than the other we

357
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:20,700
have ten cents left over and we divide that by two which is five cents so the baseball cost five

358
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:29,660
cents so let's look at it now in in the other way so the the bat is a dollar more than the baseball

359
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:36,620
which is a dollar five and the baseball cost five cents so a dollar five plus five cents equals a

360
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:42,620
dollar ten so you're you solved it and this is what you're sort of tying to the media right so it's

361
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:47,340
not exactly 180 you do have to use a little bit of algebra in other words they're going to give you

362
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:52,940
let's take 9/11 for example the buildings collapse because airplanes with diesel fuel crashed in it

363
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:59,580
well okay that's plausible but what buildings was it a chicken coop and outhouse a three-story

364
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:05,580
you know wood structure that's plot yeah that you know airplane crashing in that and diesel fuel

365
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:11,420
but not something that is robust as what we're being told and if you look at the aftermath

366
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:19,180
how can 200,000 tons of steel be reduced to 30-foot pile burning at the melting point of iron

367
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:26,700
underground so now you're going to have to figure out if both things cost a dollar ten and one is a

368
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:32,940
dollar more than the other you see this goes into again you can segue into what's the difference

369
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:38,940
between the media and the alternative media not much you know for example you know what I mean to

370
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:44,780
lead on here but I call the alternative media in many languages Latin languages papagayo which is

371
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:49,420
a parrot you know usually when I would be called into comment on things I'm like do you guys want

372
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:54,300
some crackers you know years ago and I was a little more popular in the alternative media let's see

373
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:59,100
what the Greek has to say I'm like why can't you make can't you look at the facts yourself you need

374
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:05,500
to tell me for me to tell you what to think like time magazine you know a lot of the popular American

375
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:10,380
magazines when you read their articles they're telling you how to think and what to think about it

376
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:19,100
and if you look today at the alternative media I assure you 99% of the time if not 100% of the time

377
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:24,220
on the internet they're always following they're trailing behind the mainstream like right now at

378
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:29,980
this time there's certain investigations with certain officials regarding pedophilia and the

379
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:34,860
president of the United States still and all this other stuff and all the alternative media is

380
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:41,420
just latching on to that no discernment on the reality of you know being a human on the planet yet

381
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:47,420
yeah I mean we're gonna touch a bit on the alt media as we as we go along but just to wrap up with

382
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:53,660
the mainstream aspect I think that there's something to be said for how useful the media could be

383
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:59,100
like all humans move from a point of ignorance to a point of understanding by gradually accumulating

384
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:03,740
more knowledge and understanding and since the world is a big landscape that's far too

385
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:09,420
Byzantine for any one person to comprehend in a holistic way the media should be a tool for sculpting

386
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:15,900
a good as good an understanding as you can but the issue is that we have certain people that

387
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,460
you've mentioned running the enterprises who seem hell bent on generating the current state of

388
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:25,980
affairs and I'm wondering what lies at the heart of media corporations that all seem to coordinate

389
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:31,500
their efforts towards producing unedifying content and do we like other than generalities do we

390
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:37,580
have names or histories of what the power base behind the media is the history would lend itself to

391
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:44,140
the tools that are used or have been garnered through centuries to be used to control society which

392
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:51,100
is what's called the the law society legal society the military society and the religious society

393
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:59,020
and academic academic society simple example would be years ago I worked at a television station

394
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,500
doing volunteer work to learn about how that works and I found out that one of the directors of the

395
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:09,260
TV station this tall thin elderly lady in her early 70s was army intelligence officer

396
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:14,380
right you'd never guess that you think she was just some grandma or something right

397
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:20,220
so what the hell is an army intelligence officer doing in a community television as one of the

398
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:26,780
directors go you know scratch your head on that right and it's the same all around I mean how many

399
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:31,340
times have you ever heard of someone going to a bible study in a Christian church and they spend a

400
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:36,140
half hour the priest tells you how important it is to make sure you get your taxes done on time

401
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,300
but he'll never say there is no money to pay taxes with and it's all basically

402
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:47,100
use of private credit you know of course not he doesn't know either I mean this thing goes on the

403
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:52,060
media is not simply what people regard as the media it's a level of propaganda that's throughout

404
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:58,940
every aspect of your life can you mentioned not too long ago in a different conversation about

405
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:05,340
how the media is not just about enforcing ignorance or lies but there's also fear aspect and

406
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:10,860
that they control your life by imparting fear can you expand on that well sure there's a lot of

407
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:16,060
talk about this is a two-part thing here and I'll introduce it as the as a two-part thing

408
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:21,980
is a lot of talk of quote unquote the dumbing down of America or making people quote unquote

409
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,860
stupid but that's not enough and this is the main thing that's being discussed now in alternative

410
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:34,380
media regarding the dumbing down well the main aspect of it is the duo the pair of it's in order to

411
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:40,700
control and keep the society within a certain level of control you you have to keep them stupid

412
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:46,940
and you have to keep them scared right so the fear aspect won't work unless the population is

413
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:52,460
quote unquote stupid see when they're stupid they lack the tools a cognitive tools and when

414
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:59,180
they're scared that's a a disabling factor it's a paralysis so now they're they're paralyzed and

415
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:03,980
they lack any tools so you've got them pretty much in a pretty well-contained environment

416
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:10,700
and so the implication is that if you can address the stupidity aspect then people would break free

417
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:15,740
of the ignorance as a matter of course well yeah well see once they're stupid you know you've heard

418
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,540
that stupid people are dangerous in large groups so they're very dangerous because they know they're

419
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:25,900
they're got their what comes with being stupid is gallebility in naive-tay and it would be very

420
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:34,380
easy for a revolutionary or an ideologist that was proactive in activating a crowd to gather

421
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,780
the crowd into doing their bidding right or his bidding or her bidding or the group's bidding

422
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:45,020
but if they're scared you've disabled them in the they're a fear of doing acting upon anything

423
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:50,460
even though the the level of action will be considered you know in the stupid with brackets you know

424
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:56,700
level right so it's very it's the stupidity is not enough you must keep them scared and keeping

425
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:03,020
them scared is not enough because if they're scared and they have a good cognitive faculties though

426
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:08,780
they'll want to diminish the fear by acting on their you know cognitive toolbox and saying well

427
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:15,100
we're smart we can get out of this uh scare tactic you say so you must have them stupid and scared

428
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:23,580
at the same time one does not work without the other as far as this um idea of making them stupid

429
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:29,500
and then having them scared do you make any distinction between the different outlets as far as which

430
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:34,380
one has perhaps been the most damaging in that regard do you consider any particular corporation to

431
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:41,100
be the most nefarious in what they push content wise no because these corporations are simple franchises

432
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:51,500
I think I've mentioned on years ago on previous calls any any group quote quote quote corporate entity

433
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:59,500
once it reaches 150 or 200 million a year earnings they have they're implanted and controlled by

434
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:06,140
groups again intelligence legal groups a military intelligence on and on and on secret society groups

435
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:12,140
they always put someone in a position that doesn't have a lot of mobility they pretty much stay there

436
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:18,940
and report back to home base you know earth ink or one world corporation how to you know the going

437
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:24,060
on of that company restrictions and things like that so if you for example have a software company

438
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:31,660
that grows through 150 or 200 million a year earnings the they'll have plants x intelligence

439
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:37,580
military legal the attorneys or council whatever plants in there that report back to

440
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:43,340
earth central on the goings on and if they want to shift their policy what the direction of the

441
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:50,060
of the company to the main agenda it's very easy to do by persuasion and if the those that

442
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:55,180
are running the corporation are not an agreement then you have what's called scandal whether it's

443
00:43:55,180 --> 00:44:00,380
economic personal scandal or whatever or breaking up the corporation from from people that are

444
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:06,380
already inside so you know you're looking at the control you know an army of individuals you're

445
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:11,740
talking probably a million people worldwide that are planted in all of these corporations again

446
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:17,180
that are in the hundred million to 200 million range and make sure that they're all in step with

447
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:23,980
the general agenda so they're all pretty much the same just in just different levels of access

448
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:33,020
no access meaning access to the public what I mean by that is like still you have in any

449
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:38,300
place that has television broadcasting you have the major channels right and then you have the minor

450
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:43,740
channels of television or radio right but they all have they all report back to the same central group

451
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:52,060
and speaking of this central group just to touch on it for one last time do you think that the people

452
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:59,260
who run the media corporations are as infected or impaired by the cosmic censorship that they

453
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:06,780
are infecting the masses with more so even more so because because they they're they're they're

454
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,980
they're you know there's the concept of the disinformation and misinformation the disinformer

455
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:16,300
knows the information is false and the missing form to the receivers that actually believe it

456
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:23,020
so they're the majority of the people that you see in the media the reporters and anchor people

457
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:29,900
or even no alternative media are just the they're misinformed but they do know it's it's BS

458
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:35,820
bovine excrement let's be right but they continue with it and they have to live with it so they

459
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:40,940
they have a sensory block you know otherwise they won't maintain their sanity for too long

460
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:47,020
so in other words you're talking about a low-level quality individual and i'm speaking from you know if

461
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:52,700
you anyone that knows anyone that works in uh government positions as a spokesman or media

462
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:59,260
positions as a spokesman they're they're not very well-favored uh or looked at uh as being good

463
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:06,620
quality people even by their own family members so they're very heavily compromised on a person level

464
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:13,740
which i have to tie it back into cosmic censorship i get you so we're going to continue with

465
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:20,780
alternative media the greek as somebody who has been around to see the growth of certain underground

466
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:27,740
radio outlets and sort of fan-driven media enterprises and things like internet radio was

467
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:31,660
their particular span of years that you would point to that indicated the rise of what would later

468
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:37,980
be called the alternative media probably uh the first decade middle of the first decade or the

469
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:43,020
end of the first decade of the two thousands up until about two thousand ten two thousand twelve

470
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:50,220
then it'll kind of fell apart and again not that it had much of an effect on society in a positive

471
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:59,180
way it just was there and it was of uh a little more uh you know discerning let's just say but but in

472
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:05,900
a minimal level not not to uh say that it was those were the heydays of anything there seems to be

473
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:12,540
a sentiment expressed in a lot of multimedia programs that i think many people pick up on when

474
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:18,860
they're watching it even if it's not explicitly stated which is that the hosts never really seem to

475
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:23,100
have could have made it in the mainstream world and so they started their own platforms

476
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:28,860
not necessarily as a defined expression of entrepreneurship within media to educate people

477
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:33,900
but as a sort of consolation prize for not being able to be a part of mainstream programming

478
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:40,140
and so as a result i see a lot of multimedia people commenting as you mentioned on the same things

479
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:45,100
that the mainstreams talk about but they change the twist to what extent would you say that

480
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:49,500
multimedia and the mainstream are intertwined based on the fact that so much of the subject matter

481
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:57,420
overlaps. No they are but it's by a natural default you see like the internet anyone can upload a

482
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:03,740
content and the problem is anyone can upload content. In other words let me just give you a

483
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:13,420
a very rightful statistical analysis of the internet if it were i'm all for control of the internet

484
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:19,180
very like draconian control of it but it's not going to happen because it's tied in with commerce

485
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:27,020
and even what i'm saying is irrelevant to the world at large so i would not be able to get

486
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:31,740
on the internet and have you know what we're doing right now or things in the past and that's fine

487
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:39,340
because it has no effect anyway but having a draconian restriction on the internet like some people

488
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:44,620
are complaining about censorship with YouTube and things like that i see it as a very good thing

489
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:50,540
because eventually you're going to get enough computer geeks together to hack their own minds

490
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:55,500
into figuring out another alternative platform beyond the internet.

491
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:03,580
So actually a prohibition of sorts would actually be welcome like a just a shutting down of the internet

492
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:09,420
will not happen like many well it was more popular mean years ago because people aren't thinking

493
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,420
you can't shut down the internet because banking you know so-called banking you know there is no money

494
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:21,340
it's credit-based economy is tied into it so you know companies like amazon and microsoft and google

495
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:27,020
and all that would not allow it so there is going to be no shutdown but i'm all for a North

496
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:33,660
Korea style shutdown of the internet again not just to eliminate the flow of information like the

497
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:40,300
simple-minded primitives though i would think but what it'll do is it will inspire them through crisis

498
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:42,220
to create another platform and restart.

499
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:48,780
One thing that you said a bit before that i've been thinking about there's this idea that people

500
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:54,460
who are revolutionaries are just disgruntled underdogs who weren't able to benefit off the status quo

501
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:58,380
and so they seek to overturn it but an actual fact when they get into power they end up doing

502
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:04,140
many of the things that they were fighting against and to contrast that to alternative media you

503
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:09,100
have some of the biggest names in the field that seem to offer some of the most questionable

504
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:13,900
content and i wonder if that speaks to some kind of aberration within the landscape that nobody

505
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:19,180
seems to remark on how poor character some of the top dogs within the genre are.

506
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:24,700
Well how could they remark on it because they're not aware of it they just look at the content

507
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:29,820
that they put up but that's what they call the you know internet stuff content right but

508
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:35,500
but again to go back to the revolutionary a rival someone that is a revolutionary in an

509
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:42,460
altruistic way and let's say for a greater good we'll look at society the public at large and

510
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:49,740
the 99% majority and see them as unusable unusable unworthy of change they just have to go they have

511
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:56,060
to be eliminated somehow put on another planet or whatever and you can't work with them they're

512
00:50:56,060 --> 00:51:02,460
irreparable you know they're damaged beyond whatever and that is what your first hint is when

513
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:06,940
you have a quote unquote revolutionary saying we're going to make we're going to make these changes

514
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:12,060
and everyone will be better now that's not possible if you look at the humans at large

515
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:16,860
on this planet you can't fix them they got to go sorry they're going to go naturally anyway they

516
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:25,020
only live to 80 or 90 or 75 but you can't work so so in other words a true revolutionary someone who

517
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:31,260
does a Messiah of sorts will look at human society and says 99% of them got to go or 95% of them

518
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:36,460
just can't be here anymore put them on a spaceship send them somewhere else so the the 1% that's

519
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:46,380
remaining we can work with do you see and that's not the the formula and any a national or social

520
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:50,860
change ever it's always like put me in power and you'll be better that's not going to happen you

521
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:56,460
just can't make them better and I know this is really harsh for most people's ears but sorry

522
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:03,100
that's the truth yeah it does sound a bit harsh to say the least but the fact that they're hopeless

523
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:08,700
I'm not going to disagree that people are hopeless but is there absolutely no hope well well

524
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:16,380
from a secular point of view there are absolutely hopeless it's cut in four inches of steel or a

525
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:21,420
20 feet of concrete that's you moveable of course they're hopeless but from a cosmic point of

526
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:27,500
you they're not hopeless they all have a chance to be remade and redone so that's you know we're

527
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:32,220
looking at not a fork in the road but one reality over the other you know from the basement

528
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:39,020
worms I view absolutely there is hopeless as a granite mountain is as solid but from a cosmic

529
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:45,820
point of view you know from a divine point of view no there's there's hope for them

530
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:53,020
well that will give us food for thought and something to talk about later but um

531
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:58,700
you were mentioning before about content and how the internet sort of has this

532
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:05,260
blend veneer to it as far as how it treats the information that it puts out with the rise of the

533
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:11,020
internet I think a lot of people who have no polish to their presentation or the information

534
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:15,660
that they're presenting were given the chance to be heard on a wide level and I think that there's

535
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:21,580
a core belief among the bloggers and the multimedia that somehow even though what they're presenting

536
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:25,660
is qualitatively poor they're still the cutting edge of today's journalism because they're

537
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:31,340
quote-unquote anti-media in the opposed the establishment so on one hand you can choose between a super

538
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:37,580
polished product of pristine newscasters and you know the veneer of trustworthyness with whatever

539
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:42,540
mainstream outlet you want to prefer or you can go with the guy in his basement with a mic who claims

540
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:48,460
that the system is evil which it is but he's also questionable and he doesn't address that

541
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:53,340
so where does that really leave people as far as media no leaves them where they are and where

542
00:53:53,340 --> 00:54:01,180
they're going to be in other words there is a you can use that as the defining movement a moment on

543
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:07,100
how what you just said basically the guy who's saying the system is whatever as defining moment of

544
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:14,460
how stupid humans are the human that is well aware and perceptive and is in knowledge will see

545
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:22,780
the current human society whether it's regarding religious aspects academic aspects media aspects

546
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:30,940
scientific aspects his sort of anything as being unusable in the state that it is right now so it's

547
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:38,300
basically again just to reiterate you can't make anything that exists right now in human society

548
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:44,380
better it has to be completely redone so by looking at what is called media that is simply a

549
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:51,340
reflection of the society there is no better media because you can't have a better media with a

550
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:57,900
worse society you know so you're going to have all aspects of society reflecting its foulness

551
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:08,300
and vialness as such so it is not possible so so here's the the the realistic aspect of the media

552
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:14,140
if you think you have the right stuff to put out to the right humans you do it anyway but don't

553
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:20,940
expect anything out of it because the humans at large are pretty much crap and this is also known

554
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:27,740
from a cosmic point of view you know this is a fact from a cosmic fact but them themselves

555
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:34,700
don't know that they are that the state that they're in they can't discern it you know there's

556
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:41,420
an old saying you can't take a pig to a debut on ball true i mean one of the things that and i

557
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:46,540
probably will touch on this for the last time but one of the things that continues to fascinate me

558
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:52,620
with the media situation is that people are willing to endure things that they can I think most

559
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:58,540
people can see that they're questionable so like in a world where the truth is something that people

560
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:05,100
claim to prioritize right if somebody publicly claims that a certain event is going to transpire

561
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:11,180
or that the future is going to go a certain way and if that doesn't happen usually people are in

562
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:15,260
trouble and i think that you've talked about that before because that's called being a Charlotton

563
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:23,020
or being a liar and people like that are generally not treated very well publicly but in our contemporary

564
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:27,500
times it seems like there's no better time to be a Charlotton or a liar because while it's with the

565
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:34,460
ultimateia characters have a job and make thousands of dollars a month by subscriptions why do you

566
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:40,700
think that there's such an endurance for the falsehood that they push well you know what that's been

567
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:49,100
written about two millennia ago in a certain text believe it or not if your highest level of university

568
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:55,740
is Charlottons and liars you know here's the thing you can you can corner any university professor not

569
00:56:55,740 --> 00:57:01,580
from a local junior college but from a high world renowned whatever in the reason they're there is

570
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:06,300
for their salary they don't care about what they're teaching and the ones that do are promptly

571
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:13,660
removed promptly meet within two weeks to six months so again the central you you're not going to

572
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:18,700
defeat the central powers that have been granted cosmically the power that they have over the

573
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:26,540
earth which is they're basically to promote evil and chaos and violence and ignorance to a society

574
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:33,900
that adheres to such things and not just one society all societies too and the ones that there are

575
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:41,020
some microcosm type societies of maybe on some island in the Pacific that do not adhere to such principles

576
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:46,220
or some jungle somewhere that are isolated and they're kept isolated and they're at a minimum

577
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:53,740
and for good reason you'd want to you know it's called setting yourself apart from it

578
00:57:53,740 --> 00:58:00,220
you know unfortunately we don't have enough knowledge to know the reason why humans are in such a

579
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:05,180
state that they are but we do know that we can gain the knowledge to know that they are in this such a

580
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:14,700
state. Well I think we'll wrap up with this last bit here as far as people being in a particular

581
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:20,780
state that can be observed when we want to talk about getting out of that state you can't turn to

582
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:25,420
the mainstream media because what they're pushing is outright lies and you can't really use the

583
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:31,020
multimedia too much because of the quality of people that are running it and what their own personal

584
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:36,220
agendas are so what has been your own personal experience as far as uncovering the information

585
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:44,300
that you need. Well you can use it you can use the meat both media again like we said earlier on

586
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:50,140
whatever the mainstream says it's probably the opposite but not directly like I gave the analogy

587
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:55,820
of the two the cost of the two items together and how much one is more than the other what is the other

588
00:58:55,820 --> 00:59:03,900
cost right. So for example I've given other analogies in the past regarding the media whatever they're

589
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:12,220
making a lot of noise about is to cover up where the real stuff is going on so you see so you can

590
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:18,300
use them if you understand the code that it's being presented in and the alternative media is just

591
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:24,540
more of the same it's basically an echo chamber they're just an echo chamber of what needs to be viewed

592
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:31,340
at diametrically opposite or resolved somehow. So for example you could take any story that's being

593
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:35,740
repeated in the mainstream media you'll see it'll be repeated in the alternative media and that'll

594
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:40,380
tell you several things it's most likely the opposite of that and it's most likely covering up

595
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:48,060
for something that shouldn't be noticed. So you can use them. Sure by applying discernment but I

596
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:53,260
guess I was more talking about you've mentioned being able to make use of other media resources like

597
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:58,140
libraries for example or ancient text for example or things like that like as far as your own

598
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:05,580
personal initiative to educate yourself. Sure you can yeah and just use the principle of going

599
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:12,460
back to the beginning of this thing. Cool well on that note I think that we've covered everything

600
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:18,140
that I wanted to cover is there anything else that you have on your mind Greek? Not yet I'd say

601
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:24,700
well maybe we'll pick it up on the next stream. Okay well on that note I think that we'll end

602
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:30,700
things off and thank you to everybody for listening it's been a good you know hour and some minutes of

603
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:41,100
talk and we'll see you at the next stream.
