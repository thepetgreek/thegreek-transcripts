00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,680
Hello to everyone tuned into this episode of the Greekspeak podcast.

2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,360
I'm the Archon creator of Greekspeak.com and this is episode 6 of my talks with my co-host

3
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,760
the Greek.

4
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,480
We have yet another hour or so of conversation before us and I hope to make it as engaging

5
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,000
as possible.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,120
If you have yet to catch up to speed with previous episodes you can do that on the podcast

7
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,160
page on Greekspeak.com where there are free downloads as well.

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,080
I've decided to retire the live stream chat room so there won't be any further possibility

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,840
of posting anything there during streams but feel free to use the general chat if anyone

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,000
has any questions about anything Greek speak related and as always Greekspeak.com has

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,440
no political religious or commercial affiliations as it's a personal project that's managed

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,440
by myself.

13
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,040
And that's it for the introduction.

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,320
Please enjoy the rest of the show and thanks again for listening.

15
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:24,720
Hi there Greek.

16
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,760
Hi greetings.

17
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,080
How have you been faring since the last stream?

18
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,160
Oh fairly well you know you say no political religious or whatever affiliations you want

19
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,640
to run run run away from those things.

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,520
Go in the opposite direction.

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,520
But anyway.

22
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,360
No I figured that.

23
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
I mean it wouldn't.

24
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,360
I wouldn't mind having some financial support but I'll generate that myself.

25
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:56,520
Yeah well the financial support is interesting because you know it's a credit based economy

26
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:03,840
people don't know that those that do know get about it get more confused people who don't

27
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,920
know about it are confused nonetheless so yeah food clothing and shelter indeed.

28
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,760
Well at least for this week I mean I think that we'll have ample time to dig into food clothing

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,520
and shelter in future episodes but for this week we have the topic of science although

30
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,400
I'm somewhat limited in that field thanks to my useless secondary school education it's

31
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,760
something that I know the Greek to be quite learned in so I'm going to perhaps rely a little

32
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,400
more than usual on the Greeks capacity for explaining things on this episode but I'm

33
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,280
sure you'll carry that load just fine.

34
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,580
So let's start with what the word science actually means and how that word has come to represent

35
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:49,120
something quite embellished and sometimes misleading given its etymology it comes from the Latin

36
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,520
word ciencia meaning knowledge or expertness but probably had the original meaning of to

37
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,760
separate one thing from another or to distinguish and then by the 18th century we get the modern

38
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,160
sense of the word as referring to knowledge gained from methodical observation of a subject

39
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,120
so Greek what is your studies about the history or origins of science revealed to you about

40
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,280
its evolutions over the centuries or millennia.

41
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,480
Well again how the word is being used like for example there's political science right

42
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,240
whilst people are off degrees in that and you know when you say the word science you think

43
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,080
of state of the art and technology and you know physical know how and we'll get into

44
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:37,080
why physical know how later but the term science of course just like any term is used very

45
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,280
loosely and to the you know the common pedestrian it means you know usually something they're

46
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,000
either intimidated by have been propagandized to think that they know something about

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,720
and also the third part dare I say it's become sort of a religion with its adherence and

48
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:59,360
priests and altars to be worshipped and you know useless debates and even further more importantly

49
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,600
useless information.

50
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,640
Well certainly that is the modern day landscape of that but if we look historically that did

51
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,480
take its root from somewhere that you know people often uphold this like the golden standard

52
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,800
of the inquisitive mind of people that you know pondered and looked into things that were

53
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,960
hitherto unknown.

54
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,960
We don't know much about that time other than what we have let's say written that's been

55
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:30,040
allowed to be published and I'll say that as a preface the reason why is you know roughly

56
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:38,640
and let's say around the 13 to 1500s the idea of having a centralized ruling body over the

57
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,280
entire planet for those for example who live in the West you know so Columbus discovered

58
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,240
America well it's a ridiculous statement on its face and it's a ridiculous even more

59
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,200
ridiculous when you research there was any discovery being done as in terms of finding something

60
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,480
new.

61
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,480
The entire world was always known to let's say those that were interested in the information

62
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
was there.

63
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:08,920
The term discovery is a legal term which means to bring you know jurisdiction over so when

64
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,600
you consider the political aspect or the aspect to control let's say the planet through

65
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:24,280
from a central location it had its purpose to all control right so not only control the

66
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,800
what they call nations as territories and such but also control the goings on and the

67
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,080
first goings on would be something called industry so you have industry that as we know

68
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,480
today that pretty much only can go back as far as that time period let's say 500 years

69
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:48,400
ago and what we call science today is based hand in hand to promote that form of industry

70
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,400
which is also part of that control system so what this really means is if we go prior

71
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:02,560
to that 500 year period we know very little about what was known because it's just not

72
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,400
brought forward so what we do know is you know from a philosophical perspective from an

73
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,120
observational experimental perspective and again it always ties into some form of industry

74
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:20,360
like for example if you look at someone who was talented in many fields like Da Vinci

75
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,680
90% of his work that we know of other than some art pieces were all basically commissions

76
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:32,920
by industrialists and bankers so all of his work that we you know glorify him as a scientist

77
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,640
to quote unquote and the term scientist is a very recent one by the way they were natural

78
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:44,100
philosophers these things were all based around the industry of the time and going back to

79
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:51,560
500 years or so we can call that a form of cultural censorship you know I would agree that

80
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:58,720
would be a good pretty accurate term so what we know now about science is stemming from

81
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,680
that industrial cultural censorship that started 500 years ago and the rest of that would

82
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,200
pretty much be going back and pondering what the ancient Egyptians wrote about the Babylonian

83
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:17,760
Samarians and the Greeks for ancient knowledge of it and it contrasts very starkly to what

84
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,960
people consider to be science today.

85
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,240
I hear what you're saying and yeah I think that provides us with a good platform moving

86
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,240
forward we'll develop some of those points as things go on.

87
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,640
When we talk about science quote unquote I think it's worth distinguishing its methodologies

88
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:40,320
like the scientific method from the institutions of science which are managed by academia

89
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,640
and oftentimes careerist scientists so on one hand you have an objective mode of inquiry

90
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,720
into the natural world and on the other hand you have a collection of disciplines like

91
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,360
physics and biology and they make very specific assumptions about how the natural world is

92
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,680
constituted which amounts to an ideology really that sometimes gets called scientism what

93
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,160
has been your experience with this quote unquote scientism Greek and what kinds of interactions

94
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,680
of you had with scientists who have a blind devotion to that.

95
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,000
Well it's a sign of the times of culture and society worldwide society and decline these

96
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,520
are basically these quote unquote institutions don't do the scientific method it's all

97
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,760
predetermined to pretty much support all the systems that are in place like for example

98
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,600
people that operate what I call a motorized engine driven wagon or automobile or car you

99
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,320
know why are they still burning gas in it at the almost the same rate of efficiency as

100
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:41,440
a hundred years ago you know chemical rockets to you know an airplane to go up into the

101
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,080
sky basically medicine that is based on battlefield medicine because you know the worst

102
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:54,480
thing for an army is an injured injured troop so you know the medicine they have is subpar

103
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,880
also and not changed much all of the fields are like that nutrition you know I mean astrophysics

104
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:07,800
all this stuff is based on a subpar point of view of maintaining what seems to be progress

105
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,000
and really is not but maintaining the systems that are already in place my experience with

106
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,320
it is the the only scientific method that is being performed is someone in their kitchen

107
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,360
or someone in their garage or a very very small lab of let's say a multitude of just three

108
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,400
people working but once you go beyond that into what's called corporate or a university

109
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,400
study there is no scientific method it's all the predetermined result and experiment structured

110
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:40,240
to lead to that result it's backwards now that's why a little backup of this is if you actually

111
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,200
take a hint I assure you you go online which is your easiest way to access a lot of current

112
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,920
information and I assure you 99.999999% of all the new research if you look at the authors

113
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,400
and where it's being done it's being done in some undergraduate or graduate college lab

114
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,400
with a bunch of snotty 18 19 or 20 year olds basically don't know anything they still

115
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:09,160
wet in the crotch right and they don't know anything and this is what they're putting

116
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,000
forward I mean this is ridiculous and when you look at a lot of their experiments it's

117
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,720
a bunch of like acrylic roughly cut and glued together with silicone I mean it's just

118
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:24,600
they're just mocking society you know so and the people love it you know they that's why

119
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,800
there's no you know Barnum and Bailey circus the circus here in America what no longer exists

120
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,080
because you have these these scientific morons to do it for you but people don't see it

121
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,640
as such and just like any religion the people just do it because it's it's what everyone

122
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,580
else does they don't question it again they're the only site from my experience the only

123
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:51,700
real science that's being done is on the on the individual level someone who has a discreet

124
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:57,220
desire in a particular discreet field and does it on their own you're not going to get

125
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:04,380
anything from any any establishment anymore there what you will get from the establishment

126
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,060
those about done all the grunt work is basically a lot of reference material you know you want

127
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:14,020
the melting point of this or the boiling point of that or you know what certain you know

128
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,580
basic parameters are and that's it pretty much a reference manuals but the rest of it is pretty

129
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:26,100
much junk and you know most people are confused about industrialization and miniaturization

130
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,300
as being scientific and it's not you know most of the devices today that seem to do a lot more

131
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,500
than they did years ago or operate in a higher level of efficiency in some cases are is

132
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,700
mistaken as the progress of science and it's not it is actually the implementation of advanced

133
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:52,380
miniaturization so again it's nothing specific to the field of quote unquote science or learning

134
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:58,380
what you know things that we associate with science are but it's actually the state of a society

135
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,620
and decline at worldwide society and decline if you're going to view it from a personal you know

136
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:10,580
experiential perspective I mean there certainly is a lot that one has to reconcile to assimilate

137
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,580
what you just said because people judge with their eyes and when they look around and they look

138
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:20,020
at the society that seemingly seems to be filled with technological marvels it doesn't compute that

139
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:25,460
science has not provided that so if you go into any establishment and make the claims that you're

140
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:30,020
saying they're going to point to the society around you and say well how would you like if we

141
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:36,500
didn't have all these things well because we do it's a it's it's not a matter of if we didn't have

142
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:45,220
all these things because we do right so there there's a lot of you know other allegory about that you

143
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:51,060
know if well what if this and what if that no it's just what is and what we do have is just wasteful

144
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:58,340
you know at this rate in less than maybe a few two or three or four generations a good portion

145
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:04,660
of usable land will be landfill because it's still a throwaway planned obsolescence industrial

146
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,820
aspect in the motive again is profit and the in the irony and the paradox here is there is no money

147
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,220
so how can there be a profit so if there is no money and there really is no profit because it's all

148
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:26,420
private credit it's about just a society in decline sorry simple now when most things go into a state

149
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,460
of decline or right up to the precipice where they will decline are usually at a maximum point

150
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:37,140
like if you let an inflated balloon out into the room by opening you know a creating an

151
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,780
orifice that the air can come out you'll notice it when it's fully inflated it just buzzes around

152
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:46,820
the room real slow but as it comes to the point where it's going to be completely deflated and use

153
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:53,300
and fall to the floor it starts moving faster and faster and it's louder and louder if you look at

154
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:59,300
any aspect of industry or any industry in the past that has that is no longer around let's say

155
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:04,660
while when we're recording this podcast you'll see that it reached its peak right before it's

156
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:11,860
to climb and I'm suggesting here that society is at a certain peak and they are within the system

157
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:18,980
that exists because if you actually just to go back to you know the topic if you actually look

158
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:24,180
at what they're putting forward is science it's actually all theory very little of it is purported

159
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:30,660
to be fact other than reference materials and even a lot of the reference materials are spurious

160
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,940
meaning that they're subject to change but but generally the the the aspect of everything being a

161
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,300
theory and then if you look at the theories they're just a patently ridiculous you know like

162
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,980
everything being a particle you know even magnets have particles that create a quote unquote

163
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:53,140
attraction and repulsion and light is a particle you know photon which I like to spell FAU X

164
00:14:53,700 --> 00:15:01,860
to in for those that understand the French word FAU X anyway this is patently ridiculous with

165
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:08,900
their putting in front of as being the science in the scientific community and as much to speak

166
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:14,900
about there's a lot of criticism and I don't mean for this to be a strictly critical podcast of it

167
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:21,940
because it's put it this way so what I see as being scientific is so worthless these days that

168
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:27,140
it's not even worth criticizing just sweep it to the side if you want to learn about how to

169
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:32,340
criticize what they're putting out is being patently ridiculous and obscene and untrue there's

170
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:38,020
plenty of stuff on the internet you could research maybe we want might want to lay down a little bit more

171
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:43,940
of what is really going on that you don't need a special lab or a special training and you could

172
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:48,660
actually see what you're on eye and prove is being reality as part of what people call science

173
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:55,140
yes we will certainly look at specific concepts later on in the stream but just to stick with the

174
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:00,660
historic aspect a little bit I think that through the process of what became known as the scientific

175
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:06,020
revolution in the 16th and 17th centuries you had science becoming one of the pillars of the

176
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,820
modern age but I'm curious as to how that came to pass given that every movement has its

177
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:16,420
detractors and I don't think that the these sort of irrationalities that you speak of that are

178
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:22,340
present in the dogmas of scientism would have gone ignored at that time so on one hand you have the

179
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:29,140
sort of typical Galileo renaid discartus and Darwin's whose theories about things like empiricism or

180
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,860
evolution became canonized but you also had the romantic poets and the natural philosophers of that

181
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:38,500
time like William Wood'sworth for example who opposed those things and we don't really hear a lot

182
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,740
about them what do you know about the pushback that the scientific revolution received?

183
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:49,540
they had no choice I mean there were riots there were small I would say minor and I would say major

184
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,740
riots in many urban environments when things like evolution and particle physics and later on

185
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:00,260
you know quantum was brought out but that these people who were you know the day card or even

186
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,860
Newton to a certain degree and all the way through let's say the late 19th century Tesla

187
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:12,100
you know if you look up what Tesla had to say about Einstein and this is I know not the 16th or 17th

188
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:17,300
century but they you have to realize that their opposition means nothing because they weren't the

189
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:23,460
ones funding and putting the the power behind the or the drive behind the research once they

190
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:28,180
those that are funding them let's say or the powers that their political powers are working under

191
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:33,300
decide that they're going to put in place a ridiculous system you know like evolution or whatever

192
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,940
an evolution is not new that that goes back to ancient Egypt where the pharaohs was written

193
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,820
there's still writings found that the pharaohs told the people they evolved from slime from the

194
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:49,380
Nile there's nothing new about that it's actually internally known by certain secret societies that's

195
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:55,140
what you tell the people as a prank but but here's the the interesting aspect about this this whole

196
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,180
thing about science is it and it's not about what I'm going to say now which I started with it's

197
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:06,740
all political in other words most of the people look for example there are people this is why

198
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,780
their psychology and psychiatry there are people who have made incredible discoveries and were

199
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:18,500
were stunted and prevented from developing them through quote unquote psychiatry and psychology

200
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:26,740
and propaganda right there's lots of evidence of that anyone could look up the uh but before I give

201
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,780
references which I don't think that's the point just think of this as a cognitive point of view

202
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,060
that there are more systems put in place under the name of science and which is really

203
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:44,980
scientism uh to fort development of the field in its natural reality versus its theoretical

204
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:52,820
aspect so uh going back to the 16th and 17th century we're looking at a mercantile system that was

205
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:59,860
still uh usually in generally pre-powered driven ship right there was uh very little if none

206
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:06,980
air travel airship there were airships back then and not just hot air balloons my point here is that

207
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:13,540
the mercantile system reflected the progress allowed to the scientific community when

208
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:19,380
when it was time to change the mercantile system it was time to change the scientific community

209
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:25,380
and when it was time to seriously embed and solidify a certain mercantile system then the science

210
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,180
was changed to the point where no one can apply that new science to produce anything new because

211
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:35,300
it was so ridiculous and that left a mercantile system or an industrial system as you have today

212
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:40,420
in place unchanged if you look at what they call the automobile the jet airplane electricity as

213
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:46,500
it's used this you know in the past hundred years so again you know we're trying to have a podcast

214
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:53,700
or a discussion about science and you cannot avoid through the ages especially from 500 years on

215
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,820
that it is hand in hand and interlaced and interlinked and controlled by the political interests or

216
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:04,260
the power interests the oligarchs and you know the secret rulers of the world they're the ones that

217
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:09,060
decide what's put out just like they decide which religion stays or goes which religion is supported

218
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:15,380
and so on and so forth right and and it has to also be custom tailored to each culture

219
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:21,700
so you know you'll have certain cultures that are more advanced technologically like for example

220
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:27,620
the Japanese and Germans all throughout history have been very advanced in that it was part of

221
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:33,780
their culture to be advanced in in mechanization and research and things like that and then for

222
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,620
example if you go to the African continent down by the southern part of the continent

223
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,020
the whole grouping of countries there that if you even go there today they're living almost identical

224
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:47,380
to how they were two thousand years ago so it's also a cultural aspect you have to examine

225
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:54,260
hmm yeah that's quite interesting I'd never given that too much thought but I see what you mean

226
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:03,780
right so it's it's it's not it's very difficult to answer a question within the topic about the topic

227
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:11,620
because there are so many external influences that that pose the direction of science

228
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:19,940
into a certain posture that no one admits is acting upon what we what is called the body of work

229
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:26,660
as science but it is notably there you see and that is the political quote unquote money control

230
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,780
power and military and industrial interests always in control what and this is exactly what the

231
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:37,460
public is showing is what we're discussing we're not discussing specifics now because I can give

232
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:44,100
like an example anyone can look up there was a NIMS a group NYMCA who is a group of Prussians

233
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:54,500
Germans let's say from the late 1700s to the late 1890s that worked on aero space in the Sonora region

234
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,140
of California they didn't do it in Europe they came here to do it in America let's say and they

235
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:05,060
had airships that flew at a hundred to three hundred miles per hour against the wind and they were

236
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:11,700
not how hot air balloons and this is going on over two hundred years ago right Abraham Lincoln

237
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:21,220
was given a demonstration of this and he said publicly no publicly so we're we're speaking on

238
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:28,820
the general cultural science that people understand and then maybe we'll speak on the real science

239
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:35,620
you know there have been quote unquote inventors developers researchers throughout all time have

240
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:41,060
developed things that even now would be difficult to imagine for that time and that is another

241
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:47,620
discussion or maybe we can sort of integrate that into what we're discussing about science and

242
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:53,140
again why aren't these things you know why aren't we we're told about quote unquote anti-gravity

243
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:58,580
propulsion from the early 1800s now it it exists it's very easy to evidence this

244
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:04,260
all right everyone thinks oh hot air balloons and the right brothers you know came later and

245
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:10,020
let's balloony it's funny that the one of the people in the NIMS a group I've found some notes

246
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:18,740
from the 1850s in late 1800s or early 19th 20th century they called airplanes sky lubricators I

247
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,300
thought that was really funny and and the reason why they call that I'm presuming is because they're

248
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:28,420
full of oil you know the airplanes you know they use oil driven petroleum driven so obviously

249
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,340
they're going to be leaking oil and exhaust and they were lubricating the sky that's all they

250
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:41,460
did they always poked fun if that stuff right so yeah there's you know there's an aspect to

251
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:48,180
are we going to discuss you know the real physicality of our existence and you know non-physicality

252
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:56,180
which also affects they're actually predominant and primary to the physical or we can discuss you

253
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:01,540
know more what people think is science which is absolute rubbish and I see absolute rubbish because

254
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:08,020
if you don't believe that you're still using inefficient things in your house and in what's

255
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:14,020
called a car airplane it's all junk rocket science is junk that's a thousand-year-old technology

256
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:21,620
and you're just you know because it's a culture and decline so let's look at the the idea of

257
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,420
the scientist today's definition of a scientist as you've sort of mentioned was uncommon until

258
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:31,620
a few hundred years ago you know the 19th century probably prior to that point you had natural

259
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,260
philosophers as the ones who were striving to understand the physical world and if you go back

260
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,980
even further to ancient Greece and Rome I believe the word used is the physicist for someone who

261
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,900
is doing that yeah so you have a book by a guy called Antistheans which is called Physicus and they

262
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:52,660
translated as natural philosophy accordingly what do you know about the role of that that character

263
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:57,860
in how they conceptualize the world at that time well they came for it depends on which school I'm

264
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:03,460
not very familiar with that particular one but there were various schools that were even pre-pigarian

265
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:10,020
you know if you look at the entire grouping the famous Greek philosophers if you go back to the

266
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,660
the older ones you know they you had the ones that said well everything came from water

267
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:19,220
then you had other ones that said well everything came from the ether right then you had another

268
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,020
one that said everything came from duality right and then another one that said that everything is a

269
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:30,980
representation of something in a heavenly realm more platonic let's say right so they're various

270
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:36,580
schools are they're actually they're all right and they're all wrong see when you say something

271
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:42,420
like everything came from water which I tend to believe in a very strong sense because when you

272
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:47,620
start researching with water you'll see that you can create anything in water pretty much and I

273
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:52,580
mean that and also how water is created during a thunderstorm it doesn't come out of the air or out

274
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:59,780
of the cloud it's a very easy thing to postulate and lead a good experimentation on but I wouldn't say

275
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:05,460
that it's strictly so because you know we haven't taken it to to the realm where we could prove that

276
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:11,140
but I would say that all of them are correct in some aspect then all of them are incorrect in the

277
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:17,060
aspects that we've been shown I would say that when you say physics or physics the Greek

278
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:23,460
word is feces not that not as the way it sounds in English word but it means nature and what is

279
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:27,140
nature I mean again you know we could play around with the need toers the word nature comes from

280
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:34,500
the need toer which just means god in Egypt in Egyptian ancient Egyptian not the modern Arabic so

281
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:44,260
I would say that to go back into those days is to see not just from a philosophical standpoint what

282
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:50,580
they brought what is brought forward to our time now is but what experimental or strictly

283
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:56,260
directly let's say what directly relates to what we can perceive now because a lot of the

284
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:04,820
philosophers were making just allegorian points that you know were were analogies and you know ways

285
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:10,740
to perceive things but did they have anything that is experimental see the experimentation is

286
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:16,820
paramount in the scientific method right so anyone could look up what the scientific method is and

287
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:26,100
it it requires experimentation and repeatability and again that because of that it's very easy to

288
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:32,660
prevent in a society that is in its downward stages for that to take hold right because in other

289
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,900
in other words to do good science now you're going to have to do experiments and have repeatability

290
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,380
and because of the way technology and communication works now that could be nipped in the

291
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:49,540
bud very easily by restricting access to things to experiment with and also when people communicate

292
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,180
what they're doing it'll be intercepted and of course if any group tries to form it shut down

293
00:27:54,180 --> 00:28:00,660
first they you know ridiculed and shut down so again it's not happy times from that perspective

294
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:06,020
this was also going on in ancient Greece by the way if you brought up the Greek philosopher there was

295
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:14,580
a lot of suppression I had seen a document once where there was a it was basically an unfinished

296
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:24,340
or a partial script about someone who had been arrested by the Athenian authorities because

297
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:30,340
the markets would not function when he came out and they didn't have refrigeration so if you

298
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:35,940
were a fisherman or whatever had meat you know it would spoil so the all the merchants got together

299
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:42,100
and pressed the government there the policing authorities to arrest this man because whenever he

300
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:47,540
came out he the markets would shut down and all this merchandise had to be thrown away it turns out

301
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:54,660
that he had a horseless wagon with thunder and lightning and coming out of it and smoke you would

302
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,820
bring out this device which was a horseless carriage and it had a a spiritual kutti which means a

303
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:05,380
fire box on it where smoke and thunder and lightning came out of it and a lot of smoke and it made

304
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:10,180
a lot of noise and the people wouldn't leave their homes to go to market so they had to arrest

305
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:14,180
this guy because the markets were shutting down because of this guy right? Oh so you were scared of

306
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:21,300
the way yeah he was scaring people away yeah and this is about 150 BC 200 BC.

307
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:27,940
So curious yeah yeah it's not on the internet this was at a university library it's the frequent and

308
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:32,500
they said look we got some interesting stuff here we found in a garbage dump in Libya

309
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:38,420
you know landfills yeah Libya was a it was a Greek and then Italian colony you know people don't

310
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:45,860
know that Libya was an Italian colony up until 1950s right? So what's interesting is you know it was

311
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:49,060
found in a landfill you know I was actually having discussion on someone this morning if you have a

312
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,860
landfill and you press something down hard enough and it's anaerobic of instable temperature it will

313
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:59,540
not decay even if it's paper and it will just will not decay thousands of years will go by so

314
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:06,660
yeah interesting stuff so in other words what I just gave a story of was a form of suppression

315
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:14,020
from 200 BC in the Greek society right? And this is a single example of many

316
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:20,260
yes there is suppression but it's not a suppression for the sake of developing something new in advanced

317
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:28,660
it's the sake suppression for the sake of it disturbing what's in place. Change is the enemy of the

318
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:33,060
oligarch in other words the small group of people that own the planet yes you heard me right and they

319
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:38,580
did it legally just like people say oh that's illegal or illegal who cares if it's legal illegal is

320
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:44,180
it lawful? Well ultimately you could say it's lawful because once you get someone to legally agree to

321
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,180
be a slave whether they know it or not it doesn't matter well then it becomes lawful so they actually

322
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:56,100
lawfully hold the planet right now they don't want any change because in order for the people that

323
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:03,140
run the world and own the world by the way there's no nation states anymore all that's a lie just

324
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:09,940
like Santa Claus the people that they had to put into motion with great investment a tremendous

325
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:16,180
amount of radical change to get it this way you see so they don't want any more change once they get

326
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:23,220
to that position to get back to the topic though I do want to contrast a little bit more this idea of

327
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:29,220
the modern scientist and the sort of ancient natural philosopher because there exists within academia

328
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:34,420
this imperative to view science as the vehicle that takes mankind towards quote unquote progress

329
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:39,380
and the things which belong to the past particularly the pre 17th century traditions are

330
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:45,540
irrational and so the implication is that ancient man and even middle age man were at best uninformed

331
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:50,500
or at worst stupid because their methods of comprehending the world were un thorough or superstitious

332
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:56,500
but when I look at the various disciplines within science and I look at what ancient man accomplished

333
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,900
I don't see a lot of modern equivalents like for example within chemistry there is no equivalent to

334
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:06,820
the Greek fire if you look at biology a lot of the depictions of ancient man whether it's drawings

335
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:12,260
or cave paintings or whatever else they always look more robust and physically capable than modern man

336
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:18,180
with their biological developments so my question is that how should a person's understanding of

337
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:26,580
ancient man and civilizations be revised in light of that you had a level of independence honor and

338
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:33,620
other things that were going on back then if you were not a slave like for example if you have a

339
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:41,860
thousand people in a room thousand men in a room 999 are slave and one is not how many men are in the room

340
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:47,780
it was only one that 999 are not counted as men they're slaves

341
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:56,020
do you understand what I mean by that yeah absolutely okay so when they say we the people and let's

342
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:02,580
say the American side or they say for mankind they you have to specify because if again if you have

343
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:08,660
one million slaves and two and one million men that are slaves and two that are not there's only two

344
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:15,380
people in the room you see so this is I just gave up part of the code when you when you look at your

345
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:20,260
media your science your education when you receive oh that sounds so altruistic for mankind they when

346
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:24,980
they say they're not talking about you they're talking about maybe a handful of people on the planet

347
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:30,180
yeah I saw a trailer by the way recently on a movie called the hunt someone sent me a link

348
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:34,660
and you know they're basically hunting people right because it was you know hunting boars and deer and

349
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:40,020
you know Africans so far he's got you know it's not interesting enough let's hunt people so they

350
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,980
abducted people and started hunting them was this premise of the story and they said but but you

351
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:50,500
know you're killing people and then then you know one of the prognosis of caters or whatever she says

352
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:57,620
they're not people right that went over everyone's head of course because it's not taught how do

353
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:03,860
you people are not taught how to think that way about reality so when you hear about man advancing man

354
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:11,060
even in in ancient Greece 99% of the population were slave so yeah I don't know about the number but

355
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:18,580
yes there was a significant slave population given that there isn't to my knowledge as a singular

356
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:24,100
corpus of records about ancient inventions or scientific developments what would you say are

357
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:30,100
some of the individual feats that can be singled out as extraordinary from ancient times oh well

358
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,900
it's the same knowledge we have today they they understood hydraulics they understood electricity

359
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:42,900
not in the way that we have popularized the understanding now but they everything that we

360
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:52,340
have access to scientifically is is also was accessed by them based on the their ability to travel

361
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:57,540
on what they had access to from my understanding of what I've seen it was very rare to be able to

362
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:02,180
access immediate communication like you know you and I are in different parts of the world right now

363
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:07,860
we're having a conversation back then to cover a thousand miles you needed four or five hours

364
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:14,500
you know by either you used signaling all right visual signaling to relay messages across the planet

365
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:21,460
so you could probably get a message across the planet within a day or two but now it's instant

366
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:28,740
so within that you creates a lot of inconvenience when you don't have that rapid ability to go from

367
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:33,380
place to place or communicate from place to place so it kind of limits to what you have within

368
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:38,580
your own culture or within your own geography but otherwise it's pretty much the same

369
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:45,220
this thing about as far as the the current day existence I mean in spite of

370
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:51,220
whatever polemics that you can throw at the current landscape or applications of science and the

371
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:56,180
teachings of academia like I said before one does have to contend with the physical reality where

372
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:00,980
we have a fully functioning consumer society that has been erected and it stood pretty robustly

373
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:06,420
so for the past 70 years or so and so we can talk about fake science and the institutions that

374
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,020
pedal it and then the average person will say well the consumer existence seems to work so well

375
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:17,700
and yet you're saying that it's trash which implies that far beyond this consumer reality that we've

376
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:23,940
been put in there is a different manifestation of what things could be do we have any society

377
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:28,260
throughout history that has given an indication of that of what that could be if it wasn't if we

378
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:34,340
weren't peddling fake science no there isn't much man man is living in an age the grand age I call it

379
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:42,900
of a certain level of apathy we're talking about in general sense like I give you an example regarding

380
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:48,340
that you could speak to any older person now meaning you know white hair and what people consider

381
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:55,300
to be the grandma grandpa level and when you bring up anything that of concern for future generations

382
00:36:55,300 --> 00:37:00,900
they always say there are very few exceptions I haven't seen much but they'll always say well

383
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:06,740
it doesn't matter because I'm not going to be alive in 10 years for that right or 10 years or I'm

384
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:10,980
not going to be alive then so it does I don't care and these are the people you're going to for

385
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:17,780
wisdom and knowledge right so they're telling you just be apathetic do you see what I mean so one

386
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:24,100
of the tools of the age is to instill a level of apathy and that's where the consumerism comes in

387
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:33,620
for example and the the aspect of when I say consumerism by the way I don't use that term independently

388
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:41,620
when I say consumerism I mean planned obsolescence and waste right just the sign of the age you

389
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:46,900
let's go back to ancient Greece you know that you could look at statistics a fairly good geological

390
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:53,380
and agricultural statistics and places like Greece in Italy are 90% deforested over the past 2000

391
00:37:53,380 --> 00:38:00,260
years let me say that again a lot of these great cultural havens of society you know like well

392
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:06,740
Western Europe or whatever or about 90% deforested I mean don't you think it would be a concern when

393
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:12,420
you're at about 25% deforested meaning not that it's all forest but you've lost 25% of your forest

394
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:17,940
and it's not re-growing you see and I'm not talking about urban sprawl or developments for people to

395
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:26,500
live talking about just wanton destruction you know what point do you are you at 50% deforestation

396
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:31,700
where you say we have to conserve or re- you know help regrow it you know how do you let it get to 90

397
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:38,340
percent it just doesn't sound rational right so when you look at anything let's say a

398
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:44,900
analogous to today this is going off the topic of science but generally includes it as well

399
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,780
if you took the news of the world today and put it in went back a hundred years it would stop the entire

400
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:54,500
society and everyone would stop no matter who you were and said we have to change right now so these

401
00:38:54,500 --> 00:39:00,500
things don't happen in the future because you have gradualism that takes over and I don't know how

402
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:05,380
many ways or how many times one can say that you're living if you're hearing this and you're alive

403
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:10,340
you're living in a society in decline and so it usually takes anywhere between 50 to 100 years

404
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:15,700
for society to go into decline and then another hundred or so for it to pretty much not resemble

405
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:22,820
what it ever did before so just to address that point real quick because I think that the layman

406
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:29,860
would hear what you're saying about people not reacting appropriately to the state of distress

407
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:35,220
of the environment or the planet and say well isn't that what people are talking about climate

408
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:39,220
change I mean they're perfectly happy to march in the streets and donate millions of dollars to

409
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,220
questionable charities and pontificate in the media about climate change and we need to do something

410
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:48,180
in blah blah blah so there is some kind of outcry against what people perceive as being a threat to

411
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:54,260
the planet no the outcry means nothing if you don't give a proposal of how you're going to do it

412
00:39:54,260 --> 00:40:01,460
and just by simply saying for example eliminating gasoline cars when they say that for example

413
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:08,500
you know automobiles to fort climate change because the automobiles let's say is a leading cause of it

414
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:15,140
if you go to the manufacturers let's say and make suggestions on how to increase efficiency they

415
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:23,540
don't want to listen so whenever you see a problem being posed with a very desperate all or nothing

416
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:31,620
solution it's BS it's propaganda because nothing works that way you know it's kind of like I'm building

417
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:36,980
a house I call the lumber company and they're sending over 2,000 pieces of wood and I'm going to

418
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:42,020
push this button in the house will be erected it doesn't work that way it's a gradual process to build

419
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:47,940
that house based on a plan see that's what they're basically saying so you know the climate change

420
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:54,260
is below me or BS bullvine excrement because their solution is bullvine excrement so it's all tied in

421
00:40:54,260 --> 00:41:03,060
it's very it's just how to read the code you see I think I heard you also once say that you made

422
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,780
mention in the past of the role of Walt Disney in spreading certain misinformation about scientific

423
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:12,580
concepts because he entrenched those things into the popular imagination through his animations and

424
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:17,700
other media can you talk about that a little bit well it wasn't just Walt Disney there were several film

425
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:24,740
companies from the 30s all the way through the 1970s there's a whole slew of them actually it's a

426
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:30,340
short of 50 maybe film companies and production companies to promote everything from you know

427
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:39,140
how people should get along and to smoking is bad for you to what education what means to be a

428
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:48,100
patriot or you know yeah it's the propaganda machine you know in place again just to keep things in

429
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:55,940
place the there hasn't been any real engineering in the scientific field since the 1920s Eric

430
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:04,100
dollars says that as well and I would find that to be pretty true and the evidence of that is all

431
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:08,740
all around you just because something is a different color and you're told that it's new and it has

432
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:18,500
a new shape it's the same um a flescious theory behind that that this is the state of the art

433
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,820
you know and it is the state of the art from an industrial perspective based on the you know

434
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:28,900
worldview that you know most people have but from from a what's called science and knowledge

435
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:34,820
no it's rubbish and just to clarify for people Eric dollars is sort of independent and venture type

436
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:42,020
that is popular for recreating Tesla experiments um what is this where's the evidence for the

437
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:47,300
Disney thing like where do you just just just go online go to youtube put in Walt Disney in the

438
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:53,780
atomic model big time lot of videos on him showing you oh this is the atom scientists today use the

439
00:42:53,780 --> 00:43:01,620
atom like this oh yeah that's I mean that's how it was brought I read about it as as a critique on

440
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:06,740
maybe about 30 years ago and then with the advent of youtube I looked it up and yep there it is

441
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:11,940
I haven't looked at it in maybe a decade but I'm sure there's something up there about the Walt Disney

442
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:17,300
promoting it just like you know the big bank theory was promoted and started by a Catholic priest

443
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:27,060
right not some quote unquote physicist scientist you know the photon was uh coined by a an occult

444
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:34,820
psychiatrist psychologist not a scientist these people are desperate meaning okay the people

445
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:41,220
that own the planet are quite happy with the way it is and they're quite happy with with the cycle

446
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:47,060
of destruction and you know uh some some it's a creek why would they be doesn't it hurt them too well

447
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:52,020
you ever heard of a crazy person who cuts on themselves right you ever heard of anything like that

448
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:59,700
it's the same thing so uh the the the interesting aspect here is like I've always said set yourself

449
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:05,140
apart from it minimize your interaction with the society as much as possible and provide yourself

450
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,900
good food clothing and shelter and then you will really learn what real science is about

451
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:14,820
yeah I don't think most people are cut out for that but there might be a handful that will take that to heart

452
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:21,860
but let's move on to the second part of of the podcast um which is that um in order to better

453
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:26,340
crystallize how certain concepts within the various scientific fields have been ignored I think

454
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:31,140
we should look at various fields of biology chemistry and physics and pick out some concepts that

455
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,540
if the ruling powers were more honorable and less depraved we'd have been introduced to those

456
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:41,220
perhaps a bit earlier so let's start with you let me yeah I want to interject uh the reason why they

457
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:45,940
seem less honorable is because they're accommodating the people who were no longer honorable

458
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:51,940
they can be honorable even though they're sick and whatever you want to call it you know mentally

459
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:58,020
deranged from any lawful standard uh you you could say that they do understand the concept of honor

460
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:04,100
but it's not promoted within the society because society of human livestock which is property or

461
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:10,660
slave whatever you want to call them chattel livestock citizen whatever you know whatever pick a term

462
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:16,420
you know their property and can people be property don't be shocked you know the answer is yes

463
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:22,420
no they they they do know and and they see here's the interest you know the concept of a test right

464
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:31,460
the test the concept of a test is you pose an individual or someone a problem a question a statement

465
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:39,540
and um you are requiring them or they agreed to require an answer which is either something they come

466
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:45,860
up with themselves or a choice of multiple uh other things to to complete what's called the test

467
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:52,900
you see I just laid out what a test is right and uh the the answer in the reply that's given by the

468
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:58,420
person who's being tested is then measured against a certain references or proofs or facts to show

469
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:05,140
how well they did on the test everything I just said is exactly how society's been run by those who own it

470
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:10,340
they always have given the people you know the livestock that are currently that status of slave or

471
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:15,380
livestock or citizen or subject or resident or whatever they've always been given multiple tests

472
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:22,100
over a long period of time and have failed every time miserably not just a little bit

473
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:30,020
so the state of the condition you have to realize right now might appear dishonorable which it is

474
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:36,980
it's only because the level of failure sustained by those who are being observed and accommodated has

475
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:42,660
been so high that you know how many times have you heard me say they're unrealitatable it's not like

476
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:47,780
someone didn't pass the test go and teach them again so they can pass right or have more favorable

477
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:56,340
results it's just not possible anymore so and yes there are absolutes in the world and that is one of them

478
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:04,660
so um continue I mean yeah my attitude to that has always been like which one is the heart and which

479
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:10,180
one is the horse as far as the people degenerating to a point of not being able to be repaired or the

480
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:15,060
leaders that are supposed to be stewarding the situation like one of them has to go first as far as

481
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:20,180
being depraved and it's hard to see how the people millions of people become depraved whilst the

482
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:24,180
leadership remains honorable and then suddenly the leadership realizes well they're not honorable

483
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:28,900
anymore so we're not going to either there wouldn't be any leadership if it wasn't accommodating

484
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:38,420
the mindset that demanded one uh the ultimate society in any any society is one of law where everyone

485
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:46,180
is well versed in it well known and uh and uh is is uh carries on their their business and their lives

486
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:51,140
accordingly and of course you're going to have glitches and shortcomings and then there have to be

487
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:56,980
systems in there to to write the wrongs and all that but the people don't you know throughout history

488
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:04,980
don't want that right it's very simple you know if you have a thousand page book if you just read

489
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:12,020
three pages a day which is not much to ask for and if you skip a day it six pages the next day okay

490
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:17,700
but just read three pages a day consistently you'll go through it in a year right so if you read 10 pages

491
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:22,740
a day you could do three one thousand page books roughly right so when we're alluding to our various

492
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:27,700
laws of countries and if this is i'm actually pointing this towards doctors and especially attorneys

493
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:33,780
shame on the attorneys all of them not some of them they don't know any law at all they know some

494
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:39,700
some s o m e a little bit of some court procedure but they don't know any law at all other than what

495
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:44,580
they consider as knowing as law what they see on tv there's university doesn't teach any law never

496
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:50,980
did never will and shame on them for not knowing the laws right of their of the agent of the particular

497
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:55,780
corporate body or sovereign state that they supposedly have allegiance to right if you look at the

498
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:59,700
American codes the French codes of British because none of the attorneys know any of them at all

499
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:05,860
and they they have the appearance that they do which is another thing the same thing with the scientists

500
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:09,380
the same thing with the priest to ask them anything out of the bible who'll give you one or two

501
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:16,660
verses out of context doesn't matter if they're a Jewish rabbi a Catholic priest or a Baptist minister

502
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:24,820
or an imam or whatever out of islam this is phenomenon that the lead the people demand an ignorant

503
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,900
leadership because if the leadership was an ignorant they wouldn't be their leaders because they

504
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,380
would look at the people and say these people are repugnant why would i want to lead them

505
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:41,220
so it's a very very interesting situation again from the beginning i said you cannot discern the

506
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:46,100
difference between the current state of the topic with the political or power nature of so you know

507
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:52,260
the nature of a culture in the society they go hand in hand i think it's probably going to be

508
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:57,380
worth dedicating one episode to sort of looking at that dynamic um perhaps the failure of society in

509
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:02,980
that way um but just so that we don't run out of time let's let's start with the looking at biology um

510
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:08,500
i think the most talked about biological concept that the greek has elaborated on in the past is

511
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:13,060
that of the biological vacuum you've talked about before how blood wouldn't be able to flow the way

512
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:18,660
it does it in the circulatory system without um that vacuum in that conventional physics doesn't

513
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:22,980
provide an explanation for how 40 liters of bodily fluid doesn't accumulate in the lower extremities

514
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:29,060
of the body which is what should happen um in a flusky container with liquids um how is it that

515
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:33,060
a hundred years plus of medical practice doesn't address that and can you break it down a bit more

516
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:40,580
oh it's the same year same as if any subject how can a hundred years of of political practice religious

517
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:49,940
practice legal practice uh any practice not show show that it's deficient right uh good religious

518
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:54,740
practice for example the Christians have been around for over a thousand years and uh not one of

519
00:50:54,740 --> 00:51:01,220
them's uh bothers to check and say uh let's see what the bible says about it right same thing with the

520
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:07,060
human body right uh go ahead and mimic a model of the human body and put a you're going to need about

521
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:13,620
1200 horsepower pump to move the body to move uh that amount of fluid uh at that temperature with

522
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:18,900
dissolved solids and semi dissolved solids through twenty five hundred miles or four thousand

523
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:25,540
kilometers of blood vessels average millimeter uh millimeter in diameter it is ridiculous uh and

524
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:30,180
I found out you know the was that the national socialist party gurbals or Hitler the gurbals said

525
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:35,060
if you make a lie it has to be a big lie because if it's such a big lie no one will question it you see

526
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:41,380
so they have blood pressure you know I always ask doctors I even have uh private calls with

527
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:45,620
people that are surgeons with thirty years experience and they ask me the funniest question like

528
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:50,260
well come on greek I heard you say there's no blood pressure uh you know I can't get that around my

529
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:55,060
head I said you better not you better not get that around your head you'll be thrown out on your

530
00:51:55,060 --> 00:52:03,060
ass of course there isn't right so well let's let's break that down then so blood pressure is this

531
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:08,180
positive pressure allegedly that exists with the impossible moves the blood right it's physically

532
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:12,660
impossible it's right and the more physically impossible and the bigger the lie the more people will

533
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:22,580
believe it okay so humor me greek why is it impossible because uh you can't move uh the blood at that

534
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:29,620
temperature with almost 40 percent dissolved solids and semi dissolved solids through um the average

535
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:34,820
blood vessel at one and a half millimeters in the body of four thousand kilometers long you cannot

536
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:40,420
move it it's just impossible will not happen ever and any and any experiment whether it's

537
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:47,540
and here's the interesting thing when they try to view uh how do they view biological uh functioning

538
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:55,380
through things that are dead that's kind of like having a institute to study uh the development

539
00:52:55,380 --> 00:53:03,140
of automobiles and you only go to scrapyards where they've compacted damaged cars do you see what I mean

540
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:09,300
yeah in the sense that they they cut open dead bodies and mostly do experimentation yeah

541
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:14,180
there uh one when the body dies it collapses and it goes into chemical decomposition immediately

542
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:21,380
immediately once uh the there's the onset of of not clinical death but real death where you don't come

543
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:30,980
back right so the the everything is a fiction right and it's a fiction overlap just like when you

544
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:38,100
lay down in bed uh to sleep you you put your put over your body right even in hot weather it you

545
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:43,060
feel you still want to cover yourself with something right and just because you covered yourself it

546
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:47,460
doesn't mean you're not there you're still there it's just that you rest a little more comfortably

547
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:53,060
so what they've done and what is the people of accommodated have been accommodated by is that

548
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:57,940
everything and anything that they think about is has a layer of fiction over it and that's what they

549
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:04,500
look at an example someone laying down uh in their sleeping quarters when you walk in you usually

550
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:08,500
uh look inside the room and you come back out and you say there is sleep well you don't really see

551
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:14,740
them sleeping you usually see a lump on the bed with a sheet over it typically right you don't go

552
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:20,900
examined in the person too much that's the most typical viewpoint of someone sleeping and when you

553
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:26,260
look at people in the society whether it's the scientific field or any field the what you will see

554
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:32,580
is a layer of fiction covering them and uh in big letters it says whatever that fiction happens to be

555
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:38,900
science religion politics whatever it's just a layer of fiction covering the reality now here's

556
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:42,820
the interesting thing just like when you see someone covered in their sleeping quarters on the bed

557
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:50,420
you don't see them you just see the covering uh what happens is um uh you can you you you don't

558
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:57,860
define the person by the covering but you sure act and change your behavior because of it

559
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:03,140
you might be a little quieter right just like for example if you discover that everything in the

560
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:07,940
medical field is a fiction just like everything in the political or legal or religious field is a

561
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:14,100
fiction it might be best not to make a lot of noise and wake up the slumber slumbering masses and

562
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:18,580
because the slumbering masses don't act on themselves they act through third party they're

563
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:23,060
going to call what they consider an authority figure and complain about you do you see my point

564
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:32,180
yes so so that layer of that blanket of fiction should not be disturbed um until you understand to

565
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:39,060
read the signs of a society and even if you did it's not until after they are gone meaning they

566
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:45,700
are no longer in existence their structures their society their culture then you can come out

567
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:52,900
and restructure and rebuild there is no such thing as revolution or change that is effective

568
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:58,820
in this type of society that you're existing in now you know if you said Greek we're going to reduce

569
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:06,020
the population of the planet down to 10 people or 100 people or 10,000 people and there are no attorneys

570
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:12,980
no doctors no priests no rabbis no you're right no scientists you might have a chance

571
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:20,020
right but if you reduce the population down to less than a hundred people and you had an attorney

572
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:25,860
in there a priest a rabbi your screwed you're gonna be in 200 years you'll be back to a population

573
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:31,540
of a billion morons or seven billion morons like you have today you cannot bring anything forward

574
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:40,020
it's called contamination there's a an old book that says you know a small amount of east you know

575
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:46,580
levens the entire lump right you're not we're talking about all of it being yeast right now

576
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:53,060
but what we're trying to do or at least what i'm trying to do is to sort of relieve some of the

577
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:58,900
stink of this bad science by looking at certain particular aspects and if we could accomplish

578
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:02,980
nothing else but sheds a little bit more light on the biological vacuum that'd be great

579
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:09,220
it just happens to be that living things are in a container we typically don't we typically

580
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:15,380
define living things you know insect animal fauna you know plant fauna flora right human you know mammal

581
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:19,860
reptile you know all the various things that we consider alive down a bacteria they happen to be in

582
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:26,500
a container of some sort an outer skin of sorts and sometimes that skin acts as a skeleton

583
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:35,860
structural as well the internal is always slightly internal volume of the container is always in

584
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:44,180
a slightly less pressure than the environment always so questioning that is not the point

585
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:50,900
saying why does it have to be the way that way might be a better question why do we have to have an

586
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:57,140
internal vacuum and that is quickly alluded to once you have the rational several rational answers

587
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,980
to that well because everything else does right so let's just not let's just bypass that

588
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:06,420
because everything that's something that's common in all things that are alive if everything

589
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:11,780
that we perceive as being living it has a slightly less pressure internally than externally

590
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:20,100
and then if you ask why it that is so that that's not necessarily as important as how it's performed

591
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:25,300
because bypass because they all do anyway you see so now how is the biological vacuum maintained

592
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:31,940
now there's where your your research starts not that there is a biological vacuum and why it's

593
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:37,700
there no no it's like how is it maintained because now when you start to look in that from that

594
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:45,380
posture and you lean on how to create the biological vacuum now you start to get into invariably

595
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:51,940
directly and positively or negatively affecting all living things regardless right and you will find

596
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:57,620
that that negative if you continue on this thought that internal vacuum that is maintained by all

597
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:06,020
things that are living is not a physical there is no physical component to it it is a field manifestation

598
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:12,580
it is a certain signature that you find in all yes and all living things but it is not a material

599
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:19,940
component itself yes all the material components experience is let's say that effect but that effect

600
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:25,540
is not a material is it byproduct of other things so let's just stop the thought right there because

601
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:32,660
very often people will say well question well prove to me that water you know is wet well then you

602
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:39,140
might say well you know why is it wet that's not important either is how do things become wet

603
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:45,940
that you can use you see yes I follow you who I'll just wrap up the vacuum thing who is the most

604
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:50,260
responsible for furthering research and publications about the biological vacuum for people that

605
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:55,380
want to look it up no one there hasn't been anything done since victor char burger in the 1930s

606
00:59:55,380 --> 01:00:01,220
because it's too obvious how many books are there about the sky being blue and actually that no

607
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:05,780
one knows they say they actually had spoken to a graduate student in someone of the scientific

608
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:09,780
fields that why is this guy blue is well they told me because it's a reflection of the oceans

609
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:16,340
my professor said right yeah they told me that too yeah it's just the stupidest you know

610
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:22,260
that you're being pranked as a race as as humans on the point you're being I don't know if people

611
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:29,620
really understand the gravity or the gravity of what I just said it's all a prank it's all a prank

612
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:33,700
all the professors are only there because they get a paycheck and they don't even know that there's no

613
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:39,060
money it's it's it's most ridiculous thing now that it doesn't mean that there isn't any real

614
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:45,220
research going on in someone's kitchen or backyard or closet or garage or you know a small

615
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:51,540
a group of people that are you know small meaning less than three that's going on but it doesn't

616
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:55,860
advance and most people don't know about it even with the internet is because it's quickly nipped at the

617
01:00:55,860 --> 01:01:03,140
bud you you will get if you put a YouTube up of a machine running on its own in a in a way that it

618
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:08,020
hasn't been already you will have a knock on the door from the FBI and Homeland Security in America

619
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:14,660
no matter where you are within 24 to 72 hours and they'll send a bunch of guys there with an IQ

620
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,820
of like a door knob and they'll just tell you well you shouldn't be doing this because it's bad for

621
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:25,380
the financial system of the United States that's what they always say this is detrimental to the

622
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:34,260
financial system of the United States that's the the pat line hmm well sounds like somebody

623
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:39,060
knows that for a fact yeah there are plenty of people that know that for a fact but you know it's

624
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:48,180
not a very well-known fact let's also touch on chemistry so the apex of myth of what's possible

625
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:53,300
within chemistry broaches on the work of alchemists where transmutation is the most prominent

626
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:58,500
practice and I think at the lower end of the scale of that lore you have changing metal to gold which

627
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:03,300
the Greek has said before isn't even that extraordinary and then at the higher level of that scale

628
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:07,940
I guess might be the ability to make a substance cycle through various elements within the periodic

629
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:13,460
table can you talk about how transmutation actually works and how it's been sort of ignored sure

630
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:18,020
just for the sake of time and just familiarity I had a conversation a short conversation with someone

631
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:22,980
less than an hour ago actually yes I had turned on the television it was a show it was a

632
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:28,260
recording of something from 40 years ago and there's a discussion of your bones getting calcium

633
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:32,820
and I just laughed and looked at the other person said well you you taking calcium doesn't does not

634
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:39,060
mean that you're going to get calcium because you need magnesium for the body to create calcium you

635
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:45,940
know if you if you are you're told by one of these medical quacks uh that you you're low in potassium

636
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:52,900
you don't take potassium for the body to be enriched in potassium you take um sodium

637
01:02:52,900 --> 01:03:00,500
based minerals right so if you need iron in your body you don't if you have an iron deficiency you

638
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:06,980
don't take iron supplements you take calcium supplements because the body transmutes these other

639
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:15,620
elements into the element that you need and this was the Lewis Kevron kev r a n was left off the

640
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:23,780
planet when he had proven this so there's your simple chemistry how did he prove that these things

641
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:29,460
cognitively very simple you know they took you know chickens are known for producing robust

642
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:35,940
calcium calcium calcium based egg shells you know eggs with that are hard robust calcium high calcium

643
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:42,340
content is what if we stopped feeding the chickens anything that had calcium in it would they

644
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:48,740
still produce eggs and yes they did plenty of calcium and they had no bone loss or anything like that

645
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:52,340
he also did an experiment i had happened to met one of the people that participated in the

646
01:03:52,340 --> 01:04:00,420
experiment from maro uh that the body produces potassium from salt there was a french military was

647
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:06,420
in maro uh building ref oil wells and refineries and uh the person that i had met that done that he

648
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:10,740
developed a four-way screw but that's another situation he remembered of the french being there

649
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:16,900
did an experimentation they had the people eat very little food and uh take no sodium in their

650
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:22,580
diet and work in the hot desert sweating a lot and they all had potassium deficiencies and once they

651
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:28,660
started receiving uh uh uh sodium supplements they have potassium went sky high in their body but the

652
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:38,100
sodium didn't so the body produces potassium when you're working and taking sodium but as many more

653
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:42,820
experiments you did with plants and animals and people and he was left when he had brought all of his

654
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:47,460
studies life worked the university they they laughed at him and they gave him a biology 101 textbook

655
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:55,220
and it's all in the go read that these people uh you cannot in other words there will be no change

656
01:04:55,220 --> 01:05:02,500
as long as you go outside your door and you see people right this is an anomaly all of greek

657
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:08,900
speak is anomalous to this society it is it is not for this society it is to them but it's not for them

658
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:15,140
towards them hmm yes i feel like that's probably been the most recurring point of the

659
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:23,140
stream um just uh to touch lastly on the transmutation thing so you're saying it's something that

660
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:28,100
actually occurs in the human body but the scientific establishment would profess otherwise and say

661
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:34,100
that while you get nutrition by digestion and uh absorption there's no such thing either you

662
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:40,500
get anyone could go look up on the what they call the in-net look up a profile section of the intestine

663
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:45,140
you have an animal or human don't look gory stuff but the stuff they show in anatomy which is pretty

664
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:49,380
accurate actually and you'll see there you have the luminal you know the opening in the middle

665
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:54,580
intestine and the and the hydrophobic completely sealed in or wall how does anything go through that

666
01:05:55,460 --> 01:06:03,300
there's no absorption it's all done by induction you know and this is not the misdirection is so

667
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:08,660
pathetically obvious again make the lie so big that no one will question it because if you tell a

668
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:13,780
little lie people will question it you know and if you go to a scientist again these people are

669
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:21,700
pathetic and the doctors all of them now there there's always i always give uh the the reality of it

670
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:26,420
because these statements sound absolute which are true but the footnote here is whether you're

671
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:32,340
talking about a priest an attorney a doctor or a politician they're all ignorant or evil every single

672
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:41,220
one of them you you what you do is you um you give a leeway of two weeks to six months right that's

673
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:46,180
your only exception and what i mean by that is let's say you want to be a scientist politician

674
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:51,300
attorney or priest you altruistic yeah i want to do this field because it helps mankind right

675
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:56,180
you they don't even know what that means so they go into the field and they see that's all corruption

676
01:06:56,180 --> 01:07:03,060
it's so they're like holy crap what the hell did i get myself into uh i made i wanted to make this

677
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:09,620
my life's work i just screwed myself so they have two weeks to six months to find something else to do

678
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:16,660
and they get out of the field whenever you run into someone says i used to be an attorney or

679
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:21,140
used to be a doctor used to be a priest those are the most interesting people they and they usually

680
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:25,860
keep their mouth shut because if they ever voice to the higher authorities that they're leaving because

681
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:31,220
of this situation they're told not to speak about it or else like you know they have a long arm and

682
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:38,420
they could get to them if they make a fuss about it you see my point yeah so the ones that we that stay in

683
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:45,220
the legal field the religious fields the scientific fields the medical fields are pretty evil

684
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:50,100
they know it it's all corruption and they're doing it because they like the control or they're pretty

685
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:57,540
ignorant they're dumb as a bell or dumb as a doorknob and they don't care right so when we say something

686
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:03,860
like scientists or lawyer or doctor or priest or whatever you should be thinking of yourself in

687
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:08,420
that position because those that occupy those positions today are pretty worthless

688
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:17,860
at least the ones that are stand-ins or have deeply entrenched in other words the the social meaning

689
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:23,620
to these things that i just mentioned is very high but the actual reality of them is they're doing

690
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:30,340
the opposite of what they should be doing because of a not it's not only because it's a society that's

691
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:36,420
controlled by industry or industry controls society but it's because this is a society in decline

692
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:44,260
severe decline but because of gradualism the existing denizens inhabitants or slaves or cattle however

693
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:52,260
you want to put it they don't realize it no I understand what you mean all right um so I think

694
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:56,580
we've talked for quite a bit and it's about time to wrap things up i'm just going to end off with

695
01:08:56,580 --> 01:09:02,820
sort of one last uh thing that i think is good to conclude with perhaps a more metaphysical nature

696
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:08,580
uh it's a central one to the nature of human existence if you subscribe to the idea that it's all not

697
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:13,620
just material what can be said about the question of human consciousness and where it originates

698
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:17,860
because on one hand you have the convention that claims it is generated in the brain but i'm seeing

699
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:22,980
more and more talk online that that's not the case but no concrete all explanations are being given

700
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:30,260
well it's it's a field this is there there it's a perturbation in the field a perturbation would be

701
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:35,700
just like when a drummer hits the skin of the drum with this with his hand or a stick we're dropping

702
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:43,460
a stone in a still pond these are very fine perturbations and it's just like there there's a

703
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:48,820
light spectrum the human visible light spectrum is very very small compared to what can be measured

704
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:55,460
right i mean it goes all the way from infrared to gamma i oath to ultraviolet all the way up to gamma

705
01:09:55,460 --> 01:10:00,820
and x-ray right and there's even beyond that in the in the rays these are waves again the

706
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:08,340
trapertabations the the the perturbations in let's say the ether or uh that happened that are

707
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:14,980
is human consciousness have not been uh at least popularly uh known to be measured and uh used

708
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:20,260
there is plenty of information about how it could be manipulated chemically and a like you know

709
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:28,900
electromagnetically and other ways but the exactness of it has not been made public and uh you know

710
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:34,020
anytime there's a thought there's a perturbation in the ether let's say your thoughts are perturbations

711
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:39,860
of the ether and it's two way three way four way you know there's group you know the perturbations

712
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:45,460
singular perturbations there's frequencies right you know how each device has its own frequency let's

713
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:54,500
say you know here's a way to think about consciousness on how it's being minute what what consciousness is

714
01:10:54,500 --> 01:11:00,260
is important but it's even more important than that for anyone hearing this in contemporary times

715
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:09,620
is how it's being manipulated right so like if someone comes in to your house where you are to threaten

716
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:16,580
your life and presents a weapon to do so do you say well how did he get here or do you say to yourself

717
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:21,780
you know i i don't want to be subject to this because you know it doesn't matter how we got

718
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:25,860
into your house to threaten you let's say with a knife or a gun it's what are you going to do now

719
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:32,260
that he's here threatening you with the knife and a gun you see so the the real aspect of consciousness

720
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:36,580
is that's being manipulated and since we spoke about science and before we sign off

721
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:44,980
you and i perhaps had a conversation about you know how they used to well popular culture shows

722
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:49,540
that ancients were ignorant right that they were stupid and we're not now but you know they

723
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:54,980
popular culture is also shown futurism especially more in the past they don't show futurism anymore

724
01:11:54,980 --> 01:12:02,340
for for many reasons which we've gone into but when they did show futurism how society would be in

725
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:05,540
the future you notice they never said that the people of the future will be more intelligent

726
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:14,420
that's right never said that is never said because it's all control of your consciousness propaganda

727
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:20,420
