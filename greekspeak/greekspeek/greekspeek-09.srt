00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,280
Greetings and welcome to yet another episode of the Greek Speak podcast.

2
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,280
I'm the Archon creator of the show with the Greek as my co-host.

3
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,120
This is episode 9 of what is an almost completed series of 10 episodes.

4
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,720
My apologies for the record setting gap of time between this and the last episode.

5
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,240
I had hoped to get my schedule on track and the things were going to slow down for me,

6
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,560
but that did not happen.

7
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,320
And so things have progressed as they have, but I do hope to still finish within the next

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,800
few weeks with this.

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,640
We only have one more left to go after this one, so I think we should be fine.

10
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,400
The Greek Speak website and podcast continues to be run by me as a personal project with

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,000
no commercial, religious or political affiliations, and it will most likely stay that way until

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,240
we're done.

13
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,840
So that's it for the introduction.

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:25,080
Please enjoy the rest of the show and thanks again for listening.

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,360
Hi there, Greek.

16
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,360
Greetings.

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,240
Hey, it's been a while since we last spoke.

18
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,320
Have you been keeping yourself busy?

19
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,920
Sort of a while, I guess.

20
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,600
Busy, I'm not sure if you really want to be busy in this world.

21
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
But, yeah.

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,240
Well, I guess each is on.

23
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,240
Some people need to have things to do, otherwise their idle hands fall into things that they

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,640
shouldn't be doing.

25
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,120
But yeah, we're going to focus on a new topic for this week.

26
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,120
The last episode was politics and military, and I felt that the next topic should be about

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,120
something equally pertinent to the structures that exert the most influence on the world.

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,280
So I picked the economy and the legal society.

29
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,720
Those are things that you've broached on before when talking about the credit system and your

30
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,560
view on attorneys.

31
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,400
So I think it's fitting to dig a little deeper into that and we'll start with the economy,

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:21,080
which I've divided into two segments, namely money, and then Vax and the credit system.

33
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,520
So, the word economy is widely defined as the production, distribution, and consumption

34
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,320
of goods and services in society.

35
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,880
But the end goal of a lot of that activity is often what people call money, which is I think

36
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,520
a very curious and diversified artifact.

37
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,440
It doesn't seem to have one meaning, although it's commonly touted as a means of exchange,

38
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,000
but it's also described since ancient times as being connected to evil doing because

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,720
of people's attraction to it.

40
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,120
So I think there's more to impact than just what academia or financial institutions choose

41
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,200
to share with the public about that.

42
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,720
So my first question is, Greek, what is money really and additionally, what does it represent?

43
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,720
Okay.

44
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,920
I would suggest that let's go back to the definition of economy.

45
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,280
Nome, nomos or nome meaning law and eco or eco-s meaning house.

46
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:22,600
So literally means it's taken from the Greek roots, two roots, eco and nome, meaning law

47
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,280
of the house.

48
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,520
And if anyone has ever heard what we call Greek speak.

49
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:33,540
In the past you might have been aware of interjection of a concept called the gods or for most

50
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,680
people's perceptions.

51
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,800
It's probably where they would consider to get their religion, ethics, morality, etc.,

52
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:50,200
or the entire order, conscious things are within the realm of divinity.

53
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:57,000
The sense of the law of the house or economy ultimately stems from there, which of course

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,760
we're going to be talking about the legal system which will also tie into that.

55
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,040
But remember, before we even get to the legal system that the legal pertains to law, it

56
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,480
is not law in itself.

57
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:17,680
So back to the what is money, well, it is such a subjective feeling because thoughts should

58
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,360
be objective and feelings are always subjective, let's say.

59
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,280
I would suggest that people's subjectivity will always override any clear meaning to the

60
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,480
term of what is money.

61
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:40,560
But if one retracts themselves from the subjectivity and tries to, you know, soar above the landscape

62
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:49,160
and literally meaning a society living on the earth, Terra firma uses the goods and time

63
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:55,360
and services and labor and productions and all these things that they do on the earth

64
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,240
as part of their economy.

65
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,960
So as you're on the earth, you tend to be fairly stationary within what you call where you live.

66
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,760
But once you start traveling outside of that, you need to a portable sense of your society

67
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:20,400
that lives on the earth to be brought along with you and to be used as trade or exchange.

68
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,680
But in essence, I, from Greek speak point of view, money is portable land.

69
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:37,120
That's why if you look at the lawful money concept or the lawful money establishment is based

70
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,600
on precious metals which are extracted from the earth, at least, you know, most people

71
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,440
would suggest still that they are extracted from the earth.

72
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,720
I would suggest that the concept of portable land will also carry over to the discussion

73
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,320
on the legal system and what land and ownership and things like that are.

74
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,480
Before we go into what money is, I just want to bring up a few things.

75
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,960
This is basically like a nomenclature that could be used to objectify what you hear about

76
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,880
money and the economy in your travels in this world.

77
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,360
Gold and silver, well, you know, are precious metals and there are other things that are considered

78
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:24,960
precious like minerals as well and things of rarity, treasure, hard and things like that.

79
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:32,160
But the precious metal and the rare items and the precious minerals and then we go down

80
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,120
to the different aspects of what we mentioned as being economy and use for trade.

81
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,400
But the gold was used by nobility and royalty.

82
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:51,240
It was a storehouse of wealth and it was basically used as a reserve.

83
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,040
That's why when you read about let's say 19th century land purchases between the United

84
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:04,840
States and Mexico and France and such, that was the established quote unquote ruling body

85
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
or the government.

86
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:13,640
They had put in the contract that the exchanges would be made with silver, not gold.

87
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,400
So you can look at that, how many millions or thousands of pieces of silver were used to

88
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,960
make certain purchases of land between nations.

89
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:28,160
Now the gold is in the reserve of the nobility but they do use silver in the market or to

90
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,120
make exchanges.

91
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,960
The silver also was used by the common man to make exchanges and consequently went both

92
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
way.

93
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,480
Silver was used as a reserve and also gold by the common man.

94
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,000
But typically the money was based on silver whether it was a bank note or coinage or value

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,480
of things in monetary terms was in silver.

96
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:57,080
And that would be for the working class, the middle class, if you want to go cast system

97
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:05,960
of classes, pretty much was the silver base.

98
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:12,480
The poor, the disenfranchised meaning those that were not considered to have mobility in

99
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,040
society used barter.

100
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,520
They used barter of goods usually.

101
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,040
They had the five out of pound of potatoes and you had two pounds of corn.

102
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,800
That was a fair trade.

103
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,240
But if the corn wasn't doing well in the potatoes where it might be two pounds of corn to one

104
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,200
pound of potatoes.

105
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,640
So the poor usually do barter.

106
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,480
And then we have credit.

107
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,840
Credit is reserved for the slave usually.

108
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:52,120
Usually when you have a slave class again in the cast system, they operate on a credit system.

109
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:59,640
What I mean by that is that's a very broad topic but I just nailed it in a very narrow description

110
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,320
and explanation by giving an example.

111
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:11,320
When you are a slave and you are under a household, the master of the household might have been

112
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,200
traveling or he didn't do certain meanial things or any of the meanial things if he could

113
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
afford slaves.

114
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,280
Believe it or not, one of the meanial chores or labor is to do for the household or the

115
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,680
estate was to go to the market place and what we call shopping today.

116
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:35,440
To buy either any item that the estate would need from food clothing to supplies various

117
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
sundries.

118
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,720
Well guess what happened?

119
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,640
The slave was called and given the list to go and purchase things at the market and he

120
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,120
did so with credit.

121
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:57,160
They would have a signet either a bronze plaque or some form of signet meaning something

122
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,000
represented the house and it would be rubbed on a piece of leather or parchment to make

123
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,360
an impression kind of like the old credit card devices were.

124
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:15,640
So this credit aspect always went through the private ownership concept and the concept

125
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,960
of exchanging debt.

126
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:25,120
So I hope we went down from the gold as reserved silver as the common currency, the poor

127
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,600
use, barter and the slaves are in credit.

128
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,680
So maybe that is a good place to start.

129
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:39,480
Yeah so I think that there are a lot of things there that will give us topics for further

130
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,600
conversation and that is cool.

131
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,400
But I heard you use that definition before money is portable land and I certainly see its

132
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:53,080
applications especially when you expand on it like that but if money is really just land

133
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,640
then why isn't fruit and weeds considered effective money?

134
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,760
Why does it have to be precious metals?

135
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,960
I don't know that we've gotten to the heart of what it's supposed to represent as an

136
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,960
item that also has social and psychological effects.

137
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:11,120
What you're saying is one aspect of it but I sometimes feel like we need a broader understanding

138
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,120
as well.

139
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,400
Well the more valuable the substance, the less of it you need for an exchange with a

140
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,360
comparably less valuable substance.

141
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:28,840
So if money is portable land gold would probably be in a common sense the most valuable thing

142
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
you can carry.

143
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes there might be other precious metals based on commodities and things but let's say a

144
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,680
kilogram of gold will buy you 100,000 kilos of wheat.

145
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,500
The more valuable it is you can get to the point where you have let's say a new substance

146
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:52,040
as even more valuable than gold and a grain of rice, size piece of that metal can buy you

147
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,160
100,000 kilos of gold.

148
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,200
But we are in this crop of more valuable than gold.

149
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,440
Like diamonds are considered more valuable than gold so it's platinum.

150
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,480
Well that's the subjective aspect of it.

151
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,280
Like diamonds where you won't see any adportizments or propaganda for diamond wedding rings

152
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,080
until debiers came into and diamonds are not rare by the way.

153
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,120
You're taught to believe that they're rare.

154
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,440
They're very common.

155
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:28,360
That's one of the social conditioning things that you'll find as you go along any research

156
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,360
path.

157
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
Okay.

158
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,160
I hear you.

159
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,720
So I will make an attempt to push into the areas that I'm talking about and if you see

160
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,280
anything valid there then maybe you can expand on that as well.

161
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:49,160
I personally don't have a completely comprehensive definition for money yet but from what I've been

162
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,400
able to discern I would add to what you're saying that money is also a representation

163
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:00,240
of something and it seems to be a representation of power where power is not some indeterminate

164
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,080
or bland word the way that the entertainment industry makes it out to be with you know cartoons

165
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,000
or superhero movies but power meaning ability.

166
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,280
More specifically the ability to manifest your intentions whether that's something industrial

167
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:18,080
social destructive edifying or logistical which is why someone like Bill Gates seems to

168
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,280
be able to do anything he wants but homeless people on the street are some of the most limited

169
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:27,960
people in society so because the world agrees that money will be used to mediate almost

170
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:33,840
everything it becomes the most identifiable source of power that most people know of.

171
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,160
Well it's not it's only power until you run into someone that says it's not for sale then

172
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,560
it then it puts a stop on that power so what you do is you retract and you find people

173
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,680
that you can influence with the money to go and do more of a you know plans within plans

174
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,560
treachery within treachery against that which was not for sale so you can acquire it take

175
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,080
it by force.

176
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,440
Have you heard of a concept called a hitman or an assassin?

177
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,440
Indeed.

178
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
Great.

179
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,880
So yeah I mean force obviously when you have enough of it out ranks most things as far as

180
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,800
being able to affect your will but this sort of social contract that exists in place today

181
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,560
where things are not outright chaotic in most parts of the world and people have an order

182
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:26,360
that they have acquiesced to money is the means of greasing the wheels between most interactions

183
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,320
and that exists as the dominant form of hard power second only the violence which most

184
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,080
people don't want to resort to.

185
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,960
Well let's go back to the aspect when you have money and you equate that with power until

186
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:43,440
you find into something or that you would like to have or acquire and it's not for sale

187
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,480
by the person or the organization bearing it then you result to force.

188
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:56,120
Okay and well you don't result to force you you you find those that will perform what

189
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,040
you want them to perform for that money that you have and then you get your power that

190
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:08,360
way but it also has to do with the ideology like if you couldn't find people that were in

191
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,640
let's say savage or simple or materialistic to accept money to do anything what you do

192
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,040
is you start diminishing the culture and you start breeding a new culture that will do

193
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:23,040
that and that's what you see in place today throughout the world.

194
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,600
But I mean the people that are doing that you know they don't lack for anything as far

195
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,720
as being able to use force I mean that's a very sort of long term I think plan for somebody

196
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:40,120
that wants to engineer the world in a certain way but anyway we may still find a satisfactory

197
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,600
definition I think moving forward I'm certainly seeing what you're saying but I still feel

198
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,840
like there's a slightly missing component that we might stumble on to as we continue

199
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
to talk about it.

200
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:56,320
Well the missing component is the ideology of the society meaning what kind of what form

201
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:04,120
of law they they they have allegiance to and lived to uphold and so the first thing you

202
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:13,240
have to do to take control of the economy is take control of the law right and and then

203
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:22,000
you subject the society to a changing law system not legal system but you know which is

204
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:31,760
an ideology and what something you live by and then you either eliminate those that don't

205
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:39,360
want to go with it by many ways disease or whatever starvation financial crashes right

206
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:46,080
you withdraw the money and then you breed a new culture just like you would domesticate

207
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,720
a chicken for example a domesticated farm animal and at this time what you what you experience

208
00:16:51,720 --> 00:17:00,560
is an education system of history a law form a culture that is fairly new it was revised

209
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:07,400
and redone by what you call the 1950s on the Pope's work schedule it started in the end

210
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:14,520
of the 19th century anyone could go do some research on economic textbooks not really textbooks

211
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:21,440
but economic commentary in the 19th century there was many economic schools of thought and

212
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:27,400
pertaining to you know various cultures you know this is before the rise of communism capitalism

213
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:34,480
and such you already been over 200 years into the industrial revolution which started in

214
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:44,920
the 15 or 1600s so you you're looking at a social engineering that that is now manifest

215
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:51,920
that began in earnest by the mid to late 19th century didn't take very long to redo the entire

216
00:17:51,920 --> 00:18:01,040
world so when you look at culture changes tradition in law form changes the concept of finances

217
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,400
understood and also it's very difficult for people to perceive it objectively because they've

218
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:12,840
been raised in it and you know their parents and grandparents also reinforce this new

219
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,840
breeding program or social engineering so there's no way they'll be able to see out of it

220
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,600
if they're looking for approval from those around them all right I understand that sort

221
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,880
of the thing that I mentioned before about this other aspect of money that's been talked

222
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,760
about since ancient times is that it's most notably appropriated from the bible love

223
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,800
of money is the root of all evil is there a rational reason that we can give for that is

224
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,400
it because perhaps people seek power perhaps above all else and because they see money as

225
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:53,000
representing that they go for that most people seek power with money I've encountered certain

226
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,080
individuals that live an extremely modest life and almost to the point where where they'd

227
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,440
be living out of a trailer or a mobile home and their billionaires and you wouldn't know

228
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,080
it and they and they shop they never buy new clothes they buy used clothes they sort of

229
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:18,520
look not well kept so those are the exceptions so it's not a rule that money is power the

230
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:29,960
and again you really don't need religious fanaticism right can breed power or followers that

231
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:36,800
would go back to the Gustav Lebonne authorship of the crowd let's say to understand power but

232
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:43,520
in essence for this conversation you're at the tail end of a 19th century social engineering

233
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,480
platform which pretty much gave up about ten or twenty years ago and now on a new social

234
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,960
engineering platform which will never really come into fruition which is designed to go

235
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:02,360
out to what's called twenty fifty right so I just threw in a whole bunch of stuff there but

236
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:08,640
without getting sound into philosophical and and being more empirical perhaps maybe discussing

237
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,880
how the money system works today that most people are not aware of well certainly going

238
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,640
to get to that of course we're not going to skip it I just thought it was curious that I

239
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:24,040
mean you've given these other examples of power mediums but I don't see the ancient record

240
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,020
saying that those things are the root of all evil it is the love of money that is the

241
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:32,480
root of all evil so clearly there's a part in there well the love of the the the it's not

242
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,420
money but the love of money so you can be poor let's say in have a love for money or you

243
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,540
can be wealthy and have a love for money it's indiscriminate it's just the love for money

244
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:49,500
it doesn't it doesn't denote any kind of quantity or possession of ultimately when you

245
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:56,300
when you consider even lawful money it's still a fiction give you an example if everyone

246
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:03,300
was able to produce gold tangible sellable elemental gold in their kitchen how much would

247
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:10,300
it be worth not very much right so now the the empirical what's seeming empiricalness

248
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:16,980
of gold becomes ephemeral so it is a fiction in other words it's not absolute but what is

249
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:26,220
absolute is for a certain age what is given as a moral an ethical and loss standing in law

250
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:34,540
gold is the storehouse of wealth and until it is made more public or commonly known on how

251
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:39,660
to produce it in mass it stands you know is it possible to live in a society where there

252
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:44,100
is no money I think Bradbury showed us that in Star Trek right if everyone just did what

253
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,000
they found they should do to upkeep you know the themselves in society and all that and

254
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,980
there was equal sharing whether it was meritoria you know based on merit or not wouldn't you

255
00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:01,020
wouldn't need money and just to interject you know you don't there is no money in society

256
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:07,540
today at all so you know like you said earlier there's no chaos so the the person who has

257
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:14,620
a love for money in this society is a real sick individual if you really consider that

258
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:21,500
because there is no money today in circulation or used well yes in the strictest sense of

259
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:27,860
following the definition but that which money is used to achieve I think is perhaps more

260
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:32,820
worthy of consideration than just the medium itself which is ultimately just a rock a precious

261
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:38,540
metal you're using that to achieve some kind of social gain or material gain which is a

262
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:44,980
far more interesting dynamic to analyze than the rock okay there is lawfulness and then there

263
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:51,780
is what is being done and what is being done in the world society today is not lawful so when

264
00:22:51,780 --> 00:23:00,660
we say something like money that is rooted in lawfulness when you compare to the activities

265
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:07,940
of the current society on the planet it is unlawful so it's very difficult to carry over let's

266
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:18,380
say a thought or an explanation to an unlawful group meaning it's okay there it's spontaneous

267
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:27,460
it's unpredictable in a sense unless unless you know the future and it's unstable and dangerous

268
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:34,060
right so then if you start looking at all the other things that if you're going to plan a society

269
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:41,340
as it is today you're going to have to put things in place called policing right regulation

270
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:48,340
and other things like that to control the volatility potential volatility of a society

271
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,940
that has no money but still engages in exchange and to make it even worse that they think there

272
00:23:52,940 --> 00:24:01,940
is money the next step is you have to remove any kind of reference to anything lawful so you

273
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:08,700
introduce a legal system you introduce attorneys you eliminate any knowledge of history or science

274
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:21,700
right or in you eliminate education you eliminate any kind of a spirituality that is edifying you

275
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:28,900
know you give them garden variety demonology today Judaism Christianity Islam Buddhism all these

276
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:39,580
things so they just play around Satanism same same same stuff you form a society that from a cosmic

277
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:46,700
point of view is actually worthless because it spends most of its time and intention and engaging

278
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:53,980
in worthlessness with the small group of people that that are behind the scenes and when I say

279
00:24:53,980 --> 00:25:01,060
people I don't necessarily mean human either but people nonetheless that are in control of this

280
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:07,260
this planet so that that is basically it in a nutshell and you can go off in any direction you

281
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:12,980
want on all those things you know meaning the military aspect the industrial aspect the education

282
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,940
aspect the science aspect the religious aspect and all that and the underpinning element

283
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,580
all that is finances because you know most people want to do things and they need the financing to do

284
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:29,540
it so when you start discussing the financial element and once you get outside of that it's the

285
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:35,380
lawfulness in other words it's not operating lawfully it's a very very open conversation because

286
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:40,700
anything goes in other words any type of fraud or any type of scam that's acceptable becomes the norm

287
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:48,620
all right well like you suggested before let's um perhaps move on to the banks and the credit system

288
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:55,340
having looked at money you said before that what we have today are not really banks but some kind

289
00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:03,500
of financial institution so perhaps we can start with historically what is a bank many ways to look at

290
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:12,220
it but for you had it was it was a proxy storage of wealth meaning if you didn't want to store it

291
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:18,140
within your estate or your personal or land that you had control over you brought it to the bankers

292
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:25,340
all the way down you know the bank being you know a physical place with physical money meaning

293
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:32,780
precious metals or notes representing that all the way down to a bank meaning a table

294
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:40,220
or for a money changer people that traveled and they use a different rate system so in other words if

295
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:47,420
you had a coin that weighed a certain amount you wanted for one country you wanted it to exchange it

296
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:53,980
for the type of coins weighing whatever other amount for another country so you can do the common

297
00:26:53,980 --> 00:27:01,100
exchange you know in purchases so that's basically what what the banks were basically to change money

298
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:09,020
from one jurisdiction to another one culture from another all the way also from the storage of

299
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:15,420
you know holding someone's wealth which which would be there for personal reasons for their family

300
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:21,340
or estate or for trade and then you get into what's called the law of nations which is in the U.S.

301
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:28,060
Constitution and the law merchant which will probably cover a little bit about both ways with the

302
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:35,020
economic and the legal discussion okay so I believe that the banks also had a religious component to

303
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:41,340
them going quite far back you have clay tablets from 2000 BC that show that the earliest recorded

304
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:46,060
accounts of banks were actually the temples so for example the sun god of Babylon would lend

305
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,380
well not the sun god but the priests would lend money to the farmers in exchange for portion of

306
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:55,980
their yield and would be very demanding and collecting the interest and so that activity seems to

307
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,860
have always been managed by a power based and not just some random part of the public yeah you

308
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:06,540
could say that well again what was considered lawful money came from your gods so of course

309
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:13,500
and what can you share about how banking developed during the first and second millenniums it seems

310
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:19,340
that it was always something that was connected to certain ethnic groups or certain races or even

311
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:24,460
certain countries like Italy or Austria after a certain point how did that industry find itself

312
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:31,900
being centralized around very specific groups and regions it there was a division that happened

313
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:37,260
around that time between the eastern and the western world as you can always see references to

314
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:45,100
to such even today the east and the west so we we can discuss it either way but there that

315
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:54,060
that bipolar existence in the world that still exists east or west is simply the way to describe it

316
00:28:54,540 --> 00:29:02,780
the east always had more of a xenophobic isolationist and the west had a more expansive

317
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:13,260
view on the world you could look at the colonization of the continent of Africa by the Dutch for example

318
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:22,940
as one essence of expansion where you don't see colonization of the sino culture the Chinese culture

319
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:33,100
or the asian culture beyond that area so I would just say that it's not in a phenomenon or anything

320
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:40,380
it just is the way the west expanded and it's also it also borrowed more from the east meaning the

321
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:47,820
Persian farce or what you modern what we call modern day ran many or Arabic even would

322
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:56,700
Persians and farce are not Arabic but also from the Arabic concept and the Judeo concept of finance

323
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:03,980
and of course brought to Europe and mixed in with their ideology there so it has a reputation

324
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:11,100
for being a central point because of the presumed Christian era that you're living in right now it's

325
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,140
from a secular point of view it's this is the Christian era and the harkens back of course to the

326
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:22,540
Vatican and all that so I don't see it much as a phenomenon or a change of anything other than more

327
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:29,500
of a worldwide standardization it does extend into the east though given that it is a world-wide

328
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,220
thing so it's not like you have these two separate systems of banking of finance and the east and the

329
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:41,820
west as far as I can tell the ideologies are different but the Babylonian system extended to the east

330
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:48,380
as well which is you're not supposed to know about in other words you only know about recent phenomena

331
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:54,540
a recent historical occurrence is like I mentioned earlier you're not allowed to know the real

332
00:30:54,540 --> 00:31:02,060
history of man you know of civilization how things change you only know the most for most people

333
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:07,020
the past two weeks but generally academically you don't go back more than a few years and then the

334
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:12,700
rest of its all lie going back you know how however far that's commonly accepted history

335
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:20,540
but the the world standardization happened with the Egyptians that was that's well known with

336
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:27,900
artifacts found in us even in Australia where there was an Egyptian system there's a well-known

337
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:33,580
established facts that artifacts of Babylonian weights and measures and money are found in places

338
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:40,300
in South American Columbia during the Babylonian period you know the early iron age let's say for

339
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:48,140
example this standardization basically what focal point and now it tends to be the IMF out of

340
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:55,180
Washington DC and the Bank of London in England or the city of London so these things change somewhat

341
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:05,100
and so banks and economies they underwent an enduring change in the 20th century with the spread of

342
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:10,140
central banks and fiat currency and centralized authorities for governing global finance

343
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:14,380
and a lot of people in the multimedia will point to the federal reserve or bank for international

344
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:19,580
settlements or IMF or blah blah blah as the culprits of some nefarious global agenda that has

345
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:25,420
orchestrated that and but usually they can't name real names other than the usual suspects of

346
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:31,660
certain families there are the guilty parties what more accurately can be said about how this thing

347
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:37,740
evolved in the 20th century well it was tried out in earnest in the 19th century from the beginning of

348
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:45,260
the 19th century for example Canada was experimented on with a federal reserve type system in the 18 late

349
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:51,500
1800s before they put it in place in America now when you say fiat currency it's fiat

350
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:58,460
an operation because it's not really a bank note but it's not fiat all of the bank notes today because

351
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,860
they're called fiat in other words you can't get anything for them are not fiat they're actually

352
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:11,660
backed by they actually represent a lean on the people the land the birds the trees all the legal

353
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:19,340
artifacts meaning whatever can be described on paper all of the bank notes represent a lean

354
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:25,740
by the central bank on the government and the people of that country so they're not really fiat they're

355
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:30,540
actually backed up like for example if the United States or Spain or you know even though the part

356
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:35,820
of the EU or any other country wanted to bring in lawful money they couldn't because they have

357
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:43,900
nothing to back it with you see so it's fiat an operation but in essence it's backed up by what

358
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:49,100
you hear bankers saying all the time it's not backed up by anything but the faith of the people

359
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:55,900
what's faith it goes into the religious topic just like y'all we'll show later how the legal system

360
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:04,940
is a religion also and i mean that literally not figuratively from a fanatic sense all right i hear

361
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:10,460
you but pertaining to still though the developments that took place that put in place the current credit

362
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:15,660
system from what i understand is that you had a series of events that took place in the 30s

363
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:21,980
around okay time can we talk about that yeah let's let's let's just show a very simple way in how it's done

364
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:29,020
based on how most countries are set up that doesn't matter what the type of system that's in place

365
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:36,700
monarchy communism capitalism whatever uh the they were either convinced or what was put in place

366
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:43,580
was to go into a contract with a private bank or banking cartel known as central banks

367
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:49,180
so what they did was they go into a contract they usually amend their constitution

368
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:55,740
or whatever form of government documents that they have to allow this to happen they

369
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:02,780
in by legislation let's say or by decree and once this happens there instead of the government

370
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:08,060
itself being in control of the money hands over all the tasks and responsibilities to this private

371
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:14,620
banking cartel which is always disguised as you know using the country the country's name and

372
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:22,860
and uh but always being a central bank the central bank is the giveaway uh so what happens is the

373
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:29,580
the central banking system starts to go about all the business of producing and distributing money

374
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:37,820
like a government would but for a fee but every time it does a form of production or finance

375
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:44,300
or financial activity um it requires something tangible from that particular government and when

376
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:50,940
the government runs out of everything tangible then that central bank by contract puts that

377
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:59,500
government into bankruptcy because the fees are still owed okay an example here in the United

378
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:05,420
States would be the federal reserve act comes into play and they produce all the financial requirements

379
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:10,860
for the government at a rate of 6% and all the financial activities require you know

380
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:18,780
to put gold deposits and deposits of deeds and you know tangible items meaning land titles and

381
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:25,100
things like that so what happens is if you know as time in per per seemingly in perpetuity as time

382
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:31,820
keeps going on and on and on the government runs out of things to give the private bank the federal

383
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:38,540
reserve to monetize or produce in you know financial products in the in the economy whether it's bank

384
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:45,340
notes or coin or whatever um and but the government still requires these financial activities to carry on

385
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:53,900
but the federal reserve won't work for free right they work at a rate of 6% so what happens is uh

386
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,580
the government says it's federal to the federal reserve I need money for this year's economy

387
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:01,180
in the federal reserve as we have nothing else to give me well that's because we you know

388
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:06,220
the government says because we've given you everything well that's too bad it's not my problem and by

389
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:11,660
the way if you have nothing else to give us you still owe us 6% plus you need to still keep operating

390
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:17,500
the next month year 10 years or whatever so what do we do so what they do is the the government

391
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:22,700
goes into bankruptcy it's already been incorporated because a non-incorporated government cannot

392
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:29,580
go into contract with a private entity by the way I hope I haven't lost anyone into this point

393
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:35,820
by the way there's not an economics professor or or academic idiot that knows any of this but you

394
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:42,060
could look it up yourself even if you're eight years old so so what happens is they go through this

395
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:48,060
elaborate but yet quiet bankruptcy which instead of shutting down the government in bankruptcy they

396
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:53,340
put it in what's called receivership and if anyone knows what receivership and bankruptcy is

397
00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:01,900
you can see things try to remain as the same as possible so when an entity a corporation or

398
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:08,060
organization goes into bankruptcy and receivership you don't you try to change as little as possible

399
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:14,780
all that means is that the creditor meaning the central bank now owns the government but keeps it

400
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:21,180
operating because it's a fixture in society that society shouldn't do without and that's pretty much

401
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:27,820
it and that's and that's how it works in the American system in the European system in the Asian

402
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:38,060
system as well and basically the main commodity is the human it's called human resources

403
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:47,260
or however you want to look at it basically you're living on as a slave but not

404
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:53,740
understandable in the way that you've been taught what a slave is but legally you are a slave

405
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:59,500
a quote-unquote citizen as a matter of fact you could look at the 14th amendment they kind of spell it

406
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:05,260
out in the US constitution it says it will be no more a slavery just US citizens I mean it's used

407
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:14,060
in the same sentence so that's pretty much how all the systems work it's kind of like the stuff you

408
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:18,140
see in the entertainment system with Hollywood when you start dealing with them off here

409
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,220
a businessman needs some money to run his business or expand and it deals with them off you by the

410
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:26,940
end of the film he loses the business to the mafia or organized crime it's the same

411
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:37,260
story with the financial system all right so we're looking at a global bankruptcy of multiple

412
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:43,180
nations that took place somewhere around the 30s 40s ish and yet there's hardly any paperwork on

413
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,740
this I mean there's a guy called rod class who's the only one that I know of that does comprehensive

414
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:52,700
talks about that but he's also tangled himself up in the US legal system so he can fight his own

415
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:58,460
court case and prove a point to his patriot social circles so he doesn't reach that far but other than

416
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:05,820
that there's not really much else to access directly about this congressional record you could do

417
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:11,500
them sure there's plenty of people out there that have gathered congressional records regarding

418
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:17,020
commentary with congress which congress by the way in America was shut down in the 1860s

419
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:24,620
so I mean they just show up as actors now a civil war was not the civil war you typically have a

420
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:31,900
revolution or a civil war or a severe depression and all of this by the way is it has a very strong

421
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:39,260
spiritual component to it if you understand what's called human inspiration literally in other

422
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:45,180
words there is a non tangible component behind all of this and you see it constantly

423
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:53,500
in in the language you know banking the financial language and also the legal language

424
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:59,740
and also in the symbolism most people always point to the all seeing eye on the dollar bill or

425
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:06,780
something of that nature okay so let's look at how today's economy actually functions professors

426
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:12,300
and bankers will talk about things like GDP and loans and stocks and interest rates and taxes

427
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:19,340
but what are the principal determinants of how money slash credits move around who gets first dibs

428
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:25,980
on accessing them etc etc yeah see okay everything is in receivers should meaning you have a small

429
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:31,420
cartel that runs and owns everything by presumption that's why for example when people

430
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:39,820
get an IRS lien it says notice of lien well they don't need to provide a lien because there's a

431
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:44,780
presumption that everything is under a lien and you just got them upset so now they're saying that

432
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:50,060
we you know we don't presume that we have a lien on you but you see so it's all by presumption

433
00:41:50,060 --> 00:42:00,700
the the the backbone to all of that is understanding the different like you said who gets first

434
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:05,660
dibs on it the different levels the different tiers like you have though the primary market

435
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:11,100
which is how the credit is created for example every time you sign a piece of paper that piece of

436
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:17,260
paper or or or now it's digital gets monetized that's primary then you have the secondary market which is

437
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:24,460
the the servicers or the debt collectors or the the banks that you the the part of the bank that does

438
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:30,940
deposits and things like that and checks actually check as part of the primary but anything that you

439
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:36,060
sign is primary the debt collectors and all the the legal the attorneys all that stuff is secondary

440
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:41,500
market now and then there's a tertiary market which is kind of like the entertainment business

441
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:50,620
you know where they promote all of these things one thing to to comprehend is when you're going to

442
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:58,540
put a new system in the society it doesn't matter what it is religious technical financial whatever

443
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:03,660
you have to make sure that a good portion or enough of portion which could be only two or three

444
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:11,100
percent in some cases of the society relies on you your system as for its livelihood in other

445
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:18,460
words a government job for example if you the more government employees you have there are the weaker

446
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:25,180
the the nation or society is because for example if if the government starts to become quote unquote

447
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:30,620
evil very few people are going to quit their job they're going to continue working and they're going

448
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:36,940
to yell out and scream what do you want me to do this is my living right you see so the secondary

449
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:42,140
market the debt collectors and the attorneys and all that then again involved with finances you know

450
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:47,740
are there to uphold plausibility because people are still going on the ancient notion that if you borrow

451
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:52,700
money you have to pay it back and when you start explaining that there is they actually just monetize

452
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:57,340
your signature and you're the one providing the credit you're the creditor not the debtor but they

453
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:02,860
switch you in a contract that now you're the debtor they can't understand that it's like it's called

454
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:08,940
the 800 pound girl in the room that no one sees that that's a whole concept of I like to put the

455
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:13,740
forward the term cosmic censorship it doesn't matter what's in the room if if they're blocked from

456
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:20,540
seeing it it doesn't matter what it is you know the how big or how small so the secondary market the

457
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:26,140
debt collectors and all that like for example if someone gets a $10,000 loan this just use the regular

458
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:34,220
slave parlance that they're finished they actually provided at least $80,000 for the bank just

459
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:40,220
with signing because it's a 10 to one right it's so they provided $90,000 in the bank has to keep

460
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:49,900
10% in reserve so so you know it's basically the creation modern money mechanics of federal reserve

461
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:55,740
you know Chicago money a federal reserve bank out of Chicago a modern money mechanics I once had

462
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:00,140
an economic professor say though that's fake document even though you know the federal reserve puts

463
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:08,220
it out so basically the secondary markets there to maintain plausibility that's where you're

464
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:15,820
the the the the main backbone meaning the millions and millions of people that rely on this

465
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:22,380
system and will not question it because that's how they get their quote-unquote paycheck you see so the

466
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:29,020
most important aspect of it is not really that there is a small cartel or of you know people that

467
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:36,940
have usurped the money system of the whole world the the main component is the 2% 3% 4% 5% of the

468
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:42,300
population that works in the legal field and in the financial field that's all the secondary market

469
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:50,940
they actually are a proxy army for this private banking system you know for example everyone knows

470
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:57,980
someone right that works in the financial system or the legal system or the government right so

471
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:04,380
you don't want to see them lose their job do you what kind of a person would want that right so that's

472
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:09,980
and the more people that work for the government or the financial system or the legal system the

473
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:15,980
weaker the society gets but we know what this type of system and that's the secondary market

474
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:22,460
you mentioned a bit about you know cosmic censorship and the fact that people cannot understand

475
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:28,060
certain concepts and I find that people don't seem to grasp really the difference between credit

476
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:33,900
and debt and even in the elite classes of people that claim to be experts in this area whether

477
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:40,780
the people that run shows on money or the economy or its politicians they don't really seem to acknowledge

478
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:45,340
that it's a credit based economy and they talk a lot about debt can you differentiate between

479
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:52,140
credit and debt and parse that a little bit sure that goes into the legal system it's all wordplay

480
00:46:52,140 --> 00:47:00,460
short of being a boy and writing a signing a contract that you're a girl right anything else is

481
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:07,580
possible even that's possible now so what happens is you sign a piece of paper and it's monetized

482
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:14,300
right in other words the bank has nothing it's just a storefront or it could be digital all it has in

483
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:20,940
its inventory are transaction numbers preset transaction numbers a certain number of transaction

484
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:26,060
numbers are given to each bank and they're just sitting there in the moment someone that can sign

485
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:34,060
their name or given autograph for a mark a transaction number is brought up and the details are filled in

486
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:40,540
this person came in for loan for $10,000 that they sign it yes okay next the transaction number $10,000

487
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:48,940
appears and everybody's okay but we can't do this for everyone all the time because people will

488
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:54,380
will say well I don't have a job I don't want a job I'll just go sign my name and get $10,000 a week

489
00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:01,100
right and then nothing will ever get done in society so you have to maintain plausibility so then

490
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:08,220
within the contract that they sign or forgetting the $10,000 it says that for the loan that I have

491
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:16,300
received you actually lie they lie and you swear to it right if you look at any more

492
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:21,820
gauge or anything it says for the loan that I received I will pay back right that no so this

493
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:28,300
document creates the conditions and anything before that document will never be looked at

494
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:35,100
by the jurisprudence or the jurisdictions if it's ever comes up for arbitration it can't

495
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:43,820
because the whole system is based on that you know the last thing you want is these patriotic idiots

496
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:48,300
to realize that their government sold them down the river and doesn't exist anymore the meaning

497
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:54,380
the government doesn't exist in the way that they think it does right so you can't for

498
00:48:54,380 --> 00:49:05,740
normalcy you have to start you know turning of princes into frogs on paper yes I follow you

499
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:11,900
but let's not forget to differentiate between credit and debt though well that's well on the credit is

500
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:17,260
created when you sign and it's monetized but then it becomes debt when you sign a contract saying

501
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:21,980
for a loan you received you're now a debtor but you never received a loan you're the one that actually

502
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:28,700
financed it it would be like going to a coffee shop and buying a coffee and the moment you sit down

503
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:34,460
before you take a sip from it they take it from you and they give it to the next patron who pays for

504
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:38,060
it the same coffee and then if you say well I want coffee we have to buy another one

505
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:46,780
how dare you want to drink the coffee you just bought okay follow you but but it's this thing is

506
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:52,540
interesting though where you say that the bank has nothing and it's just a holder of these transaction

507
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:57,740
numbers but then by that sort of understanding let's say you and I decide to create a bank we get

508
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:04,060
rich today it's got we we don't need any to hold anything well the bank is a national association

509
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:11,420
like you could name any bank city bank JP Morgan Wells Fargo whatever Deutsche Bank go on and on

510
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:17,180
right robber bank what those are national associations the national associations like the Boy Scouts

511
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:23,900
Girl Scouts Sierra Club environmental groups all right and they're there they're in NGOs non-government

512
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:30,540
organizations but they have cage codes which is a corporate and government entity code okay so the

513
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:35,020
reason why the banks are wealthy is not because they're running as a bank it's because they set up a

514
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:43,100
corporation you can see this if you do business with banks let's say you do business with Bank of

515
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:50,220
America there's Bank of the America NA which is national association then there's Bank of America

516
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:57,500
trust and there's Bank of America Inc. Incorporated there's Bank of America this right so they use the same

517
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:03,900
name to create different entities which they pile and dump the funds if they can into it or have people

518
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:11,100
buy shares and things like that it's the same thing you see in religion is it a black Jesus is it a white

519
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:16,300
bleeding heart Jesus is it a Jesus that you go to hell if you don't believe in is it a Jesus that is

520
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:21,180
this or you know which one which Jesus are you talking about which Buddha you're talking about this

521
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:29,900
is all based on fanaticism and religious underpinnings all of it I remember at one point when I was in

522
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:34,460
Chicago and I think they have it in other cities as well you walk past a certain building and they have

523
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:40,620
this big national debt number that's in the several billions so this is just a joke no the debt is

524
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:45,180
actually the government's debt but the government convinces you to pay their debt it's kind of like you

525
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:50,780
get a handful of bills at the end of the month and you go convince a stranger to pay them for you I mean

526
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:54,940
and they keep doing it and you get used to that and then when they don't want to do it anymore you

527
00:51:54,940 --> 00:52:01,500
want to kill them that's what's going on today also when the new banking system is put in place this

528
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:07,260
banking system everyone that lives in the land that you have solely given over to the banks is your

529
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:14,140
enemy all right like in America they have the trading with the enemies act various other countries

530
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:19,660
they call it hostilities belligerence this and that they're talking about you right because if

531
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:25,980
the people of any given government find out what the government's did not as do and is doing they would

532
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:31,580
clean it clean it out right away but they don't but the government preempts that by declaring

533
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:36,380
them the enemy and the people don't know that they are the enemy so when you hear whether it's

534
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:41,100
for military industrial or television or media or government whenever they talk about the enemy

535
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:46,860
they're talking about you it's a it's a that's why I mean you're witnessing the decline of the society

536
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:54,860
and the plans to create a new breeding program you know where there is no male or female and you

537
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:59,660
have cybernetic you know people that are part machine part and the rest are just drugged and then

538
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:04,700
the other another group of people which are used for food you know cannibalism and you know this

539
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:11,420
plan to create a new society by the 2050's just like in the 1890s they wanted a new society by

540
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:16,700
the 1950's right you see but you're in decline because it won't come into fruition.

541
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:25,660
Last thing on the subject of banks and credit systems it does seem to be the case that a lot of

542
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:31,500
activity centers around certain places like Switzerland and Luxembourg are you do you know why that is?

543
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:40,780
Well because these things are like Switzerland and Luxembourg in places like that even places in

544
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:49,260
Holland the hagg that is strategic it's not an accident in other words is strategically set up that way

545
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:55,580
and they're not you know a sense of neutrality that's like the hub of evil for example right

546
00:53:55,580 --> 00:54:00,540
like everyone looks at Switzerland as being oh yeah they're neutral they're peaceful they're great

547
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:07,100
no they're actually probably almost evil groups on the planet all right uh in terms of what good if

548
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:15,340
you're going to go down the road of good and evil right good being beneficial and evil be evil being

549
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:24,700
non-beneficial so no that is a strategic location uh Babylon was a neutral place in the ancient world

550
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:33,820
really yeah is that how so well it ran the world through satellites it the whatever you see a

551
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:40,380
group going out and conquering uh their home base is always neutral yeah even Rome was neutral

552
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:47,340
you know even though Caesar sat there it was considered uh separate from anything else you know

553
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:52,140
like the all all the roads lead to Rome well why would you why would that why would that be so?

554
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:58,540
if my memory serves me right there was a few occasions where Rome was invaded by foreigners who

555
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:03,340
identified it as the hub of the activity that they had to go and cut down so they the enemies didn't

556
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:10,060
view it as neutral sure but if you look at Switzerland Switzerland in 2002 or so was cut down also

557
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:16,620
right economically they became a sovereign state right i think Demetri Kalazov talks about that

558
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:22,380
one of his uh youtube videos in other words they became a corporation and fell into the rest of the

559
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:29,340
group because there was no need for them uh to be neutral and also the more people became educated

560
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:34,860
then they would start focusing on it so they made a cover for it by destroying uh Switzerland in its

561
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:42,140
legal state they changed its legal standing into you know a schmuck country like the rest of the world

562
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:48,460
okay so um let's look at the the last topic for the episode which is how the legal system works

563
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:55,260
so firstly we have a group of gatekeepers that mediate between the legal authorities and the public

564
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:59,980
who are called lawyers and attorneys but you've remarked on how those two groups are not the same so can

565
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:04,460
you differentiate between them lawyers and attorneys well lawyer was always known as someone

566
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:11,820
learned in the law an attorney was someone that was uh used by a feudal lord to interact with his

567
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:18,780
the fee the you know the fiefdom the slay the surfer the slave and there's no there's no going

568
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:24,300
around that but what happens is because everyone is an attorney now meaning that deals with the legal

569
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:30,300
system people have forgotten that what an attorney really is or really does and because it's normal

570
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:38,460
it's normal in other words it there's nothing alarming about an attorney right but but an attorney

571
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:44,300
is there for representing legal fictions corporations or serves since slaves are incompetent people

572
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:53,500
and uh that's that harkens back to what i started off early uh in the sonic event this is a slave system

573
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:59,820
so why would you have people that are learned in the law or why would you be learned in the law

574
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:05,260
if you're a slave and you have a credit-based system if you proclaim and try to exercise

575
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:10,460
a knowledge of being learned in law you'll be punished for it because it goes against the norm

576
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:17,580
it's just like thinking imagine you it was normal for all the people or 99.9999

577
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:21,900
percent of all the people in all the countries all the nations all the corporations whatever

578
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:28,860
were all cannibalistic and you started saying well cannibalism is wrong you'll be promptly locked up

579
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:33,820
and and well you'll be laughed at and then you'll have ad hominem attacks against your person and

580
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:38,700
then you'll be you know sequestered from the group or and or you know eliminated with extreme

581
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:43,900
prejudice the same thing with the attorneys if the entire planet is based on a credit system

582
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:50,060
and people are legally enslaved meaning their chattel and their issue to serial number

583
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:53,180
and they're treated as property and charged with crimes and things like that

584
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:59,660
to say that attorneys are not good or you know or whatever any criticism against them

585
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:10,220
is is viewed as irrational and it is actually think about it it would be irrational to negatively

586
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:16,300
criticize attorneys if it's already been well understood rationalized and established that

587
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:21,980
everyone is pretty much a slave all humans are slaves except for very small enclaves on the planet

588
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:26,300
why would you criticize attorneys aren't what are you stupid or something don't you know that

589
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:32,700
you're just a slave right you're operating in a credit system why would you of course it's natural

590
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:39,420
to have attorneys right you see the point yes of course to shift a bit away from the attorneys

591
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:44,540
which I think are a bit like a lower level of the wrong let's look at the lawyers a bit

592
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:49,420
what are the first historical accounts of those people coming onto the scene where did they come from

593
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:54,300
and where they always consider to be malevolent from the start no the the original lawyer is the

594
00:58:54,300 --> 00:59:00,060
original doctors the original professors were the priesthood the original banks and the original

595
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:08,220
universities and government buildings were the temples right so as these things grew and expanded

596
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:15,820
and you had annexes right if you had for example as we said the temple being the base for the

597
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:23,020
the noble things in society if that society expanded and became empiric an empire there's only one

598
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:29,260
temple but you you're going to make annexes of that temple another you know along your empire so then

599
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:35,660
you in a diminished sense have a lower priest he's not a priest but he knows everything the priest

600
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:40,380
should know can you call him a priest if he's not a priest no you call him a representative of the

601
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:47,820
priest whether it's a matter of knowledge whether you know based on education history money health

602
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:52,540
you know medical whatever you had people representing that priesthood throughout the empire or

603
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:57,740
throughout the land but they weren't the priests so they became the doctors which means teacher

604
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:04,220
or the attorney which is the representative you know usually the the attorney worked from the

605
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:10,220
bottom up not from the top down in other words he his authority came from the top down but he

606
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:17,420
worked from the bottom up he brought the unwashed masses to the hierarchy oh I see I didn't know that

607
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:21,980
right that's why you have to get an attorney to represent yourself when someone tells you

608
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:27,420
get an attorney representing means he's telling you nothing but a surf or a slave and you can't

609
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:34,700
stand in front of the lords or the you know the the master okay that's why they don't like here's

610
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:39,580
the interesting thing like today even today in the courts they're all sham courts anyway

611
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:46,780
but all of them by the way because if you try to have a real court it would be closed down by fire

612
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:55,180
or extreme prejudice the the aspect of representing yourself they don't like that because if you

613
01:00:55,580 --> 01:01:00,700
are capable and learned in the law you wouldn't be wasting their time because you would know already

614
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:06,220
that you shouldn't be in that court you get it they only want people that are represented by

615
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:10,380
attorneys because if you're going to go in there as yourself you're learning the law well if you're

616
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:14,780
so learned in the law and you're going in there as yourself you should have avoided the entire

617
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:21,020
matter from the beginning which I've talked about before you do that by going through the administration

618
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:26,940
not the judicial or the justice court which is a sham or religion or whatever you want to call it

619
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:34,140
based on the justice religion you know the female goddess I think I've talked about at nausea

620
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:40,460
for years now to be forced into a justice court is actually religious suppression

621
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:47,180
they don't know that and they they would laugh at you if you brought that up but actually if you

622
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:52,700
went if they're laughing at you you're on two you're dealing with those that are really too low on the

623
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:58,140
on the wrong on the ladder you need to go up higher and they they know exactly what's going on

624
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:04,940
so yeah all of this stuff has a religious underpinning to it yeah unfortunately we don't have

625
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:09,580
enough time to dig into the religious underpinnings but that is always something that people can

626
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:14,220
look into it's things that I think we might have mentioned at some point in earlier streams also

627
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:21,820
you won't find you won't sorry you won't find much on on the justice system being based on the goddess

628
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:28,780
religion in in what they call the search engines you're gonna have to find some stuff that's

629
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:36,460
printed from 19th century or before and you're gonna have to open your eyes and look at all the symbolism

630
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:44,380
just like who is it Confucius Confucius say right ancient Chinese secret symbols are the great

631
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:51,100
communicators in a society not words but symbols and he wasn't talking about the pictographic nature of

632
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:58,300
the Chinese writing system he's talking about the what is hidden is is revealed through symbolism

633
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:05,980
yeah I think that there's a general sentiment of that being the case now in the mainstream I think

634
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:09,820
people generally know that but they don't seem to know what the symbols mean so they speculate

635
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:19,420
in all kinds of rumors about so in this society where the imperative of the legal system is to maintain

636
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:26,860
the order on behalf of these nameless patrons of the corporate state can it be said that crime

637
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:30,780
actually pays since what we have is really just criminals judging other criminals

638
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:37,100
sure but the thing is the real criminals are the ones judging the people that are presumed to be

639
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:45,900
criminals in a factual lawful sense the the entire society is a is criminal society so if everyone is

640
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:53,420
criminal are there any criminals no so now you you basically you've turned everything over to a

641
01:03:53,420 --> 01:04:00,620
new paradigm now well because everyone meaning it's kind of like with the police there are no good police

642
01:04:00,620 --> 01:04:06,540
the reason why there are no good police is because those that are deemed good know about the bad

643
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:12,460
police and don't do anything about it so there are accomplices you see and by the way the police are

644
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:18,220
a function of the banks we've talked about that their lawful societies don't have police only the

645
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:24,220
ones that are bankrupt or we're allowed private banks to come in and and you know basically mortgage

646
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:29,980
up everything right I'm not against the police because I have no interest I'm not against anything

647
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:36,220
that they're doing on this planet because it's all bad so I can't say that I'm against any

648
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:43,180
specific aspect of anything in this society I'm against all of it from A to Z from young to old from

649
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:48,780
high to low because it's all unlawful like we just said so I just retract and I can just give

650
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:57,420
an educated opinion with references and an objective report like I've said many times

651
01:04:57,420 --> 01:05:03,500
if everyone wants to band together and hold hands and make the world a paradise I'm still going to

652
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:08,540
be a separate from them as possible if they want to want to band together and create a living

653
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:13,420
hell on earth I'm still going to stay separate from them either way whatever they do in the state that

654
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:24,380
they're in right so this is the the the intention of the sonic events is to be is to give an

655
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:31,420
objective report and a quote unquote opinion with references but at the same time to remain set apart

656
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:38,380
from it and indifferent to it so again what they're doing with the attorney just to go back because

657
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:45,580
everyone is acting in a criminal sense or supporting it the the the attorneys are just they're

658
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:52,060
to monetize charges you know from traffic tickets to court cases all those numbers all those things

659
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:58,700
are monetized in other words they're deposited into the bank for credit and there's nothing you can

660
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:05,500
do about it to some do in other words there's no way to fix it it has to be redone and it is I mean

661
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:11,020
the destruction of man society is done by the quote unquote good guys not the bad guys the bad guys

662
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:17,020
are the ones who are running it do you know what Shakespeare was talking about when he wrote the first

663
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:22,700
thing we do is kill all the lawyers in in that Henry the sixth play yeah that's well that's a

664
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:27,740
conversation between two of the characters and there's more detail than just kill all the lawyers

665
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:32,300
well yeah I know but I'm just referring to the quote well yeah that's something that has to be read in

666
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:40,540
context there is a wolf hill or something there is a a PBS series wolf haul or something about

667
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:46,700
an attorney for the king that's a good series to watch it's about one of the head attorneys

668
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:55,420
there another treachery in the lying that he did and the the feigning of power to maintain the

669
01:06:55,420 --> 01:07:00,620
British monarchy or the English monarchy during that time I believe it was Thomas Cromwell Cromwell

670
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:07,900
yes based on him his life and there's several those Cromwells it's the original one it's a pretty

671
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:15,420
good series to watch the PBS I'm not promoting it but it's it'll it's just it's like watching something

672
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:19,980
you can reference most of the things that they show but it's in real life you know it's like

673
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:24,940
watching a film like most Christians know about the bible by watching Walt Disney or the movies that

674
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:30,060
they made it's incorrect obviously all of it right none of it's correct but at least you get a

675
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:36,300
flavor for it you know the time period and the certain things that were said all right well then

676
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:40,620
I think it's something that could be useful for people to check out if they feel so inclined

677
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:45,740
but I think that we're gonna have to bring the conversation to a close we've been talking for

678
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:51,660
over an hour and I think we've given people a lot of good things to mull over so unless you have

679
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:57,900
something that you want to reiterate or emphasize Greek I think I'm good not at all I mean uh well

680
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:04,220
the word is there to emphasize but to deemphasize what people think is true really and uh this

681
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:10,940
this last uh conversation or sonic event with the economy and the legal system is too broad uh to

682
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:16,300
to even get into other than giving half-hearted opinions like I did pretty much hopefully I gave

683
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:25,580
it with enough reference and and uh some kind of flavor that people can go and look up certain things

684
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:31,420
but with that said yeah that's that's it for now I guess all right well then I think we'll end

685
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:36,380
things off on that note it's been a good stream and we'll be returning at some point in the near

686
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:42,220
future for the last episode of the Greek speed podcast series sorry again for the long waiting time

687
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:56,380
but we only have one more left to go and we will see you next time so thanks again for listening

688
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:58,460
you
