00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,880
Greetings to everyone, welcome to the tenth episode of the Greek speak podcast hosted by

2
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,560
the Archon in the Greek. We finally reached the last stream of this series and I think it's long overdue.

3
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,840
If you stuck with us this far then I presume you found the podcast to be something insightful and

4
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,720
that's great. Thank you for that but I look forward to bringing things to a close today and

5
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,920
we're going to be tackling subjects that are close to home for all of us given the current health crisis

6
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,840
and we'll also be looking at what the future holds so let's get to it. But as always,

7
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,800
GreekSpeak.com has never had any commercial religious or political affiliations and was always

8
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,560
something that I ran for the sake of the project itself and so that's it for the introduction.

9
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,960
Please enjoy the rest of the show and thanks again for listening.

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:21,640
Hi there, Greek, are you there? Hi there, yes I am. Hello.

11
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,920
So I don't know about you but I'm relieved that we're about to conclude the series that's taken

12
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,240
a year when you should have taken four months not that I don't enjoy speaking with you but I think

13
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:39,320
even the best of things one of their course there's a lot of social and economic activity that's

14
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,320
being stifled in the West because of a reported pandemic. The cause is attributed to some kind of a

15
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,640
virus that said to be life threatening. They call it the coronavirus. It's said to have originated

16
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,320
somewhere in China, Wuhan China in the food markets there because of the bats that they sell

17
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,400
and we see a lot of governments that are imposing states of emergency on their people because

18
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:07,400
the UN declared a pandemic in mid-March. So first of all what can be said about the nature of this

19
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:14,040
biological agent, Greek? Well the nature there is no nature to it, it's fiction in terms of the

20
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:22,840
biological aspect to it from a mechanistic point of view. Just to time date this it's what they call

21
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:32,920
towards the end of March on the year 2020 on the Pope's work schedule. So as it is now I think

22
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,920
people that are familiar with Greek speak even beyond these podcasts have picked up perhaps

23
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,400
more than just a few bits of info on how the human body works. What the medical establishment is

24
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,040
really doing and people's perception of anything living which is at a minimum by the way.

25
00:02:52,040 --> 00:03:00,040
So you know let's just let's just embed a little bit of history, a tradition, culture and all this

26
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,520
and let people actually come to a conclusion, the rightful conclusion on this.

27
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:12,600
During the Middle Evil ages and up to the Renaissance and beyond Europe was controlled by basically

28
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:19,560
an imperial system meaning by empire and you mostly hear of things coming out of the Vatican,

29
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,360
out of the Catholic Church and they had a pretty good stronghold on Europe and most of the world

30
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,480
at that time because of at least the Western world because of the financial center there which is

31
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,840
of course what you see going on now financial being embroiled with this but my point here is from a

32
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:44,440
what's called science which is learning or knowledge. What the church had done both privately and

33
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,680
publicly is stated to the quote unquote natural philosophers because there were no scientists

34
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,240
back then they were called natural philosophers people studied nature whether they call physics today

35
00:03:53,240 --> 00:04:00,600
and just the material world or the world at large. The Vatican pretty much had a stance that they

36
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,600
can study anything as long as it had a material basis or material cause anything that was immaterial

37
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:15,160
was within the domain of the Catholic Church or the Vatican. Now in today's vernacular things

38
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:23,320
like radio electricity what people call microwaves or even light those are those are still immaterial

39
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:31,880
phenomena natural phenomenon but the because of this Vatican-esque Catholic mindset that was put

40
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:40,040
on 500 years ago they fabricate things like photons and electrons you know that like you know photons

41
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:47,480
are light particles and electrons are electrical particles and everything is a particle right it's

42
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:54,040
like the Vatican the Vatican cult of particles is really what you're experiencing so nothing can

43
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,880
be conveyed even as a concept unless it has a particular agent behind it. So when they're telling

44
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:06,520
you the strict cause of an outbreak or a pandemic is this little particular virus if you take it

45
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:14,680
face value and you have at least maybe a handful of brain cells between your ears and you have a

46
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,400
little bit of time on your hands to research this you'll find within usually between five or ten

47
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:26,680
minutes of research that it is a part of germ theory and anything that's defined within

48
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:34,840
being constituents of a virus is under the study of virology which is the study of toxicology.

49
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:41,800
Also you will find within the first few minutes that viruses are dead proteins but yet

50
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,760
what I the things I just mentioned that if anyone does in an objective study in what everybody

51
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,480
of knowledge medical let's say or scientific has been accumulated regarding the subject will find

52
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,960
it is in high contrast and almost direct opposition to what you're being told in the media by the

53
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:06,520
authorities and so on. So without actually calling it a farce it's beyond that it's basically a

54
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:14,840
mind game and from a personal commentary point you get what you deserve you know there's no way

55
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,480
you can go you're spending your life saying that I'm gonna do what I do and I want to know about

56
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,320
science I'm gonna look at these jokers and learn something without looking into it before it matters

57
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,680
right and now when it matters no one wants to look at it because they're into a panic. I see

58
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,840
so if it can be shown that it's not what they're saying can we say what it is or is it do you feel

59
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,240
like it's too premature sure sure now in other words to actually formalize and do a serious treatise

60
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,880
on this would require a lot of resources but what we can observe looks at let's say there was no

61
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,160
study of electricity and you wanted to embark on it you would have the most rudimentary and crude

62
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,320
things to start doing electrical experiments right you'd probably have pieces of wood pieces of

63
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:09,000
copper some chain right higher in chains right you'd be starting off in the most rudimentary way

64
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,520
so from the position that I see it if we look at the what I call grunt work that's grunt work is

65
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,520
just like digging ditches it's a lot of work but it's not technical meaning all of the diagram

66
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:28,120
schematics and anatomical studies of biological things all the way from the the roots of plants and

67
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:35,160
trees to the bodies inside and outside of anatomy of fish to insects to human if you look at the

68
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:43,080
human intestines in anatomy books inside the lumina you know the opening of intestines arteries

69
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,040
organs cell tissues and all that you'll find that they all have one thing in common and that thing

70
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:55,080
in common is that they're surrounded by a cytomembrane which is a cell membrane and once that

71
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:04,120
membrane is examined it's extremely robust it other than high mineral things like bones and teeth

72
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,680
you know if you're gonna have a pliable membrane it's basically the cell wall and nothing goes

73
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:17,320
through it by the way so you have a central containment system with mitochondria plasma

74
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:24,040
cytofluids you know nuke what they call a nucleus on and on and on there are orifices that are

75
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:30,600
that seem like projections inward projections in cells that look like for example the pores on skin

76
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,400
and nothing goes in and out of it you'll see it as a termination point so just by looking at these

77
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,600
rudimentary supplies you know meaning anatomical diagrams and studies that have been done

78
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:48,200
and looking at how things change in condition for example if you back in the days when you had

79
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,920
magnetic tape you bought or today would be a blank CD or DVD and it had no information on it you

80
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:02,360
find the correct format and format it and copy another disc onto it and that is an information

81
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,840
transfer for example people that are old enough to remember a magnetic tape you know you dubs

82
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:14,680
a magnetic tape and your formats had it be in line for the copying process to take place another

83
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:21,880
an example would be induction a contactless charging on these cordless toothbrushes they have a

84
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:28,440
charging bay and there's no metal to conduct so so-called conduct electricity it's by induction

85
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:35,640
just like two coils would induct next to each other so and I'm suggesting induction strongly because

86
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:44,520
if anyone does any research on late 19th up to the late 19th century anything on pathology and epidemiology

87
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:51,960
and let's say toxicology and ultimately pandemic and disease study most of the books were titled

88
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,000
within the either the book itself or chapters within the book the induction of disease

89
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,680
not the contagion not took no you don't con like now everyone contracts a disease years ago

90
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,520
used to induce it right and they still have that term induction like when you induce vomiting

91
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:16,920
right you actually find a pressure point that spurs a gag reflex and prolonged gag reflex probably

92
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:23,640
will induce vomiting you only see that word used very infrequently so the actual mechanism itself

93
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:30,840
does not exist in a material sense you see also the the actual science if anyone wants to get

94
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,960
in you know actually knowledge of it you're gonna have to understand material a little bit more than

95
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,440
than you perceive it in other words most of the information about what material is has already been

96
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,080
supplied except for the planetary model of the atom and electrons and things like that but the

97
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,760
properties of living things from a material perspective have already been supplied now you have to

98
00:10:52,760 --> 00:11:02,040
piece it together on how let's say a pandemic or a disease would be induced based on lack of

99
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,560
material infiltration into a cell and there's only one way that can be done again and it's by induction

100
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:13,960
for example if you look at the a lot of the studies that we're done in early electricity

101
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:19,800
galvanic where you get the term galvanism galvanic reaction things like that he stated that most

102
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,480
metals have an atmosphere on them which is interesting and when I when I mean an atmosphere it's a

103
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,640
layer that is subject to the body itself it's a gaseous layer and people also have an atmosphere as

104
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,000
matter of fact you see it very often illustrated in cartoons where someone's really smelly they're

105
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,840
walking around and you see they act the cartoonist actually draws an atmosphere around them right

106
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:46,840
like little rays or lines like you know it's maybe sometimes then Charles Schultz drew like a fly

107
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,080
buzzing around right but within the atmosphere that individual someone sprays a bunch of

108
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,960
colonon you know once you get once you get into their atmospheric range you can smell the colon right

109
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:03,960
these things can be observed from a very practical sense so I just laid out the foundation of what

110
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:10,040
needs to be investigated you could look up Rudolf Haaska he was trying to find out the vitality

111
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:15,560
or what's called a vitamin and the vital essence of things by subjecting various yeast cultures

112
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:22,760
and bacteria to various things that were known to be have vital energy to them like spinach cultures

113
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,800
in various starches and proteins and he would mix it with the the simple life forms and see how

114
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,840
they would react or sometimes deprive them of it and see how they would react but eventually he

115
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,320
found out you didn't have to actually combine the substances together mere proximity was enough

116
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:46,520
okay so another example of a lack of direct physical manifestation in a particular way would be

117
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:54,040
people having electro sensitivity and it's already been well established that the the whole field of

118
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,200
radio is a non-material phenomenon and of course they'll always say it's electrons moving through

119
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,840
the air but there's nothing moving through the air it's an oxymoron because money of the older

120
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:08,200
radio systems were vacuum tubes anything going through that would compromise the vacuum and the

121
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:15,240
system would stop working so I don't think it's possible all based on culture in tradition and

122
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,720
what people consider to be authority in other words following the the academic authority or what's

123
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,960
taught in the academy to have any change from their perspective of a lack of a material constituent

124
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:36,360
which is the fundamental aspect of pandemic or disease okay so what we can conclude is that this is

125
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,720
not a disease that's spread to contact or one person coughing on another but by this inductive

126
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,480
process that you're talking about we have somebody in the chat who's asking if you could compare it to

127
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:52,120
a poison well it's all developed by the body for example when you take a poison and let's say it goes

128
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,520
it when we get back to it yes it can be a spread of course through contact and someone coughing on

129
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:04,120
you yeah that see this is the problem very often with trying to show what many many consider to

130
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,280
be contrary information then they bundle it up and say everything I've been told is no good no

131
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:14,360
that's not true whether there's electricity that is non-material going through a large AC wire or

132
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,880
whether it's electrons if you touch it you're going to be electrocuted either way

133
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:25,000
so the final the final the the the the terminal result is the same whether you believe it's a particle

134
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,760
or not but once you have contact well that actually supersedes induction what happens inside the

135
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:39,880
body is purely by induction when you take a poison something that is toxic to the body and it passes

136
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:47,800
from the mouth through the the throat into the stomach past the duodenum let's say into the colon

137
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,840
and all that that is the entire point you know let's say it's an ingestable one versus an

138
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:59,480
inhalable one that your your unless it's such a robust chemical that it actually disintegrates

139
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,520
the the cell wall and penetrates and cause sepsis which is bleeding from the inside out

140
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:10,520
what happens is that that poison has to be recognized by the body as something you could reproduce

141
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,400
and when I mean by reproduce it's no different than what you see in science fiction where you have

142
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,040
the genroddenberry series of star trick when you're hungry you go to a food replicator

143
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:25,160
right your body is constantly replicating things but it has to recognize it

144
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:34,040
so for example if you have let's say the ability to not reproduce a known toxin in your body at one

145
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:41,400
poison you so the the concept of induction goes beyond just pent what's called let's say the pathology

146
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,800
of disease and all that but it's also the way your body ingests anything whether it's the

147
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:52,520
longs or the intestines or your skin it's all done by transmutation again one might just take a minute

148
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,480
clear their mind and think about what I'm saying and if this was commonly known and it was because

149
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:04,120
it's it's actually very perceivable what I'm saying based on the work you can gather from the academy

150
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:12,280
meaning reference materials that they put out and based on having access to a living body by the way

151
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,760
ha ha ha right so just think about how fundamentally ridiculous it is that you don't even know how

152
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:23,400
your own body works and I don't mean you specifically but yeah you generally but imagine imagine

153
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,920
though that people actually were raised and yet a society that was built around knowledge of how

154
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:35,880
biological things really work which is the essence of transmutation or replication don't you think

155
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,520
you might want to apply that concept that now you've mastered and can handle very well and mitigate

156
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:46,120
problems with don't you think you might want to actually apply that to your your technology your

157
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:53,080
science and your culture do you know a kind of a what kind of power and accessibility to all things

158
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:59,080
a culture that knew and understood how to replicate things would have it be considerable

159
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:07,160
so I recently came across an article where a medical worker describes the lung failure that the

160
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,960
condition traits in their patients when the disease gets very aggressive

161
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,680
I'm so I was wondering if I could read some bits of that and then maybe you can comment on some of the

162
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:25,000
things that you hear happening okay so I knew it was going to be bad but we deal with the flu

163
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,120
every year so I was thinking it's probably not that much worse than the flu but it's more frightening

164
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,200
I'm seeing patients who look relatively healthy that are completely wiped out like they've been hit

165
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,680
by a truck patients will be on minimal life support and then all of a sudden they go into complete

166
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,560
respiratory arrest and can't breathe at all we have patients on a cardiac monitor and we're seeing

167
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,120
when their heart rate has a sudden increase or decrease or one of us goes into visit the patient

168
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,120
and then sees them struggling to breathe that seems to be what happens to a lot of these patients

169
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,840
they suddenly become unresponsive or go into respiratory failure and then the lungs get filled with

170
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,560
fluid normally this is something that happens over time as the lungs get more and more inflamed but

171
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,680
with this virus it seems like it's happening overnight in my experience this kind of issue is

172
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:12,360
typical of someone who has a near drowning experience or with people who inhale caustic gas

173
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,160
when someone has an infection the normal colors you associate with it are green and yellow with the

174
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,160
coronavirus patients they have a lot of secretions that are pink because they're filled with blood

175
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,440
cells that are leaking into their airways so they're essentially drowning in their own blood

176
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:31,240
end quote. All right the comment on that is very simple if one studies for example the nature of

177
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:37,400
pandemics you you might get well it's been highly censored but that sounds very similar but not

178
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:44,040
exact to the pandemic the what's the American army flu or called the Spanish flu in 1918 people

179
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:50,520
died within 24 to 48 hours it sounds like the description I was giving earlier when the intestines

180
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:56,760
or the body induce something it's different than if that substance that something was the toxin

181
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:01,880
let's say penetrating the cell wall and killing its victim that way so this sounds more like that I've

182
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:09,480
also seen several references online that it is a nerve agent reaction right which is typical the

183
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:16,440
the pink fluids and all that are not infection now just go back to the early pandemic what's called

184
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,720
the bird flu that was designed by the way there are people who designed and put these things together

185
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:27,000
and it's not done in a laboratory like people are told never it's it can't be done in a laboratory

186
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,600
it can be let's say samples can be stored in a laboratory but that's not how it's done and I think

187
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,520
we in private I have explained how pandemics are created and from the bubonic on and it's not

188
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:46,120
something I want to go on on a podcast and described but it's not in a it's not in a laboratory that's

189
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:52,200
clinical so again what with it what you read was from a clinical perspective I think it was from a

190
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:59,240
nurse was it not yes that's right right okay so again their her perspective is that the

191
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,320
viruses do exist and things like that so hopefully what what you read she had enough clarity the

192
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:11,320
clarity that we that we can see is the description of the fluids right because obviously this nurse if

193
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:17,000
she's working in there she's brainwashed otherwise she wouldn't be working there so we have to rely

194
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,960
on what we consider to be objective and if you objectify what is mentioned not only by her but

195
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:28,360
other sources that you could see they're all pretty much in in agreement it's very rapid and it

196
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:35,880
doesn't fall within the parameters of an infection yeah I would suggest that if you look at the

197
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:40,120
geographic components which by the way most of these websites that show the spread of this

198
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:47,160
pandemic were created I think last year november or october so that gives you a little bit of insight

199
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:53,720
on the timing of this right or well the well-known timing of it the other thing is if you look at how

200
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,800
it's been vectored throughout the world it just doesn't make any sense they have something called

201
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:02,760
patient zero which is the first one who started spreading it that cannot be identified anywhere

202
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:09,960
so I would suggest this is what's called a black op and it's a conspiracy just because you know

203
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,840
for example I was on a sidebar in YouTube is this conspiracy or fact well so if it's conspiracy

204
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:24,280
there's no such thing as a factual conspiracy right anyway so there is a conspiracy obviously to hide

205
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:32,520
uh it's a origination point uh uh and I think I've gone through the in brief perhaps about the legal

206
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,560
system and other things about the worldwide conspiracy that is unknown and most people today

207
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:45,880
are very well uh very well understand the existence um i don't mean right or wrong but just the

208
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:52,600
very existence of secrecy in their society through intelligence agencies secret societies people

209
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:57,560
keeping their own secrets but but basically groups large groups of people that are well-funded

210
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:03,640
that operate in secret and it's fully accepted right and because that's fully accepted this is just

211
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:09,960
you know one of the sidebars of it right so or in other words it's one of the benefits of accepting

212
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:16,440
secret societies intelligence agencies secret police secret government meetings secret corporate

213
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:25,160
meetings all these things this is i just see it as a um the benefit of secrecy so from the secret point

214
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:32,200
of view i don't because i'm not involved directly uh with any of these secret groups intelligence

215
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:39,800
or otherwise uh i can tell you what i can garner from objective objectively uh looking at the

216
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:47,160
situation and from the things that i've heard from behind the scenes is that this is a bio weapon

217
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,600
and again um that's pretty easy to determine but it's not a virus it's just a

218
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,400
classical bio weapon that was uh used prolifically by the Mongols as their

219
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:03,720
Mongol invasions started to taper down about a hundred years later they realized it was too

220
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,120
difficult to control the European population so why don't we just make a disease to get rid of them

221
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:14,520
and that was of course created with the rodents and marsupials and uh in a certain way and spread

222
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:19,960
throughout to become the the bibbonic plague and then uh you've had several plagues in between

223
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:28,600
that and then the next big one was in 1918 which actually killed uh about as many people

224
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:38,920
in one-tenth or one-twentyth the time uh and that also that was created by the american army

225
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:49,560
the same using the same methodology so um i would say there is a patient zero but it's not known

226
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:57,000
because too many questions will be uh asked you see for example where you saw the outbreak start in

227
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:05,720
places like Iran and Italy and the northwestern US uh and in china uh there are people that know how

228
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:12,040
it was started but and and they're not showing you that on television so if anyone were to look at this

229
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:19,240
very carefully uh there are some cases that people do get quote unquote flu type systems that are

230
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:25,960
very aggressive but are not flu the flu as such but are closer to the 1918 pandemic which killed people

231
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:33,080
in a day and there are also there is also enough evidence to show that there's presence of uh what's

232
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:39,720
called you could loosely call organophospho fluorines which is the seren gas type constituents

233
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:46,200
which paralyze the lungs for example the muscles of the lungs which i you can also see some people

234
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:54,360
that supposedly have recovered from that give a very similar um uh response or testimony to people

235
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:58,920
who have suffered a seren gas attack which for would be for example people that are survivors of

236
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:06,360
the first Iraqi war or various other chemical um uh think tactical chemical weapons used in the field

237
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:12,360
that is the it actually i think they're about a month ago when this started i started looking at

238
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,800
there's a couple of field manuals online army field at manuals i don't think it was the us army

239
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:24,120
was another one about a chemical weapon um protection and the symptoms of various weapons and

240
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:30,200
some of them sound very similar to what you see going on right now like for example the description

241
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:36,680
that the nurse gave so but again uh if you live in a society that accepts secrets this is simply one

242
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:43,080
of the benefits of accepting it and what are some of the uh conceivable countermeasures for this

243
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,480
ailment i know you've talked in the past about certain things regarding silver and baking soda and such

244
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,280
so there are certain things that you can put in place to sort of preempt a bad situation now

245
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:59,320
sure from the chemical attack uh you know i think a drop of seren gas from a liquid from a helicopter

246
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:04,440
on a large area will will whoever walks within you know half a kilometer of that area will be

247
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:13,640
induced or poisoned by it varying degrees for days so it's very very toxic um so that would supplement

248
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:19,000
for example what they're doing with the biological stuff see personally i don't think the people that

249
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,680
are alive today are smart as the people uh or as cruel as the people were around 1918 the Rockefeller

250
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:31,640
foundation and the surgeon general at the time uh to to make such a a a a pandemic as they did then now

251
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:38,600
i think the believe it or not even with the advent of uh constant violence and uh degrade degradation

252
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:43,640
of morality i don't think there is cruel as those people were back then so perhaps they didn't have a

253
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:50,600
biological system um in place uh to spread as well as they would like so they supplement it with

254
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:56,520
the chemical now if you're subject to the chemical aspect it typically has a very light fruity smell

255
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,120
but if you smell it it's it's kind of too late right it's like heavy artillery when you hear it's too late

256
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:09,320
i i would think with that would be just uh beware of suspicious characters you know a van

257
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:17,080
uh typically uh someone in society that shouldn't be there or if you get that feeling that intuitive

258
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,320
feeling that something's wrong here stay away uh most people are pretty good with that but again

259
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:30,280
that would be topical washing and there are antidotes for that uh they work mildly they're

260
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:37,160
meaning they may not always work for the chemical side and one of them is um a plant i think it's called

261
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:46,440
it's a it's a night shade uh belladonna plant uh it's small poise it's considered toxic and hallucinogenic

262
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:55,320
basically uh antidotes for this type of chemical that would disable the lungs that can be called the

263
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:02,520
flu antidotes would be alkaloids right maybe baking soda and water maybe the green cratum leaf

264
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:09,160
any form of alkaloid but it has to be a potent and specific variety uh the best found in the in the

265
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:17,320
belladonna plant and a variation of okay in terms of the biological side uh if you are not

266
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:23,320
formatted for example uh you might have heard that there've been plagues that ravaged a town or a

267
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:29,080
city or an area and some people didn't get it i was on a private skype call recently and someone says

268
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:34,680
yeah there are people that go and uh to a leper colony to help them out and they don't get they don't

269
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:41,720
get the leprosy for example or um so on you know you hear about uh humanitarian missions uh and the

270
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:48,280
people don't get sick um and on the other hand where you have these laboratory situations where you

271
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:56,360
had the the programmed or engineered Ebola breakout in Nigeria a couple of years ago uh most of the

272
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,960
observers that were there were wearing full hazmat suits with breathing tanks and even with that

273
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:07,720
kind of protection 20 or 30 percent of them still acquired the disease even though there was

274
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:17,000
they were completely materially separated um so to not induce it or not format it so you become one

275
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,880
of those people that i'm not going to use the term immune but just use it in a literary and not a

276
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:28,120
literary sense immune here you're looking at a formatting system so it doesn't read the disease

277
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,720
what i mean by that is um you know years ago certain computers if you hooked them up together

278
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,520
they couldn't talk to each other right because of the formatting the information wouldn't transfer

279
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:44,920
over so basically how do you change your body uh to not be format to not format the disease like one

280
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:50,360
of the things you hear well it spreads very quickly amongst humans but animals don't get it

281
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:55,560
well so does that mean that if i have i'm petting a kitty cat all day or have a pet dog that you know

282
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,280
licks my face when i'm sick it won't get sick yep that's right the animals don't get it well you know

283
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:08,200
the animal share about 90 percent or like really mammals share about 99.99999999 percent of biology on

284
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:16,760
that level and fruit fly has 90 85 percent of human DNA broccoli is 75 percent human DNA

285
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:24,200
so would a piece of broccoli catch the disease no because it's not formatted for that right so

286
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:29,800
what i mean by that is when the format is changed like for example again the people who did not

287
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:35,320
contract leprosy when they went to do the mission work or whatever disease when they went to do that

288
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,240
humanitarian mission some of them did but some of them didn't and the ones that didn't why isn't

289
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,680
there any study on that and why is it when they do study they just say they have a robust immune

290
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:50,200
system or whatever and that's it they don't study the mechanism because there is no material mechanism

291
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:58,840
behind it um it it's again it's a formatting mechanism uh now one part of me say can say well i

292
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,880
wish there was a mechanical mechanism like a virus that did it because then it's purely material

293
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:10,440
they say where gloves and masks that's fine but the mop gear that you're wearing on your face in

294
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:16,440
no turrets called the mop up gear to clean something right uh those masks are not even one micron

295
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:22,120
absolute um you know and the what they're calling a vyruses in the nanometers which is

296
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:30,120
hundred thousand times smaller than the smallest opening on a face mask so that's kind of ridiculous

297
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,480
everyone can has heard more than enough wash your hands day away you know what they call now a

298
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,520
social distancing and all that but there is no talk i assure you at all about the induction of

299
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:45,320
disease that was well known throughout history and also the formatting on how someone has to be

300
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:53,960
formatted to actually accept the information and that's where for example um i say that this is a plan

301
00:31:53,960 --> 00:32:00,120
deliberate attack because if the if the authorities any authority religious governmental policing

302
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:06,280
academic or whatever was really concerned or allowed to show concern they would be suggesting

303
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:12,600
the use of colloidal silver every doctor that's looked into it or any scientists looked into it

304
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,960
they'll tell you i pretty much within 20 minutes gets rid of any biological um condition that's

305
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,760
considered hazard within 20 minutes and it would would just someone has it in their body or is

306
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:27,480
developed in their body within 12 hours there's no talk about colloidal silver at all there's no

307
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:34,040
talk about ozoneation you know where you have an ozone machine ozone machines are used in industry

308
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:41,560
very often to disinfect things because of the ionization um like giardia is one of the

309
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:48,520
was a big um parasite in in in water for a very long time and any place that installed

310
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:56,840
ozone an ozone machine within the water line uh you know a neutralized it or eradicated it so again

311
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,880
you'll always hear an argument uh they're always going to try to lawyer the argument we'll say

312
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,600
we'll greek you know look at all the stuff about this or you know it doesn't work or this is toxic or

313
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,960
this is whatever so again you're always going to hear a contrary point of view to this because

314
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:17,000
number one there's no money in ozoneating because once you buy the machine you as long as it keeps

315
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,240
working it's good for life and there's no money that to market colloidal silver because you know

316
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:30,840
a few grams of silver can make enough colloidal silver water for a million people so it doesn't really

317
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:42,520
suit you know the the economic model so again the um the research that someone can do there is on

318
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:48,600
i believe on on the internet a few interviews with some older people that survived the american

319
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:54,360
words called the spanish blue and there's an interview with an older lady and she's sitting

320
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:00,600
there telling people that well no one in our family caught it because every morning our mother would

321
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,440
put some soda and water and have us drink it and she says it balanced and cleaned our system and

322
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,720
whoever did that didn't get it now when she says soda i'm suggesting she means a baking soda

323
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:19,000
so when you some people say well that makes you alkaline and all that but you know okay that that's

324
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,160
all right to say that but it's not the alkaline because soda hydroxide which is more alkaline

325
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:31,320
doesn't help you see so it's the it's what the mineral soda is it changes your format just like for

326
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:39,160
example when someone drinks a lot of alcohol doesn't it change their format you ever notice how they

327
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:44,280
can't walk very well anymore their speech is slurred their thinking is dulled or not as sharp

328
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:51,560
their facial expressions change they smell differently right just a little bit of alcohol

329
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:56,440
if you compare it to the volume of the human body can change completely change someone's format or

330
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:02,120
even just a tiny amount of alcohol that gives someone a buzz changes their format you know they're

331
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:08,600
being you see so that's what i mean by formatting the colloidal silver does very much the same they

332
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:13,240
don't understand the vehicle and they don't want to understand it publicly because it makes you

333
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:19,720
self-sufficient the benefits of colloidal silver but if you search around there are mainstream

334
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:26,520
scientists and doctors that have been asked i'm sure i haven't looked at it but i've seen it in the past

335
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:31,800
because there are many suggested outbreaks in society worldwide and in and what they call the

336
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:37,160
United States for past decade or two but they always comment especially the older doctors that yeah

337
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,120
colloidal silver will knock everything out but we just haven't tested it on this one yet right

338
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:48,840
so and there's other things i mean other things that are are beyond mentioning that can

339
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:55,160
can still be discovered and with the level of panic that we've seen people display whether it's

340
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:00,520
the run on the supermarkets or the hostility towards certain ethnic groups that they feel carry the

341
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:06,520
pathogen what have you observed in your locale Greek how have your surroundings changed in recent months

342
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:13,480
recent months more like the recent two weeks or so no matter where i go even a premium shop i

343
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:20,120
can't find rice right to buy and i have rice but i'm just saying i see the empty shelves and all that

344
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:26,120
which again you know i don't know if you've run into people recently right and being sarcastic

345
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:32,120
here but they're not too smart so when you see consistent events throughout places it's been planned

346
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:37,320
you know let's some groups sitting around somewhere saying you know let's start getting the notion of

347
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,680
a run on the market you know you go in here today and buy all the toilet paper and you go over there

348
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:47,400
and buy all that some people come in they see it's empty and then all of a sudden they got the idea

349
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:54,040
you see otherwise people are too stupid to hoard or do anything even riot believe it or not

350
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:59,160
there has to be a provocateur this seems like a provocateur type thing and it's also on both lines

351
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:03,800
i think they are telling it they're they're i looked up online about the supply of rice i was just

352
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,680
curious and all the manufacturers are everyone saying there's plenty of food to go around and then

353
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:15,720
you'll be other talk about oh but the logistics have changed a little bit right so artificial

354
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:21,560
scarcity i mean the people that run this world or own this world and run it have no problem with

355
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:28,120
dumping food into the ocean so you can starve and the sooner you understand that the more

356
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:33,800
clear you'll have a clarity you'll have on why things are happening right and when they're talking

357
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,960
about health is your concern your safety they wouldn't want anything more than everyone pretty

358
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:43,800
much wiped out but would would just a group of not necessarily mindless slaves left because they're

359
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:50,600
already mindless but obedient unquestioning without a doubt type of slave to be left over in in the human

360
00:37:50,600 --> 00:38:00,760
aspect but again what i see going on is i my my my needs are very minimal like for example

361
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:06,280
i did run out of paper towels and toilet paper and all that i've had a couple of rolls or whatever

362
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:11,800
and i've noticed for the past two weeks they're not around right so where is another supply chain to

363
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:17,960
get paper hmm restaurants supply i call up the restaurant supply i say do you guys have any like

364
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:25,240
table napkins you know and you know rolls of paper for the bathroom she said no toilet paper but hand

365
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:30,200
rolls and napkins we've got all the you'd ever want and happen to know some of these people and

366
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:37,560
i went and got about a year supply for less than 30 or 40 bucks of all kinds of paper goods but do i go

367
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:42,920
around and telling people go to the restaurant supply and you'll have all the paper you want you

368
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:50,040
know instead of the regular store yeah i just did indeed yeah by saying it here so last thing about

369
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:57,320
the um current health crisis the pandemics of the past 15 years you know we've had a bunch since

370
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:02,600
the 2000s with the SARS in the bird flu and swine flu and the merse outbreak in the bowl and zika

371
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:08,760
and so on and so forth they have not resulted in the level of crackdown that we're seeing currently so

372
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,320
i'm not sure whether this is something that will blow over and then resurface again in a few years

373
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,520
as the other pandemics have or if this is an outbreak that will reshape the world through violent

374
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:25,560
loss of life loss of business and the introduction of policies that curtailed people's freedoms from

375
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:32,840
what you know should we anticipate the latter or the former uh maybe uh let me just put it another way

376
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:39,480
i would say that people haven't been free for over a century uh they're perceived freedoms which

377
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:45,320
is fine like i've said another sonics you could pretty much do anything to people if you use psychology

378
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:51,240
giving example uh you have you ever heard me mention that there's going to be a pitophyllia

379
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:57,880
petarastic and cannibalism agenda thrusted into society and it'll be welcomed and put to put to use

380
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:04,360
i think i've said that in the past now if you mention that to people now they'll say no way but

381
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:11,400
you know it's coming and you will love it because you're going to fall for it so i don't see any

382
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,480
i just see the way things are changing a little bit uh to lead to what i've been saying for a long

383
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:23,640
time which is the the focal of power going from the western world to the you know what's called

384
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:29,640
southwest Asia or the middle east as you find in some of the ancient prophecies um again uh

385
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:36,600
the i just see dead people just walking around and they don't know where they are what they are or

386
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:43,480
what's going on so in terms of the authorities uh doing uh whatever they're doing shenanigans you know

387
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,200
even if they opened concentration camps and decided to put half the population in there i think

388
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:53,960
there'll be minimum resistance in other words the possibility to resist the authority that is put

389
00:40:53,960 --> 00:41:00,600
in place right now is impossible because everyone's tied into the digital network and um that's

390
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:07,400
what i see all right then well i feel like we've talked enough about what's going on at present time

391
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,120
and how that might spill over into the near future but i also want to talk about the further future

392
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:17,000
and what lies in next year and beyond but i also think it's worth looking at one of the frames of

393
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,360
reference we're using for that kind of prediction which is the system of time keeping modern man

394
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:27,880
keeps time using the grigorian calendar something which the Greek refers to as a pope works schedule

395
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,360
with a bit of derision i think and i believe the implication is that it's a calendar system that

396
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:38,120
originated from a papal decree which serves more as a metric for monitoring one subjects than anything

397
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:43,160
else can you talk a bit about why the calendar the grigorian calendar is something that you regard

398
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:50,600
with such scoffing anything unlawful i try to regard as scoffing it's not lawful meaning it has no

399
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:57,080
bearing in in anything that is accountable it's completely arbitrary and it's based on uh it

400
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:03,400
in order for the Vatican system or Catholics to exist you need a uh an abundant crop of evil and

401
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:09,320
ignorant people not informed and not good people in other words most of the people that adhere to

402
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,640
this system are ignorant they don't know what's going on and they just tell if they're told it's good

403
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:18,360
they go for it then the evil ones that know what it is and just like having power over people

404
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:23,160
that's all i and there's no ex the only exceptions there are temporary where someone kind of

405
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,960
wakes up to what's going on and looks for an exit strategy either from the belief system or the

406
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,160
actual workings of the institution and i have met a couple of by the way Catholic priests who have

407
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:37,800
quick because they found out what it was about and by the way when if you're an ordained Catholic priest

408
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,520
and you want to get out of the clergy they give you a card and they say go go to this office or call

409
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:49,240
this guy and uh they'll you know continue this type of career and uh one of the guys that did that

410
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,400
had a piece of paper with an address in a phone number he showed up and he looked up at the door it

411
00:42:53,400 --> 00:43:02,760
said central intelligence agency so anyway um uh uh uh it's completely unlawful for example if you

412
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:09,560
study the ref any references to the julien or uh Gregorian system it's considered arbitrary in

413
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:15,240
other words they just count days there are no weeks or months or years uh they started bunching

414
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:21,960
things up with different types of nomenclature for years and months they'll even tell you like the

415
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:27,160
first month of this year is a b year or a d year or whatever i mean it's kind of like a bizarre

416
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:36,280
aspect of uh of you know uh that's been adopted and it's not just that there are other organizations

417
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:41,480
and institutions that try to institute their own timekeeping system like myans that are 20-day

418
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:47,880
month right yeah Stalin tried to have a 10-day work week uh Eastman Kodak in Rochester New York

419
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:54,120
tried to develop his own time IBM did develop their own time schedule for their workers so basically

420
00:43:54,120 --> 00:44:00,920
it's just the memorialization of events for scheduling purposes but to be lawful it means that anyone

421
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,960
can do it once they understand the process and there's nothing really to buy you're not dependent on

422
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:12,840
some uh fictional arbitrary system like for example if you study timekeeping it's in the language as well

423
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:20,120
for thousands of years people try to settle their debts before the full moon came which is the new

424
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:25,640
moon by the way rises in the east it's not the darks with their moon that they call the new moon that's

425
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,960
in a part of an Egyptian nomenclature which i may or may not discuss at the moment but

426
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:36,520
people always try to settle their debts uh by the full moon that's why today uh they try to

427
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:45,400
settle bills with you with every moon you get it they get a moonfully bill uh also you look at the

428
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:51,960
way that time is done in reckoning the days the day starts at high noon at solar noon and these

429
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:57,880
two things i just said about the moon and the day starting at solar noon are typically found in

430
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:04,600
astronomy not astrology but astronomy 101 classes or the first year of astronomy in university

431
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:10,440
they do go through this so you could look up that for scientific and academic purposes

432
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:18,680
the day starts at solar noon but for the people it's civil mid-knife right so for example uh again

433
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:25,960
regarding the the moon i mean or actually regarding the day if people remember the pre-electronic

434
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:31,400
banking conventions if you deposited a check in the bank before or afternoon i should say

435
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:37,480
it was counted as the next day right there's an old song i think it was the door as the night divides

436
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:44,840
the day right so basically you go from noon to noon um that's why uh you know you have uh something

437
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,880
like break fast right you eat break fast in the morning because you fast for the day and you break

438
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:55,560
your fast at the end of the day which is right before noon now this if anyone studying any older

439
00:45:55,560 --> 00:46:01,480
ancient rits and understands uh timekeeping you will uh you'll get a pretty good handle on what's

440
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:09,960
going on in terms of the year the yearly cycle um again the catholic vatican principle is uh

441
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:16,360
got to jam it all together uh to make it work and the year is not about the year's rotation around

442
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:22,280
the sun but the actual return of the sun or the return of the seasons to the year the typical

443
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:26,840
measurable years go from spring to fall and then the winter is an interim period you could look at

444
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:34,760
spring as being a time of starting new projects or planting sowing um uh you know a new development

445
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:40,280
summer is the time for it to grow fall is a harvest and winter is an interim period

446
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:47,480
humans are agricultural like if you were uh an agricultural individual you'd be there at the

447
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:52,440
springtime you'd be there in the summer and you'd be there in the fall those are critical times

448
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:56,760
but let's say you needed to replace the roof or build a new wagon wheel or you needed

449
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:01,640
to go on a long trip somewhere you didn't do it in the spring or the summer or the fall you did it

450
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:07,480
in the winter the winter is an interim period usually for that for those things because if you

451
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:12,520
try to do it during the spring summer or fall you're taking time away from production uh on the

452
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:18,760
uh you know of agriculture so once you understand these cycles and people are still agricultural by

453
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:25,400
the way you you're not um uh you can also think of it you know uh your a society that started by the

454
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:31,960
by the development of fire or the discovery of fire in almost inner permethane way as a metaphor

455
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,240
and you're pretty much that's the type of society or you can daydream and imagine all you want about

456
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:43,480
how you'd like your society to be technological or so technological just means tools um but can

457
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:49,320
you imagine a society that developed magnetism instead of fire it would be very different than yours

458
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:54,680
so you're kind of uh all you can imagine and no matter how far fetched it is it still brings you

459
00:47:54,680 --> 00:48:00,040
back to being agricultural and if in anyone that works with agriculture if you're not lawful you're

460
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:07,480
going to suffer great loss right so in other words if you don't handle the spring summer uh and fall

461
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:12,680
properly you're probably going to starve unless you have enough set aside and you'd have to do it

462
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:18,440
right the next year to keep it going that's what i mean by lawful timekeeping in other words having a

463
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:28,920
a record a way to memorialize events which is time uh that is there can be picked up at anyone at any time

464
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:37,240
uh for example what a lawful timekeeping system does is transcends various other arbitrary

465
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:43,480
modalities meaning like an arbitrary modality would be the Gregorian, Julian or the Mayan or the

466
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:51,720
Egyptian those are like brand name uh timekeeping modalities and once that society goes away at knowledge

467
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:59,560
of how to use their timekeeping goes away you've lost also their record of time you see um so if you

468
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:06,600
keep to record uh recording and memorializing events by lawful timekeeping means which is using the

469
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:12,520
earth uh the sun and the moon and then of course for longer durations the constellations uh no matter

470
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:18,440
where you are uh on the earth you'll always have a pretty accurate record of memorializing those events

471
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:28,280
all right but um even though the Gregorian system can be shown to be fallacious it is widely known that

472
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:33,240
we have a lot of other ones that outdate the julian system such as the Iranian calendar the Chinese

473
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:38,440
one the eastern orthodox have their own calendar i think the assyrian culture also has their own

474
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:43,560
which amongst those kinds of systems should be given pre-eminence do any of them map perfectly

475
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:49,240
onto the lawfulness that you speak of none of them none of them work because they they're trying to

476
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:56,520
use a form of divination and mathematics to make it work on a schedule basis and it really is

477
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:01,400
observational in other words they're not lawful systems for example you could look at those systems

478
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:08,120
and they consider the new moon to be the dark moon there is a small remnant of the old

479
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:13,960
bow religion which is now called buddhism uh which is actually a pretty horrible society back then they

480
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:19,880
were they were pretty nasty people but uh they do consider in their calendrical system the full moon

481
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:28,040
to be the new moon but outside of that it falls apart again i would say that that old bow system uh

482
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:33,720
they they might have come close to having something closely lawful but whenever you see the dark moon

483
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:40,440
being the new moon you're looking at that palio or i should say palio i mean yeah it is paleo-egyptian

484
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:47,880
first dynasty system and maybe i should just cover that typically they relied the priesthood or the

485
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:58,680
the pharonic priesthood the the kafaz uh relied on astronomical signs um and uh they relied on uh

486
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:05,160
a full moon system uh meaning meaning look there's also something as a lunar calendar but the moon

487
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:11,800
to determine the month which were debts were settled and also it's a turn of of of events based

488
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:22,520
on a grouping of weeks uh four weeks uh and there was a lot of you might call it uh consideration

489
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:28,040
that the celestial were not as they are taught today millions of miles away or whatever but they

490
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:33,160
believed that all of the celestial that they saw were within reach within the sky that we see

491
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:40,520
and they were subject to predation meaning uh what if a big monster or demon came and swallowed the

492
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:46,920
moon we would no longer be able to uh determine time with the moon and that would really suck wouldn't it

493
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:55,240
so uh if we if the big monster comes and eats the moon up in the sky uh how do we manage our monthly

494
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:00,920
you know things that we have to do well the only one that could really substitute that is what comes

495
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:06,920
out of the mouth of pharaoh well so when the moon started going towards the middle of the month you know

496
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:13,560
which was the the dark phase they told pharaoh listen you can't go anywhere you must stay in the palace

497
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:19,400
you stay here uh until the moon reappears because if it doesn't reappear and it's been perdated on by

498
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:27,160
some sky monster you now take its place right and you must guide us right so pharaoh is like okay

499
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:32,440
you know let's see what's on that flicks right i have to be in the palace for three days you know

500
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:38,200
send me some more young boys or young girls or whatever they were doing at the time and finally when

501
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:43,720
the new moon was cited what they called the new moon uh when the crescent was cited they said ah see

502
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:48,920
the moon has renewed itself it wasn't eaten pharaoh is free to go about his business throughout his realm

503
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,920
and that means that the moon was renewed so that is our new moon now

504
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:59,640
do you see how ridiculous this is saying that the dark moon can be used for accurate observation

505
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:04,680
as a fallacy because the one of the benefits of having the full moon as your new moon is he put a

506
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:09,480
stick in the ground and you get a shadow which can be recorded where you can't do that with the

507
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:15,480
a dark moon one is a dark one is it not dark it's it takes there's no way to record that where you

508
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:20,200
can actually have what's called quote unquote a sundial or you can actually etch a mark you know

509
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:27,720
it noon if you if you solar noon if you start making a sundial and uh you start marking it where

510
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:33,880
noon time is you'll notice that it moves several arcs every year in other words noon time is a little

511
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:42,120
bit more towards the east this year than it was last year right so you could see the progression of

512
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:49,000
the ages of the centuries and the millennia by where noon time is marked and that is could be done

513
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:57,640
by anyone you don't need a special clinical system so again um to just to get people's minds out

514
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:03,720
of their reference points these are things that we agree on to keep schedule and when if you start

515
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:09,720
agreeing that um you're going to run your life by something that is arbitrary and unlawful do you

516
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:16,200
think there are any side effects to that yeah of course there are yeah it's a so so if you how long can

517
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:24,200
a society uh go through unauthorized acts before they get a pandemic whether it's engineered or natural

518
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:31,400
it's irrelevant do you see is it well deserved i don't know if if i told you that there's a

519
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:37,000
society of cannibals and headhunters that all died of a pandemic on that on that island based on

520
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,800
way your what your were raised in how much compassion would you have for most people to see i'm glad

521
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:48,360
those savages died right do you think there's possibly uh beyond individuals in other society that

522
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:53,560
is looking at this society is being completely unlawful which it is saying pandemic how come it hasn't

523
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:59,640
wiped them all out whereas this you know why should we sympathize with them right nice either logic

524
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:06,440
there well the purpose of talking about the timekeeping is to lead into the next part which is

525
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:10,120
going to be getting to the end of the the stream which is that we're going to talk about

526
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:15,640
what the future holds and i think that when we talk about looking at things on the timeline it's

527
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:19,560
important to know what timeline it is that you're considering and how to measure that

528
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,320
and more importantly where the source material is for that so what what we haven't talked about with

529
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:29,240
regards to timekeeping is what the source uh literature is on where to get information on the time

530
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:33,960
pieces and how to use them effectively we're not going to look at that on this stream but that's

531
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:38,600
just to say that these are things that you have to look into um but now let's talk about what we can

532
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:43,960
see approaching in the coming years we've got this health crisis here that might evolve into something

533
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:48,600
that's worse we certainly know that there's an economic downturn that's taking place with the lack

534
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:55,320
of business activity um so i want to start with economics greek what do you see happening in the economy

535
00:55:55,320 --> 00:56:02,440
of the near and far future oh well the economy it's not going to go into any kind of a lawful status

536
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:08,200
because the the economy is pretty much governed by uh unlawfulness you know you don't have a lawful

537
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:13,560
means of exchange you don't have a system of law in place you have a legal system that is not law

538
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:19,720
um uh like i think i've mentioned i've even told an attorney who was being sued recently

539
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:23,720
you should study the law and you'll beat the other attorney because attorneys don't know anything

540
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:32,360
about law and he says yeah that's right okay so there is no law uh you have uh uh uh a series

541
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:39,400
of events that are going to take place with considering the apathy of humanity right they're just

542
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:44,680
going to brush themselves off and like i said earlier if you uh turn you know turned on what they

543
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:48,600
call the news and they said well we're gonna have to report half of the society to concentration

544
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:53,640
camps that they'll that'll happen they can they'll do that that's how dumb the people are uh

545
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:59,560
across the planet right now um i think there was a financier back turn of the century and uh he was

546
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:07,960
asked uh what are you going to do if um the people find out that the financial system is a scam

547
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:13,320
it's all that's easy i'm just going to pay half i'm going to print enough money um to pay half the

548
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:18,680
people to kill off the other half right so that still holds true today i don't see any negative

549
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:24,440
uh anything negative coming out of this as people uh that are doom and gloomers i think this is

550
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:31,160
just another nine eleven type event um which i've mentioned in the past look for these axial type

551
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:39,080
mini axial periods that change the way things uh uh are conducted are the the common the common

552
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:46,680
conversation for example after what's uh september 11th 2001 they said well this is a post nine eleven

553
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:53,480
world right well now it's going to be a past corona virus world right that's that's you'll hear of that

554
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:59,240
a little bit now and a lot of the things that you see imposed on the public now that they accept

555
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:05,080
will carry through but that is irrelevant uh what i mean by being irrelevant is if you look at where

556
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:10,440
you are in the movie you're near the end of well the movie already ended you're looking at the

557
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:16,040
credits and simply these crises and quote unquote uh terror events and wars and all these things

558
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:20,440
that you're seeing are just rehashing things that have happened in history before to lead mankind to

559
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:27,160
the final wrap-up of their worldwide society before the new society starts so that was a lot to say

560
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:33,080
in one sentence but i would suggest that the next thing to look for after this is you know whatever

561
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:38,840
whatever restrictions you see that are put on society will be of course uh accepted there will be no

562
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:47,560
memory of anything before this as usual and uh you will uh continue uh uh to see what's called the

563
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:54,120
western world as being quote unquote a superpower and i'm including the russian system from a military

564
00:58:54,120 --> 00:59:00,520
point of view they consider that a superpower also but the western superpower is being uh brought

565
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:06,920
lower and lower and lower in their economic productive ability and uh social moral standards

566
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:14,680
and whatever else you you want to judge a society by and within the interim you're going to see

567
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:22,760
a reorganization in rapid form and uh what's called investment meaning of time of thought energy

568
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:31,640
material goods um political affirmation in in the place uh southwest Asia known as the Middle East

569
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:38,200
and you will see the Middle East starting to grow by by by description that i just gave and beyond

570
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:44,280
and the western powers meaning Europe and the United States and what have you though the black

571
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:50,440
nobility the old way of things that's going to start to play second fiddle to an emerging

572
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:58,440
economy political status um uh entertainment status scientific status and all that in the Middle East

573
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:09,320
generally is what you're going to start seeing not yet probably beyond uh 2022 summertime uh 2022

574
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:15,320
the fall uh around 2023 you're going to see a lot of activity towards what i just mentioned

575
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:21,960
and by the year uh on the Pope's work schedule 2025 there'll be no doubt that there is a tremendous

576
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:27,880
amount of investment and uh emphasis being put on that part of the world meaning the Middle East

577
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:35,560
all right then that is something that people will have to keep an eye on and so having covered

578
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:41,560
the range of topics i planned for this episode i'd say that we're at the end of the Greek speak podcast

579
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:46,680
but i would like to conclude the stream by asking the Greek to restate some exposition that i've heard

580
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:52,360
you speak on the past which served as my entry point into Greek speak what i first reacted to was

581
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:58,280
when you spoke of how mankind is so utterly unable to identify the cause of their condition

582
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:04,520
and the underlying ordinance behind their traditions so you've illuminated that by talking about

583
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:10,520
where mankind gets lost from and by explaining how ancient practices of the past have been revived

584
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:16,760
through parity in a way that still pays homage to the powers that actually ruled the world so can we

585
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:22,120
end things off by revisiting some of those things sure one of the things that we might have brought up in

586
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:27,320
note recently was with two cannibals birthdays and dolls have in common and i think most of the people

587
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:33,880
unless there are new listeners probably uh i've heard this before also i will give you that

588
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:40,200
in a second but i also want to reiterate what you just said which is i've looked at most of the things if

589
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:47,160
not all of the things that men man kinds culture celebrate and they all have some kind of a root

590
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:56,680
in something very macabre either murder rape or the sacrificing of children and i have not found

591
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:03,480
very little if not anything that is not based on basically murder may ham rape or child sacrifice

592
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:08,120
and also i'm going to put out something that i haven't said before there's a whole myriad of them

593
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:14,360
but you know the clown face also you know the how clowns are always shown to children as being a happy

594
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:20,280
joyous celebratory thing and then maybe i should give you a little bit of that first maybe before

595
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:27,720
the cannibals birthdays and dolls and most people have been aware of my criticism of subculture known as

596
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:33,080
the kids culture and kids are baby goats of course which is a sacrificial animal but there there's no

597
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:37,720
if the future depends on your children you have none because all your all your children have been

598
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:41,480
turned into goats with your mouth by calling them kids in the english language at least

599
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:49,320
but one of the celebratory figures that you typically see in the kids culture the kids subculture

600
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:57,480
is the the involvement of this clown figure you see it in the Ronald McDonald's stuff you see it in

601
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:03,880
a lot of their toys you see it as something to be observed as you know a happy go lucky celebratory

602
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:08,680
humorous whatever and of course there's been a play on you know the killer clowns now and all this

603
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:17,720
other stuff but the clown face itself with the exaggerated mouth the very pale skin and the exaggerated

604
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:25,880
distorted eyebrows and eyes and distorted hair comes from an effigy or basically the recordation

605
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:32,520
of an event that was basically started with the gladiators actually came before the gladiators in

606
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:40,040
Rome but i'll give them as an example within certain of games the the victor in a glad in about with

607
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:45,800
another gladiator would of course kill his victim it was a fight to the death and then to celebrate

608
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:52,520
that death and to show his willingness to you know basically take on that person you know take

609
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:57,480
whatever that person had that made them that person was it the in front of the audience they would

610
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:06,440
remove and skin off the face of their victim and they would place it over their own face and of

611
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:10,840
course if you tore someone's face off and put it on your face the eyes would be distorted the mouth

612
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:15,000
would be stretched out in the hair would be right just like the clown face with the pale skin

613
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:21,160
there's no blood rushing through it so we're talking about a very macabre some people may not be

614
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:25,640
macabre basically if you spoke to the people in the audience back then they probably liked it

615
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:31,560
but that is what the clown face came from and this is what you're putting in front of your children

616
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:38,280
so another thing you're putting in front of your children is what do cannibals birthdays and

617
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:43,240
dolls have in common and that sounds like an absurd question because they don't seem interrelated

618
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:51,000
at all well yes they are for first of all when we consider the ancient cultures even in many of

619
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:58,040
the secular public fool systems or education systems they tell you the society started

620
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:04,680
in the middle east the Mesopotamian area and they had a language it was basically a vernacular

621
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:10,680
or a type of language known as Hebrew caldian and the the priests of that culture were known as

622
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:17,080
the cahons and what they would essentially do is from a very dark sense tell people if they wanted

623
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:23,320
prosperity they had to sacrifice a child and not only sacrifice it but take some you take eat some

624
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:27,640
of the flesh it didn't matter how much you ate just as long as you put some of the flesh in your

625
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:33,640
in your body that's why the eating of human flesh is basically the cahon ballism because the God

626
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:38,600
that you were doing it for was a ball or a lord today when you go to church they tell you to worship

627
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:46,280
the lord right so in essence you know it's it could be argued to some degree but most things do

628
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:53,240
show etymologically the word cahon ball or cannibal does come from that source from a western

629
01:05:53,240 --> 01:06:01,320
word perspective and of course anyone if you mentioned cannibalism they do understand what you're saying

630
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:07,320
but they don't understand this was a ritualistic right in ancient religious practices and the term

631
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:12,120
ball is still carried over in the Christian and many other religions as the lord as well

632
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:19,080
so what was interesting about this is the people didn't notice much prosperity coming from this

633
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:27,480
so eventually what they did is they started doing a parody of this but before I get to the

634
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:33,080
parody I left out what the doll the purpose of the doll was because it's cannibal's birthdays and dolls

635
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:38,840
when the parents returned back home after the sacrifice was done the other siblings asked where

636
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:44,920
their sibling was their brother or sister so the altar boys of the priest of the lord or the cannibal

637
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:50,360
would make an effigy or a small model of the child and you call the doll so the children were told

638
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:55,480
here play with this because your brother and sister is away for now right they lie to the children

639
01:06:55,480 --> 01:07:01,000
like they do today and the children at least had a doll instead of their brother or sister so now

640
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,880
you understand the you know little girls like to play with dolls oh yes they do because maybe the

641
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:10,840
little girls were more emotionally attached to their brother or sister than the young boys but they

642
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:17,080
did also develop dolls for boys later on as well so you're looking at the macabre again ritual

643
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:24,520
interstill maintained in current traditions now again this didn't bring prosperity so why not

644
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:29,880
do for those that were too squeamish instead of sacrificing the child why don't we do parody

645
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:36,840
the event so you bake a loaf of sweet bread which represents the child and you put lights in it which

646
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:44,360
represents the life and everyone attending the ceremony makes a wish of makes a brings presence

647
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:52,280
because the the person who this celebration is for usually the child is to make a wish of

648
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:57,560
prosperity because it's about prosperity and they blow out the lights which is the life and they all

649
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:03,320
eat some of the cake which is the body of the child in symbolism and to show that the wish of

650
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:09,320
prosperity was met gracefully the participants bring little presence or gifts to the ceremony

651
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:17,000
so there's your birthday cake celebration again mimicking and parodying a human sacrifice

652
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,320
you might even see very often when there's a lot of criticism even today on these

653
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:28,200
pedophile networks they're quote-unquote elites or upper level of society whatever they always have

654
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:34,760
a parody at the dinner table or whatever of a human body of some sort still even though they

655
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:43,320
they actually doing the real thing behind the scenes so there's your there's your wonderful

656
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:49,480
western technologically evolved society with your birthdays and your dolls and your clowns

657
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:55,800
yeah that is quite a recontextualization of the things that most people think are innocuous or

658
01:08:55,800 --> 01:09:02,680
even worse enjoyable right and you can go on and on with what they call the Valentine's day heart

659
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:08,440
is not the human heart or a heart of anything because everyone knows that the heart looks like a human

660
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:15,640
fist those are the frontal view of a woman's genitalia you know which enroman in other societies

661
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:23,640
on that day were cut off and nailed to a door or what do you call mounted and dried so you can have it

662
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:32,200
as a charm yep and so let's let's end things off with the this idea that your law comes from

663
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:38,920
you God that is the maximum that is the standard on this planet the maximum meaning that everyone

664
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:44,280
knows this it doesn't even have to be written wherever you see any law form throughout history there

665
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:50,760
was always a de-effic defied figure attached to it and you'll see this throughout history no matter

666
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:57,640
where you look and just to point out in case anyone hasn't noticed you'll you have all countries all

667
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:03,000
the sovereign states which are corporations or brand names you know that whatever country you want

668
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:09,480
to associate with or consider has a department of justice or a hall of justice with a goddess statue

669
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:16,840
if you go that infinite bastion of knowledge Wikipedia ha ha ha they will show you photographs of no

670
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:23,480
less than 30 or 40 countries that have adapted this you know pretty much and they're

671
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:29,000
priesthood is the the bar association right so you might people say well you know what you ran

672
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:35,720
in is enemy of the u.s or North Korea is enemy of the u.s but they all have bar associations you know

673
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:41,960
it's kind of ridiculous again but wherever you look through history and even in modern society the

674
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:51,720
current goddess that's revered by the modern society is justicia it's a revived goddess religion

675
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:57,800
so no matter how you want to take that as negative or positive it's true you'll always have some kind

676
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:05,480
of a de-metron or patron god within your law form but there's also this is sort of also more general

677
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:10,920
idea that people have to get their operating system from something that is higher up the

678
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:16,520
hierarchy than they are whether it's children looking to their parents or it's grown men and women

679
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:22,280
looking to something else right the way things are done on this planet is you have an authoritative

680
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:28,120
figure and there's another maxim that if you make men your authority you're going to have slavery

681
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:34,040
in oppression where if you make the gods your authority you don't you actually have freedom

682
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:41,320
right because you answer to them and they're non-material so from that point of view you could look at

683
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:47,560
classifications and memorializations of law throughout history and you will find that it's probably

684
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:52,920
best memorialized in what's known as the biblical text i'm not suggesting you go read a lot of the

685
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:58,440
versions and things that are put out but if you're not familiar with it you can do a study on what's

686
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:04,840
called biblical law and you will see that it is probably the most diverse and most let's say

687
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:14,040
widest aspect of law form there you'll also find that historically they like to talk about

688
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:21,320
homerabi code and things like that and if you they attribute that for example to a king homerabi but

689
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:31,000
he had a god that he was justified to do this for you see so and of course the biblical god is Yahweh

690
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:37,080
and you don't see that in your verses oh you don't see this in your biblical versions because of

691
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:46,920
the Judean influence which put a ban on the use of his name 2200 years ago in fear of

692
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:56,200
one of the for example hedge laws or halaka laws which is to prevent blasphemy because if to prevent

693
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:02,920
well if no one spoke his name there's no way blasphemy could be committed you see so if you don't see

694
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:09,480
Yahweh written in your Bible that is because of a quote unquote a contemporary Jewish influence or

695
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:15,160
Judaism influence in the rabbinical sense which in essence is contrary to what the Bible says

696
01:13:15,160 --> 01:13:21,960
itself because the biblical text says to proclaim his name freely so you're gonna have to

697
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:30,280
pro or not you but this conversation or this type of expository information could will take

698
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:37,880
of another set of sonic events to talk about yes of course and that does it I think there isn't much

699
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:42,120
more that we can say that would motivate people to look into these things if they still don't feel

700
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:47,400
like looking into it and so what remains now I think is to delve into the finer points of things and

701
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:53,160
tackle the high level subjects that concern mankind's existence and for my part I'll be doing that

702
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:58,200
by setting up a new website later in the year for that it's gonna be looking into things that most

703
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:03,400
people consider perhaps esoteric today but those things will become more familiar as time goes on

704
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:08,200
and can I count on the Greek perhaps to join me for a podcast for that when it's ready?

705
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:15,640
I don't know if you can but yes you may I'm just joking I'll take that all right well thank you

706
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:21,160
again to everyone who's tuned into the streams we've done quite a few and I'm grateful for anybody

707
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:27,160
that stuck around it means that the effort was reciprocated so even though the podcast is over I'm

708
01:14:27,160 --> 01:14:33,000
gonna be directing my energies towards greekspeak.com still by writing articles for the rest of the year

709
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:38,520
before launching the new website which will focus on like I said the unseen realm of things

710
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:43,240
and then I also want to extend a thank you to the greek you've taken the time and of course these

711
01:14:43,240 --> 01:14:48,360
podcasts don't exist without you I couldn't ramble on for an hour and a half on my own so thank you

712
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:53,720
very much for your contribution. Oh you're welcome and you know I couldn't ramble on for an hour and a

713
