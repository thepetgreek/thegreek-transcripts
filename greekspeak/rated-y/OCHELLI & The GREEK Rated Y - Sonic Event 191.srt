1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,780
The Sonic Event 191, here we are, Greek,

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,280
how are you today?

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,840
I'm tired, I'm going to go to sleep

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,900
soon as we finish this.

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,980
Yeah, it's just very windy, doing auto mechanic

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,200
stuff today and all kinds of stuff.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,100
Been up since four in the morning.

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,060
You just replaced your transmission or just had

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,100
your transmission replaced?

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:31,820
Yeah, but I'm doing something else.

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,920
I haven't done anything on it in really

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,460
a decade other than basic coil changes and

13
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,480
I was like, oh my gosh.

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,000
Hey look, if you don't have to do

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,200
a lot of work, that's great, outside of

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,180
general maintenance, right?

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,340
I mean, that's the whole point.

18
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,800
No, I did, I do a lot of

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,380
stuff, mounts, all kinds of stuff.

20
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,820
I usually prefer to bring it to someone,

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,040
but mechanics suck.

22
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,880
Even like really good mechanics, they're not very

23
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,140
good.

24
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:56,920
I hate to say it.

25
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,300
Well, you know what it is.

26
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,700
It's like going out and eating in a

27
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,500
restaurant, you know?

28
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,440
There aren't any good restaurants anymore.

29
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,700
They do have those computers nowadays, though, that

30
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,460
for the past like 10, 15 years, they've

31
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,080
had something they can just plug the computer

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,640
and the computer tells them what's wrong, right?

33
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,200
Isn't that like the general?

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,640
Well, that's the OBD system.

35
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,820
We've kind of brought that up.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,380
OBD is onboard diagnostics.

37
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,320
Yeah.

38
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,200
Yeah, sort of.

39
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,800
That doesn't tell you much, just a bunch

40
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,340
of sensors.

41
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,060
I'm talking about the workmanship, really.

42
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, okay.

43
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,240
Workmanship is poor.

44
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:26,940
Absolutely.

45
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,660
Well, isn't it poor on everything?

46
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,720
So look, I've got a bunch of oddball

47
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,380
questions this time, and I'm grouping them together,

48
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,120
and I got one stupid one to open

49
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,980
up with you just real fast, just philosophically.

50
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,920
I'm curious about this myself, and probably you

51
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,040
don't do this, but you ever have one

52
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,740
of those like days where you do a

53
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,920
couple of really just dumb things and you

54
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,760
can't figure out why?

55
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,080
You know, the day where you press the

56
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,180
coffee maker and you're sitting there going, why

57
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,460
isn't my coffee brewing?

58
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,140
And then you realize it's not plugged in.

59
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,720
You know, like that kind of stuff you

60
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,360
do a few times in the course of

61
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,640
a day, and you're just like, man, I'm

62
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,780
off this day.

63
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,740
Do you do that ever, or are you

64
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,660
immune to that?

65
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,080
I'm immune to that.

66
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,560
Okay.

67
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,720
I got a lot of radar around me.

68
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,680
I got you.

69
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,700
You know the Terminator?

70
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,060
When you see it from his point of

71
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,320
view and he's got these...

72
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,180
Oh, he's got the analytical, here's the responses,

73
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,060
here's all of the vectors.

74
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,360
Yeah, that's how I function, yeah.

75
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,100
Oh, that's cool.

76
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:22,600
Yeah, that's cool.

77
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,060
Well, I don't, obviously, but I was just

78
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,500
curious, because I notice that those things sometimes

79
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,680
come in batches, and I was just thinking

80
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,000
about it, and it doesn't matter what my

81
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,840
physical being is.

82
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,660
Anyways, so like I said, there's weird questions

83
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,380
here, and this one, they actually make a

84
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,740
reference to a biblical passage, and Ezekiel 34

85
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,120
and 35, excuse me, and no one talks

86
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,660
about this.

87
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,060
Can the Greeks talk about it?

88
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,500
Okay, it was the prince of Israel, okay?

89
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,000
Will he be ruling in the next society?

90
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,060
Is this person someone who is coming in

91
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,040
the future that is referred to in Ezekiel

92
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,940
34 and 35?

93
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,360
Okay, how about that?

94
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,620
Yeah, it'll be coming from the future, but

95
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:16,480
it's complex, because most likely things like that

96
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,360
you read in what they call the Bible

97
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
are like hyperlinks.

98
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,980
In other words, you have to look at

99
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,220
the phrase as something that's a directive or

100
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,960
a strong subject matter to be defined in

101
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,060
other places, typically.

102
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,740
That's just the style that it's written in.

103
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,560
And like most hyperlinks, it's got some of

104
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,020
the information that's relevant in the hyperlink, but

105
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,380
you have to actually go to the page

106
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,260
to get the whole thing.

107
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,900
Yeah, you have to know it all, and

108
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,660
you can't just read.

109
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,880
That's why in religions they just have you

110
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,420
read one verse, you know, because it's understood

111
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,200
that you cannot read it piece by piece.

112
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,320
You have to read the entire thing, really,

113
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,840
even though it was written over a big

114
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,540
time span.

115
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,620
That's why people don't understand it.

116
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,460
When you read it all, let's say you

117
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,460
were to read all of it in one

118
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,800
shot, the entire Bible, right?

119
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,260
You would understand it way better than if

120
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,500
you spent 20 years reading it the way

121
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,140
people read it.

122
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,120
It gave me two different versions of it,

123
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,400
reading this thing they call the Bible, reading

124
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,240
it cover to cover over the course of

125
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,740
about a year.

126
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,800
I just read it like that.

127
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,279
It took me a little time, you know,

128
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:17,980
eyesight and everything.

129
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,500
And then other times I read it in

130
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,340
pieces and this and that and finished it,

131
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,560
but didn't actually dedicate myself to reading it

132
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,160
every day.

133
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,520
And it gave me two different perspectives on

134
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,420
it, for sure, even though it was only

135
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,380
a few years apart.

136
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,180
Try to read each book in a day.

137
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,920
So read Genesis in a day, the next

138
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,180
day read, right?

139
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,080
So in a month you'll have it done,

140
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,280
or a month and a week or whatever.

141
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,100
Yeah, I did that temporarily and then kind

142
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,320
of got off track and then had to

143
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:46,880
go back to it.

144
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,740
That was that other time, outside of when

145
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,100
I did it.

146
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,780
But if you actually read it, see, everybody

147
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,040
says they read it.

148
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,700
No one wants to say they didn't read

149
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:53,800
it.

150
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,940
They're like, oh, yeah, I read it, too.

151
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,180
And everybody says, oh, good, you read it,

152
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:56,340
too.

153
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,200
Nobody read it.

154
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,660
Nobody's really read the Bible.

155
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,120
I hate to say it.

156
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,460
Nobody.

157
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,780
No, I read that book.

158
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,760
Even people who say, not nobody, there's very

159
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,480
few exceptions people actually read it.

160
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:05,840
Yeah.

161
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,980
And can retain it and comprehend it is

162
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,960
completely off.

163
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,720
Well, retaining it and comprehending it is another.

164
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,460
There's got to be fewer than 1,000

165
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,260
people on the planet who have actually read

166
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,780
it and try to comprehend it.

167
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,700
I mean, it's one of those popular, how

168
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,300
would you call it?

169
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,740
You have things like that in culture where

170
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,680
everyone just passes things off as a given.

171
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,780
Like all the people.

172
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,380
I've only met two people in my whole

173
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,820
life that actually read the Bible.

174
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,180
Well, I've read a lot of people that

175
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,680
say they read it 50 times and all

176
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:32,820
that.

177
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,120
So I come up with stuff like, oh,

178
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,960
like, how can you put that together?

179
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,660
Well, I've I've read it, but I've read

180
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,160
that version of it that, you know, obviously

181
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,100
I've read a version of it.

182
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,020
And I read the common English version of

183
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,080
it or whatever they called it.

184
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,880
I can't remember what they even call it

185
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,080
now.

186
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,540
But, you know, where they put it in

187
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,840
more plain American English.

188
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,000
I read that version of it.

189
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,560
I read the King James with the, you

190
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,980
know, the those of the these and the

191
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,800
thousand, all that.

192
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,200
I read both of those things, but it

193
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,520
doesn't mean that I actually retained at all.

194
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,400
Maybe it was a mistake to write the

195
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,260
Bible, because like I say, if you write

196
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:10,040
a book, you're presuming that the readership has

197
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,700
comprehension.

198
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,980
That is the problem always.

199
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,260
And I was thinking that when I watched

200
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,400
the Capitol Hill hearings today on the JFK

201
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,480
case, it was kind of funny.

202
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,000
But anyway, maybe I'll talk to you about

203
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,920
that another day.

204
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,340
That's fine.

205
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,480
Here's the thing.

206
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:24,800
Yeah.

207
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,080
These presidents, they're either read in or they're

208
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,520
not and they don't care.

209
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,400
It's a really shitty.

210
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,860
You got to feel sorry for them, whether

211
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,480
they've been assassinated or not.

212
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:33,760
Right.

213
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,060
But they're real shitty people because for either

214
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,380
either way, it's like what I'm trying to

215
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,420
say is, have you stopped beating your wife

216
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,700
yet?

217
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,760
It's that kind of thing.

218
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
Whether no matter how you answer that question,

219
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,160
you're admitting to beating your wife.

220
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:49,660
Right.

221
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,260
The basic history.

222
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,600
They're presuming that no one knows the history,

223
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,280
which is pretty good presumption that it's a

224
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,800
corporation.

225
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,080
It doesn't serve as a government as as

226
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,840
it was created.

227
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,060
It's a business.

228
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,720
And what they do is for their shareholders.

229
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,000
So to be a president of such an

230
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,020
organization, I mean, that's you got to be

231
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,460
like a real scumbag, you know.

232
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,520
Now, here's the other part that's even more

233
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:15,860
damning.

234
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,360
If you don't know any of that, you

235
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,920
believe the propaganda that the lady has been

236
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,340
told.

237
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,580
Well, you're even worse now because what are

238
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,160
you going to leave?

239
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,140
It's like the blind leading the blind.

240
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,100
You know how they say, right.

241
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,320
Or the dumb leading the dumb.

242
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,440
So either way, it's damning to be in

243
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,420
any of those leadership positions, any country because

244
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,680
of the state of affairs.

245
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,200
Yes.

246
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,440
Just a very dirty, very, very dirty.

247
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,860
I've kind of looked at it this way.

248
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,620
Every once in a while, some fool gets

249
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,000
in there and thinks he's actually going to

250
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,180
be in charge and be able to do

251
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:44,540
something.

252
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,540
You know, we don't know what's going on

253
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,160
in the background.

254
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:48,860
Right.

255
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,900
No, we don't know.

256
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,620
But they're all it's all very bad.

257
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,900
It's it's been very bad for over 150

258
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,820
years because it's not it doesn't have it's

259
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,860
not very bad in the overall cosmic sense

260
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,980
because it's just a corporation.

261
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,640
There's plenty of bits.

262
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:04,980
I don't know.

263
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,360
Someone was going to put together where they

264
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
say the US government's a corporation.

265
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,620
They had generals, people.

266
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,160
Yeah, it's just a corporation.

267
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,360
It's just a corporation.

268
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,240
You know, it's just a God is G

269
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,600
.D. piece of paper.

270
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,460
You know all that stuff.

271
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:18,920
Right.

272
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,600
So I think that it's they're they're all

273
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,980
bad either way, no matter.

274
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,140
You can give whether they know what's going

275
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,420
on.

276
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,720
They're bad if they don't know what's going

277
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,000
on.

278
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,480
They're bad.

279
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:31,799
Right.

280
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,140
Because they should know.

281
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,240
Right.

282
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:37,020
So it's just really bad overall.

283
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,820
And it's it's also the the populace's fault.

284
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,880
No, I understand.

285
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,820
Look, you know, it's not like you're going

286
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,580
to have good and bad people working at

287
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,940
the crack slash whorehouse.

288
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,460
You know, it's they work at the crack

289
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,080
slash core, you know, the whorehouse.

290
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:51,900
So that's it.

291
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,720
I mean, it's not it doesn't serve.

292
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,580
It doesn't serve what it was intended.

293
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,780
It doesn't work wherever.

294
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,640
Here's an example.

295
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,940
Wherever you have influence of the corporate government

296
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,800
versus low influence of it, like in places

297
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,340
in rural places, you know, you don't have

298
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,100
much influence.

299
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,640
You'll notice the culture and the society go

300
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,500
down very quickly.

301
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,860
You wherever you have corporate government, like all

302
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,600
the cities or whatever, crime goes up.

303
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,860
Poverty goes up.

304
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,000
Drug use goes up.

305
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,420
Corruption goes up.

306
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:30,200
I'm not saying that minimal corporate influence has

307
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,780
none of that.

308
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,960
It also has it, but not as much.

309
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,860
So you look at all your big corporate

310
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,200
cities, L.A., Philadelphia, New York, whatever, Jersey

311
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,580
City.

312
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,220
Keep going.

313
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,500
Right.

314
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:41,900
Right.

315
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,540
Or even the shore, Jersey Shore.

316
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:45,180
Right.

317
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,840
Those, you know, they became popular recreation, the

318
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,900
government regulation and went down to shit.

319
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,600
Yeah, that's exactly because not because of the

320
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:52,960
government.

321
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,080
That's what people are saying.

322
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,480
It's because it's a corporation and they have

323
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,900
investors.

324
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,720
And one of the definitions of investment is

325
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,700
to gain from the efforts of others.

326
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,460
Of course.

327
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:06,420
Right.

328
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,660
So it's it's pretty bad.

329
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,760
But, you know, you I used to be

330
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,460
naive thinking like I wanted to get out

331
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,980
of New York because everyone around me sounded

332
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,400
dumb.

333
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,900
And I went to other places.

334
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,120
They didn't sound so dumb, but they were

335
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,920
just as dumb.

336
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,540
Then I was like, well, it's got to

337
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,240
be Americans.

338
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,060
And then I met people from Iraq, people

339
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,180
from Tibet, people from Russia, people from Japan.

340
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
I said, oh, they're dumb, too.

341
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,460
Oh, my gosh.

342
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,340
It's planetary wide.

343
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,980
This is a surface dwelling earth inhabitant issue.

344
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,800
You know, along these very same lines, somebody

345
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,600
asked a question, actually quotes a bunch of

346
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,600
stuff that you just said, OK, in their

347
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,400
longer message.

348
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,240
But to break it down, they're asking, you

349
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,240
know, if there is a spiritual purpose or

350
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,780
if there is a weaponized purpose in the

351
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,480
spiritual realm to the fact that so often

352
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,000
people like that in the government or in

353
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,100
the culture or whatever capture a large portion

354
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,140
of the imagination.

355
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,200
In other words, a lot of people's thoughts

356
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,060
and a lot of people's discussions are taken

357
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,360
up with these people, their actions, their crap.

358
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,100
And isn't that a form of manipulation in

359
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,800
and of itself?

360
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,940
If everybody is talking about this person, thinking

361
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,560
about this person, you know, against them or

362
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,680
for them, it's irrelevant.

363
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,560
OK, let's say it this way.

364
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,280
Yeah, you could you could do an overarching

365
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,840
in respect to any question.

366
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,420
There's an overarching aspect that's not really brought

367
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,180
up or emphasized.

368
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:33,840
Right.

369
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,200
And what I want to emphasize is that

370
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,940
we have an evasive species that is negative,

371
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,560
invasive or evasive, evasive and invasive, but more

372
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,680
evasive, evasive and invasive.

373
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,320
No problem.

374
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:48,980
OK, go ahead.

375
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,860
Evasive meaning you can't see them, but they're

376
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,500
negative.

377
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,360
Right.

378
00:11:52,520 --> 00:12:00,240
And they basically benefit and feed off of

379
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,800
what we call negative behavior, negative thoughts, negative

380
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,200
whatever.

381
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,320
I'm not going to say loose or whatever.

382
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,740
That's that's more extreme.

383
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,300
You know how that term became popular about

384
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,860
15, 10, 15 years ago.

385
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,220
Right.

386
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,500
But in other words, if you go to

387
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,260
find swamp creatures, they tend to need like

388
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:24,780
a high sulfur diet, decaying, decomposing things to

389
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,220
thrive.

390
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,400
That's an analogy, right?

391
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,360
OK, got it.

392
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,180
So they need a decaying.

393
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:34,700
You'll have things go really well in generally

394
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,520
in many societies here for no more than

395
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,260
a decade or so.

396
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,620
And then it goes into a long like

397
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,040
century of decay because they need to breed

398
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,040
decay and strife, but not enough to kill

399
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,140
the victims, but enough for them to survive

400
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,460
it and propagate it.

401
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:49,900
Right.

402
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,720
Well, most parasites, most parasites don't kill their

403
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,340
host.

404
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,240
And quite frankly, look, mushrooms grow very well

405
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,560
in the dark and the muck and clams.

406
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,840
You know, a lot of people love the

407
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,220
clams.

408
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,420
Maybe that's your thing.

409
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,020
They go where they harvest clams.

410
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,160
It really stinks, doesn't it?

411
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,820
Actually, the best places to harvest clams in

412
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,200
a lot of places are what?

413
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,260
Near the sewage where they dump the sewage,

414
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,780
to be honest with you.

415
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,720
So what does that tell you?

416
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,860
Well, yeah, so we're but at the same

417
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,960
time, you know, we have a short it's

418
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,660
good to have a short life to pass

419
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,620
through here or whatever.

420
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,560
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

421
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,680
It's not a positive place, no matter how

422
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,160
you cut it.

423
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,360
Just like I mentioned recently through the years

424
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,140
of people, what do they call them?

425
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,780
Survivalist preppers or whatever, like, oh, I got

426
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,440
to get out of the city.

427
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,500
I saved up one hundred thousand bucks.

428
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,880
I got this place out in the middle

429
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,240
of nowhere, off the grid, whatever.

430
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,440
I talked to him two years later.

431
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,480
I'm like, oh, man, it sucked.

432
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,900
I was like, I told you, it was

433
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,200
like five times more expensive living in the

434
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,420
city.

435
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,640
And then in nature, you'll find out that

436
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,920
everything wants to kill you, right?

437
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,540
Whether it's a bug, an animal, anything, everything

438
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,380
wants to kill you.

439
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,660
And he's like, yeah, I was like, I

440
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,060
can't go live in the city.

441
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,980
Like the city is the pinnacle of human

442
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,720
existence.

443
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,840
Besides that, I mean, here, let me just

444
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,400
take it further.

445
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,780
Unless a doomsday comes, a doomsday prepper is

446
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,480
kind of useless.

447
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,040
And by the way, who the hell wants

448
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,240
to eat beans and rice for the next

449
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:15,960
15 years?

450
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,140
Because that's what they always stop.

451
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,480
Well, here, let me continue the logic train

452
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:19,860
on this.

453
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,500
So if you really if you lived in

454
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,840
a city and you didn't have a corporate

455
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,300
government with investors, or really just, you know,

456
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,080
they can't tell.

457
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,240
See, the corporate government, again, this is a

458
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,540
tangent.

459
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,100
Can't tell people what's going on because they

460
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,640
don't have to.

461
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,840
You could just look it up yourself.

462
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,620
It's pretty crazy.

463
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,900
I'm still reading like statutes at large and

464
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,160
stuff.

465
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,400
And some of the laws are insane.

466
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,600
You know, I mean, like in our favor,

467
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,960
all the laws are in our favor.

468
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,180
All right.

469
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,780
Except for, for example, a U.S. citizen.

470
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,680
The only rights they have is to live

471
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,200
in Washington, D.C., basically.

472
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,800
That's it.

473
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,500
And they're a debtor.

474
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,660
And they have everything they can do as

475
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,120
a privilege.

476
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:55,580
Right.

477
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,760
That's the all caps name.

478
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,360
So it's like a credit card, you know.

479
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,280
But so if all that was known, people

480
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,300
would it would just dwindle and become nothing.

481
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,500
So they rely on deception, the corporate side.

482
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:07,760
Right.

483
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,560
So it's just like when you go to

484
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,880
a Ford dealer, do they say, well, you

485
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,480
know, Chrysler's got good cars, too.

486
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,720
They never say that.

487
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,720
So they can't talk about anything that is

488
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,160
not in accord with their fiduciary responsibility to

489
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,860
their principles.

490
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,900
Meaning the United States government and all the

491
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,660
state governments are also part of the since

492
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,700
the Civil War were planted and put in

493
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,320
by the federal government.

494
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,300
They were all dissolved.

495
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:34,660
Right.

496
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,020
OK.

497
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,840
This is easy to find in the statutes

498
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,280
at large and places like that.

499
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,760
So so when you're dealing with, say, state

500
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,540
of Georgia, that is a political subdivision out

501
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,340
of Washington, D.C. That's where its home

502
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,140
is, not Georgia, because there's Georgia state, there's

503
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,900
Florida state, Arizona state.

504
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,140
But state of is the is the Washington,

505
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,840
D.C. thing creature.

506
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,200
So but they don't have to disclose anything

507
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,140
because it's already written pretty clearly.

508
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,280
Right.

509
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,140
But let's say everything was disclosed.

510
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,220
Everything was hashed out with government, religion, all

511
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,820
that stuff.

512
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,780
You would have a city that would function

513
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,740
optimally.

514
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,880
The people's fitness or health would be very

515
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,300
high.

516
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,780
They would determine collectively direct representation how they

517
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,260
want to see the society go.

518
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,180
They would also have a science that allow

519
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,080
them to fully manipulate all material world around

520
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,280
them.

521
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,500
What that would lead to is what do

522
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,340
you call it when you eliminate eradication of

523
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,280
animals and insects?

524
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,920
You don't need them anymore.

525
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
You might have some pets, whatever, but you

526
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,100
would eradicate all the wildlife plant, all the

527
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,340
things that, you know, are unnecessary because you

528
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,440
don't need animals and plants and bugs and

529
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:49,680
stuff.

530
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,420
You have full control of your environment.

531
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:51,780
Right.

532
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,160
That transmutation Star Trek type stuff.

533
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,440
Right.

534
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,400
Yeah.

535
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,880
And then eventually you take over the the

536
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,680
entire planet.

537
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,540
You put a Dyson sphere around the whole

538
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,020
planet.

539
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,300
Right.

540
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,099
Energetic one.

541
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,760
Nothing can come and go.

542
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:07,500
Yeah.

543
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,400
That's that's the future, by the way.

544
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,180
If you were to continue in an optimum

545
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:11,460
way.

546
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,960
Now, what I just mentioned, like if I

547
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,480
talk about eradication of all the species, except

548
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,980
for humans, people are like, oh, my gosh.

549
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:18,480
Yeah.

550
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,680
Sounds pretty horrible, doesn't it?

551
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,280
But that's what happens when you optimize the

552
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:22,940
human culture.

553
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,859
Sorry, I don't mean to.

554
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,040
So how many creatures were in the world

555
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,660
when people were more primitive, primitive?

556
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,180
A lot more creatures as people became more,

557
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,500
let's say, advanced, the number of creatures declined.

558
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,280
Well, they talk about the logic train.

559
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:36,660
Yeah.

560
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,460
They talk about the extinction of thousands of

561
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:38,820
creatures.

562
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,620
You know, over the course of time, it's

563
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,820
because, yeah, they get eliminated.

564
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,860
And I guess, yeah, if you don't want

565
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,140
to maintain the balance of the natural existence

566
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,620
and you don't need to because you can

567
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,360
simply replicate.

568
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah, you can do anything.

569
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,440
For example, when I had the bike shop

570
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,340
and the reps would come in to sell

571
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,140
parts for me to sell to the customers

572
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,520
retail.

573
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,820
Right.

574
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,640
And the guy, you know, let's say they

575
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,940
have high end saddles.

576
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,680
They're not called seats.

577
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,860
They're called saddles on a bike.

578
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,140
Right.

579
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:02,480
OK.

580
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,480
And he had a really high end stuff

581
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,140
like, you know, you know, 100, 200 dollar

582
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,620
bicycle saddles.

583
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,760
And I would always mess with them.

584
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,560
You know, I got anything else.

585
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,180
What do you mean?

586
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,340
This is like the best stuff in the

587
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:14,480
world.

588
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,180
I said, no, I want some bicycle saddles

589
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,240
that have leather and skin made from endangered

590
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,900
species.

591
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,120
You got any of those men?

592
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,000
And they would look at me like I

593
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,620
was just like I said, I wanted to

594
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,240
go home and F his sister or something.

595
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:29,480
Right.

596
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,660
I was just joking.

597
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,740
So what I'm trying to say, one guy

598
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,880
got really in my face and said, I

599
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,780
want saddles made from leather of endangered species.

600
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,040
He wanted to kill me for saying because,

601
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,920
you know, you know, the brainwashing of the

602
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,900
right environmentalists.

603
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,440
So you want white you want white panther

604
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,600
coated bald eagle feather stuffed.

605
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:49,840
Yeah.

606
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,100
Like if there's like one white tiger left,

607
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,720
I want it dead and I want it

608
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,040
skin on my bicycle.

609
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,100
Right.

610
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,740
And and if there's enough left over, you'll

611
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,060
make a holder for your water bottle.

612
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,020
If it's the last one that that's even

613
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,360
better.

614
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,740
Now, that freaks people out when you talk

615
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,200
that way.

616
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,300
Now, do I really believe that?

617
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,960
I'm not going to confirm or deny it.

618
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,940
I'll let you decide, because I know I

619
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,080
know that you're not going to hear anybody

620
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,780
else saying that.

621
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,440
So, yeah.

622
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,040
Screw the animals.

623
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,120
I mean, don't screw the animals.

624
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:19,700
Let's be silly.

625
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,320
No, I have no regard for them other

626
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,560
than whatever.

627
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
Because if you're going to if you're going

628
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,880
to think about the big picture, like I

629
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,960
just said, moving forward.

630
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,280
Right.

631
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,900
That's what dictators did.

632
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,020
They get branded really bad in history.

633
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,920
But they were to eliminate huge amounts of

634
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,440
their population because they were like, we need

635
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,180
to clean this place up.

636
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,720
You ever you ever see people like a

637
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,140
young couple move into a neighborhood where some

638
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,980
old people lived?

639
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,940
And like for weeks they have dumpsters outside

640
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,120
throwing everything away, tearing stuff out.

641
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,840
You're like, my gosh.

642
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,120
It's like, well, this person had a lot

643
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,080
of crap in here.

644
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,340
You know, we had to gut the place.

645
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:52,640
Right.

646
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,760
So gut the damn place.

647
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,780
And yeah, creatures and everything and just make

648
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,540
a human society.

649
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,940
But you can't do that if you don't

650
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,620
have full control of your environment.

651
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,220
Right.

652
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,080
You have to be able if you need

653
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,020
gold, you go to a machine.

654
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,300
Boom.

655
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:07,980
You got gold.

656
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,780
You need you know, right.

657
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,300
You make everything is made.

658
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,300
You know, there's no mining.

659
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,240
There's no farming.

660
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,720
There's no right.

661
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,340
This is possible right now.

662
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,900
This can you can look.

663
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,700
I do the stuff that I'm talking about

664
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,400
in my kitchen.

665
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,000
Right.

666
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,560
And I need to start maybe doing some

667
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,040
videos or seminars, free seminar and say, hey,

668
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,160
look, guys, there's a camera.

669
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,940
Nothing fake over here.

670
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,960
Look, this is carbon.

671
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,120
I'm going to turn it into iron.

672
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,320
You can do this at home, too.

673
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,360
This is how you do it.

674
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:36,700
Right.

675
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,020
It's no fakery here.

676
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,080
Look, I'll even do a topless.

677
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,020
No shirt.

678
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,220
Don't show whatever.

679
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,040
I'll do it naked.

680
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,280
Don't show them how to make.

681
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:44,520
Yeah.

682
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,880
Don't show them how to make gold, though,

683
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,280
because somebody might come and try.

684
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,940
So we will show how to make gold.

685
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,320
I've gone over it many, many times.

686
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,980
It's biological gold that it has to be

687
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,940
taken to another level.

688
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,980
Quite a bit of confirmation with that.

689
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:55,760
It's not difficult.

690
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,020
There's a logic train there.

691
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,280
And you do use organic materials right now.

692
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,500
But, oh, my gosh, you know, it's people

693
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,220
don't want to hear.

694
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,640
They only want to hear the stuff that

695
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,980
they're being conditioned to hear.

696
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,020
Right.

697
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,060
So, you know, you know, here's a question

698
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,460
that kind of goes along with that.

699
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,160
But let me just say one more thing.

700
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,780
You start talking about eliminating all the animals

701
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,280
and insects and plants, all that stuff.

702
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,660
You can't do that as you are right

703
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:23,940
now.

704
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,800
You it will not work.

705
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,660
It'll be total havoc.

706
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:28,560
Right.

707
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,960
It's kind of like saying, let's get rid

708
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,560
of all the gasoline cars tomorrow.

709
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,780
That won't work.

710
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,720
You have to transition.

711
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,220
Right.

712
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,480
And then when they're almost all gone, then

713
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,920
you're like, oh, my gosh, I'm glad we

714
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,500
transitioned.

715
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:39,940
Right.

716
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,060
So anyway.

717
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,840
Well, yeah, if you're in the place and

718
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,220
it's, you know, been gutted, been redone, everything

719
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,100
is shiny and new.

720
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:47,380
Yeah.

721
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,580
Anyway, Greek has left hints on the power

722
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,600
of intent to create our reality.

723
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,060
Could you speak to whether it's about.

724
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,220
See, they're asking for technique here.

725
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,540
Do you write these things down?

726
00:21:59,740 --> 00:21:59,840
Hold on.

727
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:00,960
You can't intend.

728
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,000
You have to have technical.

729
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,080
You have to intend to get technical access

730
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,520
and know how and where we're going to

731
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:05,880
do it.

732
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,420
Intention ain't going to do much.

733
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:07,960
Right.

734
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,240
But you can sit around a day and,

735
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,620
you know, people hope for a lot of

736
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,120
stuff there.

737
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,920
Their their their day is going to come.

738
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,620
And before you know, you wake up, you're

739
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,100
seventy five and nothing's happened.

740
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,840
And you're like, oh, shit, I should I

741
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,480
should have done something more than just waiting

742
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:22,900
around.

743
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,240
Right.

744
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,600
So, no, the intention is is doesn't intention

745
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,080
is is a variable in a very big

746
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,640
equation.

747
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,260
And if whenever you hear culturally, societally, whatever,

748
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,340
people just focusing on one thing like positive

749
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,200
thinking or and that's it, that'll get it

750
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:40,360
done.

751
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,220
No, it doesn't get it done.

752
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,680
Positive thinking is part is to be thrown

753
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,760
into a bag with twenty five other things.

754
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,040
So is intention.

755
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,160
So is the emo.

756
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,240
So is everything.

757
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:50,720
Nothing.

758
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,080
Right.

759
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,220
No monoculture of thought or spirituality.

760
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,840
It's all even in spirituality.

761
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,020
You have to do works.

762
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,940
You have to do things.

763
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,420
You have to.

764
00:22:59,520 --> 00:22:59,660
Right.

765
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,100
Right.

766
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,760
And like you said, you got to first

767
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,880
get the tools in hand.

768
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,380
I mean, you know, here, build a bookshelf.

769
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,980
Here's a Phillips head screwdriver.

770
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,720
Not going to be the only thing you

771
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:07,820
need.

772
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,780
First, the tools.

773
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,360
They all have to come within a very

774
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,540
close time within each other, because if you

775
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,060
have one or two or three parts and

776
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,660
the other ones are taking too long, you'll

777
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,120
give up.

778
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,380
Right.

779
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,580
So you have to play.

780
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,160
It's planning.

781
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,860
You can actually be a real like sorry

782
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,100
ass fuck of a human.

783
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,180
And at the same time, while you're in

784
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:32,500
that state, start planning a great future or

785
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,960
a great reality for yourself.

786
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,860
But cover all the bases you cover.

787
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,980
Let's say you need money for this.

788
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,880
How am I going to get all the

789
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,440
money I need?

790
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,420
How's my outlook going to be?

791
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,760
How do I get myself better outlook?

792
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,640
How do I get my fitness level up?

793
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,900
Because I need energy to do this.

794
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,500
How do I find people around me that

795
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,620
will support what I want to do and

796
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,780
help them also?

797
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,420
And then the tools.

798
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:53,760
Right.

799
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,600
And the location.

800
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,960
All of that has to be planned.

801
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,560
So that comes.

802
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,800
There's no evolution.

803
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,740
One thing.

804
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,300
And then hopefully the next thing will come.

805
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,220
No, it doesn't work that way.

806
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,240
That's how you have a divided kingdom.

807
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,300
That's what you live in.

808
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,380
OK, well, here's another random strangeness.

809
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,840
And then I've got just one more thing

810
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,400
after this.

811
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,240
What is the Greek speak on Eden in

812
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,680
Florida?

813
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,080
In quotes, hypothesis.

814
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,140
A man called LV Edison Calloway in the

815
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,780
1930s, I think, researched and wrote about it.

816
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,980
Pre-flood civilization being in America.

817
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,500
Giants.

818
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:26,920
Yeah.

819
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,840
And reported in old newspapers all across the

820
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,180
land.

821
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,080
So what do you know about that?

822
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,400
Not much, but the archaics gets into that.

823
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,120
Everything really started here.

824
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,060
The modern society, people were everywhere all the

825
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,160
time, just like electricity has always existed.

826
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,540
Everyone in every culture knew about electricity, but

827
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,460
they didn't use it.

828
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:46,800
Right.

829
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,000
And then you had different levels of culture

830
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,400
that use it and others that knew about

831
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,260
it and didn't use it.

832
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,380
It's just like that.

833
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,100
You had very advanced cultures here.

834
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,220
But the thing about places that are heavily

835
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,120
desert, barren, flat land.

836
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,020
Yeah, we're different at one point.

837
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,900
And like, for example, like archaics gets into

838
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:08,480
a lot of this.

839
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,400
Most of the U.S. was underwater.

840
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:10,880
Not most.

841
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,860
A lot of it was.

842
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,880
You know, if you drive through, you don't

843
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,260
see any old trees through Arizona and Texas

844
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,900
and parts of California.

845
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,440
All these that this was all underwater.

846
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,280
That's why you can find fish fossils.

847
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,840
And if you dig deep enough in a

848
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,700
lot of desert, you'll actually find fish fossils

849
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,340
where you think there was never any water.

850
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,240
I find seashells.

851
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,620
What if I go down one, three, four

852
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,060
feet?

853
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,380
OK.

854
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,020
It's high desert.

855
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:30,800
It got pushed up.

856
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,780
But Charlemagne, there's they're constantly finding encampments here

857
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,360
where King Charlemagne is around 800 or ninth

858
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:37,780
century.

859
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:43,120
He had a colony here near Tucson and

860
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,880
they sailed here.

861
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:44,800
Right.

862
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,500
The water.

863
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,200
I mean, by car, you have to drive

864
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,360
three hours to go to the beach.

865
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,880
So they sailed to Tucson.

866
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,080
So it was very different.

867
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,540
It was an inland sea that connected to

868
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,480
the ocean to what they call the Gulf

869
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,680
of America now, I believe.

870
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:55,980
Right.

871
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,860
And all this.

872
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,820
So, yeah, that's only recent.

873
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,820
A very recent big geological changes everywhere.

874
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,100
But no, nothing about Eden in Florida, Florida.

875
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,260
Imagine that extending all the way down to

876
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,640
wherever you want to extend it.

877
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,540
You know, it was much more much different

878
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,000
than you mean.

879
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,820
The land was bigger landmass.

880
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,080
Yeah.

881
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,400
OK.

882
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,060
OK.

883
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,180
No problem there.

884
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:20,760
All right.

885
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,500
So let's start right off the coast of

886
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:22,820
Florida.

887
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,420
Florida, Cuba, there's underwater.

888
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,480
There's cities under there.

889
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,360
Yeah, there's all kinds.

890
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:30,180
They're all submerged remains like the Bimini Road

891
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,440
and.

892
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,340
Yeah, exactly.

893
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,100
Thank you.

894
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:32,300
Yeah.

895
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,500
Hemingway and all I got into.

896
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,360
Yeah, exactly.

897
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,360
OK, so look, this is the last one

898
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:37,700
here.

899
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,420
And let me just get that note up

900
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,340
because I put it on a text document.

901
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,220
I wanted to save it for a moment.

902
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:43,660
Where is it?

903
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,120
There it is.

904
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,400
Right.

905
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,640
OK, so this person went through the process.

906
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,780
They kind of argued with themselves for a

907
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,780
little bit and went through the process of

908
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,000
making that process, that voice inside their head.

909
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,400
Silent.

910
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,420
Oh, so they got rid of that.

911
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,500
And what resulted is that they started dreaming

912
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,680
differently and they're a little bit disturbed by

913
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:05,820
it.

914
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,220
Now, here's the thing about these dreams.

915
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:07,940
I get it.

916
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,700
I get it.

917
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,040
Go ahead.

918
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,900
Probably things that I've experienced when I experimented

919
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,400
with that.

920
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,160
It's not like scary dreams or anything like

921
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,640
that, but literally the rules of reality change,

922
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,580
like to the point of you can walk

923
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,020
upside down on surfaces like you don't have

924
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,540
to worry about, like you can walk up

925
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,840
a wall and this kind of thing.

926
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,760
The rules of reality literally are changed in

927
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,380
these dreams.

928
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,460
And this person is wondering, is this another

929
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:38,020
trick by those entities to try and break

930
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,700
them in some way?

931
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,600
OK, yeah, I get it.

932
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,240
OK, you leave.

933
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,980
You live in an agreed upon reality.

934
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,740
Like everybody will pretty much agree.

935
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,860
You can't walk through walls.

936
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,660
You can't fly.

937
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,200
Right.

938
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:48,540
Right.

939
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,940
You can't dematerialize.

940
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:52,640
You can't be invisible, you know, physically or

941
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:52,980
all that.

942
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
So that's an agreed upon.

943
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,460
All of that is without a machine.

944
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,300
You can't travel over 10 miles an hour

945
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:57,780
or whatever.

946
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,980
Like, you know, yeah, et cetera.

947
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,280
That's agreed upon reality.

948
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,140
All those limitations, your perception or limitations.

949
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,820
The reason you see what you see is

950
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,540
because if you saw everything, you couldn't handle

951
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,440
it with the capacity, mental capacity that you

952
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:09,720
have.

953
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,560
So what's going on is if you're in

954
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,140
a dream state, if you train yourself, if

955
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,800
you can see your hands and move your

956
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,160
hands, you're not in a dream state.

957
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,660
You're in like a mid reality.

958
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,100
Right.

959
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,020
If if you still see a lot of

960
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,460
people say you dream in black and white.

961
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,340
That's just to satisfy a juvenile mentality.

962
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,780
Don't even ever think of that.

963
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,220
But another thing is, if you notice, if

964
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:33,480
you're dreaming and people are their speech, their

965
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,640
mouths are never moving.

966
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,180
Right.

967
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,020
But if you notice their mouths are moving

968
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,480
now, you're not in a dream anymore.

969
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,080
You're actually conveyed into a different in between

970
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,120
channels, let's say.

971
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,380
Right.

972
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:43,940
OK.

973
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,860
The other thing about that agreed reality that

974
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,680
I mentioned, you could.

975
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:47,980
Yeah.

976
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,260
The laws of of agreement that we have

977
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,320
here don't don't apply there.

978
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,620
So now they would be if if you

979
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,160
hear if you see if you hear speech

980
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,500
and you see the mouths are not moving

981
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,740
and you can't really have control of your

982
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,300
hands and see your fingers moving intentionally, it's

983
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:11,200
probably an implant again by those entities that

984
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:11,740
give dreams.

985
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,500
Yes, it's an implant.

986
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,180
But if you have control of those things,

987
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,060
I've had a dream, for example, I've asked

988
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,740
myself to dream.

989
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,020
And I went into a community where there

990
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,480
were sharks and horses like people.

991
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,680
And they honored me.

992
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,740
The horses honored me that a huge table

993
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,380
and there were horses.

994
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,340
They sat down and they grabbed beer mugs

995
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,940
and I saw my hands moving and their

996
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,720
mouths were moving and they were all talking.

997
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,580
And they were there, had these big steins.

998
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,560
And I don't recall exactly how they were

999
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
holding them with hooves.

1000
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,620
But they were upright.

1001
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,540
That's funny.

1002
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,940
They were glad to meet me.

1003
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,360
And there were some sharks there to be

1004
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:47,660
careful.

1005
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,360
The sharks are, you know, they're OK.

1006
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,460
Just don't get too close.

1007
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,660
And I was like, well, that's a real

1008
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,040
fucked up situation.

1009
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,080
It's got to be a dream.

1010
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,340
Right.

1011
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,020
But no, it passed all the tests.

1012
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:57,520
Right.

1013
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,360
But I saw their mouths move and my

1014
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,160
hands were moving.

1015
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,280
I was able to articulate.

1016
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,680
So that was really cool.

1017
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,420
I mean, you've heard of DMT, right?

1018
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,000
Yeah, of course.

1019
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,200
Yeah.

1020
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,320
In literature.

1021
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,820
You know, actually, that's kind of funny because,

1022
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,160
you know, Gulliver's travels, right?

1023
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,220
Everybody knows about the one where he shows

1024
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,660
up and he's a giant because that's the

1025
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,300
one they always show you in the cartoons

1026
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,280
or the movies or whatever.

1027
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,000
And then and then he's a microman.

1028
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:20,820
And then he.

1029
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,140
Yeah.

1030
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:21,440
Yeah.

1031
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,820
But there's actually the least known book of

1032
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,360
them all is he's a horse.

1033
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,980
People, the whole Williams, the horse people.

1034
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,280
Right.

1035
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,340
I was just going to say that.

1036
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,880
And I was just wondering if that was

1037
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,120
connected, if that was connected.

1038
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,420
Yeah.

1039
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,240
And no, that did not come to memory

1040
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,700
till I gave this account to someone about

1041
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,240
a year ago.

1042
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:36,660
OK.

1043
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,300
OK.

1044
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,120
No, I was just curious if maybe, you

1045
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,660
know, it was a very Tudor setting.

1046
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,020
Tudor would be like sixteen hundreds, fifteen hundreds

1047
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,620
village type thing.

1048
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,580
Very rough hewn, using pretty real and smells.

1049
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,260
If you get very strong smells and tastes.

1050
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,900
But if you if you don't, the criteria

1051
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,380
that I use is if you don't see

1052
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,140
the mouths moving when their speech or you

1053
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,340
can can articulate your hands, you're still being

1054
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,720
fed a dream.

1055
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,380
Now, remember, they depend on them, the inner

1056
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,220
voice and all that.

1057
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:08,680
Right.

1058
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,800
OK, well, first of all, that's a success.

1059
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,660
That's testimony on what I'm putting out, because

1060
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,260
if this person worked on and he had

1061
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,760
results about quieting the voice, that's another box

1062
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,600
we could check off.

1063
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,800
Another one that's that's advancing beyond the shit

1064
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,220
that we let's put on us.

1065
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,320
And that's only that's only the second person

1066
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,600
who's written to me and told me that

1067
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,820
they were able to do that, by the

1068
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,040
way.

1069
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,640
So, oh, there's more.

1070
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,340
I've spoken to a few.

1071
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,240
I believe you.

1072
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,740
I mean, I did it, too.

1073
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,200
But I'm just saying it's just funny to

1074
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,900
me because it's like that's the second.

1075
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,600
That's only the second person people have written

1076
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,260
to me about over and over again, about

1077
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:43,820
a lot of things.

1078
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,260
But this is one of those things that

1079
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,680
I've only heard twice, you know, coming back.

1080
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,180
But the first thing here, look, it's an

1081
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,860
open adventure.

1082
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,700
I'm the only one really talking about that

1083
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,480
voice in your head.

1084
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,400
It's not you.

1085
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,900
Well, actually, I did come across it in

1086
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,360
Castaneda, something similar.

1087
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,320
And you talk about the second attention and

1088
00:31:59,320 --> 00:31:59,680
all that.

1089
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,180
But I'm the only one that's, I think,

1090
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,820
taking it out of context that it's usually

1091
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,960
given in some novel or whatever.

1092
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,320
And I'm saying this is real.

1093
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,480
And go ahead and work on it.

1094
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,800
And you'll see your life change.

1095
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,920
Your perception will change.

1096
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,920
You'll be you can't be better off here,

1097
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,440
by the way.

1098
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,160
You know, when someone tells you do this,

1099
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,340
you'll be better off here.

1100
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,140
No, this is this is you can't be.

1101
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,060
This is a place of compromise.

1102
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,220
And but this sounds like something you should

1103
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,040
test this whole dream thing, because he talks.

1104
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,580
Yeah, but it's more than the dream thing.

1105
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,920
Look, remember the dream thing is that dream

1106
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,600
experience and all that is tied into calling

1107
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,800
the voices, let's say.

1108
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,020
Right.

1109
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,140
So, yeah, of course, it's going to work

1110
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:40,440
that way.

1111
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,280
But also, they could take you down that

1112
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,720
route where they show you instead of focusing

1113
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,440
on this world, they make you focus on

1114
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,160
another world.

1115
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:49,840
Right.

1116
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,100
Right.

1117
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,260
That they they can assist you to do

1118
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:52,500
that.

1119
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,580
And it's still mess with you.

1120
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,360
But there's also a series that I've noticed

1121
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,880
that if you if they try doing a

1122
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,320
replacement voice on you, one of the final

1123
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,440
ones is prescience.

1124
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,940
Like they give they make you psychic eight

1125
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,020
seconds, two minutes into the future.

1126
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,080
And most people, like I said, fall for

1127
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,300
that.

1128
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:09,600
Right.

1129
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,160
Yes.

1130
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:10,760
And then they work.

1131
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,380
They go work with the police and they

1132
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,540
find, you know, right.

1133
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,500
And they say, I'm psychic.

1134
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,440
No, you're not psychic.

1135
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:18,960
You they replace the the typical entity with

1136
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,600
one that does that.

1137
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,320
And you believe it.

1138
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,140
Oh, my gosh.

1139
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,600
I mean, that could be anyone could be

1140
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:24,840
right.

1141
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,980
They gave you an entity that actually has

1142
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:30,040
that knowledge and therefore gave you less work

1143
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,580
to do that than to keep you occupied.

1144
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,560
Right.

1145
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,380
Otherwise.

1146
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,060
So they they're very efficient at what they

1147
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:36,280
do.

1148
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:36,780
Yeah.

1149
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,640
But here's the thing, like just like people,

1150
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,020
they're not that smart.

1151
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,880
They're lazy.

1152
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,280
Right.

1153
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,400
So, you know, once you understand that, you're

1154
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,060
not going against a formidable enemy.

1155
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,860
They're under you can consider these entities and

1156
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,480
nonphysical entities formidable because they don't have physical

1157
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,140
limitations.

1158
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,420
But on the other hand, they wish they

1159
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,720
did because there's something about having a physical

1160
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,020
body enjoying this realm.

1161
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,540
Right.

1162
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,120
It's always like you're never happy with what

1163
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,480
you got.

1164
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:03,700
Right.

1165
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,300
Like the humans want to be spiritual and

1166
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,800
get out of the physical and not the

1167
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,080
spiritual ones want to be physical.

1168
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,780
Is that funny?

1169
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,040
The grass is always greener.

1170
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,120
Greener.

1171
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:14,300
Well, the whole thing, this whole system is

1172
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:14,880
screwed up.

1173
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,840
You want to get out of the system,

1174
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,780
not whether you're spiritual or physical.

1175
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:19,739
You see what I mean?

1176
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,040
Yeah.

1177
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,860
Just to finish this question, though, just real

1178
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,679
fast is the last part of it.

1179
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:26,260
He mentions that he got rid of one

1180
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:26,600
voice.

1181
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:27,719
It seemed like it was gone for a

1182
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,000
little bit.

1183
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,659
Another one seemed to start up.

1184
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,199
And then when he got rid of that

1185
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,699
one, that's when these dreams started.

1186
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,840
And the weird thing is, you know, besides

1187
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,820
this sort of like defying the rules, like

1188
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,480
you said, the agreed upon reality here is

1189
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,840
that it also gave him like choices, like

1190
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,080
he could decide to walk on water or

1191
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,080
not in this other reality where, by the

1192
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,060
way, there was fluid in strange places that

1193
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,179
it wouldn't have normally been.

1194
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,159
It was a very kind of almost seemed

1195
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,480
chaotic, but he started to understand there was

1196
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,320
an order to it.

1197
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,040
And these things have rapidly and been constant

1198
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,280
for many days afterwards.

1199
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:05,720
Yeah.

1200
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,260
Well, be careful because they might want to

1201
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,280
drive you nuts, too.

1202
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:08,580
Right.

1203
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,820
So you might want to get rid of

1204
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:11,000
that the same way you got rid of

1205
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,480
the voices.

1206
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:13,740
Fair enough.

1207
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,700
So some of the most interesting people I

1208
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,900
ever met was in the loony bin.

1209
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,300
Not that I was there, but I knew

1210
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:18,980
how to visits.

1211
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:21,440
You know, someone said, hey, let's go visit

1212
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:21,760
whatever.

1213
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,820
They're in the psych ward.

1214
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,140
Right.

1215
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,140
And once a week, the ones that are

1216
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,260
not dangerous, they're out.

1217
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,820
They're out like a public room.

1218
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,360
They can't leave the building, but the public

1219
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,660
could go and interact with them.

1220
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,400
OK, well, usually you sit next to me,

1221
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,900
talk to me like they seem pretty normal.

1222
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,260
But after like 30 seconds, like, oh, shit.

1223
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,960
Now I know why you got your ass.

1224
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,840
It's like if you go on the you

1225
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,780
know, you go into the on the wrong

1226
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,460
train on the subway one day and you

1227
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,600
end up in a part of New York

1228
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,780
that you don't normally go to.

1229
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,720
But that seems to be.

1230
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,640
Well, it depends.

1231
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,180
It depends.

1232
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,600
But also some of the most interesting people

1233
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,620
like very well, like Tesla said, an insane

1234
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,200
person can think very deeply.

1235
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,400
But an insane person cannot think clearly.

1236
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,120
So you get a lot of deep thought.

1237
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,860
And first of all, if you were too

1238
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,900
progressive in your let's say your level of

1239
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,740
intellectuality, if there is such a word, the

1240
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,200
powers that be want to see you either

1241
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,600
like addicted to drugs, homeless, living on a

1242
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,200
park bench, eating out of a garbage can

1243
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,760
or an insane asylum or jail.

1244
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,080
They don't want you in the public.

1245
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:21,920
Look, fair enough.

1246
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,080
And, you know, one of the coolest things

1247
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,440
I ever thought I saw when I was

1248
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,180
younger is the first guy I saw with

1249
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,240
one of those, you know, five gallon paint

1250
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,500
can drum sets, you know.

1251
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,740
And I love that guy.

1252
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,420
But was he sane by standard concept?

1253
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:36,680
Yeah.

1254
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,200
So that was in Times Square in the

1255
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,000
80s, really late 70s, 80s.

1256
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,380
Exactly.

1257
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,240
But the first time I saw it, it

1258
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,480
was amazing to me.

1259
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,940
And that guy, when you talk to him,

1260
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,380
though, you know, yeah, it would take about

1261
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,560
a couple of minutes.

1262
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,080
And then you realize this guy's probably not

1263
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,480
going to hold any other kind of job.

1264
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,240
So probably good.

1265
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,360
He's making paint can drums.

1266
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,420
Well, you don't want a job.

1267
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,020
You should have a job.

1268
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:56,640
Quit your job.

1269
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,580
Learn how to use revenue.

1270
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:57,900
Right.

1271
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,700
Fair enough.

1272
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,280
We're having a lot of fun with that,

1273
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:00,840
by the way.

1274
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,280
We've like I said, we've made the group

1275
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,560
more private.

1276
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,680
The chat groups will just take you to

1277
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,000
the old one.

1278
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,300
We're going to nuke that pretty soon.

1279
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,740
But we're just moving along.

1280
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:11,760
We're just moving along.

1281
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,020
It's it's such a such a cool thing

1282
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:17,120
to wake up to stuff that has been

1283
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,080
around for over 100 years.

1284
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,920
Let's say we're just about 100 years and

1285
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,740
has been taken advantage of by those who

1286
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,440
know about it.

1287
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,000
And they're not hiding it because you can

1288
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,180
find out just by reading.

1289
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:27,540
Right.

1290
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,120
Cool.

1291
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:28,660
Yep.
