1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,700
Hey, Sonic Event 192 rated Y and man,

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,520
fun, fun and more fun sometimes.

3
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,120
Greg, how are you?

4
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,360
You didn't get the tornadoes or anything.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,520
I saw tornadoes.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,720
No, but I know someone is doing some

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,680
amateur weather work out west.

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,860
I was watching it and they didn't follow

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,280
through.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,380
No, this is not like this is a

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:31,920
presumption.

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,980
And I'm like, oh, they're going to get

13
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,300
hit.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,620
I voiced it to some people that the

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,260
Midwest is going to get probably a day

16
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:41,980
notice on the forecast one or two days

17
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,880
before they get hit with some bad weather.

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,900
That's the thing about weather work.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,920
You got to see it through.

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,140
So it dissipates when you know, you have

21
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,440
to know what you're doing.

22
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,120
Does that make sense?

23
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,000
Yeah.

24
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,360
Well, it does.

25
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:57,940
It does.

26
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,920
You know, and one guy very cryptically approached

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,860
me on social media, believe it or not.

28
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,040
And I told me, you know, just like

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,140
the Greek knows how to do weather work.

30
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,380
Some of us understand how to move other

31
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,120
things around.

32
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,180
And they mentioned that recent quake in where

33
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:15,840
was it, Myanmar?

34
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,240
I think it was.

35
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,660
Well, that wasn't that was a go ahead,

36
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,360
you know, put my I'll give you my

37
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,280
three cents on that.

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,500
Yeah.

39
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,800
No, I wanted to get it from because

40
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,320
this person told me that this was definitely

41
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,640
not something that was just going to happen

42
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,000
anyway.

43
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,380
This was done by somebody.

44
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,260
Yeah.

45
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:32,540
Yeah.

46
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,200
Well, it's done by somebody times two.

47
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,780
And I'll get into it if you want.

48
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,040
Yeah.

49
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,760
Go ahead if you want.

50
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:36,960
Good.

51
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,400
Well, first of all, regardless of the earthquake

52
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,620
or asteroid or tornado or hurricane, there's only

53
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,060
one thing that we know that can do

54
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,500
the following, which is justify concrete and steel.

55
00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:00,080
Now, a two billion gigawatt ultrasonic transducer or

56
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,020
underground nuke, that tower that came down is

57
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,700
classic one to one nuclear demolition.

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,259
So I was thinking by the earthquakes, they

59
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,320
blew one of those.

60
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,200
You're ready, James Bond stuff.

61
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,180
Those P 700 granites that are still there's

62
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,020
20 of them, maybe 18 of them at

63
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,160
large that were absconded from the Kursk submarine.

64
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,200
And you could look up everything I just

65
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,440
said.

66
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,160
You'll find it.

67
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,300
And those P 700s have a dial a

68
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,920
new yield up to 500 kilotons, which is

69
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,920
50 times actually Hiroshima to say was 11

70
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,120
was really more like five.

71
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,140
But those are very tiny.

72
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,160
500 kilotons is pretty big.

73
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,340
It's half a megaton.

74
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,580
So they're dialed, they're dialable.

75
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,560
So you could dial it.

76
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,460
It's not crazy.

77
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,540
It's like the Wile E.

78
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,000
Coyote.

79
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,920
Remember, he had the dials on the devices.

80
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,400
Oh, yeah.

81
00:02:59,540 --> 00:02:59,940
Decide.

82
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:00,640
Decide.

83
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,680
You want the big bang.

84
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,020
Yeah.

85
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,880
You want the big bang.

86
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,880
You want the huge bang.

87
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,180
You want the no.

88
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:05,760
Yeah.

89
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,300
Yeah.

90
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,960
And these guys had the codes.

91
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,200
OK.

92
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,280
When they flew it into the Pentagon, they

93
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,480
didn't have the codes, fortunately, or they elected

94
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,840
not to use it.

95
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,340
And that's why they they threw Victor Booth

96
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,500
in jail, because the Department of Justice has

97
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,000
a secret.

98
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,880
Well, they're all secrets public.

99
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,440
You know, they have the the the the

100
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,320
trial against Victor Booth was for arms dealing

101
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:27,780
and stuff.

102
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,360
But the one that they didn't show the

103
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,400
public was for the missile that hit the

104
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:31,700
Pentagon.

105
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,480
That's what they arrested him for.

106
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,400
And Dmitry Kolozov was involved in defense of

107
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,600
that also because Putin kept saying Putin also

108
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,160
said, well, you know, the missile came from

109
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,180
Ukraine, but Ukraine never had an arsenal of

110
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,400
peace.

111
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:44,960
Seven hundred.

112
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,160
Good.

113
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,220
I need it's granite without the good.

114
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,420
I need G.R.A.N.I.T.

115
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,480
I'm just saying those are at large and

116
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,420
there's many, many, many others at large.

117
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,260
And Israel's been putting out the biggest black

118
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:58,620
mark.

119
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,440
The most dangerous stuff in the world comes

120
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,400
from that very dangerous country to the north

121
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,220
of us, by the way.

122
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,000
What would that be?

123
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,400
Well, Canada, as I look, that would be

124
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,760
Canada.

125
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,040
They broker some.

126
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,940
That's all I'm going to say.

127
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,620
I don't want to visit.

128
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,579
But yeah, yeah.

129
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,660
Years ago, I spoke to people that were

130
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,640
in certain groups that knew this kind of

131
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,380
stuff and they were pretty calm about it

132
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,500
because they were talking about it like it's

133
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,860
daily, like just the hot sheets that they

134
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,440
get every day.

135
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,520
And I was like, you got to be

136
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,300
kidding me.

137
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,680
This is freaking amazing stuff.

138
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,140
And of course, it's not for the public.

139
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,280
That's why this is a subscription thing.

140
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,360
Well, it goes out there, you know, in

141
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,060
the public in a way, but never, you

142
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,000
know, just like they showed on Men in

143
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,240
Black.

144
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:42,500
Right.

145
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,760
It goes out on the Weekly World News

146
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,080
and people laugh at it.

147
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,380
But the truth is, I did a whole

148
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,280
study on my show, even about the all

149
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,860
the nukes that they can't account for.

150
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,820
Remember all those ones that are missing and

151
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,840
that's public information.

152
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,220
Yeah.

153
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,280
That's talking about non-public information.

154
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,000
Well, right.

155
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,220
If they're telling you they're missing in public,

156
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,280
that means it's really bad.

157
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,220
Well, that's what I'm saying.

158
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,940
You see, they show you Bat Boy and

159
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,220
then they put that in the Weekly World

160
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:06,760
News, too.

161
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,140
Right.

162
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,020
So they show you Bat Boy and this

163
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,460
and that.

164
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,900
And the third thing, and it's all like,

165
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,460
oh, so you're supposed to laugh at it

166
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,180
because it's crap.

167
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,060
Yeah.

168
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,920
Now, what people don't understand, this sounds crazy

169
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,140
if you're not informed in this.

170
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:18,640
Yeah.

171
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,600
When they were doing all the above ground

172
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,400
nuke testing in Nevada, it caused a lot

173
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,140
of health problems, fitness problems, actually health problems

174
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,420
downwind, meaning east of Nevada, people were getting

175
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,020
what's called lung cancer and they had to

176
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,940
blame it on something.

177
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,640
And if the army sends the media and

178
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,120
the AMA, American Murders, I mean, American Medical

179
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,860
Association, a memo that they're going to say

180
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,440
it's cigarettes causing lung cancer because we might

181
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,080
someday presumably approach and do a study.

182
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,240
And then like a week later, we did

183
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,280
the study, right?

184
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,960
You got to think because they have to

185
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,000
follow through with paperwork, tell everyone that cigarette

186
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,820
smoking, they believe it because no one was

187
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,040
getting lung cancer west of Nevada between the

188
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,240
late 50s, 60s and 70s, unless they were

189
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,280
black or Jewish women.

190
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,300
Hmm.

191
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,520
All right.

192
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:07,940
OK.

193
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,820
What does that mean?

194
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,180
Should I get into what that means?

195
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,400
OK, because actually lung cancer mostly is caused

196
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,080
by let me just say this.

197
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,080
Most people that get lung cancer, I've never

198
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,380
smoked a cigarette like 80 percent, 80 percent

199
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,280
of those people never even smoked a cigarette,

200
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,040
should I say it again?

201
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,100
And 80 percent of those women, people are

202
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,600
black and Jewish women.

203
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,560
And one of the very well understood for

204
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,820
many, many years, lung cancer was caused by

205
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,260
grief, emotional grief.

206
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,680
Now, do you think black women in America

207
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,400
and Jewish women in America have any reason

208
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,700
to have grief?

209
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,080
Well, those are like most oppressed groups.

210
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,520
And, you know, during that time period, especially.

211
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,460
Oh, right.

212
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,160
Because even if you get empowered, what's the

213
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,040
first thing that happens?

214
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,020
The men get empowered.

215
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,000
If any, even on the surface, it's just

216
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,820
grief in general.

217
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,580
It could be personal family, you know, and

218
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,000
all that.

219
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,800
And even the movies portrays it.

220
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,040
Right.

221
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,380
Of course.

222
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,900
So anyway, that's that's not the absolute, but

223
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,780
I'm just saying now that's a real study,

224
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,280
by the way, what I just gave you

225
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,860
a real one over time.

226
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,260
But most people don't understand that they decided

227
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,180
to do most of the nuclear device testing

228
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,620
underground because there's no merit in atmospheric detonations,

229
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,760
meaning I think we went over a few

230
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,460
sonics ago or a couple of sonics ago.

231
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,080
There was a hot war with tactical nukes

232
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,720
between the Soviets and the Chinese in 69,

233
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,360
70, 71, something like that.

234
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:38,560
Yeah.

235
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,640
Somewhere within the last ten.

236
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,920
And it's classified still.

237
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,920
And what I'm telling you on the on

238
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,640
the tactical is the tactical linebreaker.

239
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,940
So here come right now, thousand troops, you

240
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,000
throw a howitzer, you know, a small one

241
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,100
and nuke them and they get it's like

242
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,020
hitting a wasp's nest with a baseball bat.

243
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:54,300
Right.

244
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:54,560
Yeah.

245
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,800
No, I went over it and I and

246
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,080
I decided to go do a search on

247
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,180
it.

248
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,520
What I came up with is they said

249
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,360
there was the potential for nuclear exchange.

250
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,360
No, no exchange.

251
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,440
But they thought it might.

252
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:02,980
Oh, yeah.

253
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,140
Yeah.

254
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,660
And we went through that and that whole

255
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,800
exercise to show you.

256
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,780
They talk about that conflict in the State

257
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,180
Department.

258
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:10,820
It listed it.

259
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,960
Then it said it's classified.

260
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,660
That's all.

261
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,040
And it was just a blank page.

262
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:15,620
Yes.

263
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,600
The rest below it.

264
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,340
So the interesting thing there is there is

265
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,000
more merit.

266
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,680
By the way, there's no merit in using

267
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,320
it in military.

268
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,100
It's just a tactical linebreaker, which can actually

269
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,180
be done more effectively by screwing up comms

270
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,360
and people, civilians communications is more effective.

271
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,460
But anyway, they decided to use it for

272
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,059
civilian purposes, mostly, which was like if you

273
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,660
want to clear, you know, you ever see

274
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,080
like driving cross-country, they cut a hole,

275
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,580
they cut a mountain or cut a hill

276
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,920
to put a road, keep it flat.

277
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:50,420
Right.

278
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,380
That takes a lot of work and a

279
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,100
lot of dynamite where, you know, the cost

280
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,840
of using an underground nuke and justifying everything

281
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,500
is a thousandth the price of dynamite.

282
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,500
These things look like fire extinguishers.

283
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,720
They're small and it's a lot cheaper logistically

284
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,980
because, you know, with dynamite and everything, you've

285
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,620
got to drill holes, you've got to place

286
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,860
it, you've got to do all this.

287
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,320
But if you're.

288
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:11,680
Yeah.

289
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,160
Yeah.

290
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,340
You just drill one hole.

291
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,820
And there's a video where the Russian countryside,

292
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,420
which is Siberia, they had a gas leak,

293
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,320
a natural gas leak.

294
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,100
They couldn't stop.

295
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,400
So they just counters slant drilled and put

296
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,080
one of these nukes.

297
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,700
You see the nuke.

298
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,620
It actually looks more like that more like

299
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,240
fire extinguisher.

300
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,660
It looks like the size of those A

301
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,100
or B tanks, the large ones that are

302
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,960
welding supply, you know, or in a hospital.

303
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,580
You know, they got the big oxygen tanks

304
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,040
like that.

305
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,440
Oh, yeah.

306
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,240
It's not very big.

307
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,280
Yeah, it's like a little shorter, you know,

308
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,580
about five foot tall, 10 inches, eight inches

309
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,040
in diameter.

310
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,160
That's all it is.

311
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,020
And they slipped it down.

312
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,940
You see the nuke go off and everything

313
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,840
vibrates, you'll dust on the surface and the

314
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,560
gas leak stop.

315
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,840
If you remember the BP oil spill, they

316
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,000
were suggesting on using nukes to stop it.

317
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,780
You just slant drill and you slide one

318
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,960
of these nukes in there and they go,

319
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,480
boop, and it justifies everything within the range,

320
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,240
depending on the yield of the device, vaporizes

321
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,200
instantly regardless of material and forms a glass

322
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,880
ball, glass lined ball plasma that takes about

323
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,700
three months to cool down to the ambient

324
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,200
again.

325
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,100
And it causes a crashing wave around it,

326
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,340
like an ultrasonic wave.

327
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,780
Look up what you know, there's ultrasonic jewelry

328
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,180
cleaning.

329
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,260
There's ultrasonic cleaning for teeth.

330
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,260
It just completely pulverizes anything it touches based

331
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,640
on the frequency and based on the yield,

332
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,560
you know, the energy.

333
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,740
So what people don't know is when you

334
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,540
do this underground, there's plenty of videos.

335
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,100
It's called Project Plowshare and they have been

336
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,660
using them.

337
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,040
And they're actually, if you know anyone in

338
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,100
the military, if you'd share, they're called atomic

339
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,680
gates, atomic gate, just like a fence gate,

340
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,840
you know, a gate and a fence atomic.

341
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,360
What they're set at very large skyscrapers and

342
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,460
public works like the, I'm not going to

343
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,380
mention bridges like the Golden Gate or the

344
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,700
Verrazano or anything like that.

345
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:10,360
But the possibility strategically, every, every power, every

346
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,240
government has a plan, a strategic plan and

347
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,860
technical plan that the government integrates with the

348
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,240
military.

349
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,220
And one of the plans always is what

350
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,720
if we get and take over by an

351
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,480
invading force?

352
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,340
What do we do?

353
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,200
Well, do we leave the Golden Gate Bridge

354
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,020
and the Verrazano Bridge?

355
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,060
I didn't mention those, did I?

356
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,660
Anyway, or do we set off these atomic

357
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,060
gates?

358
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,240
And right, right.

359
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,140
You know, yeah.

360
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,220
So they can't use the infrastructure, highways, tunnels.

361
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,720
So these things are set up and maintained

362
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,400
always around there.

363
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,080
Those those you could put if you were

364
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,060
to make a postcard of America with its

365
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,620
most significant, what would you call it?

366
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,340
Public works.

367
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,500
OK, all of those have it.

368
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:51,880
Right.

369
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,040
So, well, you know what?

370
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,660
They don't all necessarily have to have it

371
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,880
at the target sites either, because all you

372
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,020
got to do is disrupt certain networks at

373
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,180
particular choke points.

374
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,280
And, you know, by destroying one thing, you

375
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,380
can knock off access to locations.

376
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,140
You just you just need to put enough

377
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,380
of a gap in it that it's not

378
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:09,960
crossable.

379
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,340
Right.

380
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,020
That's all you know.

381
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,320
But you got to realize they like to

382
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,720
go big as if everyone that did this

383
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,100
design is from Texas.

384
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,820
But if you know what I mean.

385
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,020
It's also sort of the World Trade Center.

386
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,460
So Scorched Earth sometimes is the order of

387
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:23,560
the day.

388
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,100
That's right.

389
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,020
If it's not catastrophic, it's easy to repair.

390
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,100
But this is the state when you say

391
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,540
nuclear there.

392
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,080
Imagine when you said cell phone.

393
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,660
By the way, you could look this up.

394
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,560
There were cell phones around in the 1940s

395
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,240
and 50s.

396
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,300
They were for truck drivers.

397
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,800
The cell phone lines or literal lines and

398
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,740
receivers ran parallel to the highways.

399
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,740
And you could see there's YouTube videos.

400
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,900
I haven't looked at in a long time,

401
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,220
but hopefully they're still up.

402
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,700
You see a guy in a truck and

403
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,580
he has like a regular phone that you'd

404
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,280
have on the in your landline with a

405
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,340
cable and a box.

406
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,140
Yes.

407
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,380
He makes calls through to adjust his route

408
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,420
or where he's going to pick up.

409
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,360
His cell phones were funny because they used

410
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,780
to have a base and a wire like

411
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,620
a house phone did.

412
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,880
And they used to see him in cars

413
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,320
and like the late 70s.

414
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,860
Yeah, I remember a chauffeured a lot of

415
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,020
stuff.

416
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,260
Mr. Verderame for one week in 1985 in

417
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,620
his new Rolls Royce, he had a cell

418
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:18,740
phone.

419
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,860
It was in the center council.

420
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,820
You pull it open and it has a

421
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,240
regular phone with a cable.

422
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,980
And he apologized.

423
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,300
He says, I'm I was supposed to get

424
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,760
the one that was a wireless phone because

425
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,940
we already had wireless phones in the mid

426
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,340
80s.

427
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:32,580
Right.

428
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,020
And everybody's like, where's the phone?

429
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:35,260
Right.

430
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,200
So you have to go to the base

431
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,920
and push a button.

432
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,500
So the alarm.

433
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,640
Oh, it's under the couch pillow.

434
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:38,980
Right.

435
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,380
Remember those days.

436
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:41,820
But anyway.

437
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,600
Yeah, I do remember that.

438
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,500
It's just like that.

439
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,500
Can't find the phone.

440
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,820
You go to the base and you push

441
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,000
a button and you hear a buzz.

442
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,580
As soon as people got rid of it,

443
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,900
as soon as they went to the, you

444
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,920
know, the wireless phone.

445
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:52,180
Right.

446
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,120
Before that, everybody knew where it was, but

447
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,060
it was a pain in the neck because

448
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,460
you couldn't walk more than five feet away

449
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,000
from the wall.

450
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,320
Let's go back to the cell phone.

451
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,840
So you tell people cell phone and they

452
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,620
think of like an old Motorola brick that

453
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,100
you had a suitcase for.

454
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,620
And that's what a cell phone is.

455
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,640
Well, the nuclear technology is the same way.

456
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,460
What they show you is only atmospheric.

457
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,980
They usually show you postcards of some big

458
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,200
tests or the ones on Japan.

459
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,760
And that's it.

460
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,880
And that's all the public thinks.

461
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,680
They don't know that there there's an unwritten

462
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,060
agreement to not use them atmospherically.

463
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,400
That's why when they're talking about Putin's talking

464
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,380
about using nukes and wow, this is becoming

465
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,760
a sonic about nukes.

466
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,520
Was it?

467
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,180
I didn't expect any of this at all.

468
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,340
But it's not going to happen.

469
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,900
No, it's not going to happen.

470
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,700
It's the same thing like saying there's going

471
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,600
to be a financial crash.

472
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,420
It's not going to happen because it already

473
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,560
crashed in the 1930s, dude, or up to

474
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,160
the 1950s, the whole world's financial systems crash

475
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,660
and you're running under credit.

476
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,020
So what happens when you know we can't?

477
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,380
Well, what they're doing is restricting credit.

478
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,680
There's no way you can have a financial

479
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,140
crash.

480
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,700
Don't ever take anything like that to heart

481
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,980
because it's impossible.

482
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,600
What they're going to do is mess with

483
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:00,980
your credit.

484
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,920
And you know how they do that?

485
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,920
By sending you checks, stimulus, the more checks

486
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,620
they send you.

487
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,400
Hey, imagine anybody you might know that suddenly

488
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,840
goes to their mailbox and there's a check

489
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,060
for fifteen hundred dollars.

490
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,160
Wow.

491
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,640
This is what were they going to say?

492
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,280
All this sucks.

493
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,120
Are they going to say what?

494
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:17,960
No, this is great.

495
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:18,400
Great.

496
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:18,840
Great.

497
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:19,660
Right.

498
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,220
Yeah.

499
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,340
Then another, let's say two weeks goes by

500
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:22,940
to get another one.

501
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,760
Fifteen hundred dollars.

502
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,080
Right.

503
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,700
Is that suck?

504
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,140
Oh, this is terrible.

505
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,900
Hey, sign me up.

506
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,400
Or is it great?

507
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,300
Sign me up.

508
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:30,740
Exactly.

509
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,320
So I start saying that I'm like, oh,

510
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,600
the economy, not the financials, is going to

511
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,040
shit because right.

512
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,720
The more checks they send people, the more

513
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,640
money is created.

514
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,520
Yeah, of course.

515
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,020
Yeah.

516
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,860
So, by the way, I had someone that

517
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,580
I've known for a while.

518
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,880
He's put in.

519
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,340
I haven't looked at the replies.

520
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,340
He's I think he documented he's trading the

521
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,120
higher AI and he's putting in Sonics that

522
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,320
I've done from a long time ago.

523
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,820
And he says, oh, yeah, it checks out.

524
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,500
It's the AI completely check.

525
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,840
Everything you got is checked out.

526
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,180
So, well, whatever that means, let's get off

527
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:02,600
the new thing.

528
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,580
But I have this thing now.

529
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,980
You know how we come up with phrases

530
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,360
here.

531
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,820
I mean, the Greeks said, you know, like

532
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,960
dummy load and all this other stuff.

533
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,120
Right.

534
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,280
Well, I aftertaste is my latest one.

535
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,240
Aftertaste.

536
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,020
Yeah.

537
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,480
You ever see an AI image and you

538
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,040
could tell it's AI or something written by

539
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,680
AI and it leaves an aftertaste.

540
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:20,680
Yep.

541
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,320
Yeah, I call it because we're working on

542
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,400
the water helix dot com website and brilliant

543
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,780
person I'm working with, but he likes a

544
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,880
little bit too much.

545
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,600
And I said, you know, the people that

546
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,660
I'm talking to are wealthy clients because I

547
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,200
want to sell.

548
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,160
I want to release them to the luxury.

549
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,320
I think I went over that.

550
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,580
If you sell something to commoners, then you

551
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,620
want to go to luxury market.

552
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,960
The luxury shake their finger left and right.

553
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,220
That means, no, I want something better.

554
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,020
So if you sell to the luxury first,

555
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,300
then you can trickle down.

556
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:56,820
Right.

557
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,980
And those people are very realistic.

558
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,440
They don't make decisions the way the average

559
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,359
people get impressed.

560
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,380
But I think there was stuff about aftertaste

561
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,700
with sodas back in the day.

562
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,460
Wasn't there something?

563
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,819
No, it was it was the alcohol free

564
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:13,140
beer.

565
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:13,660
What was it?

566
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,540
No aftertaste.

567
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:14,740
Right.

568
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,180
What was it?

569
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,800
You remember something about aftertaste?

570
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,339
Oh my God.

571
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,119
The less filling tastes great.

572
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,099
No aftertaste.

573
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,099
No aftertaste.

574
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,400
Right.

575
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:22,680
Yeah.

576
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,560
Well, that was the O'Doul's, right?

577
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:25,280
O'Doul's.

578
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Yeah, I yeah.

579
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,280
But I remember hearing no aftertaste somewhere in

580
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,180
the media before.

581
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,380
But what I'm saying is you notice that

582
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,040
when you look at poorly done, AI leaves

583
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,900
a really bad aftertaste, really good AI where

584
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,160
you could say 50 50.

585
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,440
It could be real or not.

586
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,580
That's that's possible.

587
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,880
It's got a mild flavor.

588
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:45,980
Right.

589
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,440
But the the AI aftertaste is remember when

590
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,780
you first had diet soda?

591
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,860
I don't know.

592
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,460
Some people don't mind that aftertaste.

593
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:52,980
I do.

594
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,120
No, I can't.

595
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,120
Well, after I can't do it, I you

596
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,440
know, because you've tasted it.

597
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:57,740
Yeah.

598
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,580
Yeah.

599
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,080
And after tasting it, it's like, whoa.

600
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,540
This is not good at all.

601
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,240
You know, it's not good saying it's bad

602
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,780
because it makes the people who like it

603
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,000
feel bad to say this is really not

604
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,320
good.

605
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,160
And yeah, so there's this thing I get

606
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,560
when I look at something done by AI.

607
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,320
And sometimes people play a joke.

608
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,560
I mean, they'll send me an email and

609
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,960
they'll have the AI write it.

610
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,360
And I see who it is playing a

611
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
joke as someone I know.

612
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,820
And you spot it right away.

613
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,360
Right.

614
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,340
I think, well, you know, I'm being presumptuous

615
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,900
here that just because I could spot AI

616
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,400
right away, everyone else does.

617
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:31,680
Right.

618
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,720
Some people don't care.

619
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,380
Right.

620
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:34,920
You know what I mean?

621
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,380
And like that dog in the background, I'll

622
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,280
move out of the way here.

623
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,240
That's cracking me up because, you know, we

624
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,540
talked just before we started to record here

625
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,360
and sirens.

626
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,060
And I'm worried about my dogs.

627
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,840
And meanwhile, you got all kinds of dogs

628
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,600
over by you.

629
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,880
Well, it's the desert.

630
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,140
High desert is very quiet.

631
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,860
And they're actually about 200 feet south of

632
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,120
me.

633
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,320
And it carries.

634
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,560
Remember, the high desert means we were underwater

635
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,200
at one point and it got pushed up

636
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,800
about a mile, half a mile.

637
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,080
Now, there's no there's no old trees here.

638
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,740
Now, the trees we have are like 20

639
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,040
feet.

640
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,640
The funniest thing to me is that people

641
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,240
listening to us right now that might be

642
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,040
filtered out or you might vaguely hear the

643
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,840
dog in the background.

644
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,220
It's not that it's not that, you know,

645
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:16,860
it's not terrible.

646
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,680
No, I know.

647
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:17,980
Yeah.

648
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:18,660
But yeah.

649
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,200
But anyway, again, I just want to drive

650
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,360
home the AI aftertaste, push it around and

651
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,700
make it make a hat or a T

652
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:25,940
-shirt.

653
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,760
Look, this is good.

654
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,460
I know after minimal aftertaste, but that's what

655
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,100
it does for me.

656
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,680
But it's a mental aftertaste.

657
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,480
And it's I find it very displeasing and

658
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,760
in poor taste, very much how it's a

659
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,120
sign of the times, like, you know, 70s

660
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,960
fashion.

661
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,080
You know, you're going to you're going to

662
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,000
think for the 70s fashion is that Lipschitz

663
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,620
guy, Ralph Lauren.

664
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,280
That's his real name, by the way.

665
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,660
I had him as a client, by the

666
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:52,780
way.

667
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,240
Not me, the company I worked with.

668
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,640
We redid the Rhinelander on 72nd in Madison,

669
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,040
which is still his main store, Lipschitz.

670
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,340
Yeah, he came up with the wide collar

671
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,660
and the wide ties, by the way.

672
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,620
You could thank him for it.

673
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,200
But when you see that with those patterns,

674
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,340
you say 70s.

675
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:10,520
Right.

676
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,640
And I'm glad we're not right doing that

677
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,140
anymore, no matter how many comebacks they have.

678
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,600
And then you got the 80s hair.

679
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,900
Remember the 80s, everything permed up?

680
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,520
Oh, I'm glad we're not doing that.

681
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,220
Look, a bird's nest, you know, like spiders

682
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,000
can take.

683
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,140
All you got to do is if you

684
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,100
like Star Trek, just watch what they called

685
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,900
The Next Generation, because it was made toward

686
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,680
the end of the 80s.

687
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,600
Yeah, and it's like everything in the future.

688
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,120
But they couldn't get away from the 80s

689
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,420
hair.

690
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,480
That's right.

691
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,080
You could always.

692
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,720
That's why good films don't let themselves be

693
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,060
dated.

694
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:37,500
Right.

695
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,300
And then you got all this other stuff.

696
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,240
Also, 80s was the huge shoulder pads on

697
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,800
everything.

698
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,080
Well, women.

699
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:44,780
Wait a minute.

700
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,780
Now, it wasn't men.

701
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,740
Men didn't always have the shoulder pads, shoulder

702
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,740
pads and women.

703
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,040
Well, they got beefy on the men's like

704
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,720
like not on the members only.

705
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,880
Coat jackets.

706
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,020
But no, it was like regular jackets.

707
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:56,540
They did.

708
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,260
Yeah, women accentuated.

709
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:58,560
Yes.

710
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:58,780
Right.

711
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,780
The Miami Vice look kind of went with

712
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,160
a little bit with the shoulder pads.

713
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,340
But it was introduced into women's garments, mainly

714
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,500
with the women and everything addresses shoulder pads,

715
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,640
wedding dress, shoulder pads.

716
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,360
I mean, yeah, it was like, yeah, I'm

717
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,960
giving an example here about the A.I.

718
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,220
And one of the retorts I got back

719
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,880
was that they're they're doing much better now.

720
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,320
No problems with the hands.

721
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,880
And I went back and I found what

722
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,640
they're OK.

723
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,940
The hands are looking better.

724
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,900
You know, six fingers or distorted hands.

725
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,200
And but the feet are really jacked up.

726
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,420
So, I mean, the feet look like, you

727
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,500
know, you could peel a banana.

728
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,020
It's a way to look like a human

729
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,360
foot.

730
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,140
Let me tell you something.

731
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,520
It's worse than that, because I went and

732
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,960
I decided people were giving me this crap

733
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,920
about, you know, the JFK document dump that

734
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,360
came out.

735
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,720
And, you know, why don't you use an

736
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,640
A.I. to go through it?

737
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,660
And I went, please don't don't don't waste

738
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,140
my time.

739
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,620
But but I said, you know what?

740
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,260
Let me go play with one of these

741
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,940
A.I. and see what the general like

742
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,540
an open one can do with the JFK

743
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,020
assassination.

744
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:00,480
Right.

745
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,760
I didn't want it to give me a

746
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,020
theory.

747
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,400
I didn't want it to solve it for

748
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:03,620
me.

749
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,340
I wanted to just give me basic information,

750
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:06,740
OK?

751
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,840
And you know what?

752
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,860
The A.I. cannot organize the basic information

753
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,380
properly.

754
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,900
I turned around and I tried to get

755
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,060
it to do it and it wouldn't do

756
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,300
it.

757
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,960
It wouldn't even give me a good explanation

758
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,600
of the of the standard explanation.

759
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:20,980
Sorry.

760
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,100
Are you using the which tier, the public

761
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,460
tier or the private tier?

762
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,500
That's got two tiers.

763
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,300
I tried.

764
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,320
I tried both.

765
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:27,760
OK.

766
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,480
Oh, OK.

767
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:28,820
OK.

768
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,280
Yeah.

769
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,900
Because they deliberately entice you with the crap

770
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,540
and they try to write.

771
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,940
It's a reverse psychology that the public or

772
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:36,920
the free one isn't doing well.

773
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,820
So you have to subscribe to deliberately make

774
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,560
it not do well.

775
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,180
But yeah, I'm not paying for it.

776
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,740
But I was able to access it anyway.

777
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,160
Oh, good.

778
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:43,520
OK.

779
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,620
Point is, the point is this, I went

780
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,640
and I did that and I tried to

781
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,440
get text out of it.

782
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,500
And then I said, you know what?

783
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,040
Forget it.

784
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,360
I give up this thing, trying to write

785
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,060
me like, you know, a short paper, like

786
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,220
as if I was giving a kid a

787
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,040
history assignment.

788
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:56,340
Right.

789
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,660
Write me a paper about the JFK assassination.

790
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,260
No good.

791
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,340
So I said, all right, give me some

792
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,380
images, because everybody tells me the images are

793
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:03,660
great.

794
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,740
This and that.

795
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,360
And they've done better.

796
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,700
And they told me like they told you,

797
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,400
the hands are better.

798
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,460
So I said, OK, give me some images.

799
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,500
It is the most jokey, ridiculous thing you've

800
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,460
ever seen in your life.

801
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,720
I actually put these things out like, you

802
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,880
know, in a couple of places and said,

803
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,500
this is what I tells me when I

804
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,960
ask it to describe the Kennedy assassination.

805
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,860
I'm not asking to solve it for me.

806
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,640
So I know.

807
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,020
But in short, it was it was it

808
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,420
couldn't even handle the current established.

809
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,460
It couldn't even handle the established lore.

810
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,640
It couldn't handle the conspiracy theory.

811
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,440
It couldn't handle.

812
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,880
Give me just a straight historical explanation, not

813
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,060
in picture form, not written form.

814
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,600
It can't handle it because there's too much

815
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,160
information.

816
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,100
Now, think about this.

817
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,560
If there's too much information on that one

818
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:47,900
thing.

819
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,660
Oh, my gosh.

820
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,220
Then tell me how far we've gone so

821
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:51,420
far.

822
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,300
Now, the guys who got fired from Google,

823
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,020
who engineered some of this stuff for them,

824
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,460
you know, they tell me, listen, there's a

825
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,320
couple of things that really are not available

826
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,420
to anybody right now.

827
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,180
And this and that was OK.

828
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,360
And of course, you know about that.

829
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,000
But but that's the thing.

830
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,300
All this stuff that people are thinking is

831
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,220
so great and is one.

832
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,320
It's just another toy.

833
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,900
It's just another.

834
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,220
Yeah.

835
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,880
And it's not really a because we we've

836
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,940
got over this a long time.

837
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,960
We are in an AI, because if this

838
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,200
is a created reality, who wants to do

839
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:20,700
the labor?

840
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,660
The pinnacle of any being is to make

841
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,440
machines and substitutes for.

842
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,280
So you can go and do other things.

843
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,500
Right.

844
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,840
So so, quote unquote, God could go fishing

845
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,000
while the AI he made runs the reality.

846
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,360
You see.

847
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,800
So it's been around forever.

848
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,540
Well, anyone that hammers that to death, it's

849
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,960
even in their name is archaics.

850
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,240
Right.

851
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:39,820
There you go.

852
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,000
I mean, why bother to sit there and

853
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,800
build one car that'll take you a month

854
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,480
to build from the, you know, the floor

855
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,840
to the roof of the vehicle?

856
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,180
Right.

857
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,180
Why bother to do that if you can

858
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,080
build the machines over the course of a

859
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,040
couple of months and then in this case

860
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,800
would be like a 3D printer, which just

861
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,080
spits out three dimensional.

862
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,960
Yeah, right.

863
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,040
Why not just do it that way?

864
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:58,480
Hardens.

865
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,860
Yeah, I mean, that's what it is.

866
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,200
By the way, I've gotten a lot of

867
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,600
engineer on the engineering side proposals to do

868
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,660
3D printing, and it doesn't take me more

869
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,980
than 10 seconds to knock that whole idea

870
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,400
down.

871
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,640
No, it's not going to work ever.

872
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,460
So it would.

873
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,220
Well, not ever.

874
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,720
But in the ever we have left again,

875
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,560
what's available.

876
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,700
But that's the point with what's available, because,

877
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,660
look, we could speculate.

878
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,520
We could dream.

879
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,980
We could theorize.

880
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,480
But you still got to work with at

881
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,600
the end of the day what we have.

882
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,060
In the 1960s, the post office was able

883
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,960
to read 13 pages of regular envelopes, 13

884
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,640
envelopes stacked up, it would read all.

885
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,980
And I imagine, you know, it's folded in

886
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,380
there, right?

887
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:38,800
Right.

888
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,120
So it's all gibberish.

889
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,700
I was able to read through a stack

890
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,740
of 13 envelopes at a time with extra

891
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,020
whatever.

892
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,420
This is in the 60s.

893
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,340
This is 60 years.

894
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,800
You know, we say 60s now.

895
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:49,860
That's 60 years ago.

896
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,500
Yeah, of course.

897
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:54,100
So, yeah, so they would do that.

898
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,040
And if you go, can you go out

899
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,160
and buy a machine that'll do that?

900
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,940
Go to your office depot or where do

901
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,540
they sell these high end devices?

902
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,000
You say, I need something that could read

903
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,160
13 envelopes stacked up at once.

904
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,520
They still don't offer that.

905
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,260
You see, right?

906
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,120
No, but you know what?

907
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,400
On your cell phone, you can basically click

908
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,080
anything and it'll read it to you.

909
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,300
Now, that's new.

910
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,980
That was an imagined technology in the 80s.

911
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,760
I got to tell you, they've just released

912
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,020
that.

913
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,180
I had a client in the 90s who

914
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,060
was working on that.

915
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,380
And he says they're having a problem with

916
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,420
the various American accents more than any other

917
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,300
country, because in other countries, when the accents

918
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,520
change, it's a different language.

919
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,760
If you go to Spain, like Catalans, Catalonia,

920
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,820
it's not Spanish.

921
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,240
Right.

922
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:35,600
Right.

923
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,720
Now, here, here, you know, you got the

924
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,120
garage and you got the garage.

925
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,360
Right.

926
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,840
And Boston, you got New York.

927
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,440
You got.

928
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,920
Well, I just gave you a garage.

929
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,480
Right.

930
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:48,080
And then, yeah, all these different twangs and

931
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,980
it's all the same language.

932
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,300
Yes.

933
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,720
But they work that out.

934
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,080
Yeah.

935
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,280
So whatever.

936
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:53,660
Yeah.

937
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,040
Not impressed.

938
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:55,800
No.

939
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,980
And they model stuff like now one of

940
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,680
the readers, one of those readers I was

941
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,960
telling you about where you can point it

942
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,100
at a book and it'll read it to

943
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:02,300
you.

944
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,960
You can get Snoop Dogg to do it

945
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,280
for you.

946
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,580
Snoop Dogg's voice does it.

947
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,400
Oh, I see.

948
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,540
But again, like the reason I never liked

949
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:12,620
these devices is because the programmers did it

950
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,440
for a mindset that is of a nine

951
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,260
year old girl with a credit card.

952
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:16,520
Right.

953
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,460
That makes any sense.

954
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,180
And that I just can't jive with that

955
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:19,620
mindset.

956
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,740
But I don't think I ever will.

957
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,780
No, it makes perfect sense.

958
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,720
Recently, I played a couple of clips from

959
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,200
an A.I. version of George Carlin, believe

960
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,360
it or not, where it was like, you

961
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,820
know, as if he was alive today, as

962
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,460
in jokes today.

963
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:30,780
Yeah.

964
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,000
And the first thing he does, he comes

965
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,380
out and makes a joke about, sorry, I

966
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,740
haven't put out any new material, but I've

967
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,400
been dead, you know, which is a Carlin

968
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:37,740
joke.

969
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,180
I get it.

970
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,600
Yeah.

971
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:38,920
But a lot of.

972
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,360
Yeah.

973
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,660
But I'm just saying that's more like subject

974
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:41,940
matter.

975
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,780
I'm just saying the overall quality just for

976
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,320
me isn't there now.

977
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,380
Without being hypocritical.

978
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:47,800
Yeah.

979
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,200
The the image that's on the top of

980
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,100
the site that we put together is a

981
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,200
and it looks banging.

982
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:53,860
It's great.

983
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,380
I read it through a bunch of people,

984
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,480
several of the images, and that was at

985
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,620
the top and I'm using it.

986
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:02,460
But I ended up redacting most of the

987
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:02,980
stuff.

988
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,520
We have one where there's a UFO in

989
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,520
the background and someone's holding the scale orator

990
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,240
and says, thanks.

991
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:08,540
Right.

992
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,140
OK.

993
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,800
Like you could go to the water helix

994
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,320
dot com.

995
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:12,940
Yeah.

996
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,060
And also, yeah, a bunch of other stuff

997
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,900
we have to do for publishing reasons.

998
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,380
So, yeah.

999
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,020
Right.

1000
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,340
Right.

1001
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,360
Hey, but the uncultivated graphic, you did that

1002
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:23,680
yourself.

1003
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,640
That's not a right.

1004
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,160
No, I did that with using word.

1005
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:28,800
Yeah.

1006
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:29,620
Yeah.

1007
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,400
No, I'm just I'm just throwing it in

1008
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:31,560
there.

1009
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,880
Which which I think I would have done

1010
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,000
the graphic of graphics, meaning just letters better

1011
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,280
because of space.

1012
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,200
No, but I just did that with word.

1013
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,720
OK, I have no time anymore in this

1014
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,500
life to sit in front of a computer

1015
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:45,900
or other.

1016
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,960
It would be like this is a bad,

1017
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,700
bad one.

1018
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,420
But I'll say it anyway.

1019
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,120
To me, these devices and computers are just

1020
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,140
like sitting at the toilet.

1021
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,340
What do you go to the toilet for?

1022
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,600
Do your business and go.

1023
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:57,420
Right.

1024
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,160
I can't just sit there and do stuff.

1025
00:28:59,280 --> 00:28:59,740
You know what I mean?

1026
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,180
Well, you do that to get rid of

1027
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,500
what you've already used up.

1028
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,580
Well, I'm just saying, yeah, it's just something

1029
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,660
you don't want to think about.

1030
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,940
It's something you don't want to spend a

1031
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:07,600
lot of time with.

1032
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,140
Right.

1033
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,340
Fair enough.

1034
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,240
So listen, we've gone through a lot of

1035
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,160
stuff here without even touching the questions.

1036
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,400
But I do want to do.

1037
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,240
Let's do the questions.

1038
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,660
We've been on about half an hour, 40

1039
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:16,860
minutes.

1040
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,280
Let's do it.

1041
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,500
Yeah, I just want to jump because that's

1042
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,240
that's always a good perk for whoever is

1043
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,440
asking them and another chance to squeeze something

1044
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:23,740
out.

1045
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,280
Yeah, right.

1046
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,560
So I'll just give you a couple of

1047
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:25,700
them.

1048
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,840
OK, we don't have to do them all

1049
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,820
today, but by all means, guys, keep sending

1050
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,240
in what it is you want mentioned here,

1051
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,380
covered, gone back over, et cetera, especially if

1052
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,900
you want something gone back over, I think,

1053
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,420
because sometimes people miss things, you know, somehow,

1054
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,060
even though they're listening as intently as they

1055
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,440
can.

1056
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,580
But see the Sonics about that to get

1057
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,340
a better grip on it.

1058
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,560
Anyway, OK, there's a weird one just out

1059
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,080
of left field.

1060
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,180
And I picked this at random.

1061
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,520
Can you recommend a synthetic oil for high

1062
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,920
miles for a two thousand Camry?

1063
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:56,760
Yeah.

1064
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,300
With only one is your best bet.

1065
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,740
That's mostly available.

1066
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,400
Walmart supposedly for half the money has something

1067
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,900
that's good for 20,000 miles or something

1068
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,480
that's supposed to be like mobile one.

1069
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,160
Check it out.

1070
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,880
There are really high end one and also

1071
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,280
Amsol, A-M-S-O-L.

1072
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,760
And I think you could buy those at

1073
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,620
some stores.

1074
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
It's usually a mail order.

1075
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,580
I'm doing I'm testing that right now.

1076
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,180
I'm really happy on how smooth it is.

1077
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,800
But for synthetic, OK, here's the recommendation with

1078
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,800
motors and our engines, their engines is in

1079
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,580
an optimum world.

1080
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,440
Let's just say you used a synthetic from

1081
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,100
day one, literally day one on that car.

1082
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,820
You're OK.

1083
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,780
But if you haven't, you're there's a bunch

1084
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,660
of varnish and lack that's built up that

1085
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,960
you won't get the full benefits.

1086
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,460
So you're going to need to do a

1087
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,000
gentle flush.

1088
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,400
And so maybe 100 miles before you do

1089
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,900
the oil change, pour in some Marvel mystery

1090
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,580
oil.

1091
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,980
Not when I say some, you know, all

1092
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,320
cars burn a little bit of oil.

1093
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,000
It's OK to go slightly above the dipstick

1094
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,760
slightly, but not much more depending on how

1095
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,480
fast you're driving.

1096
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,280
And about a 50 or 100 miles before

1097
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,040
you put in five, six, seven, eight ounces,

1098
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,080
depending on how much oil is you could

1099
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,320
put in the in the sump.

1100
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,880
Marvel mystery oil.

1101
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,720
It has something called stoddard oil.

1102
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,920
It's been used for 100 years and it

1103
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,680
takes moisture.

1104
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,220
It dissolves lack of lacquer and varnish slowly.

1105
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,540
So it won't release any big chunks that

1106
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,680
get stuck in any of the orifices.

1107
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,580
I believe it also has lard in it.

1108
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,000
So, you know, you know how, you know,

1109
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,440
the best tacos supposedly are fried in lard.

1110
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,380
I don't eat that.

1111
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,740
But, you know, I understand.

1112
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,340
I'm an Old Testament kind of person.

1113
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,160
But that's what I would do there.

1114
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,120
But mobile one is is an all across

1115
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,100
the board recommendation because you can get it

1116
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,280
anywhere at discount store.

1117
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,280
Well, and just one, frankly, look, I worked

1118
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,960
in that business for a little while with,

1119
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,760
you know, I worked Rex on mobile, actually.

1120
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,460
And the thing is, the mobile stuff has

1121
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,100
been consistent with its manufacturing and it's very

1122
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,640
high grade.

1123
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,080
Yeah.

1124
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,220
And, you know, for what's available to the

1125
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:15,780
public, right?

1126
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,880
Not the stuff that's, you know, formulated specifically

1127
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,740
for race cars and this and that for

1128
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,180
stuff that's available to the public.

1129
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,960
It's actually of a higher quality than.

1130
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:24,460
Yeah.

1131
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,860
Well, here's the other thing.

1132
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,280
Castro is overrated.

1133
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,960
It's gotten it had a big campaign.

1134
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,360
Well, there is a better oil than Castro,

1135
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,420
by the way.

1136
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:39,920
The Pennsylvania Oil Company is, in other words,

1137
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,940
could take more carbon.

1138
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,000
But a 2000 Camry.

1139
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,660
Yeah, that's if it has less than 400000

1140
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,060
miles on it, you take care of it.

1141
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,080
It's broken in now.

1142
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:50,800
Congratulations.

1143
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,440
Right.

1144
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:51,760
Yeah.

1145
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,440
You could go a million miles with that,

1146
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:53,960
by the way.

1147
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,940
Those I've never known one of those to

1148
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,720
actually die.

1149
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,860
Those things usually go off road once they've

1150
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,200
been hit too bad in an accident.

1151
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,900
That's usually someone who blew, I think, a

1152
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,240
rocker arm on a piston.

1153
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,020
It just really failed.

1154
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,820
It had a quarter of a million miles.

1155
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,880
And but he immediately went and replaced the

1156
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,020
engine, which was a smart thing to do.

1157
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,520
A 96 and still driving it.

1158
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,260
Oh, yeah.

1159
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,380
Almost 30 years.

1160
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,840
That's yeah.

1161
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,100
Well, I'm I'm enjoying a 27 year old

1162
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,980
Dodge Caravan.

1163
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,020
I love the hell out of it.

1164
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,200
Drives like a car could put a washer

1165
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,680
dryer in there and go down the road

1166
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,560
with a bunch of people.

1167
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,620
You know, it's great.

1168
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,180
Yeah.

1169
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,720
OK, so another one.

1170
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,800
Somebody addressed that.

1171
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,280
Now, I don't know if you remember this,

1172
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,200
but you had this brief discussion about all

1173
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,620
the flora and the fauna and you have

1174
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,300
no need for it.

1175
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,460
And who cares about the rest of the

1176
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,080
animal life?

1177
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,040
If no, no, no.

1178
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,040
That's that's if you let humans if the

1179
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,720
humans were on a correct path and you

1180
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,940
weren't controlled.

1181
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:51,560
Right.

1182
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,740
And you weren't stalled out like, you know,

1183
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,240
the entire 20th century was stalled in this

1184
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,860
century is completely stalled.

1185
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,580
You don't mean by putting a stall and

1186
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,440
it can't take off.

1187
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:01,680
Right.

1188
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,620
Humans would eventually get rid of all animal

1189
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,520
life and insect life and all that and

1190
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,460
close the planet, make it just pure, pure

1191
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,060
habitation.

1192
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:11,320
I'm not saying that's the right thing to

1193
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,219
do, but that would be a very simple

1194
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,179
progression.

1195
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,219
That was my point is we do that

1196
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:16,600
anyway.

1197
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:16,920
Yeah.

1198
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,219
Anyway, where are all the whales?

1199
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
Where's the dodo bird?

1200
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,620
Where is the world?

1201
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,520
How many species of humans been directly responsible

1202
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,340
for eliminating?

1203
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,780
And it's got to be in the thousands.

1204
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,580
Well, the whales are funny because, you know,

1205
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:28,679
they did that whole again.

1206
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,920
I know I'm Star Trek guy, but they

1207
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,580
did that Star Trek movie about the whales

1208
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,320
being extinct.

1209
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,260
But the thing is, those whales that they

1210
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,420
said would be extinct are actually growing in

1211
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,820
population now and et cetera.

1212
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,200
Sure.

1213
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,940
Look, all I'm trying to say is conservation

1214
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,360
does.

1215
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:42,679
Yeah.

1216
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,659
All I'm trying to get at is that

1217
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:46,679
I wanted to clear up a misunderstanding because

1218
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,260
it seems like a couple of people thought

1219
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,780
that you were either a suggesting this or

1220
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,960
saying that this is the way things were

1221
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,360
going.

1222
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
I want to be taken that way.

1223
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,600
I'm just saying if you let humans progress

1224
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,440
technologically, when they get to the point where

1225
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,280
they don't need to farm or hunt or

1226
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,300
do anything like that, everything is synthesized.

1227
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:04,680
Right.

1228
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,640
Like in like in Star Trek, we have

1229
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,760
that technology now.

1230
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,300
Right.

1231
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,600
I mean, if I had more years to

1232
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,240
live and just some more funding, I can

1233
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:12,900
develop it.

1234
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,820
You know, I'm not the smartest tool in

1235
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,540
the shed and I can develop it in

1236
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,340
my kitchen, in my backyard shed.

1237
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,140
I can make that stuff, you know, it's

1238
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,560
around.

1239
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,320
So what I mean is make make the

1240
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,400
equipment to make synthesize anything.

1241
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,320
Once you understand the principle.

1242
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:30,860
Right.

1243
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,940
So the evolution, meaning the progression unraveling of

1244
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,460
humankind is they will just get rid of

1245
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,220
everything that's not human and not necessary.

1246
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,400
That's what people do.

1247
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,520
Look at how they build a city.

1248
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,220
We don't need this for the city.

1249
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,160
They they roll out a plan for the

1250
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,440
city.

1251
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,580
And you hold it.

1252
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,760
Look at the plan and you look at

1253
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,320
what's there.

1254
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,300
And you look at when the city is

1255
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:53,480
done.

1256
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,980
What was there is no longer there at

1257
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,260
all.

1258
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,420
It's all gone.

1259
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:56,720
OK.

1260
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,040
Right.

1261
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:57,360
Yeah.

1262
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,220
So look, I was just trying to make

1263
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,060
the point that you weren't suggesting it.

1264
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:02,500
It wasn't.

1265
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,380
No, I wasn't.

1266
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,380
But I said, I know what it takes

1267
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,320
to suggest that, because I did suggest what

1268
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,060
I wanted to piss off, like a high

1269
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,120
end bicycle distributor.

1270
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,420
He would come and give me all these

1271
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:12,920
saddles.

1272
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,500
You know, there's a lot of bike seats

1273
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,300
and they're really high end, you know, Ferrari

1274
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,940
and all this other stuff.

1275
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,160
And I said, no, these are no good.

1276
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:22,080
I want ones that have animal skins from

1277
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,060
endangered species.

1278
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,540
And he would just get totally inflamed because

1279
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,860
people have a very sensitive spot.

1280
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,080
Like you give me an example.

1281
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,500
You know, torching the rainforest was all a

1282
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,740
propaganda and they did torch a lot of

1283
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,680
it, but it was propaganda.

1284
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,940
And what do you call it?

1285
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,200
Propaganda might what they wanted to do there

1286
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,520
was torch enough of it and put it

1287
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,260
in the in the media enough to get

1288
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,800
it public outrage, international public outrage.

1289
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,160
So then they could pass laws and all

1290
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,840
the countries to protect the environment.

1291
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:52,560
Right.

1292
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,440
But in a way that would suit them

1293
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,400
who are passing the laws, you get it.

1294
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,600
Yeah, it would be nothing to benefit the

1295
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,900
people, be draconian.

1296
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,680
So then they have actually open swaths where

1297
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,980
no one can step in so they could

1298
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,600
do their human hunting parties.

1299
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,000
You know, they have human hunting, right?

1300
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,400
Well, there's there's that.

1301
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,640
And also, frankly, look, no, nobody gives you

1302
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,020
this information, the news or education or any

1303
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,240
of this.

1304
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,020
Nobody gives you any of that to inform

1305
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:15,220
you.

1306
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:15,760
What are you, stupid?

1307
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,040
The point is that they give it to

1308
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,380
you to react to it.

1309
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,620
Yes, they want a reaction.

1310
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,500
They don't want you to learn anything or

1311
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,920
to tell you the condition of things or

1312
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,880
to actually warn you.

1313
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,280
It's about just getting you to react a

1314
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:27,720
certain way.

1315
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,520
And that's what it's about.

1316
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,440
It's about manipulation.

1317
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,400
What they want to do is give you

1318
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,120
enough reasons that we can't do anything anymore

1319
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,940
and whatever.

1320
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,400
But, you know, you could fit the entire

1321
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,320
population of the earth in Texas comfortably in

1322
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,860
a suburban setting, by the way.

1323
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,260
Well, that was the point I want to

1324
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,880
make about this floral and quanta thing and

1325
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,520
removing everything.

1326
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,200
Here's here's the reality, OK?

1327
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,300
And you tell me if you disagree.

1328
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,880
There is no reason for anybody on this

1329
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,820
planet to actually be without anything.

1330
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,000
If you mathematically distributed stuff all across because

1331
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,760
people always talk, oh, it's too much population,

1332
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,700
too much population.

1333
00:37:59,120 --> 00:37:59,820
Here's the fact.

1334
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,700
No, that's a that's a fallacy.

1335
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,520
No, you can have a you can have

1336
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,360
a trillion people on this planet.

1337
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,200
You know, by the way, there's evidence.

1338
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,140
We know probably you've known me for a

1339
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:10,560
long time.

1340
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,040
You know, I've been saying there are there

1341
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,640
are no billion and a half people in

1342
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:13,860
China.

1343
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,940
It's coming out right now.

1344
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,140
There's people documenting, you know, putting up more

1345
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,120
official.

1346
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,940
There's no more than three or four hundred

1347
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,340
million.

1348
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,940
And I reaffirmed this again during the covid

1349
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,400
thing.

1350
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,120
Twenty twenty.

1351
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,680
I started talking about it again.

1352
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,340
There can't be more than two billion or

1353
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,140
three billion people max.

1354
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,260
Even that's a big number.

1355
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,580
I'd be surprised if it was more than

1356
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,560
a billion on the planet, because who who

1357
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,640
comes up with these population numbers?

1358
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,600
It's the bankers.

1359
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,960
Oh, the bankers keep very straight books, don't

1360
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,200
they?

1361
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:46,880
Yeah.

1362
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,140
Right.

1363
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:47,580
Yeah.

1364
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,600
It's all false.

1365
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,540
Because the the reason why they had to.

1366
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:54,760
And I talked about this decades ago.

1367
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,340
Also, the reason why they say there's billions

1368
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,020
of people in China is because their birth

1369
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,140
certificates are very, very low value.

1370
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:02,520
Right.

1371
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:03,860
So think of it this way.

1372
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,560
You got a five dollar bill in your

1373
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,480
pocket to go buy an item that costs

1374
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,040
450.

1375
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:08,740
Yep.

1376
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,680
Right now.

1377
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,120
But this other guy, all he has is

1378
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,680
pennies.

1379
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,060
That's a lot of pennies.

1380
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,380
Comparatively, it's five hundred pennies.

1381
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:17,640
Right.

1382
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,800
So so in order for him to in

1383
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,280
order for the guy who just has pennies

1384
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,100
to sound like he can afford stuff, he

1385
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,820
has to have ten thousand pennies.

1386
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,140
Right.

1387
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:27,860
OK.

1388
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,400
Right.

1389
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,000
To sound like he has something.

1390
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:30,400
Right.

1391
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:34,000
So they're undervaluing the Chinese birth certificate because

1392
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,860
that's the bond.

1393
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,940
But by the way, on the Treasury sites

1394
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,920
of many countries, they say, oh, that's a

1395
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,140
myth.

1396
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,240
But if you go to the DTCC or

1397
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,320
the Trading Commission of each company, they have

1398
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,100
a category for trading birth certificates, which is

1399
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:48,840
a government agency.

1400
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:49,820
It's crazy.

1401
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:50,720
Yeah.

1402
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,100
Well, isn't that the way things usually run?

1403
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,040
Hey, listen, one last thing before we kind

1404
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,620
of finish up this one for today.

1405
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,980
And it's oh, man, where did it go?

1406
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,860
I just had it.

1407
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,060
Let's see.

1408
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,960
Oh, right.

1409
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,240
You talked about cannibalism in the past, OK?

1410
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,380
And somebody brought up this whole thing about

1411
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,520
I'm going to crush this down a little

1412
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,700
bit, but they were watching some commercials and

1413
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,240
they realized that it was kind of being

1414
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,540
normalized in a KFC commercial and all that.

1415
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,440
Anyway, and they were wondering if this is,

1416
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,940
you know, being done to sort of prep

1417
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,960
people for this idea that you talked about

1418
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,620
on a bunch of the old songs.

1419
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,900
Yeah, definitely.

1420
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,000
Yeah.

1421
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,500
Just to kind of get I talked about

1422
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,300
a long time ago.

1423
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,500
They're going to prep you for there's no

1424
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:35,940
gender.

1425
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:36,240
Right.

1426
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,000
Because if there's no gender, you can't be

1427
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,220
considered a man or a woman.

1428
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,000
Now you're it.

1429
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,920
So it's easier to facilitate the prison system

1430
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,540
or whatever else they want to do monetary

1431
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,060
system.

1432
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,600
And that's why they have you using terms

1433
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,240
like female and male, because that's what you

1434
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,540
do when that's property farm animals and property.

1435
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,020
Exactly.

1436
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:51,660
You know what I mean?

1437
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:51,860
Right.

1438
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,320
And then the cannibalism aspect, because, you know,

1439
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,960
I would say pigs eat their own kind

1440
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,360
to have them eat their own kind.

1441
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:58,680
Right.

1442
00:40:59,060 --> 00:40:59,840
Yeah, of course.

1443
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,000
And that's usually what causes the big problem.

1444
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,280
Remember mad cow disease, right?

1445
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,000
That's what they said.

1446
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,120
That was a big problem, right?

1447
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,500
And it's by the way, the MRNA injection.

1448
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,120
No one that works in industry will tell

1449
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,840
you it's a vaccine.

1450
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,940
It's an MRNA, which is a prion form,

1451
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,440
which is mad cow.

1452
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,840
So but thankfully, no humans took the vaccine.

1453
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,300
Yeah, that's what I've been saying.

1454
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,940
Because what would mad human disease be like?

1455
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,960
Oh, you mean actually Tuesday?

1456
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,640
I question your humanity if you actually think

1457
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,960
a vaccine can do anything.

1458
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,100
No problem.

1459
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:32,680
Is that OK?

1460
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,160
That's again against our medical friends.

1461
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,960
You don't want to embarrass these public people,

1462
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,140
but it's gotten to the point where it's

1463
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,380
just a joke all around.

1464
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,700
The premise of a vaccine is that you

1465
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,860
have an immune system, which you do not,

1466
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,460
because everything that explains the immune system is

1467
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,680
the elimination system.

1468
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:56,760
The premise, the overall diagnosis of whoever that

1469
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,280
the heart is a pump and it's not

1470
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:01,060
the premise that you absorb things and you

1471
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,780
don't, you're not a pressurized filter bag or

1472
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,700
go blood pressure.

1473
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,500
So all of their premises are completely false.

1474
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:13,000
And also the mainstream medical is still attached

1475
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,700
to historically Victorian corpse medicine.

1476
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,420
Now, if you look up Victorian corpse medicine,

1477
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,160
they say, oh, they were experimenting on cadavers.

1478
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:21,960
No, no, no.

1479
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,540
Do some research on Victorian corpse corpse medicine

1480
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,360
as medicine.

1481
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,140
They were taking cadavers, dehydrating cadavers.

1482
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:30,580
Right.

1483
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:34,000
And giving it as prescription to people to

1484
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,860
improve their health.

1485
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,300
And they went so far that they wanted

1486
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,080
so many people.

1487
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,940
It was such a mass thing, mass marketed

1488
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:43,820
thing that children found it to be bitter

1489
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,340
and unsavory.

1490
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,580
So they chocolate coated it for the children.

1491
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,600
You can look it up.

1492
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,140
This is this a sick group of people.

1493
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,220
And now they went from being totally sick

1494
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,800
and perverse, which is cannibalism, by the way.

1495
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,160
Yeah.

1496
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,020
I mean, people eat dehydrated corpses, corpse meat

1497
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,000
as medicine.

1498
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,680
It's gotten to the point where now they

1499
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,560
must think that people are so dumb.

1500
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,060
They're telling them the heart is a pump

1501
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:12,160
and you absorb nutrition and you have blood

1502
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,920
pressure and diabetes and all these other things

1503
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,260
that in AIDS or whatever.

1504
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:17,580
Right.

1505
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,980
So, yeah.

1506
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,040
Uh huh.

1507
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,000
Sure.

1508
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,080
Yeah.

1509
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,080
OK, so look, I'm going to hang on

1510
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,480
to a couple of these other things for

1511
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,000
next time, but just one last thing here

1512
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,320
regarding culture, because somebody had a point of

1513
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,500
clarification they wanted, and I saw this repeated

1514
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,220
in a couple of places, but it was

1515
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,360
sort of a general question.

1516
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,660
So I'm going to combine it.

1517
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:43,280
You think it is just worse in the

1518
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,660
West, worse in America?

1519
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,200
Or I mean, when you talk about this

1520
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,320
culture and the way it's going downhill and

1521
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,180
how it's going and everything else, you're talking

1522
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,020
about every part of the surface dwelling culture.

1523
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:54,680
So, yeah.

1524
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:55,960
Well, right.

1525
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:56,820
Yes and no.

1526
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,640
The best way to discern it for years

1527
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,480
I was using is they have Levi's jeans.

1528
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:01,140
Yeah.

1529
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,120
In other words, if you bring up a

1530
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,520
region or geographic area, country, nation.

1531
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,720
OK, did they get their hands on Levi's

1532
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:07,900
yet?

1533
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,560
If they did, yes, they're going down.

1534
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,380
But now I would say past decade, maybe

1535
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:12,800
less.

1536
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,800
It's the smartphone, because I've seen videos where

1537
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:20,040
the people like in Rhodesia living in raffia

1538
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:24,700
huts, right, wearing traditional gowns, floor, you know,

1539
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,360
dirt floor.

1540
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:26,060
Right.

1541
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,360
Sleep and eat on the floor, dirt floor.

1542
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,240
And they're running around with iPhones.

1543
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:32,940
Right.

1544
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:33,520
Right.

1545
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,100
So they're still getting the pictures of water

1546
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,380
that they're carrying on their heads back to

1547
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,020
the whatever.

1548
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,940
Yeah, they're now they got an iPhone.

1549
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:41,500
Yeah.

1550
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:41,840
Yeah.

1551
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,580
And it's not OK for going down for

1552
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,120
who going down for who?

1553
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,140
Well, the the earth is very carefully managed

1554
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,340
as a commercial thing.

1555
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:51,300
Everything is commercial.

1556
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,220
Your religions are commercial.

1557
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,800
Your judicial system is commercial.

1558
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,060
Your medical is commercial.

1559
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,020
So the masters of commerce, I'm not talking

1560
00:44:59,020 --> 00:44:59,960
about wealthy people.

1561
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,000
The people that are directing this commercial whatever

1562
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,660
enterprise is or they're doing it for as

1563
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,060
themselves, as the benefit for their beneficiaries.

1564
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:10,680
Right.

1565
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,260
Right.

1566
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:15,180
And against the grantors and the grantor and

1567
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,120
the settler, they're going to have an issue

1568
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,980
if, you know, if they're not in agreement

1569
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,540
with the grantor and settler of this trust.

1570
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,000
And the trustees are playing to that tune,

1571
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:26,460
you know.

1572
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,340
So, yeah, it's all commercial.

1573
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,300
There's no medical.

1574
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,340
There's no judicial.

1575
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,100
There's no religious.

1576
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,160
It's all commercial.

1577
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,780
All of it's commercial.

1578
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:34,960
This is a commercial thing.

1579
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:36,940
Well, and they point out a couple of

1580
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,860
people pointed out that, look, over time, any

1581
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,640
business that comes out, you know, they like

1582
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,880
to impress you at first and everything is

1583
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,800
good on the first day.

1584
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,820
The deals are best.

1585
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:47,560
You know, the the counters are cleaner.

1586
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:48,580
The floors are cleaner.

1587
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:50,260
The people are nicer on the first day.

1588
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,060
They open anything.

1589
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,460
But as time goes on, what happens?

1590
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,660
The quality declines.

1591
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,500
Well, well, I'm saying the rules of this

1592
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,780
business have always been around.

1593
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,780
You can go back to post flood.

1594
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,940
Most likely we have more of a continuous

1595
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:03,520
history.

1596
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,840
But it was applied as such.

1597
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,100
It was applied to business.

1598
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,860
Not everything was in business.

1599
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,580
Now everything is in business.

1600
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,080
Like years ago, for example, even when I

1601
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,020
was growing up, I mentioned you had medical

1602
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,820
professionals, doctors, whatever.

1603
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,580
They worked out of their homes.

1604
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,140
They came and they did house visits.

1605
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:20,480
Right.

1606
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:25,680
They offered whatever they could, including remedies, personal

1607
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,340
concoctions and things.

1608
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:27,600
Right.

1609
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,060
They made a they made a concerted effort.

1610
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:31,680
Right.

1611
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,120
Where now it's not at all.

1612
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,600
Now it's to find a competent medical person

1613
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,380
or it's even worse in the legal system.

1614
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,460
You had people that were actually lawyers studying

1615
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:43,960
lawyers.

1616
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,320
Now this is the proof of it.

1617
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,520
I'm a Craigslist junkie.

1618
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,640
I just love looking there for entertainment.

1619
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,060
Right.

1620
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,180
And every so often, typically around the holidays,

1621
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,900
that's when the the old people die.

1622
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,760
You'll see free bookcase of lawyers books.

1623
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,080
And when you go over there, like, oh,

1624
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,560
yeah, my dad was 85 and he's been

1625
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,820
a lawyer for 60 years and whatever, whatever.

1626
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:08,480
I'm like, uh-huh.

1627
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,640
First thing I do is I pull the

1628
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,360
book out of the shelf.

1629
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,540
And you know, when a book is like

1630
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,280
60 years old and it's never been open,

1631
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,640
that feeling it's like everything not glued together.

1632
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,700
But there's like this vacuum that holds everything

1633
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,040
together.

1634
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,680
Oh, the pages feel like a solid, singular

1635
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,000
piece of something.

1636
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,220
Yeah, until you open it and you get

1637
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,860
this wild suction sound.

1638
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:25,300
Right.

1639
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,060
And not one page of any of the

1640
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:29,040
I think maybe one or two of the

1641
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,100
books had some notes, but all the other

1642
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,380
law books and statute, none of them ever

1643
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:36,480
been opened ever, ever from the factory.

1644
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,220
The binder was just and this is I've

1645
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,320
seen this once, twice, three, four, five, six,

1646
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,860
seven, eight times over and over because it's

1647
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,540
all a show.

1648
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:46,420
Like when they have someone on CNN or

1649
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,140
Fox or TV or whatever as a lawyer,

1650
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,220
what do they have in the background?

1651
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:53,020
Green screen, all these books, right?

1652
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,120
So it's part of the set.

1653
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:56,620
It's all fakery, man.

1654
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:57,540
Absolutely.

1655
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:00,520
And, you know, just for entertainment purposes, I

1656
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,440
might put one of the I decided to

1657
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,400
enter Ocelli in the Greek sonic event.

1658
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,460
And then a couple of phrases from a

1659
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,980
couple of the things that we did recently

1660
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,520
to see what would happen.

1661
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,520
And you ought to see the ridiculous images

1662
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,920
that I decided to draw.

1663
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,960
Maybe I'll put one of those.

1664
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:14,900
Oh, no, it's fine.

1665
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,800
It's got a strong aftertaste.

1666
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:17,920
Yeah, aftertaste.

1667
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:18,360
Absolutely.

1668
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,740
Spare me that.

1669
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:20,860
Yeah, spare me that.

1670
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:21,700
Fair enough.

1671
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:21,940
Maybe.

1672
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,680
OK, that should be the title of this

1673
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:23,840
one.

1674
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:24,760
Spare me that.

1675
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:25,680
Spare me that.

1676
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,220
Spare me that.

1677
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:27,280
Aftertaste.

1678
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:28,040
No, thanks.

1679
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:28,800
Aftertaste.

1680
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:30,880
Less filling.

1681
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,020
It doesn't taste great.

1682
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:32,580
How about that?

1683
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:33,280
Yeah, that's pretty.

1684
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,020
I'm surprised.

1685
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,400
I should say the morons on this planet

1686
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,100
haven't figured out that it gives a bad

1687
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,660
actress or talk about it enough.

1688
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,420
Oh, my gosh.

1689
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,880
Rodney Dangerfield's dead, man.

1690
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:43,940
Yeah.
