1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,260
Hey, Rated Y, and what are we on,

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,440
193, Greek, how are you doing?

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,960
We're going to hear some noise because you're

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,240
outside, maybe, we'll see.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,040
Yeah, I'm building a deck sort of thing,

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,540
and I'm trying to make use of all

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,080
the daylight.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,720
When you're in a swing of things, you

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,580
don't want to stop.

10
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,280
Yeah, ladies know about that.

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,280
Don't stop now.

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,320
Yeah, kind of thing.

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:27,960
But yeah.

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,220
You know what's funny?

15
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,820
I have a strange question that almost fits

16
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,120
exactly, dovetails perfectly with where you're going right

17
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,320
there.

18
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,800
So let me go there first.

19
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,240
Go for it.

20
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,880
I was going to save this for last,

21
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,800
but I'm going to reverse it because things

22
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,900
change as we're growing.

23
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,940
Somebody asked about emo work, right?

24
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,160
And they asked about masturbation.

25
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,980
Okay, now, you're obviously doing something that's emotional,

26
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,840
and if you're picturing things, you know, in

27
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,840
the old days, not using the Internet, etc.,

28
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,660
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

29
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,420
Does that relate to emo work?

30
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,800
Because does that do something?

31
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,180
Yeah, remember that.

32
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,280
Yeah.

33
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,160
That's what there is.

34
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:04,440
Remember that.

35
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,420
There's an emo there.

36
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,200
What is it?

37
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,800
You know, you could do your own diagnosis.

38
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,360
Is it giving?

39
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,080
Is it taking?

40
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,000
Is that a part of...

41
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,820
Well, it depends on what you're picturing, doesn't

42
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,020
it?

43
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:16,660
I mean...

44
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,380
Is it...

45
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,940
You know how the animals do things from...

46
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:23,120
It's the animalistic nature that wants to procreate,

47
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,080
right?

48
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,040
Is it that?

49
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,160
You know, because...

50
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:26,760
Right.

51
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,820
Wilhelm Reich showed there's a separation between the

52
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,680
emotional release or the mental release of that

53
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,660
versus just the bodily fluids and the procreation

54
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,100
aspect.

55
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:36,700
Right.

56
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,920
Is there a mix there?

57
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,100
I personally, this part of my life, sex

58
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,300
is for having babies.

59
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,940
There's other aspects to it.

60
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,920
You know, you could have a sexual arousal

61
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,600
and all that.

62
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,620
It has nothing to do with wanting to

63
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,280
procreate.

64
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,080
Right?

65
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,520
So it would be that aspect of it.

66
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,140
I don't know.

67
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,560
I haven't really dealt...

68
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,840
I haven't given it a lot...

69
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,320
I haven't done much mind work on it

70
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,560
to see how to direct such a question.

71
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,600
But there is a separation between the mental

72
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,039
health of an individual, let's say, and the

73
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,220
need to procreate, right?

74
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,840
So there's a separation there.

75
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,100
And then how much is the need to

76
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,380
procreate really separated from who we really are,

77
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,520
from the emotional needs?

78
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,440
That needs to be worked out, I think,

79
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,940
more than what William Reich did, because he

80
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,280
used it as a form of therapy.

81
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,940
And of course, I don't know if I

82
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,460
would say the times back then were more

83
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,400
like sexually restrictive or pent up.

84
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,280
I mean, that's the propaganda we get.

85
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,860
If you watch stuff from the 1930s or

86
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,040
whatever, man, are they suggestive, you know?

87
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,220
So I don't think they were that repressed.

88
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,380
I don't think there's much repression.

89
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,500
I think that's propaganda.

90
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,080
And it's more individual.

91
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:44,800
Yeah.

92
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,380
And that's the thing, is that the culture

93
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,480
shifts and propaganda shifts, and the reality is

94
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,180
always a bunch of crap.

95
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,360
Because, you know, they tell you all about,

96
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,780
oh, gee, you know, back we were much

97
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,800
more repressed in the 1800s and this and

98
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:56,960
that.

99
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,520
Meanwhile, if I read very carefully and just

100
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,860
take a look at, like, the history of

101
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,540
the Civil War, what they preserved, I mean,

102
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,920
there's a whole lot of action taking place

103
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,460
where people are trying to tamp down all

104
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,560
sorts of STDs.

105
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,540
People are getting the clap left and right.

106
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,380
They're having issues because of the prostitution.

107
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,660
There's huge prostitution rings.

108
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,140
Whole cities were taken over by prostitution rings

109
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,240
during the Civil War.

110
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,560
Yeah, yeah.

111
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,320
Well, yeah.

112
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,960
Of course, mining towns and, you know, game

113
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,360
towns.

114
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,240
But it's not, you know, look, if the

115
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,900
prostitutes, it's like saying they got food poisoning

116
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,000
because they ate at restaurants.

117
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,640
But I'm not making a judgment here.

118
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,420
I'm just saying, just think about this, because

119
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,100
this is part of the propaganda, not that

120
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,180
you're putting it out, but it is laden

121
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:44,540
with it.

122
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,600
Like, well, they had STDs because of all

123
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,160
the prostitutes.

124
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,780
No, that's like saying they got food poisoning

125
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,560
because they ate at restaurants.

126
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,160
You get it?

127
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,080
It's the same exact thing.

128
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,400
So in other words, the reason why you

129
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,260
get food poisoning in restaurants is because of

130
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,400
how the restaurants manage themselves hygienically.

131
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,520
The reason there was STDs because of prostitutes

132
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:06,220
is because they're dirty hoes versus clean hoes.

133
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,000
No, I get it.

134
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,200
Right.

135
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,860
I was just pointing out what I found

136
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,800
in the documents, what they were saying.

137
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,820
The Department of the Army was saying this.

138
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:13,320
The whole thing.

139
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,140
Yeah.

140
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,880
That has to be rethought.

141
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,180
And I've never really given enough perspective from,

142
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,380
let's say, what can be said about the

143
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,820
entire sexuality thing.

144
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,760
I've just lately just put a cap on

145
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,360
it and say, hey, if you're not interested

146
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,060
in having babies, get away from it.

147
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,160
It's not necessary.

148
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,600
But there is the arousal part.

149
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,920
There is all these other things.

150
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,060
Yeah, that has to be considered.

151
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,280
Because we live in a society that promotes

152
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,960
sex, which means the birth rate will go

153
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,280
down.

154
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,260
And it is, right?

155
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,000
But that's the thing.

156
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,060
It is a serious consideration in emo, though,

157
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,900
because there is a strong proclivity toward this.

158
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,740
I mean, I know that nowadays there are

159
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,680
people that claim to be asexual and this

160
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,540
and that and blah, blah, blah.

161
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,980
But the thing is, it is a key

162
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,260
component to somebody's emotional structure, I think.

163
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,800
Well, the ones that are like that are

164
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,380
the ones like protect the children.

165
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,700
And it turns out they're the ones that

166
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,640
are actually molesting the children.

167
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,940
If it's put out in the mainstream, it's

168
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,440
the opposite.

169
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,840
The moment I see somebody screaming about, you

170
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,720
know, pedophiles over and over and over again,

171
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,240
it's like either they're the ones that are.

172
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,440
Yeah.

173
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:17,740
Yeah.

174
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,600
Either they're a victim.

175
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,480
Right.

176
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,160
Right.

177
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:20,620
Exactly.

178
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,360
That kind of thing.

179
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,800
So, you know, they say, well, I'll just

180
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,840
throw something in there.

181
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,480
I don't even know if it's online anymore.

182
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,280
Oh, the Vatican molested a child or whatever.

183
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,920
It was a boy was 15 or 16

184
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,720
or 14.

185
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,140
You know what?

186
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,200
The age of consent that the Vatican is.

187
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,780
I think it's twelve.

188
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:38,300
Thirteen.

189
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,580
Okay.

190
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,340
I was thinking thirteen.

191
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,360
But twelve or thirteen.

192
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:40,640
Yeah.

193
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:41,380
Yeah.

194
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,760
So, you know, these things are propaganda.

195
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,560
There's by the way, I discovered a YouTube

196
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,800
channel looking at it.

197
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,260
I don't really fully endorse him, but he's

198
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:48,780
a good listen.

199
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,240
If you're familiar with stuff I've spoken of,

200
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,060
it's called Middle Nation Shaheed something.

201
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:54,560
OK.

202
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,280
Used to be a professor or something.

203
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,140
And he talks about Middle East and how

204
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,940
the world is abandoning the West and all

205
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,220
that stuff.

206
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,780
I talked about 15, 20 years ago, how

207
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,800
it's coming into fruition.

208
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,280
I mean, he's new on this and he

209
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,720
can make some very valid points from a

210
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,820
good, fresh perspective against the propaganda.

211
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,760
So because it's not right or left.

212
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,900
And he is correct about, look, you want

213
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,780
to clean up a society, make them Islamic.

214
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,760
I didn't say they should be, you know,

215
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,540
clean them up because religion goes into every

216
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,140
aspect of your life if you take it

217
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,560
seriously.

218
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,320
Now, recommending someone to become Christian is just

219
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:33,760
ridiculous.

220
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,600
That's just like everybody go get a lobotomy

221
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,080
and get on that.

222
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,600
So my stuff, you know, whatever.

223
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,760
No, that's just that should be like never

224
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,980
even considered or done.

225
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,560
Now, if you say from a social perspective,

226
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,960
convert people to Judaism because they have laws

227
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,740
and rules and all that.

228
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:49,980
No one face it.

229
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,420
No one wants to be a Jew in

230
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:51,800
this world.

231
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,460
Still, you frown down or whatever.

232
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,100
Now, the propaganda shows that, by the way,

233
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,760
most people think I'm Jewish because I say

234
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,340
I'm an Old Testament guy, including most of

235
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,560
the Greek people that I meet.

236
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,060
They equate it all the time because of

237
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,080
your mentions of the Old Testament.

238
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,440
They say, oh, you must be, you know,

239
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,500
a pseudo Jewish.

240
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,840
And yeah, he thinks that a lot of

241
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,360
these Greeks I've spoken to, which is like

242
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,420
two or three, say that I'm a Jew

243
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,440
that just happens to know some Greek that

244
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,040
calls themselves the Greek to hide it.

245
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,440
And it's the opposite.

246
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,300
Right.

247
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,620
Right.

248
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,740
I'm not hiding that.

249
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,000
You know, I'm not Jewish.

250
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,740
I don't have to hide.

251
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,200
Anyway.

252
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,240
So beware of Greeks bearing gifts and beware

253
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,320
of Greeks bearing comments.

254
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,300
But anyway, beware of anybody.

255
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,760
If you go Islamic, you have the rules

256
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,740
and you have a certain composure where there's

257
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,000
a priority on your behavior.

258
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,640
Actually, it's very misunderstood, you know, and it's

259
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,580
actually not bad.

260
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,880
It's very submissive.

261
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,800
You know, the word Muslim means a submissive

262
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,500
right to be a submissive, submissive.

263
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,780
So that is a good thing for a

264
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,740
temporary fix.

265
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,400
I don't know how you could put a

266
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:02,860
religion.

267
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,740
Has it ever been done?

268
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,200
Put a temporary religion on people.

269
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,400
You got to do this for 10 years

270
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,280
or 20 years to fix your society.

271
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:08,800
I don't know.

272
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:09,620
Probably.

273
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:09,960
Yeah.

274
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,200
It seems like people personally do that a

275
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,340
lot of times, you know, they go through

276
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,640
a time period where they're kind of hell

277
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,660
raisers and then they find, you know, religion

278
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,000
for a little while, they always say.

279
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,040
And and then after a while, everything sort

280
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,420
of levels out again.

281
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,700
And it's not all about the religion and

282
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,380
AA and everything else, whatever.

283
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,540
I've watched people go through that cycle.

284
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,380
Interesting.

285
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,880
I looked at this Middle Nation channel.

286
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,720
You're talking about the guy who looks like

287
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,360
I hate to put it this way, but

288
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,919
I hear I think of it as part

289
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,380
of black YouTube at this point.

290
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,679
He looks.

291
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,240
No, no.

292
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:44,540
He looks like the architect in the Matrix.

293
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,240
Yes.

294
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,480
That's the guy there.

295
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,620
But he uses the symbology here of like

296
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,280
with the the black, the black, the red

297
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,760
and the green and white all together.

298
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,360
I'm not familiar with that.

299
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,260
That's a that's a West Asian, African, what

300
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,660
do you call Southern world colors?

301
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:02,680
Yeah.

302
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,820
But anyway, I just want to throw it

303
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,220
out there, because a lot of the stuff

304
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,180
is stuff that I spoke about a long

305
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,060
time ago and he fills it in with

306
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,980
current affairs.

307
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,720
Look, I'm not endorsing being Muslim, but but

308
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,220
I'm not endorsing being any religion.

309
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,120
But his point of fixing and cleaning up

310
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,560
like, you know, you don't get him.

311
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,660
You don't get impoverished becoming Muslim, actually, because

312
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,660
it's a form of communism in a way.

313
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:27,400
Right.

314
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,660
The no interest in this.

315
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,080
That right.

316
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:29,820
OK.

317
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,860
Well, shouldn't you say that?

318
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,440
That's not true.

319
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,260
It's not a form of communism.

320
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,040
I was going to.

321
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,760
If you turn Christian, you're going to be

322
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,740
impoverished because the Christian religion is a rich

323
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,320
man's religion.

324
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,960
I was the rich people funded because the

325
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,520
main point is you can do anything.

326
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,820
All laws are done away with.

327
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,720
And guess who you get?

328
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,660
Where are you going to get your laws

329
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,020
automatically from the rich people at the state?

330
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,820
Also, it tells people, don't worry about acquiring

331
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,560
wealth here because your wealth is somewhere else

332
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,340
up in the sky.

333
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,620
Right.

334
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,100
Right.

335
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,260
So it's perfect.

336
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:58,360
So it's perfect.

337
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,400
So they don't have to invest in control

338
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:00,900
apparatus.

339
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,580
The Christianity is so that the minimum investment

340
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,920
in the protection apparatus for the elite minimum.

341
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:10,480
Right.

342
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,180
So and it's the most hypocritical, totally hypocritical,

343
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:14,920
hypocrisy.

344
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,540
So when the elites say the absolute something

345
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,300
is absolute in the next day, change it.

346
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,060
They're not called them hypocrisy because the people's

347
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,040
religion is based on it.

348
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,640
So anyway, if you want to degrade and

349
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,840
demoralize the people, it's Christian.

350
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,160
Right.

351
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,440
Well, look, what did they do to the

352
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,840
native cultures in the state?

353
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,080
Right.

354
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:31,820
Right away.

355
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,280
Make them Christian so we can get rid

356
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:33,660
of them.

357
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,040
Right.

358
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,180
Very interesting.

359
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,180
Because you get rid of you basically wind

360
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,900
up surrendering all possessions because your real possessions

361
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,480
aren't here.

362
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,400
They're in the next life.

363
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,400
So don't worry about this.

364
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,720
Well, the main thing is that there is

365
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,360
no law.

366
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,420
There's no law.

367
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,020
But, you know, you have to have some

368
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,400
order.

369
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,580
And because the law has been done away

370
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,900
with subconsciously, they put in the state's laws,

371
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,800
which is all commercial.

372
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:56,820
Anyway.

373
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,360
And, of course, you've got to do what's

374
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,620
Christianity without Sunday.

375
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,640
You know, there's the Seventh-day Adventist and

376
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,620
all that for Saturday, but it makes you

377
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,880
a strict adherent to the Pope's work schedule.

378
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:07,900
Oh, yeah.

379
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:08,360
Yeah.

380
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,000
It's terrible.

381
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,420
Well, here in the South, not necessarily because

382
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,020
you're going to church all different days here

383
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,540
in the South.

384
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,480
I mean, you got church Wednesday, Thursday, every

385
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,880
day, all the time, you know.

386
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:19,420
Yeah.

387
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:19,820
Yeah.

388
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,160
But that's that's because, again, the hypocrisy.

389
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,760
You know, you got to it's about people

390
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,620
have a lot of energy.

391
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,300
And if you don't give them something to

392
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,920
do, they're going to do what they they

393
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,120
might actually educate themselves.

394
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,640
So what else you got?

395
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,180
There you go.

396
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:33,440
OK.

397
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,480
So somebody did.

398
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,620
Here's a random thing.

399
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,100
If they asked, have you checked out any

400
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,820
of the Zen cooking books from the Oshawa

401
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,480
Foundation?

402
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,440
I don't know what that is.

403
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,900
Do you?

404
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,020
Never heard.

405
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,480
I've heard of Zen and that is actually

406
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,400
a pretty good mindset, but not the not

407
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,400
one that gets advanced in for Western cultures,

408
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,300
which it is more of a Western thing.

409
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,000
But no, I haven't checked out those cookbooks.

410
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:57,420
OK.

411
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,360
The main thing about food is think about

412
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,040
it as a car.

413
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,920
If I put this fuel in the car,

414
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,340
is it going to gunk up my engine?

415
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,120
Is it going to give me the power

416
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,240
that I need?

417
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,680
Is the engine going to run rough?

418
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,720
Is the engine going to run smooth?

419
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:13,540
Right.

420
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,920
Is it contaminated?

421
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,700
You know, water and fuel is a contaminant.

422
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:17,920
Right.

423
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,720
So think of it, not that you're burning

424
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,220
anything.

425
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,780
People think of food on the daily, even

426
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,160
on a park daily, like, well, this is

427
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,080
what I have for breakfast, what I have

428
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,980
for lunch, what I have for dinner.

429
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,660
And that's it.

430
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,780
But, you know, what you ate yesterday for

431
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,140
lunch is still mixing what you're eating today

432
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,680
for lunch.

433
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,020
Right.

434
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:36,480
Right.

435
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,440
In some capacity, energetically.

436
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,020
The main thing.

437
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,900
Let me just make a little interjection here.

438
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,280
Total segue into something.

439
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,000
Laundry.

440
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,840
I've been a laundry buff my whole life.

441
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,540
And if anybody here, especially guys, well, women

442
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,920
also, if you notice that your clothes, even

443
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,300
though they're clean and dry, you put them

444
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,620
in the closet, you think they're fresh and

445
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,800
you get this sense of B.O. and

446
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,380
you use more soap and the B.O.

447
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,220
is still there and all that.

448
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,340
I've done some experiments because I've been playing

449
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,420
around with soaps and this experiment lasted about

450
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:05,900
two years.

451
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,540
And there's something about biodynamic emergence where things

452
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:11,940
emerge.

453
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,780
Now, they say they find bacteria that cause

454
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,220
these odors.

455
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,780
So the body odor, which is the bacteria

456
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,480
are found, but they're now come from somewhere

457
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:19,660
else.

458
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,140
They emerge from the chemistry and the energy.

459
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,640
So when you use a particular soap and

460
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,880
you like it for a long time, the

461
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,920
chemical constituents in that formula is going to

462
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,120
breed a particular bacteria that's going to give

463
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,060
off a certain smell.

464
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,460
So the way you fix that is by

465
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,500
changing soap simply like, for example, give an

466
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:38,800
example.

467
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,680
I have like some dress shirts that they're

468
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,460
casual shirts, you know, button up and all

469
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,500
that long sleeve, you know, and no matter

470
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,300
how much I washed them, they had B

471
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,600
.O. And I said, OK, this is an

472
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,100
emergent.

473
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,380
In other words, something is starting to grow

474
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,960
here that it gives me an unpleasant smell.

475
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,480
It's, you know, it's just like it's supposed

476
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,900
to smell fresh and it doesn't smell like

477
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,680
body odor even after doing a triple wash

478
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,660
on it with extra soap and rinses and

479
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,540
all this other stuff.

480
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,580
Immediately, as soon as I switched to soap,

481
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,120
I went from powder to a liquid or

482
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,560
a different powder or whatever.

483
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,380
The B.O. in the mildest clean went

484
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,260
away and it's gone and it probably be

485
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,700
gone for a few months to a year.

486
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,900
Then it will return if you continue using

487
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,660
the same soap.

488
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,620
So my advice to fresh smelling laundry is

489
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,300
it's not one of those things, you know,

490
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,420
like a cigarette brand.

491
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,180
You know, I've been smoking camels for 40

492
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:31,460
years.

493
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,420
It's the only one I like.

494
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,520
OK, laundry, you know, or I drink just

495
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,200
Pepsi or Coca-Cola because that's what I

496
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:37,400
like.

497
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,960
I'm a, you know, I'm a Miller guy,

498
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,980
you know, my whole life.

499
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,120
No, no, no, no, no.

500
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,820
That doesn't work with laundry soap.

501
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,860
You must change laundry soap brands now.

502
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:47,940
It's important.

503
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm saying brands because each brand has its

504
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,380
own distinct formula that even though they seem

505
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,000
the same, they're slightly enough different that each

506
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,400
one will emerge a different type of condition

507
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,920
where you will have a body odor in

508
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,200
the clothes that does not go away.

509
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,520
And I am so happy.

510
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,840
I am so happy because I got to

511
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,620
the point where all the clothes were clean

512
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,260
in the closet and I have a pretty

513
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,400
good ozone machine and I kept ozonating and

514
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,120
it just made it worse.

515
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,640
I was like, what am I going to

516
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,080
do here?

517
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,560
You know, I don't know what I ever

518
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:16,740
said.

519
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,240
Hey, your clothes is B.O. I smell

520
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,400
it.

521
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:18,960
That's enough.

522
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,300
Right.

523
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,860
So and I just want to share this

524
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,160
with people, because if you do notice a

525
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,280
closet of someone or yourself, the clothes are

526
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,480
all fresh and clean, but you still have

527
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,320
this body odor.

528
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,660
Just change your soap.

529
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,260
I think every three to six months, go

530
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,160
to a different soap and that will go

531
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,880
away immediately.

532
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,820
That's why this is a big achievement.

533
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,480
I mean, it doesn't take much to make

534
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,100
me happy.

535
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,280
So this made me very happy.

536
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,140
Oh, fair enough.

537
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,920
Look, sometimes the smallest things.

538
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,200
Right.

539
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,580
Oh, my gosh.

540
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:46,860
Yeah.

541
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,480
Anyway.

542
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:47,860
Yeah.

543
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,080
So.

544
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,600
All right.

545
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,060
I did the thing about the cookbooks.

546
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,220
Home clean.

547
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:51,560
OK.

548
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,380
Home cleansing.

549
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,640
The idea, you know, people that burn sage

550
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,320
and, you know, do prayers and this and

551
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,560
that.

552
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,240
Well, they're not.

553
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:58,900
That works.

554
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,640
All that works.

555
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,000
But.

556
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:00,600
OK.

557
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,840
It's just like the laundry soap.

558
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,720
When you do something, you ever go to

559
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,880
an old person's house, has that old person

560
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,340
smell.

561
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,560
Right.

562
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,160
Guess what?

563
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,700
Because they're always doing the same exact thing.

564
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,260
They set the clock.

565
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,440
They have to eat the same food at

566
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,620
the same time.

567
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,560
Right.

568
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,300
And they do all the same stuff.

569
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,460
And that from that condition emerges the stale

570
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,620
whatever.

571
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,580
And the things that are happy in that

572
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,800
stale custom environment will stay there.

573
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,620
So when you burn sage, it's like the

574
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,040
laundry thing.

575
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,820
You just change the entire condition and whatever

576
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,280
made itself at home now has to leave.

577
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,500
Right.

578
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,060
Now, you might say a logical mind might

579
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,860
say, well, now you're inviting the entities that

580
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,540
bring the sage.

581
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,180
Yeah.

582
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:45,700
That, too.

583
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,080
But at least you're not in stagnation.

584
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,100
It's really to stop stagnation, stop mental, spiritual,

585
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:51,640
physical.

586
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,520
Well, they were spiritual stagnation is bad also.

587
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,020
Of course.

588
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,300
And they were asking a couple of things

589
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,060
like, is there a particular time of day

590
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,360
that's best to do this?

591
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,840
Well, think of it this way.

592
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,940
The time of day when you ask that

593
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,780
question, it's a loaded question because the day

594
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,760
ends at noon.

595
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,560
Mm hmm.

596
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,099
All right.

597
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:08,680
Right.

598
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,220
So time of day is do you want

599
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,280
to do it at the end of the

600
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,599
day, at the beginning of the day?

601
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,300
Well, if you want to do it at

602
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,300
the end of the day, you do it

603
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,819
right before noon.

604
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,520
You can start.

605
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:19,839
You want to do it at the beginning

606
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,619
of the next day.

607
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,040
You do it just right after noon.

608
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,020
Well, I was just going to say you

609
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,920
could do both and cover it because it

610
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,839
could take you, you know, say 10 minutes

611
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,020
if you start at five minutes.

612
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:28,920
And you covered both.

613
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:29,200
Yeah.

614
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,400
Yeah.

615
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,100
Then you cover both.

616
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,500
Would that not be a good way to

617
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:31,720
go?

618
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,440
Or that would be the best way to

619
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,300
go because you've covered two days in one

620
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,560
shot in 15 minutes.

621
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,440
So you actually it would be an hour.

622
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,140
It'd be the first hour, last hour.

623
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,560
Yeah, I would do it.

624
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,840
I would do it around then or at

625
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,940
night when it's dark out late because that's

626
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,640
when the ether is the most compressed and

627
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,840
you're going to get more bang for your

628
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,120
buck.

629
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,620
Well, see, that was the thing I was

630
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,120
going to ask you about, too, is that,

631
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,840
you know, would it be better to do

632
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,160
it then?

633
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,600
Because this is when spiritually things are more

634
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:58,940
quiet.

635
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,360
I hear you.

636
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,260
It's all right.

637
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:00,860
Oh, yeah.

638
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,640
Let me let me move around here.

639
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,100
No problem.

640
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,120
We have someone that's got dogs that doesn't

641
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,300
know how to take care of dogs.

642
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,920
They don't know that dogs have different voices

643
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,240
for different communications.

644
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,940
So you get the most bang for your

645
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,880
buck a little before noon and into a

646
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,760
little bit afternoon because that's covers two days

647
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,740
and also at nighttime, late at night when

648
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,340
the ether is the most compressed.

649
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,160
Well, see, like, you know, for most compressed,

650
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,260
but also we talked before about there's sort

651
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,280
of less traffic because there's less, you know,

652
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,060
going on.

653
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,080
So people are more.

654
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:34,400
Yeah.

655
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,520
The airwaves are cleaner.

656
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,180
Yeah.

657
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,440
So that would that would be another time.

658
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,500
But what do you think?

659
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,360
Later noon.

660
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:40,600
Yeah.

661
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,280
Later noon.

662
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:41,560
Yeah.

663
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,260
Late at night.

664
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,580
And late at night would be midnight.

665
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,600
Ten, eleven, twelve.

666
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,420
One, two.

667
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,240
OK.

668
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,060
Anywhere between there.

669
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,780
And some people, if you work in a

670
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,600
live in a community that people get up

671
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,180
early to work, they might wake them up

672
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,300
in the middle of night, call, you know,

673
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,620
like, what the hell is burning, you know?

674
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,660
So you have to adjust it for where

675
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,200
you live.

676
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,600
And also, you're not I'm not at home

677
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,360
at noon because I got a job or

678
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,400
you're either way.

679
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,120
Yeah.

680
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,200
So, yeah, that's what I.

681
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,240
Oh, by the way, there's research that's been

682
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,420
done.

683
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,260
I have to dig it up.

684
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,340
But when the spirit leaves the body, it

685
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,180
takes longer to leave at night, right, because

686
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:20,720
it's denser.

687
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,580
Everything's compressed.

688
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,100
Right.

689
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,920
Then someone who dies in the morning or

690
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,120
around noon where it would just fly out,

691
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,460
right, because everything's expanded.

692
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,220
More suction in the atmosphere.

693
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:29,580
Yeah.

694
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,360
I know ether.

695
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,380
It covers physical and spiritual, you know, mental

696
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,140
and physical.

697
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:34,540
Right.

698
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,400
Like I noted, quite honestly, that in the

699
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,880
single numbered hours of daylight, right in the

700
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,140
early morning is when I would know most

701
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,660
of the time this is when people died

702
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,180
of old age and things.

703
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,080
Well, regardless of when you die, this the

704
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,660
the the spirit leaving the body, like if

705
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,500
you study, like, for example, this is a

706
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,200
hypothecation and ease.

707
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,560
The people that had most more detail are

708
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,280
the ones that died when it was nighttime

709
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,120
because they hovered over the operating table or

710
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,300
wherever, saw themselves and the ones that had

711
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,420
less to say, because they really flew away

712
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,580
and had stories where they were a way

713
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:10,960
away.

714
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,260
It was more when they died during the

715
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:13,600
day.

716
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,920
OK, very simple.

717
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,820
This is all simple.

718
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,980
Universal principles apply to everything the same.

719
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,900
So when something is expanded, what are the

720
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,140
qualities of something expanded, what a rarefied right?

721
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:28,560
Thinner.

722
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,280
What are the qualities of something compressed and

723
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,460
condensed, denser?

724
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,200
It doesn't matter if it's physical, mental, spiritual.

725
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,240
The same thing goes with thought, spirit, everything.

726
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,380
Universal principle is just that universal principle would

727
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,540
be someone who is a technical software and

728
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,040
hardware guy for video.

729
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,420
He knows everything about the program, the digital

730
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:54,660
video, including how it's going to manifest on

731
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,200
the screen for people to view.

732
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,560
It knows everything about that.

733
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,880
That's how he knows how the machine works

734
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,560
and the code.

735
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,840
And he knows how it's actually translated into

736
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,220
an image.

737
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:04,420
That's right.

738
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:04,960
That guy.

739
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,460
That's what universal principle.

740
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,200
That guy's the most people I know.

741
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,860
I just do software or hardware, you know,

742
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,580
some hardware.

743
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,140
Right.

744
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,440
And the guy who does hardware doesn't know

745
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:12,700
software.

746
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,120
See that?

747
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,880
That's the slave stuff.

748
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,220
Right.

749
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:15,540
So.

750
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:15,980
Right.

751
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,480
That's that's how you keep it compartmentalized like

752
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,660
they do in intelligence work.

753
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,000
OK.

754
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,800
So with that, you know, it's kind of

755
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,020
funny.

756
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,180
I have one other question, but just one

757
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:27,720
weird thing.

758
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,400
Yin and yang.

759
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:28,780
Right.

760
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,560
Is there a particular like to apply that

761
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,180
to the time of day?

762
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,000
Well, how about that?

763
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,420
Expansive and contractive.

764
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:35,880
Yeah.

765
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,180
So during the day, it's expanded at night.

766
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,500
It's contracted.

767
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,700
So nighttime is young and daytime is that's

768
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,220
I mean, I'm just pointing it out is

769
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,880
that I'm just right.

770
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,600
I mean, because we were going to give

771
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,220
it to you and it's lean because the

772
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,400
sun is very young.

773
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,980
So it creates a yin effect.

774
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:54,480
Right.

775
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,260
Just like, for example, fire is very young.

776
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,260
But when you heat something, it expands, which

777
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,220
is yin.

778
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,520
Right.

779
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,380
And it becomes something that's becoming right.

780
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,720
And because it has heat in it, but

781
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,440
it's more young, even though it's a balance.

782
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,100
So when you put fire, which is young

783
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,740
on a piece of metal and it expands,

784
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,880
that's a yin reaction.

785
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,180
But the metal takes on that heat, which

786
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,960
makes it more young than it was before.

787
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,740
But it's also more yin because it expanded

788
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,140
state of balance.

789
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,740
And that's when you work with metal.

790
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,960
That's why, for example, people that cut copper

791
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,780
all day and plumbing or whatever, I said,

792
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,880
you know, if you have that copper at

793
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,140
86 degrees, it'll cut so much better.

794
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,720
They're like, oh, come on, it's 78 in

795
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,480
here, 86 degrees to make that much of

796
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:39,920
a difference.

797
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,880
I'm like, yeah, try it.

798
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,380
They're like, oh, my gosh, that's a big

799
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:43,780
difference.

800
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,080
Right.

801
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,720
Because everything has this little sweet spot.

802
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,400
That's true.

803
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:46,840
Right.

804
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,460
That's true.

805
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:47,720
So.

806
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,280
OK, so I have one more universal question,

807
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,560
but you had something else that you wanted

808
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,240
to bring up outside of the laundry or

809
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,440
just the laundry.

810
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,540
That's a major thing.

811
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,820
I mean, that thing is like if you

812
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,420
ask me, what's the most exciting thing I've

813
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,220
discovered in the last six months, it's that.

814
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:05,160
Well, another thing, though, just about the laundry,

815
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,900
quick question is I had this problem and

816
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,000
I threw a bunch of different things at

817
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,320
it and I'm not even sure what finally

818
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:12,920
solved it.

819
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,680
But the machine had a smell that I

820
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,040
couldn't get rid of that was putting it

821
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,200
on all the clothes for a while.

822
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,580
And it wasn't B.O. It was something

823
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:20,940
else.

824
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,660
And I don't even know.

825
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,980
The machine itself is not self-cleaning.

826
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,060
They get very dirty.

827
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,320
machine that you have changing the bearing where

828
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,280
you have to remove the drum and disassemble

829
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,360
all the wet workers and see how scummy

830
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,040
and shitty it is.

831
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,340
I have made a small high pressure nozzle

832
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,880
hose, quarter inch hose that goes between the

833
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,920
inner and outer drum.

834
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,220
And I spray just toilet bowl cleaner.

835
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,340
You don't want to use acid.

836
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,380
It's a strong acid, but you do it

837
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:47,800
quickly.

838
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,460
If people that put vinegar in their in

839
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,600
their wash, that's OK.

840
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,940
But if you do it often, all the

841
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,580
rubber hoses and seals will disintegrate very quickly.

842
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,800
I discovered this a long time ago when

843
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,900
I used vinegar and a pressure spray bottle

844
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,280
was pump spray bottles and it dissolved the

845
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,180
diaphragm in three days, turned it into black

846
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:05,560
powder.

847
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,200
Oh, crap.

848
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,140
So good.

849
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,320
The washing machine people don't tell you that

850
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,000
because it's a three to five hundred dollar

851
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,740
service call.

852
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,860
They like doing it.

853
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,140
It's an easy job for them to change

854
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,500
the drain hose, the internal one.

855
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,360
But yeah, you have to clean the washing

856
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:20,520
machine.

857
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,540
I use steam.

858
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,440
I have a very hot water and a

859
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,420
very fine nozzle that goes through the tiny

860
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,600
little holes in the drum front loader, top

861
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,160
loader.

862
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,360
Top loaders always work better because of gravity.

863
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:32,560
You think.

864
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:32,840
Yeah.

865
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,300
So I'm very I'm disgusted at washing machines

866
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,980
because when I grew up, washing machines were

867
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,780
30, 40 years old, still working now every

868
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,380
five years.

869
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,120
You've got to get one.

870
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,500
It doesn't matter if you spend five hundred

871
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,820
bucks on one or two thousand.

872
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,300
Yeah.

873
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,140
Yeah.

874
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,760
And that's the consensus.

875
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,080
Someone would say, oh, I have mine for

876
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,500
10 years.

877
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,400
Well, that's a rarity.

878
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:51,760
Right.

879
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,260
Yeah.

880
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:52,760
At this point.

881
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,100
Right.

882
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,300
It's like someone saying they're married for 20

883
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:55,680
years.

884
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,240
You know, it's a rarity.

885
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:57,600
Right.

886
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,620
You look back at grandma.

887
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,700
Grandma had her, you know, her knives for

888
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,800
for 40 years.

889
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,460
No problem.

890
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,400
That's different.

891
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,320
The reason why.

892
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,700
Well, knives could last a thousand years.

893
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,440
But what I mean is the washing machines,

894
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,080
they've decided to really work with the big

895
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,980
department stores.

896
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,500
Yeah.

897
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,340
So it's a it's a it's a long

898
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,700
story, but it's pretty easy to figure out

899
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,880
once you do a little research.

900
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,880
It's another story of planned obsolescence.

901
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,120
Right.

902
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,100
I mean, like you and I.

903
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:21,460
Yeah.

904
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,300
It's definitely planned obsolescence, like the printer that

905
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,160
stops working because you made too many copies.

906
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:25,500
Yeah.

907
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,040
Like you and I.

908
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,680
It's an electronic command of the iPhone that

909
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,080
I'm using.

910
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:28,780
Yeah.

911
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,440
Like you and I talked about the iPhone

912
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,160
just before we started recording and it was

913
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,500
like your iPhone's not working now too well.

914
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,320
So yeah.

915
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,840
Anything other than the telephone will not give

916
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,940
me it will not give me a tone

917
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,500
no matter what.

918
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,940
And if you go to adjust the tone

919
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,080
setting, the button is disabled like it has

920
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,780
no effect.

921
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,000
They're pretty shitty company.

922
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,880
I mean, pretty bad.

923
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,860
They're all pretty shitty.

924
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,620
They're all, you know, there is no Apple

925
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,700
or Android or Microsoft or whatever.

926
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,440
Samsung.

927
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,160
They're all the powers behind.

928
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,560
Once you have a business that goes over

929
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,740
one hundred and fifty million dollars a year,

930
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,700
you've surrendered it to the the oligarchy.

931
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,240
They take control of it.

932
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,160
Complete control.

933
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,220
I heard from someone who's been in business

934
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,440
for a while now, it's as little as

935
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,700
five to ten million a year.

936
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,580
You make sure that they got a pretty

937
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,140
good sense of what you're doing.

938
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,680
I'm talking about full control of the company.

939
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,400
Wow.

940
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,460
So so, you know, everyone's on board.

941
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:23,720
Right.

942
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,720
So so I've only got one more piece

943
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,380
of feedback input question here, and it's kind

944
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,020
of a weird one.

945
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,580
But they were listening to some of the

946
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,440
early ones and you talking about, you know,

947
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,160
I'm just here taking notes and this kind

948
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:37,560
of thing.

949
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,240
And we talked in early on about what

950
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,740
would you do if an alien showed up

951
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,520
or this or that?

952
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,880
And they didn't get an answer in this

953
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,640
in this listening to that about, OK, what

954
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,480
would you say if someone did literally show

955
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,760
up and they just happened to drop in

956
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,960
front of you particularly?

957
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,820
They want to know.

958
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,240
And they said, look, we just discovered this

959
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,860
place and we want to take notes.

960
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,740
We want to observe what's going on here.

961
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,320
Where would you send them?

962
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,460
What would you tell them?

963
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,000
This is the question they have.

964
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,540
Well, can you hear me?

965
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,180
Yeah, I can hear you because there you

966
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,320
go.

967
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,760
OK, I just lost the head for a

968
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:16,960
moment.

969
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,700
Sorry, you're good.

970
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,900
You have to rephrase.

971
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,940
Just paraphrase it.

972
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,280
So if someone showed up and like I

973
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,560
said, as a rescue mission to get the

974
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,140
Greek out here, I mean, no, if somebody

975
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,860
showed up and all they said is, look,

976
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,580
we just discovered this place exists.

977
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,300
Oh, you mean a real I mean, someone

978
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,220
who actually saw the advertisement I put out

979
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,680
and answered it and we just found this

980
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:37,880
place.

981
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:38,800
What do you want to tell us?

982
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,300
Well, what do you want to tell us?

983
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,240
And also, where should we go and what

984
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,900
should we see to take no place?

985
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,040
So where'd you come from?

986
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,220
Wherever you came from, go back and leave.

987
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:47,840
You know, it's easy.

988
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,920
I said that before.

989
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,400
There's a billboard on the back of the

990
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,700
moon.

991
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,140
This is your last chance.

992
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,980
If you pass this, if you see if

993
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,140
you can read this, you'll probably be visible

994
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,540
by surface-toiling earth inhabitants, which are morons

995
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,440
with very little exception.

996
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,200
So our recommendation of the council, Intergalactic Council

997
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,140
or whatever, as we found through many years

998
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,360
of experience with these idiots, that the best

999
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,760
thing is to turn back and do not

1000
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,780
engage in anything.

1001
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,620
If you do engage anything, you say we'll

1002
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,360
confuse them.

1003
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,640
So you can enter at your own risk.

1004
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:23,620
Yeah.

1005
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,760
They have a very toxic environment.

1006
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,000
Kind of like they don't.

1007
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,260
Yeah.

1008
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
So kind of like a warning beacon they

1009
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,920
put out in Star Trek, right, where they

1010
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,260
go, OK, we don't want anybody to go

1011
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,780
near this planet or the system.

1012
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,100
We're going to put out a beacon here

1013
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,560
that says this place is dangerous.

1014
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,720
Don't go.

1015
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,160
Yeah, there wouldn't be much.

1016
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,540
The first thing is leave.

1017
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,600
There's nothing to learn here.

1018
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,980
And you want me to prove that?

1019
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,500
Look at the ask the inhabitants what they've

1020
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,480
learned here.

1021
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,580
And it's kind of like if you want

1022
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,160
to know whether you should vote or not,

1023
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,240
have a five minute conversation with a voter.

1024
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,180
You've heard that something like that.

1025
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,520
Yeah.

1026
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,840
You know how dumb they are.

1027
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,600
So the same thing.

1028
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,240
There's not much here.

1029
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,320
No, no.

1030
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,520
And don't be fooled by the beauty.

1031
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,600
Like the people.

1032
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,060
You're not being fooled.

1033
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,900
You take it in.

1034
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,880
You take it in.

1035
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,340
That's why, like people go to prostitutes.

1036
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,760
It's a momentary whatever.

1037
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,000
And then you go on.

1038
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,640
It's a moral.

1039
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,140
There's a moral issue.

1040
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,020
There is no moral issue with saying, I

1041
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,140
like how beautiful the flowers look and smell

1042
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,960
and how beautiful the sunset is and all

1043
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,780
that and the beautiful things or whatever here.

1044
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:35,980
But that's just small and temporary extraction, like

1045
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,000
a snippet or a thumbnail of what's going

1046
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:38,400
on here.

1047
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,660
The the real truth that I keep saying

1048
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,860
this is I've spoken to several people and

1049
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,520
advise them.

1050
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,960
In other words, people, especially during the Obama

1051
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,120
age, they were retirement Obama age.

1052
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,600
Yeah, it was the Obama years to go

1053
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,220
off the grid.

1054
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,720
They thought the country was going to tank.

1055
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,740
And I said, no, it's not going to

1056
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:53,920
take.

1057
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,380
It's actually going to get a resurgence and

1058
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,360
get ultra conservative.

1059
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,880
And it's going to the Middle East is

1060
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,280
going to be the anyway we're going to

1061
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,480
be more isolationist.

1062
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,020
And they said, if you go off grid,

1063
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,940
everything's going to cost five times as much

1064
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,020
all your fuel and energy.

1065
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,580
And you'll notice that everything in nature wants

1066
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,400
to kill you.

1067
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,020
Yeah.

1068
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,640
And like two or three of them came

1069
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,000
back and said, yeah, it's just like that,

1070
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:15,160
man.

1071
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,460
It was beautiful, but it sucks.

1072
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,680
Everything wants to kill you, everything, the bugs,

1073
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,760
the animals, the environment.

1074
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:22,740
Yeah.

1075
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,120
So it's a constant thing.

1076
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,780
By the way, one thing I want to

1077
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,380
interject that I haven't gotten into much is,

1078
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,380
you know, the seasonal attitude or the seasonal

1079
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,040
outline of how affairs happen, like spring is

1080
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:38,700
building up, planting, planting, planting.

1081
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,300
Summer is building up and growing.

1082
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,520
Fall is tearing down.

1083
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:44,140
Harvest winter is a time where you don't

1084
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,980
plant and grow and tear down.

1085
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,440
It's an in-between time where you do

1086
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,580
things that you couldn't do or didn't shouldn't

1087
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,040
have done while you were planting, growing and

1088
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,480
harvesting.

1089
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:56,840
Right.

1090
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,880
So give an example of that.

1091
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,820
You know, spring, you plant your seeds.

1092
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,720
Summer, you grow and have some summer harvest.

1093
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,240
Fall, you have your main harvest.

1094
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,360
You take care of all your of your

1095
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,060
business debts and income, whatever.

1096
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,420
And then the winter is when you put

1097
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,040
a new roof on your house, you fix

1098
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,180
your wagon, you go on a long trip.

1099
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,000
Right.

1100
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,580
This is the agricultural basis for life.

1101
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,980
So from a basic societal point of view,

1102
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,060
stuff that happens in the spring is planting

1103
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,760
something that will probably grow in the summer.

1104
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,840
And things that happen in the fall are

1105
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,800
tearing down events.

1106
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,320
That's why every financial crash is always in

1107
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,900
October or September.

1108
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,960
And that's also when people are harvesting, because

1109
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,600
that's when the financial crashes happen.

1110
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,140
That's when people really make their money.

1111
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:40,760
But yeah.

1112
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,380
Yeah, that also it's also tearing down.

1113
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:43,700
Right.

1114
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,480
Wintertime is when the really weird shit comes

1115
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:46,720
up.

1116
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,460
Like, you know, somebody did something weird.

1117
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,280
Like, you know, India launches a satellite into

1118
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,080
space like India.

1119
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,860
I mean, they they still have a caste

1120
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,780
system with untouchables and the curry.

1121
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,200
And how the hell do they sell a

1122
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,660
satellite?

1123
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,000
What?

1124
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:01,720
So anyway, you'll see these patterns throughout.

1125
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,900
So I didn't talk much about the fuckery

1126
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,080
going on this spring.

1127
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,320
I didn't get a sense, like with covid,

1128
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,220
they announced the Federal Reserve and the treasurer

1129
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,160
announced covid on the Passover, the biblical Passover,

1130
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,200
not the Jewish one.

1131
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,720
And like 9-11, the one that happened

1132
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,660
in 2001 happened on the Day of Atonement,

1133
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,320
the biblical one, not the Jewish one, meaning

1134
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
the 10th day of the seventh month.

1135
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,280
So covid was announced on the on the

1136
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,920
13th day, the end of the 13th day

1137
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,900
of the first month.

1138
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,340
And that's not January 13th, dickheads.

1139
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,760
I mean, the people are trying to tell

1140
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,440
me, well, that means this.

1141
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,120
I had a message from someone who's like,

1142
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,680
you know, the Bible says what it means

1143
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,920
and means what it says.

1144
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,520
If it's the 13th day of the first

1145
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,780
month, it's got to be January.

1146
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,180
I mean, total retarded shit sometimes I get,

1147
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,500
but not much, by the way, for the

1148
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,780
thousands of messages I've gotten, I've gotten maybe

1149
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:01,060
two or three memorable, really dumb asses, which

1150
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,720
is excellent.

1151
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,640
That's like point one point zero one percent.

1152
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,800
That's pretty good.

1153
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,820
I wish I could say that.

1154
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,020
Yeah.

1155
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,020
Oh, my gosh.

1156
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,720
I'm actually blessed completely.

1157
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,180
Like, you know, I shouldn't use that word

1158
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,840
either, but you know what I mean?

1159
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:19,640
I endowed with a very responsible listenership, but

1160
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,440
the fuckery going around this spring, we're in

1161
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,900
the middle of spring now on summer.

1162
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,180
We had 100 degree temperatures for two days

1163
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,540
in Tucson, broke a record like 10 degrees

1164
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,140
above the historical record.

1165
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,380
I wonder if anybody's doing weather work in

1166
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:32,900
California.

1167
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,800
But anyway, I'm not.

1168
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,060
I could be to mitigate it.

1169
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,880
But the fuckery going around in, did I

1170
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,340
say fuckery?

1171
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,680
Going a medical term, going around this springtime

1172
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,080
and all that.

1173
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,700
The main thing I didn't notice anything threatening.

1174
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,860
But I did notice that the there was

1175
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,660
a big move to do this tariff thing.

1176
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,100
Right.

1177
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,360
A middle nation does talk about the tariff

1178
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,580
thing.

1179
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,800
It's just to isolate.

1180
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:03,000
And, you know, it's really interesting in how

1181
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,040
stupid people are.

1182
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,960
Manufacturing, it supposedly protects the American wherewithal and

1183
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,280
resources here nationally.

1184
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,800
All those were cut.

1185
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,140
All the.

1186
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,100
What do you manufacture?

1187
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,980
Well, all the factories began to be shut

1188
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,600
down in the late 60s, for sure, in

1189
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,659
the 70s and 80s.

1190
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:19,000
Yeah.

1191
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,520
And the only thing is little cottage industry,

1192
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:24,040
a little mom and pop stuff, which is

1193
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,199
what Covid was supposed to get rid of.

1194
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,120
And the tariffs are going to make it

1195
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,780
even harder because the big businesses know how

1196
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,199
to use bills of exchange.

1197
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,980
The little business guy does not.

1198
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,080
So if a little guy that does a

1199
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,580
quarter of a million in business a year

1200
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,820
gets bills that are 50 grand, he's out

1201
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:42,260
of business.

1202
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,000
He doesn't know how to handle those bills.

1203
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,820
He sees it as something he has to

1204
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,900
send out using from the earnings from his

1205
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,219
business.

1206
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,139
They don't understand that the big corporations, they

1207
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:55,380
have private accountants and attorneys that know how

1208
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,640
to use bills of exchange.

1209
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,500
You know, there's no money.

1210
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:57,820
Right.

1211
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,460
So just the way you write a certain

1212
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,520
paper makes it money.

1213
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,980
That's why I keep saying, how can Apple

1214
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,240
be worth a trillion net?

1215
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,120
Because that means that everyone on the planet

1216
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,500
would have to buy at least a thousand

1217
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,360
dollars worth of Apple products every year.

1218
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,420
I sure as hell I don't.

1219
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,080
I don't.

1220
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:15,020
So it's all bills of exchange, negotiable instruments.

1221
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,900
So combined with the high tariffs and the

1222
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,280
small business, people don't know how the money

1223
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,040
system works.

1224
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,960
So when someone sends them a bill for

1225
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,520
a thousand dollars, they think they have to

1226
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,100
take it out of the income that they

1227
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,320
earn.

1228
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,240
They don't know that that bill is actually

1229
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:28,800
a check.

1230
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,060
You know, I mean, it's ridiculous.

1231
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,520
So for their own ignorance, we'll put them

1232
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:34,820
under.

1233
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,760
Yeah, I just see a slow turndown, more

1234
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,260
more of the what you saw COVID do

1235
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,060
is what the tariffs are going to do.

1236
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,980
But in a different way, it's a small

1237
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,720
business to business in general.
