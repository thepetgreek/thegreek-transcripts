1
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,980
Hey, SonicEvent194, and hey, Greek, what is that?

2
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,860
I heard something tapping there just as I

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:15,100
was...

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,160
Oh yeah, I just turned...

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,860
I have an automatic ignition gas stove, I'm

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,940
making seasoned rice, but it's brown rice.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,280
And it's funny, you know, people invited me

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,100
for dinner over the years, I got a

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,980
reputation of showing up about an hour, hour

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,659
and a half before the dinner starts, so

11
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:32,740
I could go to the kitchen and do

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,400
the cooking.

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,200
With your tools, with your tool bag, so

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,500
to speak, right?

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,780
And I got my tool bag and some

16
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,160
ingredients, which, you know, good salt, you know,

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:41,440
whatever.

18
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,140
And I got this, Sondra Means is her

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,580
name, she knew about that from the grapevine,

20
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,080
and I showed up and she goes, I

21
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,980
know what you're doing, you're here to cook,

22
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,800
no, I'm cooking.

23
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,960
She gave me a hard time about it,

24
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,460
and my wife was there at the time,

25
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,660
she was laughing because she thought I would

26
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,720
always get away with it.

27
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,400
But the point here is, she made a

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,040
dinner...

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,320
Wait, you mean you didn't get away with

30
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:06,780
it that time?

31
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:09,100
No, she wouldn't let me in the kitchen

32
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,060
because she knew that was my MO.

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,240
I'm surprised, I'm surprised, because dealing with you,

34
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,400
I have this hard time thinking that people

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,080
resist you in person, I don't know why.

36
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,520
Well, no, but anyway, she prepared like a

37
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,460
broiled salmon with veg and brown rice, and

38
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,820
my first comment was, this is an unwritten,

39
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,580
unspoken rule, when you have an animal protein

40
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,900
like fish or meat or whatever, fowl, and

41
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,860
you always serve that with white rice, never

42
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:39,480
brown rice.

43
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,760
Brown rice is when you go veg across

44
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,240
the board.

45
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:42,580
Why?

46
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,380
Because brown rice has got more than enough

47
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,740
energy than you're going to need.

48
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,960
Here's something, we eat food to get energy,

49
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,840
and energy is different qualities.

50
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,380
Most people don't think it that way, they

51
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,000
think, oh, well, yeah, I know I get

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,540
energy because when I'm hungry, I go along,

53
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,620
and energy, there's even like a Snickers commercial

54
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,480
about that, right?

55
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,660
Well, they're still on the burning concept, and

56
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,460
they go, oh, it's my fuel, it's the

57
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,700
fuel, we're burning fuel.

58
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,740
Yeah, well, not at all, yeah.

59
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,560
We could get into it with the car,

60
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,960
by the way, you're not burning gasoline in

61
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,240
a car, you're actually, you're adding vapors and

62
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,200
things that are ignitable to the air, you're

63
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,360
actually burning the air.

64
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:21,880
Right.

65
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,700
That's why a gasoline, you could substitute gasoline

66
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,920
for propane, like in warehouse forklifts, you could

67
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,840
substitute it for alcohol, you could substitute it

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,380
for hydrogen.

69
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,620
So yeah, it's just a very juvenile way,

70
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,240
but the people, you know, they're minors, right?

71
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,820
Remember, I've read the statute that even though

72
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,860
you will still be considered a minor even

73
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,580
though you are of legal age, what does

74
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,160
that tell you?

75
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,280
You're a minor for the rest of your

76
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,400
life.

77
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,120
And if you remember from early Sonics, I

78
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,200
always say, you might, people that call yourself

79
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,080
minority, shame on you, it has nothing to

80
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,140
do with your skin complexion.

81
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,240
It's purely that you're incompetent, right, legally.

82
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,580
So anyway, you've heard that, but anyway, back

83
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,420
to the dinner stuff.

84
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,520
Oh yeah, and by the way, back in

85
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,680
the 50s on the Sonics, like somewhere around

86
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,260
Sonic 50 something or other, somebody was catching

87
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,940
up and they just, you know, started not

88
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,620
too long ago and they were saying how

89
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,120
great the cabbage was.

90
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,920
I just, oh yeah, well, I've gotten a

91
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,780
lot of, yeah, the cabbage roast, it's cabbage

92
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,280
roast and broccoli steak and right.

93
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,960
I just got, I just got that feedback

94
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,280
like two days ago.

95
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,600
So I'm just telling you that that was

96
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,100
like a couple of new people that are

97
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,600
coming through and searching through and they're actually,

98
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,660
the reason we're really doing this is because

99
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,980
when I occasionally get an email, I've changed

100
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,820
my entire life, you know, and I'm like,

101
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,380
oh, great.

102
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,180
Because if you know that my adage, if

103
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,980
half the people in the world helped one

104
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,740
person, right, the whole world is taken care

105
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:44,860
of.

106
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,220
So I've done that with hundreds of people,

107
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,380
if not more.

108
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,500
And it's objective.

109
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,760
It's objective information.

110
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,860
It's not like, well, that's how he likes

111
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,240
it.

112
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,340
So I do it.

113
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,760
So, you know, it's very objectifying.

114
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,940
But anyway, back to the food, when you're

115
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,080
doing a whole grain, people don't really eat

116
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,940
whole oats, you know, they're very difficult to

117
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,200
eat.

118
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:04,500
Right.

119
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,720
I've had whole oats.

120
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,100
It's quite interesting.

121
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,600
They usually roll them because the shell on

122
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,860
the outside doesn't soften with with cooking.

123
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,839
But whole grains usually is veg all the

124
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:16,220
way.

125
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,120
And when you're going to do an animal,

126
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,420
when I say, you know, people are used

127
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,540
to calling an animal, right?

128
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,560
Fish, poultry, bird, fowl, you know, whatever, four

129
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,380
legged, whatever, anything that's animal protein, go with

130
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,520
white rice, a very basic starch.

131
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,260
Here's another thing, way to look at it.

132
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,660
You know, the concept of potato skins and

133
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,500
potato with the skin on and all that,

134
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,880
you can do that with an all veg.

135
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,320
But when you're going to prepare a potato

136
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,100
dish, start with animal, make sure all the

137
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,200
peel is off because that peel carries all

138
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,820
this energy.

139
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,400
But by the way, potato peels produce soil.

140
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,820
They produce what's called by by two minute

141
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,200
by humus, lignites and all these other things.

142
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,080
So when people when you buy potatoes, you're

143
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,960
like, oh, there's dirt on there.

144
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,580
That's actually the dirt that was produced by

145
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,080
the potato.

146
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:04,740
Is that wonderful?

147
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,620
But anyway, just to give you an idea

148
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,940
of the perspective, but I have some tuna,

149
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,120
some tuna that I've been curing out slowly

150
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,980
and I'm going to have that with the

151
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,460
brown rice.

152
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,240
So I was a Greek.

153
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,300
You're just contradicting yourself.

154
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:19,800
Yes, I know.

155
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,040
But I'm going to have like a very

156
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,600
tiny amount of brown rice on the side,

157
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,120
mostly with some veg after we finish the

158
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,460
sonic because I didn't feel like making anything

159
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:27,660
else.

160
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,920
I felt like an extra protein.

161
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,380
But if you ever wanted to, like, do

162
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,660
a super load, do like beef or lamb

163
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,980
with burdock stir fry and brown rice.

164
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,920
If you just ate brown rice, you'd be

165
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,220
fine.

166
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,480
If you just ate the beef, you'd be

167
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:43,720
fine.

168
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,880
If you just ate the burdock, you'd be

169
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,040
fine.

170
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,220
Could you imagine all three together?

171
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,520
It's like rocket fuel, jet fuel and racing

172
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,440
fuel put together.

173
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:49,740
Right.

174
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,360
And TNT.

175
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,120
I was just thinking all three things are

176
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,100
like highly potent.

177
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,440
Oh, my gosh.

178
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,080
The burdock will give you more energy than

179
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,680
the beef.

180
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,800
The brown rice is in between.

181
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,640
And, you know, what beef does, you know,

182
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,560
it's very energetic.

183
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,800
Cows like to kick.

184
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,300
You want to you don't want to eat.

185
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,140
The reason you get energy from beef is

186
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:08,920
cows are kickers.

187
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,860
People don't know that.

188
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,140
Right.

189
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,920
They kick a lot.

190
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,120
A cow doesn't like you.

191
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,240
It'll turn around, just get out of the

192
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,460
way.

193
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,420
But anyway, but I think the cows that

194
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,400
most people are familiar with are totally subdued

195
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,140
and drugged out.

196
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,400
Right.

197
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,820
They're so doped up and messed up from

198
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,800
the hormone treatments and whatever the hell else

199
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:24,960
is.

200
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,300
Yeah.

201
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,380
Their horns are cut.

202
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,100
You know, all the cows have horns as

203
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,580
part of their character and they cut the

204
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,460
horns and all that.

205
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,400
So, yeah.

206
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,080
So that's the spiel on the food.

207
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,180
Very, very important.

208
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,400
No date on the food seminar yet.

209
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,840
And I have to blame.

210
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,800
It's not an excuse, but I'm going to

211
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,480
put the blame on the financial seminar.

212
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,960
It's taking a lot of energy to get

213
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,560
it set up so it can run.

214
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,200
People can run on their own.

215
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,500
We've got some new people coming in.

216
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,140
It's really good.

217
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,760
All right.

218
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,680
Probably the only thing I have is a

219
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,380
stupid Skype link to something.

220
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,820
So I've gotten some people interested.

221
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,240
But the thing is, if you're not active,

222
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:03,960
you get booted.

223
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,200
And there's a bunch of people that are

224
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,400
not active.

225
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,680
And I still haven't booted them.

226
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,340
And I may not.

227
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,300
I don't know.

228
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,400
But the food seminar, when things slow down,

229
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,360
I keep saying that we'll do that.

230
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,380
That's very, very important.

231
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,640
Right now, that link to the financial seminar

232
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,520
is still in the Patreon chat.

233
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:19,760
Yeah.

234
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,780
If you go there, the link for the

235
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,700
other one is there because I keep just

236
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,500
changing groups.

237
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,060
If you're a guest, no guests.

238
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,220
If you're a guest, we'll boot you.

239
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,900
You got to have a name if you

240
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,060
want.

241
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,920
Just pick a stupid name just so we

242
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,620
know not who you are, but how to

243
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,200
refer to you and call you, you know,

244
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,060
whatever.

245
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,640
You know, when you say someone's name, you

246
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,160
know what name you use for your avatar.

247
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,960
But if you say guest 348, you're like,

248
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,900
I don't know, that may not be me.

249
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,180
I mean, you know, maybe I'm a guest.

250
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:44,860
I hear you.

251
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,740
So you're going to carry that over to

252
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,940
teams after the fifth, though.

253
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,160
Right.

254
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,160
You have no choice.

255
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,620
I just tell everybody, leave it alone and

256
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,120
they'll automatically switch for you.

257
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,040
That's what it says.

258
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,280
Yeah.

259
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,800
But but teams is like they're they're copying

260
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,240
Zoom.

261
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,120
They're giving only one hour on calls.

262
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,240
And then there's a premium for 30 hours,

263
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,660
which Skype was unlimited.

264
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,000
We ran around the days 10, 15 years

265
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,220
ago.

266
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,280
Brain food.

267
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,540
Yeah.

268
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,360
They ran a group.

269
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:08,640
Yeah.

270
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,660
Ran for about a year.

271
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,560
Went for like a year.

272
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,380
It was like a year.

273
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,680
As long as two computers were on all

274
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,060
the time.

275
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,320
Right.

276
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,460
And that was run by a guy, a

277
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,960
Brit expat that lived in, oh, Jamaica or

278
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,280
something, or Belize.

279
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,040
One man outfit should salute to you if

280
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,780
you're still out there.

281
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,960
So, yeah, that was back in the day.

282
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,100
I met a lot of people there.

283
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,179
I wonder if that guy.

284
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:33,880
Not much.

285
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,140
Yeah.

286
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,059
Much brain food.

287
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,000
But I got you.

288
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,600
I wonder if anybody ever recorded any of

289
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,960
that, though, because some of those I mean,

290
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,100
some things were just stupid and some things

291
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,140
were very enlightening.

292
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,300
And there were interesting people.

293
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,360
I didn't find anything, but that's OK.

294
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,660
It's a matter of taste, right?

295
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,360
Well, it depends.

296
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,660
I mean, I went in there at certain

297
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,420
times a day and, you know, it would

298
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,660
just be like a personal conversation almost because

299
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,420
they just, you know.

300
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,720
Yeah, that's what it was.

301
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,680
And most personal conversations to me are absolutely

302
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,160
worthless.

303
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,260
Well, like I said, OK.

304
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,240
Uh, yeah.

305
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:02,860
Yeah, I know.

306
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,640
It's you got to be.

307
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,260
Look, I don't have that much time left

308
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:05,480
here.

309
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,880
I don't think anybody really does.

310
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,200
I just tell it like it is.

311
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,160
If you want to know what I'm thinking,

312
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,100
listen to what I'm saying.

313
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,380
I have no inner monologue.

314
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,960
And I've stressed that to that.

315
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,840
No one should have that.

316
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,600
But all right.

317
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:15,980
What do you got?

318
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,840
Got questions tonight?

319
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,680
Well, I got a couple.

320
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,060
Just a few, though.

321
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:19,800
Let's see.

322
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,000
Please ask the Greek to elaborate more on

323
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,900
why he mentioned that sex is for procreation

324
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,240
only.

325
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,720
That's from the last Sonic, by the way.

326
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,280
Well, that's right.

327
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,240
You were given.

328
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,840
It's kind of like a pinky.

329
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,400
You have a pinky so you can pick

330
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,080
your nose, right?

331
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,620
Think of it.

332
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
So, you know, you have a thumb.

333
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,160
So you have an opposing member.

334
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,220
There's a purpose for everything, like your appendix

335
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:39,620
is.

336
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:39,840
Yeah.

337
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,020
Your appendix is not there because of evolution

338
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,100
that shrunk away.

339
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:44,700
It was another thing.

340
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,640
No, your appendix is a sourdough starter.

341
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,340
So when you're lacking positive intestinal flora required

342
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:57,400
for positive intestinal flora and fauna for having

343
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,520
efficient digestion, it's it's produced in the appendix

344
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,340
and then pumped out.

345
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,740
These medical morons will never.

346
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,500
They can never just like the legal morons.

347
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,560
The attorneys never learn any law.

348
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:08,920
Right.

349
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,240
Right.

350
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,560
So you you have a component that is

351
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,600
psychological and it's good for the beneficial for

352
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,660
energy flow in the body, you can say.

353
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,760
But there are exercises.

354
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:21,740
There's an extra.

355
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,920
There's an old video.

356
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,960
Wilhelm Reich developed an exercise for men who

357
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,080
had too much pent up sexual energy to

358
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,280
do.

359
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,460
So it's basically just laying on your back

360
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,160
and arching your back up and then doing

361
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,300
rapid breathing motion, rapid contraction, extraction of your

362
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,380
diaphragm, you know, like you suck your stomach

363
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,060
way in and then push it way out

364
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,180
while your back is arched up a little

365
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:40,380
bit.

366
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:40,880
I've tried it.

367
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,280
It works.

368
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:41,820
It works.

369
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,900
That's to give off sexual energy.

370
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,460
Give me an example with the sex, the

371
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,600
way it's done.

372
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,440
It's used.

373
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,380
The social engineering part is interesting because that

374
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,420
is purely for population control.

375
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,900
When they want to increase the population.

376
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,240
Yes, you have herders, masters, groups that control

377
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:02,540
you.

378
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,000
And it's good if you don't know it.

379
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,000
It's working right.

380
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,160
If you don't know that you've been socially

381
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,280
engineered, that means that the social engineering is

382
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,580
working very well.

383
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:12,820
Right.

384
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,540
Yeah.

385
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,480
OK, so when they want to increase the

386
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,040
population, they restrict.

387
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,460
Sexual activity, you can't talk about it.

388
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,660
There's no condoms behind the counter at the

389
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,060
store.

390
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,280
Nothing above the knee on TV and media.

391
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,020
Right.

392
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,200
Very like you'd see in Muslim countries, very

393
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,440
much.

394
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,060
You'd see in whatever restrictive Mormon, whatever.

395
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,220
OK, so when they want to decrease the

396
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,400
population, they promote sexuality.

397
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,660
Now, suddenly, you have condoms behind the convenience

398
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,860
store counter visible.

399
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,600
A lot of sex insinuation, a lot of

400
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,800
sex showing all the way to the point

401
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,600
to where the rating would not be for

402
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,200
below 18 on regular media.

403
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,020
But like right now, they oversex you.

404
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:00,800
So you're popular.

405
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,880
So you have no children.

406
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,160
Right.

407
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,580
Even the publicly shown numbers right now are

408
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,000
demonstrating that in the United States, we are

409
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,960
not even, you know, keeping up with replacement.

410
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,300
Oh, we passed that like five years ago.

411
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,240
It's like one point one point two children

412
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,120
now or something.

413
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:14,800
I'm being born.

414
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,740
Might be lower.

415
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,380
And it might be lower than that.

416
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,640
One, two, you're seeing that the fertility rate

417
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,060
is lower.

418
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,160
Sperm counts are lower.

419
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,300
All these things are lower.

420
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,220
That's right.

421
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,340
Now, let me just give this because most

422
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,380
people never heard these.

423
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,020
Most people have never heard the stuff I

424
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,480
talk about and never will.

425
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,560
Unless they get it from here.

426
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,920
That's the sad part for me.

427
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,240
Right.

428
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,040
Because I'd like to shut up and sit

429
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,640
back and listen to somebody else.

430
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,840
But anyway, give me an example, if you

431
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,160
didn't quite get my point.

432
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,880
When you go to one of these Mormon

433
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,160
community, a Muslim community, I don't pick some

434
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,780
other sexual what they call sexual repression, which

435
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,780
it's not, by the way.

436
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,240
But that's a form.

437
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,540
That's how the label would be put on

438
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:54,680
it.

439
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,980
Puritanical in general thought.

440
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,280
Yeah.

441
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,280
The thought process of a puritanical kind of

442
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,480
mindset regarding sex.

443
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,480
Pick any society.

444
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,540
Go knock on their door.

445
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,740
How many children are here?

446
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,100
Oh, we got five children and one more

447
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,760
on the way.

448
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,340
How many should not go to the next

449
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,620
house randomly knock on the door?

450
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,080
How many children?

451
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,940
You have nine children.

452
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,660
How many children do you have?

453
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,900
We have three.

454
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,120
And how old is your wife?

455
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,760
She's 18.

456
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,020
You know, no, those are a third baby.

457
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,900
I used to meet guys from Muslim countries

458
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,600
all the time.

459
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,640
And from the 90s, the early 2000s and

460
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:25,920
stuff.

461
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,060
And they were always parts of families where

462
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,060
it's like, you know, 70 kids.

463
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:30,800
Right.

464
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,300
OK, now let's let's change it over.

465
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,740
Just to illustrate, let's go to a place

466
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,660
like New York City, Tokyo, L.A., do

467
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,100
a random knock on door.

468
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,560
How many children?

469
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,740
We don't have any children.

470
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,520
Oh, you've been married 23 years.

471
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:44,960
OK.

472
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,060
Now go to the next.

473
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,860
How many children you have?

474
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,600
We have one child next door.

475
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,900
How many do not next door?

476
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,980
One, two.

477
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,880
We have two children.

478
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,100
Wow.

479
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
So where the sex is being promoted, the

480
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,500
population has been going down and where it's

481
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,960
not promoted or actually slightly held back or

482
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,580
held back.

483
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,400
Now, when I say the pop, the sexuality

484
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,320
is held back.

485
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,900
They still have a lot of romantic songs,

486
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,280
courting, courting, you know, those Muslim countries.

487
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,100
I was just telling you about every single

488
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,920
one of their songs.

489
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,640
If you translate it, everything is about love,

490
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,720
their love, who they're loving, who they're being

491
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,840
with, who they want to be with.

492
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,680
That's everything.

493
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,020
So so this is a phenomenon that is

494
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,960
actually one on one social engineering that no

495
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,460
one is talking about, by the way.

496
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,140
No one is realizing it because the social

497
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,940
engineering works.

498
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,880
So when you tell people, you know, it's

499
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,000
a conspiracy theory, that means that the the

500
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,680
the mind control is working.

501
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,300
Well, some people have talked about this, but

502
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,880
they've never connected what you just connected there,

503
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,560
which is that in a place where you

504
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,600
have like what people think of as repression

505
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,500
is where the population is growing, you know,

506
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,220
where it's like, keep the you know, the

507
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,380
women in turtlenecks and make sure that their

508
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,940
skirts are long or maybe no.

509
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,860
But there's no reason for it.

510
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,400
I still fervently tell people, hey, you, you

511
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
know that everyone around you and your family

512
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,340
at work on the street is a moron.

513
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,080
So if that's true, no one has ever

514
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,520
said Greek.

515
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,660
My parents are not morons.

516
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,760
My family's are not morons.

517
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,860
No one's ever come back today.

518
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,860
Greek, I feel so.

519
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,560
Everyone's like, yeah, I guess so.

520
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,780
In this sense, the people I don't even

521
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,060
know.

522
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,280
And they're like, yeah, you know, I specifically

523
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,000
say the people you live with, the people

524
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,780
you work with, the people you see on

525
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,260
a recreation are all idiots.

526
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,060
Yeah.

527
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,400
So OK, so if we take that as

528
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,700
a given with few exceptions, right, how easy

529
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,260
it is to put on a social control

530
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:34,740
mechanism.

531
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,680
And why would you tell them, quote unquote,

532
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,040
the truth of the matter?

533
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,500
We're idiots.

534
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,360
See, that's the thing.

535
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,920
A lot of the social engineering is completely

536
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,040
misunderstood because they have a logical sort of

537
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,180
through line for these things.

538
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,700
And they think, oh, it must work this

539
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:48,920
way.

540
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,660
So in a place where they're promoting sex,

541
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,080
that must be a place where they're wanting

542
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,680
you to breathe.

543
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,260
Like when they put terrorism on a country,

544
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,440
that's because they're they they're telling the people

545
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,460
we're not afraid of you.

546
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,600
Now we're coming after you.

547
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
Middle Nation talked about that in one of

548
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:03,940
his videos.

549
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,060
I had it in the background when the

550
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,720
government is afraid of its people.

551
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,800
It tries to maintain peace and order when

552
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,580
a government is not afraid of its people.

553
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,260
It just goes out and just kills anyone

554
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,840
randomly like the drone strike.

555
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,940
Just does what they do, you know, whatever

556
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,400
they want.

557
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,940
That's why the CIA does these experiments, because

558
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,860
they, you know, they're American based, supposedly, and

559
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,740
they want to know.

560
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,700
But, you know, we might want to try

561
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,200
this here.

562
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,420
Let's go take over a country and just

563
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,620
have that that government, a puppet government, put

564
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,940
and start just killing people publicly and see

565
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,280
what the reaction is now.

566
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,000
You know, every decade they do that.

567
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,280
Right.

568
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,060
Speaking of that, speaking of that, a funny

569
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,280
thing is going on right now.

570
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,500
Right.

571
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,200
Everybody's talking about, you know, Trump and the

572
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,400
politics and blah, blah, blah.

573
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,120
And everybody's having their moments of outrage.

574
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,680
But these people are not understanding certain things.

575
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,920
Like they're trying to get rid of USAID.

576
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,000
And they go, well, that's us doing good

577
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,660
around the world.

578
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,700
And it's like, no, what's happening there is

579
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:02,380
they're reorganizing the intelligence community because all of

580
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:02,500
that.

581
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,420
Yeah, but let's go back to the theme

582
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,180
here that I brought up.

583
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,760
The U.S. government is afraid of the

584
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,800
U.S. population, and it's not because of

585
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,740
the guns, because they could slowly, just like

586
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,319
they restricted population control, they could restrict the

587
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,640
guns are no good without bullets.

588
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,740
You don't go after the guns and bullets

589
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,540
and the best guns you're going to get.

590
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,060
You're outgunned by.

591
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,060
So, you know, you're not.

592
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,900
There's more people with guns in the U

593
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,600
.S. and then people with guns in the

594
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,660
whole world combined.

595
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,000
And it's like ten to one.

596
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,360
The military in the U.S. military that

597
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,860
we know about is very small.

598
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,560
That's great.

599
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,380
The U.S. population has at least ten

600
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,280
times more.

601
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,460
If you got 80,000 BB guns, though,

602
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,740
you're no more than a nuisance.

603
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,680
OK, what I'm saying is that the small

604
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,640
arms and everybody thinks is there, you know,

605
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,980
their big defense against the gun.

606
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,880
If they want to, they'll hit you with

607
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,060
a drone from the sky.

608
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,120
You won't even hear it coming.

609
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,840
Well, it's not even that.

610
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,480
Yeah, that's true.

611
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,660
But that's singling out.

612
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,020
But I'm talking about mass population, but they're

613
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,460
moronic.

614
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,860
You see, the Americans are too moronic.

615
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,100
They cannot work in order to have a

616
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,600
revolution or a civil war.

617
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,260
We never had a civil war, by the

618
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:08,420
way.

619
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,660
They'd call it a civil war.

620
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,560
It was the war of northern aggression, the

621
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,300
war of the states.

622
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,960
It was to give the federal government taxation

623
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,500
power.

624
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,340
And that's I've seen documents written at the

625
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,080
time about it.

626
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,600
But here's the thing.

627
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,740
The people in order to this is from

628
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,300
Middle Nation.

629
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,960
So he he made a good point in

630
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,960
order to be revolutionary or whatever to go

631
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,900
against any power structure.

632
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,160
You have to have good art.

633
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,380
You have to have good knowledge.

634
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,380
You have to have a knowledge of the

635
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:34,780
classics.

636
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
You have to have rationale.

637
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,480
And Americans don't have that.

638
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,000
Of course.

639
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,420
Right.

640
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,780
It's been because of the social engineering.

641
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,860
I'm not saying people are not capable of

642
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,020
that.

643
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,560
I don't see many that are.

644
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,620
But it's they're victims of this social engineering

645
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,020
program.

646
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,720
All right.

647
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,460
What else you got?

648
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,360
Well, you know, I have an odd question

649
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,940
for you, because I think I picked up

650
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,680
on something from you in our many conversations

651
00:18:59,680 --> 00:18:59,980
here.

652
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,700
And I want to check.

653
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,660
I don't think you've ever been around.

654
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,820
Like, I know you've been around black people

655
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,320
and you talked about it being in New

656
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,980
York and melanated individuals, you know, what most

657
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,940
people call black people.

658
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,740
But I don't think you've actually spent time

659
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,560
around black people that grew up in the

660
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,240
South, have you?

661
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,900
Oh, yeah, I have.

662
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,460
Really?

663
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,300
Yeah.

664
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:18,700
Yeah.

665
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,740
I've been to Buford, South Carolina.

666
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,280
I've been around in my early in the

667
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,760
70s.

668
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,320
I have.

669
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,260
They are very much still social engineered the

670
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,540
way of the slave days.

671
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,240
But it's terrified of dogs.

672
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,620
Yeah.

673
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,220
Terrified of dogs.

674
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,680
Even a little chihuahua.

675
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,340
They're terrified.

676
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,980
They look down when they speak to white

677
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,220
people.

678
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,960
They look down at the ground.

679
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,020
Very if you want to know what it

680
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,440
was like to be black in the 1800s

681
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,280
in the South, it hasn't changed very much

682
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,380
in many ways.

683
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,720
But at the same time, what I did

684
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,500
see that people don't know that it's never

685
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,140
really talked about is the affluent communities that

686
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,940
are like Georgia.

687
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,000
You know, there was a joke.

688
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,680
Why don't we send all the black people

689
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,600
where they came from?

690
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,360
Atlanta, Georgia.

691
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,300
Right.

692
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,900
There's some guy comedian made a joke about

693
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,180
that.

694
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:05,420
Right.

695
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:05,800
Right.

696
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,860
But no one talks about the affluent communities

697
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,520
you'll find in and around near Georgia, in

698
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,580
and around New Jersey.

699
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,760
Well, there are even places.

700
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,140
When you say black people, they're so stigmatized.

701
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,520
There are even places in Mississippi, quite honestly,

702
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,800
which you would think of as one of

703
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,700
the harshest, most, you know, like definitely throwback

704
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,820
kind of to slave day states possible.

705
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,180
Right.

706
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,120
But they even had whole communities where they

707
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,300
separated and created an affluent situation where they

708
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,720
put in the.

709
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,600
Yeah, that's why they were against civil rights,

710
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,640
because they knew with civil rights, the white

711
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,920
man's going to butt in and and bring

712
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,320
their police and create slavery again.

713
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,300
It's like 20 percent of the people that

714
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,280
produce crimes that go to prison are black.

715
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,260
But 80 percent of the people in prison,

716
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,160
I mean, are indicted for crimes.

717
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,380
Let's say, yes, 20 percent of the population

718
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:55,700
is black.

719
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,220
But the 80 percent of the population is

720
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,280
black in prison.

721
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,780
So what they're doing is bring back the

722
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,600
slave system for black people with civil rights.

723
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,660
People don't know this.

724
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,640
Civil rights was the worst thing that ever

725
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,100
happened.

726
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,820
It's a 14th Amendment thing.

727
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,120
And I think I believe in meritocracy and

728
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,140
believe it or not, the world really runs

729
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,000
a meritocracy.

730
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,200
That's why people in general, any country in

731
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,920
the world have a dislike for government workers,

732
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,680
because they know if you work for the

733
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,800
government, you could go punch in and go

734
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,300
to the movies all day, not do nothing

735
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,640
and you won't get fired.

736
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,800
It's not a meritocracy working, you know, in

737
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,140
a public municipal job.

738
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:32,400
Right.

739
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,020
I find it strange that you think the

740
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,440
world works on meritocracy.

741
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,860
Because it does work on meritocracy.

742
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,320
Well, quite honestly, when I mean, do you

743
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,980
do you think a guy like Elon Musk

744
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,620
is there at a merit?

745
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,080
Oh, no, that's well, no, I'm talking about

746
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,940
the world, except for the power structure.

747
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,580
You know what?

748
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,540
Elon Musk is 200 billion.

749
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,760
He's just a slave.

750
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,820
Then no one talks about the two and

751
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,480
a half trillion.

752
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,760
The Rothschilds are worse.

753
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,680
Why not?

754
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,980
And the Rothschilds are just clerks.

755
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,120
They're not even part of the power structure.

756
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:02,900
I mean, they are.

757
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,480
They're the closest you can get publicly about

758
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,220
the power structure.

759
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,800
You know, the Rockefellers, the industrialists and the

760
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,320
bankers.

761
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:09,600
Right.

762
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,140
Habsburgs, they've lost their power a long time.

763
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,100
It's all under the main power is underground,

764
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,200
subsurface, literally subsurface.

765
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:21,260
Now, the let's go back to the people

766
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,500
of darker complexion.

767
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:33,420
There there's no separation in terms of behavior,

768
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,380
conditioning or anything like that that anyone else

769
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,520
would be subject to.

770
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,460
Right.

771
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,080
There's no.

772
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,760
How would you say it?

773
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,980
And I'm not trying to be political correct

774
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,580
at all.

775
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,380
I mean, I don't care about like member

776
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,080
Jimmy the Greek.

777
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,760
He said, you know, the black people are

778
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,620
better at why there's so many black people

779
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,880
in sports is because they were used to

780
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,280
running around in the jungle and all that.

781
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,520
And they got something like that.

782
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:53,720
Right.

783
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,400
Well, he said what happened is, is that

784
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,620
when they were breeding people slave days, they

785
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,840
decided to breed the biggest, strongest women with

786
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,820
the biggest, strongest men.

787
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,920
And they got the biggest, strongest.

788
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,600
Yes, we made a point like that.

789
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,260
So there's stupid stuff like that.

790
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,200
But it's a very in other words, it

791
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,180
doesn't matter what your complexion is or race,

792
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,720
quote unquote, because you have the Asian race

793
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,060
or whatever.

794
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,460
It's it's the society and the mind control

795
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,620
that you've been subject to.

796
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,980
And it starts in your culture, in your

797
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,900
family, how you've literally how your parents were,

798
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,920
unless you abandon what your parents, even the

799
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,740
Bible tells you, abandon the ways of your

800
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,120
parents.

801
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,380
Right.

802
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,100
But but here's the interesting thing.

803
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,380
There was a study done a long time

804
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,880
ago about Chinese people speak Chinese because they're

805
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,240
Chinese.

806
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,940
So they did an experiment where they put

807
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,000
in Caucasians from Europe in America, born in

808
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,100
China, and they spoke Chinese just as well

809
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,840
as Chinese.

810
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,160
Right.

811
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,160
And behaved their mannerisms and all that just

812
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,700
as equal.

813
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,260
So all that racist stuff doesn't work.

814
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,980
Now, there is medical racism.

815
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,620
We've talked about that.

816
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:55,940
Right.

817
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,960
Yeah, there's certain that's why you won't find

818
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,800
certain psychotropic Prozac in Asia kills people.

819
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,480
If you're Korean, take Prozac, you die.

820
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,400
We've talked about this.

821
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,160
There are biological differences that have come up

822
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,420
among groups of people that are connected to

823
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,340
particular by biographical areas.

824
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:13,680
Right.

825
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,560
I mean, it's just not biographical.

826
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,860
You know what I'm trying to say?

827
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,920
The discussion, by the way, with people of

828
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,860
darker complexion always ends up being a class

829
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,080
struggle discussion.

830
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,720
It's a class.

831
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,240
Yeah, it's a class thing, not a racist

832
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:28,580
thing.

833
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,520
Well, we do have in America a caste

834
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,060
system and they wave it in your face

835
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,060
all the time.

836
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,820
Middle class.

837
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,860
They're getting rid of the middle class.

838
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,880
Why is there any class system at all?

839
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,780
So they're developed a class system that they

840
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,720
pigeonhole people in and they cloak it with

841
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,920
racism and all that.

842
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,560
You know, the most racist people towards black

843
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,540
people are black people is what I've noticed,

844
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,580
you know, in the mixed environment, not just

845
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,240
in one specific deep south thing, but being

846
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,860
around different parts of the country.

847
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,880
Well, I don't know.

848
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,440
The deep south thing is different to me

849
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,900
because the the linguistic base is different here

850
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,520
than it was up north.

851
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,400
You know, I mean, I'm familiar with it.

852
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,480
I remember being in Buford, South Carolina.

853
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,020
Guy literally had a pickup truck with a

854
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,260
dog in the back and a rifle rack.

855
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:16,460
Yeah.

856
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,340
And he says that's common, by the way.

857
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,080
He says, listen, Greek, we pulled up from

858
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,560
someone's house.

859
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,760
You got to stay in here because I

860
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,440
got to go talk southern to these folks.

861
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,300
Somebody say in the car.

862
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,440
So, I mean, that's how critical it can

863
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:29,680
be.

864
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:29,900
Right.

865
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,380
The culture.

866
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:30,780
Right.

867
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,240
Yeah.

868
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,880
But I mean, it is it is strange

869
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,020
because I mean, it does not even remotely

870
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,540
resemble.

871
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,920
I mean, up north, it would resemble the

872
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,280
language.

873
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,480
I was the reason why it was settled

874
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,720
by Scots and certain people from Europe that

875
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,120
maintained a closed structure.

876
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,780
They were merchant class.

877
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,380
And you don't want to corrupt your your

878
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:49,860
status.

879
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,300
You want to corrupt your bloodline.

880
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,400
So they kept to themselves.

881
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,060
Language formed a certain way.

882
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,920
And it just stuck that way.

883
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,100
Look, just like why do people from New

884
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,800
York sound like they're from New York, dirty,

885
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,440
dirty, dirty?

886
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,520
You know, I learned at a very young

887
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,220
age if you had a New York accent

888
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,760
and you spoke like this, no matter how

889
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,280
smart you are, you sound dumb.

890
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,140
Yeah.

891
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,460
Right.

892
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,400
And there are.

893
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,000
And fortunately, you don't see a lot of

894
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,800
that on YouTube.

895
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,760
And but whenever you heard someone that is

896
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,620
showing New York accent, it was like, oh,

897
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,580
that's a really there's not there's no.

898
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,100
So I learned that, you know, you better

899
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,120
not, you know, because I saw it coming

900
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,980
and I ducked.

901
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,240
Well, yes, I got you.

902
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,880
Look, even the Jersey accent, which I have.

903
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,760
They they they often already.

904
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,040
Yeah, it's not thick, though.

905
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,560
It's not.

906
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,220
They could it could come through if I'm

907
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,880
around for people from Brooklyn or Jersey, wherever

908
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,000
I get way worse.

909
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,640
Yeah, it gets way worse if you're around.

910
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,260
But Jersey, Jersey is more like this, you

911
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,600
know?

912
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,420
Yeah, right.

913
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:47,820
Exactly.

914
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,380
Jersey is, you know, you got a thing.

915
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,200
It goes like that.

916
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,200
New York is a little softer on the

917
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,540
top.

918
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,840
You know, it's more flowing.

919
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,920
It sounds more like Italian.

920
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:57,620
Right.

921
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,260
Jersey.

922
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,340
You know, Jersey is like, yeah, yeah.

923
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,640
From Jersey, you know.

924
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,440
Right.

925
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,560
But either way, let's listen to Nicholson.

926
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,620
And what's the little his little friend?

927
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,560
Oh, David.

928
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,440
Danny DeVito.

929
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,800
And who else is from New Jersey?

930
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,040
I almost got in one of his movies

931
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,380
once.

932
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,800
But anyway, you know what I'm talking about?

933
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,680
I think that was a fairly correct assumption.

934
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,240
The Jersey New York accent.

935
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:19,720
I got you.

936
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,380
You know, you're right.

937
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,960
But the thing is, it's either either one

938
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,480
of them, though.

939
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,900
It creates an assumption in the listener that

940
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,460
you're not as intelligent.

941
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:30,060
Just not like the Boston.

942
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,920
When you Boston cock the calf, that's a

943
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,340
little bit.

944
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,240
It's almost as bad.

945
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,620
But not you don't sound like if you

946
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,840
have a New York accent, right?

947
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,560
You sound dumb.

948
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:37,900
Yeah.

949
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,360
You're not automatically stupid if you're from Boston.

950
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,880
I mean, you could be your suspect, you

951
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,820
know, but but you're automatically stupid if you're

952
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,080
from.

953
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,500
Well, it's kind of like when I got

954
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,720
on the Internet, like people from Australia sounded

955
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,560
dumb to me and people from New Zealand

956
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,300
sounded like arrogant assholes.

957
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:53,820
Right.

958
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,920
And initially and I used to joke around

959
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,900
about that and they didn't find it funny.

960
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,660
So I stopped joking around about that.

961
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,260
You know, they meaning the New Zealand, the

962
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,800
Kiwis and the Aussies.

963
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,060
Yeah.

964
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,800
What was what was even worse is when

965
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,000
you mix them up and I go, well,

966
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,760
what's the difference?

967
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,480
Well, what?

968
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,380
Oh, there's a big.

969
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,100
I know.

970
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:10,660
I know.

971
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,800
And then there's South African, which is the

972
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,560
mixture of Dutch and English and all that

973
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:14,880
stuff.

974
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,320
Yeah.

975
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,400
You got to be good with accents.

976
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,560
Also, believe it or not, I could tell

977
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,700
a person's race and nationality but just by

978
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,400
their voice.

979
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,000
Right.

980
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,500
If it's a black guy, Asian guy, even

981
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,720
if they're completely whitewashed, you can tell there's

982
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
a vocal cord thing.

983
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,360
There is biological differences or whatever.

984
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:32,760
Right.

985
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,820
When it comes to voice and major.

986
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,060
Well, to me, I can hear it.

987
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,340
Like when I was speaking with Sam, people

988
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,160
thought he was a white guy.

989
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:42,900
I said, oh, he's black.

990
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:43,860
How do you know he's black?

991
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,860
And I said, no, it's obvious he's black.

992
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,840
I said, I can't tell.

993
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:47,400
Right.

994
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,360
So I can hear when I spoke to

995
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,260
him, that's for sure.

996
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,140
But yeah, there's subtle differences.

997
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,840
This is all part of being on planet

998
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,120
Earth.

999
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,720
But what is social engineering?

1000
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,900
It's just got everybody at arms, even within

1001
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,580
the groups, you know, even within the groups

1002
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,280
that's been going on for a long time.

1003
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,280
And it's going to go on as as

1004
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,240
long as you don't have rocket packs and

1005
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,520
hotel on the moon, it's going to be

1006
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,100
going on.

1007
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,680
Because when you have rocket packs and hotel

1008
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,280
and when things will change again, you're never

1009
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,180
going to get those things.

1010
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,060
So these things are never going to change

1011
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,580
in this society, not in this lifetime.

1012
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,880
Anyways, I got one more question and then,

1013
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,720
you know, we can just run from there.

1014
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,800
Can the Greek offer advice for the best

1015
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,660
ways to eliminate parasites in our body?

1016
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,340
Now, that seems to me to be a

1017
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:31,880
wide.

1018
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,860
Yeah, because the parasites are changing constantly.

1019
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,360
Like dog breeds from 100 years ago are

1020
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,100
not the same.

1021
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,480
No matter how you like German shepherds were

1022
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,800
really, you know, great dogs.

1023
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,200
And now you got a German shepherd who

1024
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,080
hip dysplasia.

1025
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,540
He's going to have hip problems.

1026
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:47,840
Right.

1027
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,180
So you have certain parasites that are not

1028
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,920
even acknowledged.

1029
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,620
Like I remember the fleshy bacteria or whatever

1030
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,880
showed up at one point.

1031
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,160
And I went, whoa, where the hell did

1032
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,800
that come from?

1033
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,160
Because that wasn't here before.

1034
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,720
A lot of the parasites that were dangerous

1035
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,320
100 years ago are harmless.

1036
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,220
And a lot of there's new parasites that

1037
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,020
they don't acknowledge, because when you work in

1038
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,020
the medical industry and if you see something

1039
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,800
on the slide that you are told you're

1040
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,880
not supposed to see, they just negate it.

1041
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,820
They do exclusions, right?

1042
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,240
Complete exclusions.

1043
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,280
There are there are parasites that live on

1044
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,100
put on plutonium rods in nuclear power plants.

1045
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,060
Well, also, as some things have thawed out,

1046
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,660
OK, it appears to me as though we've

1047
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,420
lost some we have lost some ice cap

1048
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:27,920
here and there.

1049
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,260
If we've thawed out stuff that's been frozen

1050
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,400
for a thousand years, it's very possible there's.

1051
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,320
Yeah, but I'm talking about emergence.

1052
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,500
I don't go for that.

1053
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,320
That stuff has to come from somewhere.

1054
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,440
Stuff comes from nowhere.

1055
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,300
You know, you can have pure, sterile conditions

1056
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,260
and put it in in a certain way

1057
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,680
where it's absent of certain light and you

1058
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,780
introduce some gases and you'll see things forming

1059
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,680
in their biologicals where there was no way

1060
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,860
that we live in a world where things

1061
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:00,680
emerge from inorganic life, yet organic life, believe

1062
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,280
it or not.

1063
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,140
And they have the conditions just right.

1064
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,500
Let's go back to the thing.

1065
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,180
There's a walnut, whole clove.

1066
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:07,420
Right.

1067
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,400
And one other thing, walnut, whole black walnut,

1068
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,480
whole clove and one other mixture.

1069
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,080
There are capsules you could buy.

1070
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,780
It's a powder.

1071
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,180
Start off with that.

1072
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,860
Those are the basic there.

1073
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,660
If you if you if you did a

1074
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:24,720
search on this online, that's the basic I

1075
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,680
think they still exist.

1076
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,100
There were parasite cleansing was really big 15,

1077
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,560
20 years ago, especially with Hilda Clark and

1078
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:30,900
all that.

1079
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,080
OK, so the basic capsules that are available,

1080
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,920
it's got walnut, whole clove and one other

1081
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,580
thing, I forgot what it was.

1082
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,760
Wormwood.

1083
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,380
Yeah.

1084
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,600
And that's it.

1085
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,720
Thank you, Wormwood.

1086
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,120
That's the basic.

1087
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,140
It's like 30 bucks for 100 capsules or

1088
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,320
whatever.

1089
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:46,960
Do that.

1090
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,200
Start off with that.

1091
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,080
Go very mild.

1092
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,780
Start off.

1093
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,060
OK, start off mild.

1094
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,220
If you work a job or a job

1095
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,380
that you have to go to work from

1096
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,700
nine to five or be somewhere because you

1097
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,640
might get the shits.

1098
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,280
Right.

1099
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,480
And in a way that you don't expect.

1100
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:01,820
Yeah.

1101
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,780
Be careful with the Wormwood, though, because I

1102
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,420
used to be able to get that in

1103
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,120
whole and I could grind it myself.

1104
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,560
And it was a lot cheaper than buying

1105
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,020
a powder.

1106
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,600
And, you know, get it from a trusted

1107
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,000
source.

1108
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,260
This is very much when it's a powder.

1109
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,360
It takes in three days.

1110
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,880
It's oxidized just like coffee.

1111
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,600
Coffee connoisseurs ground the beans right before.

1112
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,940
Because if it's pre ground, it's oxidized.

1113
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,160
It just tastes flat.

1114
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,560
Well, that would be the reason why I

1115
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,700
wanted to grind it myself.

1116
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,840
The reason I'm suggesting what I'm doing is

1117
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,140
this is very, very mild.

1118
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,260
The next step up would require research and

1119
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,380
some self diagnosis.

1120
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,140
Right.

1121
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,360
The main thing about parasites is, believe it

1122
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,140
or not, most people now have them in

1123
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,820
their liver and they thread through your liver.

1124
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,600
Those don't come out very easy.

1125
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,600
Right.

1126
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,920
And if you if they try to, you

1127
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,560
can have a liver damage, which you can

1128
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,440
recover from.

1129
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,460
And by the way, anything that's not in

1130
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,980
your intestine your body created.

1131
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,060
That's a pretty scary thought.

1132
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,660
But for an example, OK, let's get off

1133
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,080
on this.

1134
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,900
You ever see surface dust mites on skin

1135
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,280
mites?

1136
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,380
Like when you show they show a picture

1137
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:08,860
of it.

1138
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,400
Oh, yeah.

1139
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,260
And it looks like some sci fi creature

1140
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,220
from another planet.

1141
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,820
And so that lives on your skin.

1142
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,140
Yeah.

1143
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,800
They show you the weird things that live

1144
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,760
on your eyebrows even.

1145
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,040
Right.

1146
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:17,500
The.

1147
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,060
Yeah.

1148
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,800
And you cannot get rid of those because

1149
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,100
they they form.

1150
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:25,160
They emerge from all the conditions on your

1151
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,940
on your body.

1152
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,740
And that freaks people out, especially if you're

1153
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,660
if you know about this.

1154
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,760
You just found out about this.

1155
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,240
All the pictures are tripped on LSD.

1156
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,260
You'd probably get like 80 grit sandpaper and

1157
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,320
sand all your skin off.

1158
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:35,540
Right.

1159
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,560
So, yeah, it's some crazy stuff.

1160
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,760
But anyway, these things are emergent.

1161
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,240
So the thing is, are you in harmony

1162
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,880
and are you in symbiosis with it?

1163
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,500
Is it causing harm and damage to you?

1164
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,160
Uh, everyone has them to a degree.

1165
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,180
Like I said, if they're not just in

1166
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,940
your intestines or stomach, your body created them.

1167
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:56,840
Now what?

1168
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:57,960
Now what?

1169
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:01,180
These things emerge from different conditions.

1170
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,120
Right.

1171
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,420
So the people in cold climates will have

1172
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:08,480
a different set of parasites than people in

1173
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,159
the tropics.

1174
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,139
Right.

1175
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,239
And vice versa.

1176
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,980
I mean, people in temperate areas and different

1177
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,860
ones in the northern hemisphere.

1178
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,739
If you think the earth is around different

1179
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:20,920
ones on the southern hemisphere or the southern

1180
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,500
plain, northern plain, these things are emergent.

1181
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,380
So most of the toxins that are things

1182
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,719
that are found in the blood, if not,

1183
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,120
well, all anything found in your blood, by

1184
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,880
the way, your body created.

1185
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,400
Right.

1186
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,000
It's a completely closed system.

1187
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:40,960
And when it's done, it's usefulness disintegrates and

1188
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,699
becomes energy.

1189
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,860
And it goes out through the appropriate organs,

1190
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,980
bladder, intestine, liver, kidney, you know, the urinary

1191
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,060
tract, which is the entire, they call the

1192
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,719
urinary tract, the entire system of kidneys and

1193
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,540
bladder and all that.

1194
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:59,760
But yeah, so don't, don't, uh, you have

1195
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,700
to self diagnosis is the key.

1196
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,180
You have to diagnose that.

1197
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:03,580
Right.

1198
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,040
Right.

1199
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,020
But I'll tell you that most, the majority

1200
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,600
of the stuff that is disabling to people

1201
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:13,080
are parasites and a metal in their bodies,

1202
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,020
thallium from old, uh, the amalgam fillings, they

1203
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,200
put some nasty chemicals in there, uh, and

1204
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,220
also not having proper dentistry.

1205
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,420
Uh, so yeah, this is a big topic.

1206
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,060
Um, I would study, if I were to

1207
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,800
get into this for whatever reason, the first

1208
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,760
thing I would do is research diagnosing, uh,

1209
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,940
parasites, not the parasites themselves with diagnosing a

1210
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,760
man or a woman's health condition, and then

1211
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,220
which parasite would be responsible for that.

1212
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:41,580
Right.

1213
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,820
And then how to test for that.

1214
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,160
But remember, I'm saying it again for the

1215
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,560
fifth time, if you find anything like in

1216
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,140
the liver or any of the organs or

1217
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,140
whatever, or suggest even in the brain that

1218
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,320
was created by your body because of what

1219
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,920
you eat, what you've been exposed to.

1220
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:58,480
Right.
