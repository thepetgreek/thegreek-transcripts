1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,440
Rated Y, Sonic Event 196, how you doing,

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:11,720
Greek?

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,400
How I'm doing, let's do it.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,480
You got some questions?

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,600
Yeah, let's do it.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,380
Okay, so I got things from the chat.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,700
I got stuff from the Patreon, so we'll

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,320
hit it all as quick and as best

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:22,900
as we can.

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,940
So, Greek, when you mentioned the inner voice

11
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,480
change-up, can screw up, is being double,

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,040
does the confusion go beyond God to life

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,380
partner?

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,160
Okay, you know what they're asking you?

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,120
I didn't get that one.

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,900
Yeah, they're kind of asking, okay, they're trying

17
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,960
to confuse you, but are they trying to

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,360
influence the things around you, like your partner,

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,920
other people in your life?

20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,720
Yeah, I'll stop right there without getting into

21
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,000
more stuff that I've gotten into.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,060
So I posted two videos in the, it's

23
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,640
Ocelli and the Greek Chitango, right?

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,260
Yeah, it's Ocelli and the Greek Rated Y.

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,780
OcelliandtheGreekChitango.com.

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,020
Yeah.

27
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,260
Dot Chitango dot com.

28
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,780
Website, I mean, a YouTube channel, everybody should

29
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,480
check out.

30
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:09,400
It's simple, it's called Lookout for Charlie, and

31
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,780
it's Lookout F.A., and then Charlie.

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,080
And he's been recording, he's an audio guy.

33
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:15,680
Okay.

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,720
And he's been looking at, you know, ambient

35
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,120
noise, you know, when you record it.

36
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,260
And he gets in there and he filters

37
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,840
out the common denominator, and there's voices.

38
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,520
There's always voices in the background, and he

39
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,920
has a spin on it and all that.

40
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,500
And what the thing that makes it so

41
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,760
profound, what he's doing, is that they react

42
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,180
to you.

43
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,900
So in other words, if you're hammering or

44
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,500
there's a dog barking, those voices get slightly

45
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:41,940
larger.

46
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,360
They adjust, and they're aimed at individuals.

47
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,120
And they're not, quote unquote, like the typical

48
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,560
used word, nice.

49
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,560
They're usually very negative.

50
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,360
And these things exist, and he's been finding

51
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,260
them in old movies.

52
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,420
It's not a new thing, like with harp

53
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,580
and all that, even though he does bring

54
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,120
that up.

55
00:01:59,340 --> 00:01:59,560
Right.

56
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,020
It's part of the artificial intelligence, the A

57
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,880
.I. that runs everything here doing that.

58
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,639
So the voices in your head, okay, that

59
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,720
I talk about are different, but are they

60
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,040
really?

61
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,440
How many times have you heard me say,

62
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,260
you don't see with your eyes, you see

63
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:14,940
with your brain.

64
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,100
You don't hear with your ears, you hear

65
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,700
with your brain.

66
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,440
You don't taste with your tongue, you taste

67
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,300
with your brain.

68
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,620
So everything, these are sensors, and sensors are,

69
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,320
what good are sensors without a controller?

70
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,480
So in essence, we're talking about the same

71
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:29,880
thing.

72
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,740
He believes that they're 100% man-made,

73
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,460
which I believe they are too, because if

74
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,680
you heard me say, the gods are men,

75
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,620
which is the, and the more, okay, the

76
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,580
more, let's just say radical whistleblowers tell you

77
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,280
that they meet these beings that call themselves

78
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,920
gods, and they're just people with tech.

79
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:47,600
Right.

80
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,120
How many times have I been saying that

81
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,380
for?

82
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,440
I've been saying that for decades.

83
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,820
Yeah, and I actually heard that a long

84
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,660
time ago from some very strange old man

85
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,440
that seemed oddly legit, even though they kind

86
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,980
of sounded crazy, even back then.

87
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,780
Oh, that's a good person to listen to.

88
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,860
That's usually the guy, you should listen, because

89
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,140
one way or another, even if they are

90
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,340
crazy, you're going to learn something.

91
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,720
Well, they're crazy based on what?

92
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,200
Well, but that's the thing.

93
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,740
Right now, I'm at the point where I

94
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,540
see pretty much everyone around me as being

95
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:13,940
crazy.

96
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,000
Well, right, but that's my point, is that

97
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,140
throw that away, and try and learn from

98
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,600
what you're observing, is all I'm saying.

99
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,300
It's kind of like, you know, what is

100
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,000
it, walk silently and carry a big stick?

101
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,340
I walk silently now and carry a yardstick.

102
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,320
I just measure everything around me, and nothing,

103
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,500
everything's falling short.

104
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,520
So what you do is you lower your

105
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,240
expectations.

106
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,360
There was a thing on, was it Mad

107
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,620
TV?

108
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,100
Lower expectations.

109
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,640
Lower expectations.

110
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,580
And then you realize that, hey, fuck it,

111
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,380
you know, can I use that medical term?

112
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,620
Sure, I've used it a lot.

113
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,940
Yeah, and you just got to say, hey,

114
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,320
when is this all going to end, you

115
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:46,560
know?

116
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,180
Usually, if I walk into a movie, and

117
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,180
it's not a good movie, I walk out

118
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,140
and just walk around the neighborhood or whatever,

119
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,880
till, you know, whoever I went with finishes

120
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,620
watching that piece of shit, and a movie

121
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,500
or whatever, crap.

122
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,840
But you can't really walk out of this

123
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,100
movie too easy, can you?

124
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,940
Well, I mean, see, now there's a thing.

125
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,720
You could, because psychologically you can kind of

126
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,420
tune out and go into another direction.

127
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,040
Oh, yeah, what do they call it?

128
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:11,620
Catatonia.

129
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,680
I've tried that.

130
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,780
20 years ago, 30 years ago, I think

131
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,579
I sat in a room still for about

132
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,000
8 hours, and that was about it.

133
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
I don't need to do that again.

134
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,400
Okay, fair enough.

135
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,800
But I mean, there are ways where you

136
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,100
can sort of adjust and go into, you

137
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,740
know, some people say that there's tech stuff

138
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,400
when they go into virtual reality or they're

139
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,380
playing games or whatever.

140
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,320
That's their escape, right?

141
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,840
Yeah, that's people watching these piece of shit

142
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,260
movies.

143
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:36,640
Yeah.

144
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:37,700
Okay.

145
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,840
I can't do that.

146
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,580
So anyway, I don't want to get into

147
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,260
subjectiveness.

148
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,700
You know what I say about that, right?

149
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,940
You've got to talk about things that help

150
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,980
others in a general sense or generally specific.

151
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,720
Like, for example, we'll get off the voices

152
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,260
because I didn't get any comments on Lookout

153
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,100
for Charlie.

154
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,240
I almost thought he's got a little bit

155
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,300
of a Jersey twinge to his voice, but

156
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,140
it turns out he's not Jersey.

157
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,420
He's not too far.

158
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,380
Baltimore, I think.

159
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,520
I'm going to say Baltimore.

160
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,200
Baltimore, I mean, you know, is a half

161
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,580
-hour drive depending on where you go.

162
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,420
To Baltimore?

163
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,200
From where?

164
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,300
Yeah, from Jersey.

165
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,900
No, no, that's not a half-hour.

166
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,360
That's Maryland.

167
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,180
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

168
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,840
That's a ways away.

169
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,360
Yeah, I'm sorry.

170
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,260
What I was thinking, no, it's an hour

171
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,860
and a half if you're hitting the gas.

172
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,800
You're thinking of Delaware from the tip of

173
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,120
Jersey.

174
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:25,880
Yeah, that's right.

175
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,040
Don't worry about it.

176
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,140
Look.

177
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,740
No, okay.

178
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,260
My geography is messed up today.

179
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,540
I've been building sunshades all day outside.

180
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,960
Well, let me just, let me tail on

181
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,840
to this voice thing real fast, though, because

182
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,100
I have a question for you because I

183
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,800
used to hear things and I used to

184
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,580
record a lot.

185
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,880
I just made many, many tapes of many,

186
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,420
many things.

187
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
I used to record interviews.

188
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,580
I recorded sound outside.

189
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,340
I used to just enjoy hearing sound and

190
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,180
splitting things up and actually kind of like

191
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,060
analyzing it in my own brain, right?

192
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,740
And I used to do this with the

193
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,880
magnetic cassettes and later on.

194
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,640
Oh, but hold on.

195
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,600
What he's getting into is none of it

196
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,200
is subject, all of it is controlled, and

197
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,400
it's aimed at the listener.

198
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,440
It's very interesting.

199
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,440
Now, it's very hard to find a quiet

200
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:14,860
spot.

201
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,460
Also, you'll find these voices everywhere.

202
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,080
And what I'm saying, though, they're not just

203
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,480
in your head, like I've been saying.

204
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,040
He's saying is that they're in the ambient

205
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,680
field and it's okay.

206
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,420
Well, that's what I was getting at here.

207
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,620
That's what I was trying to get at

208
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,180
is that they're actually in a lot of

209
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,640
different fields because I discovered extra things in

210
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,660
broadcast and people said, oh, no, that's just

211
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,580
channels bleeding over.

212
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,120
And I'm like, no, that's not possible because

213
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,960
when you go from one frequency to the

214
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,160
other and the voice remains the same, that

215
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,260
to me indicates it's all along that type

216
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,920
of frequency.

217
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,740
In this case, if you can get semantics

218
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,460
out of the voice, you can actually hear

219
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,100
what they're saying and it's relevant to the

220
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,520
subject matter that the observers, let's say, or

221
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,400
whoever's in the environment is pertaining to them.

222
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,220
It's very kind of spooky, but it's not

223
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:02,800
a surprise.

224
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,480
If you've been listening to what we've been

225
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,800
talking about, especially since the old ONG, you

226
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,580
shouldn't be surprised.

227
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,500
But I see what he did is he's

228
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,380
able to record what the artificial intelligence that

229
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,140
runs this place is doing.

230
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,520
And I think it's fascinating.

231
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,560
And I think the more you know about

232
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,880
it, the more you can, if you're intelligent

233
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,800
enough, is to, how would you say, defend

234
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,540
yourself, right?

235
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,560
Okay, but what I used to pick up,

236
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,560
though, personally, was gibberish.

237
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,900
And I know that people have found other

238
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,460
bits of gibberish where they pick out a

239
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:34,720
phrase.

240
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,540
Like, you know how people find stuff in

241
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,180
the backgrounds of Disney movies and they go,

242
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:38,900
did you hear that?

243
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,380
Well, that's more effective.

244
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,920
That's why TV commercials turned into gibberish, because

245
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,960
they found that if they played gibberish, it's

246
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,380
more memorable subconsciously.

247
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,760
Well, there's no subconscious, but it's the part

248
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,620
that it gets past the filter, which is

249
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,280
your senses, right?

250
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,680
You know, this is an entire sonic, if

251
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,620
you want to delve on how the senses

252
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,120
work.

253
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,620
Fooling the senses is the opposite of what

254
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,380
people think.

255
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,100
Like, if you've got to fool the eye,

256
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,180
you've got to be really fast.

257
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,860
No, you don't, because you're not fooling the

258
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,060
eye.

259
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,060
You're fooling the brain, right?

260
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,420
So the brain has to follow a logic

261
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:13,900
train.

262
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,220
I'm saying that, and I'm biting my tongue,

263
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,920
because if you didn't met anyone recently who

264
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,280
could follow any kind of train of logic.

265
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:21,540
Anyway.

266
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,280
Well, no, not logic, but the brain looks

267
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:23,980
for patterns.

268
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,340
Forget about logic.

269
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:25,680
Yeah, exactly.

270
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,340
It just looks for patterns.

271
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,380
Well, it's going back into the previous files,

272
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,080
right?

273
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:29,620
Right.

274
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,200
So, like, if you tell someone, you know

275
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,600
what a house is, and right away they're

276
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,059
going to think of the stick drawings they

277
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,419
did when they were in kindergarten of a

278
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,720
house all the way to the house they

279
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,120
live in.

280
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:37,860
Pretty much, yeah.

281
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,700
And if you think, you know, and they're

282
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,320
stuck in that.

283
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,680
And the brain likes to conserve energy, so

284
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,800
it reduces it to the simplest thing of

285
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,460
a house, a car, or a voice, even

286
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,440
when you say a voice.

287
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,380
Right?

288
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,100
There's a psychology to it.

289
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,980
Years ago, in the 90s up until the

290
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,500
early 2000s, they found that if they, in

291
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,040
public spaces, made an announcement, they had someone

292
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,140
with, in America, with a British accent, because

293
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,400
Americans were always enthralled with someone with a

294
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,060
British accent.

295
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,420
They would always stop and listen.

296
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,020
Oh, you and I talked about this many

297
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,320
times.

298
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,100
I told you, PBS was loaded with it

299
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,440
because it was meant to be the go

300
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,120
-to for you to educate yourself, and an

301
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,520
educated voice had a British accent.

302
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,300
Yeah, sound more refined.

303
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,120
Right, exactly.

304
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,760
And, yeah, so the whole thing is you

305
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,760
reduce the mind.

306
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,360
You find out, and this is what you

307
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,820
call, what are they called?

308
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:25,740
Trends.

309
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,360
It changes.

310
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,580
It changes, right?

311
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,800
Like, years ago, for example, you know, I

312
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,940
met an old person, I'll show you how

313
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,460
trends work, and because we lose certain trends,

314
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
we lose certain trains of thought.

315
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,620
When I was growing up, maybe I was

316
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,660
in grade school, and the Kennedy assassination came

317
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:42,820
up.

318
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,880
We're talking about 1974.

319
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,100
And there was an old guy around.

320
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,000
He says, yeah, they killed Kennedy because he

321
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,740
was the first president not to wear a

322
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,240
hat.

323
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:51,940
Right?

324
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,960
Because whenever you left your house and you

325
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,300
were a man or a male, you wore

326
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:55,640
a hat.

327
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,460
You didn't leave without your head covered, right?

328
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,320
And to see someone on the podium without

329
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,500
a hat in public, you put the haberdashers

330
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,160
out of business.

331
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,760
By the way, if you don't know what

332
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,920
a haberdasher is, someone who works with hats.

333
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,240
And they got together and they paid the

334
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,000
mob to kill him.

335
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,440
And this is what I was told when

336
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,380
I was, like, eight years old, 10 years

337
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,500
old or something like that.

338
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,000
And that stuck in the back of my

339
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,480
head when I hear everybody talking about the

340
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,020
Kennedy assassination.

341
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,180
They say, yeah, they killed him because he

342
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,340
was the first president not to wear hats.

343
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,420
Everyone looks at me like, what the hell

344
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,620
does that have to do with anything?

345
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,040
And I don't sit there and explain it

346
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,020
like I just did, right?

347
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,240
So if you lose the idea of what

348
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,960
these trends were like, you could make a

349
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,500
statement that sounds utterly ridiculous like that, right?

350
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,360
If I didn't explain it, it would probably

351
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,000
sound utterly ridiculous today.

352
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,800
Even to older people, you have to give

353
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,380
an explanation.

354
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,120
So what happens is we tend to fall

355
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,800
into things that are pieces of information that

356
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,100
are missing that sound ridiculous.

357
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,300
Like, how many times have you been told

358
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,040
the America's the richest country in the world?

359
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,800
And you go to someone and say, you

360
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,960
know, the U.S. has been bankrupt.

361
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,840
They're like, I get out of here.

362
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,280
We're the richest country in the world.

363
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,180
What are you talking about?

364
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,940
Right, right.

365
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:02,580
Yeah.

366
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,520
So it's all backwards.

367
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,660
So not only are they confused with misinformation,

368
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,260
they're taking partial under-informed, misinformed stuff and

369
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,420
forming it as their basis.

370
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,800
And then you have trends thrown in.

371
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,340
Okay, so what I'm trying to say is

372
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,920
they have nothing to lean on, the average

373
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,040
human, unless you go to an old culture,

374
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,260
right?

375
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,640
I mean, like a place in the Pacific

376
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,700
Rim Islands where they haven't been affected in

377
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,780
500 years, right?

378
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,780
Maybe 300 years or whatever, right?

379
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,740
Places like that, those people have a much

380
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,160
more firmer grip on reality, believe it or

381
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,800
not, right?

382
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,040
Like people, they're calling them Bush people, believe

383
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,400
it or not.

384
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,360
They have a much firmer grip on reality.

385
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,240
Yeah, so anyway, I would be curious to

386
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,500
see with – because I did a whole

387
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,340
bunch of mental outlines.

388
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,560
If you do check out Lookout for Charlie,

389
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,480
that's Lookout, F.A., and then Charlie on

390
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,300
YouTube, I would like to ask him to

391
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,580
go in a primitive – why would we

392
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,260
call them primitive?

393
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,080
Oh my gosh, I got to slap myself

394
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,580
for that.

395
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,560
A basic society that hasn't been affected by

396
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,460
Westernism, that hasn't changed in old Bush people,

397
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,300
and see what they're being told.

398
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,680
Because I think it's subjective based on your

399
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,080
culture.

400
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,720
But anyway, and also it's based on the

401
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,080
individual.

402
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,060
Like one of the questions – go ahead.

403
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,940
Well, I was going to bridge this with

404
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,000
something really odd that somebody sent me and

405
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,640
wanted to ask you a question about it,

406
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,380
because they found this article, Evidence of Ancient

407
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,120
Ritual – this is the headline from the

408
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,260
article – Evidence of an Ancient Ritual to,

409
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,140
quote, kill, end quote, the dead and destroy

410
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,360
their tombs in a final feast 4,000

411
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,800
years ago found in Crete.

412
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,500
Now, the question – Well, if we know

413
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,240
anything more than 200 years of suspect, right,

414
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,260
how accurate it is, what's the source of

415
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,780
that term?

416
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,300
Do they find that inscribed on something in

417
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,280
linear A or linear B, because that's the

418
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,900
language they used, or what?

419
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,160
Well, they did a whole thing on the

420
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,440
island of Crete, an excavation, and they found

421
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,640
a graveyard where they did weird things with

422
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,700
tombs and this and that.

423
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,820
And therefore, the person wants to know, you

424
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,620
know, what is the lawful burial ritual anyway?

425
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,820
Because it's a little confusing based on what

426
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,720
they see in the text.

427
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,060
And they were reading this article saying, you

428
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,640
know, look, the Greeks had all kinds of

429
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,800
odd things going on at different time periods,

430
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,900
and pointing to this article as part of

431
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,360
the evidence.

432
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,060
Of course, this is archaeologists and anthropologists interpreting

433
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,440
what they found when they dig things up.

434
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,760
Yeah, and they're not going to tell us

435
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,200
– you know, there's over 1,000 archaeological

436
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,400
digs all over the world going on, and

437
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,080
they're voracious.

438
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,740
I mean, they're really going after it.

439
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,840
But they don't report anything, because everything they're

440
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,000
finding always leads to some kind of human

441
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,980
sacrifice, some really grim, macabre shit.

442
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,160
So why would they keep putting that, right,

443
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,640
in there, right?

444
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,520
Well, this is a weird thing about destroying

445
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,680
the tombs afterwards.

446
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,200
Like, you leave the tombs of people there

447
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,840
for a little while.

448
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,580
But they were wondering if there is a

449
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,440
lawful practice that's simple about this.

450
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,180
It's lawful as to do with your deity.

451
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,680
So if you're an atheist, you go by

452
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,160
the laws of the state, right?

453
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:06,840
Of course.

454
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,460
So, you know, like red meat's bad for

455
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,200
you this decade, next decade.

456
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,940
Sugar's bad for you the next decade.

457
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:15,320
So right now, here's your three options.

458
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,420
Cremate, bury, or now they have composting, and

459
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,820
you have to do that with the body

460
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,380
as the people that are left behind.

461
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,380
You've got to, you know, finish up their

462
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,380
business, so to speak, with that.

463
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,360
Well, also, it's in every culture.

464
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,460
Every culture, hidden, is a powerful person is

465
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,980
usually – they eat some of his flesh

466
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,760
to get his power, right, because the flesh

467
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,320
carries the spirit and all that.

468
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,600
This isn't found in every culture.

469
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,840
I mean, but, you know, it's not publicly

470
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,280
known.

471
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,220
But, no, look, I think burial would be

472
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,520
the way to go because people say, what

473
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,160
about cremation?

474
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,860
Well, you burn garbage, I said, right?

475
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,380
What do you think of cremation, great guy?

476
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,920
You burn garbage, right?

477
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,380
So, I mean, then you could take that

478
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,160
several ways.

479
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,580
You know, is cremation dishonoring or whatever?

480
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,480
I think it matters to a certain degree.

481
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,900
I think the transition – I've gone into

482
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,820
it not too much.

483
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,160
Maybe I should in the future.

484
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,400
What happens when you die without – how

485
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,600
can you talk about something that you haven't

486
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,500
experienced, right?

487
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,780
It's all supposition, right?

488
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,100
Right.

489
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,160
Hypothesis.

490
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:19,900
Hypothesis.

491
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,080
But you can imagine, you know, it's a

492
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,340
form of drowning, but you're drowning in gas,

493
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,880
you know, air, instead of drowning – like,

494
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:32,340
suddenly, imagine a fish is drowning in water

495
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,780
where he was just fine the rest of

496
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,380
his life.

497
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,680
So, it's no different than suffocating, right, without

498
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,440
the pressure.

499
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,360
You know, that's why you always wish a

500
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,540
painless death on whoever.

501
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,100
What do they usually say in the film?

502
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,760
He didn't feel any pain.

503
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,680
He went peacefully.

504
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,540
Yeah, he went peacefully, yeah.

505
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,260
Because typically people are kicking and screaming when

506
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:58,900
it hurts, right?

507
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,280
Typically.

508
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,400
Not always.

509
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,480
So, yeah, I don't know, man.

510
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,680
It's a tricky thing.

511
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,880
But, yeah, very rarely do I get something

512
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,200
I'd recommend, other than a rated Y, is

513
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,860
look out for Charlie.

514
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:13,940
Did I bring him up?

515
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,160
Yeah.

516
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,880
Look out for F.A. Charlie.

517
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,820
Check out his work, because he's one of

518
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,320
these evidentially based guys.

519
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,000
You know, so he'll go over an audio

520
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,340
and say, well, if you think this is

521
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,000
just whatever, check this out, right?

522
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,080
If you think it's just a fluke or

523
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,340
whatever, it's too consistent.

524
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,760
It's in the background.

525
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,280
He leans a little too heavily on it

526
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,240
being current man-made technology, but he's finding

527
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,460
the stuff from 50 years ago, 30 years

528
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,220
ago in recordings.

529
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,080
Not all recordings.

530
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,720
It seems to be wiped out when they

531
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,680
do digital stuff.

532
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,940
You have to have a good analog recording

533
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,340
or something that's not online.

534
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,100
It's filtered out.

535
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,020
But anyway, you got any other questions?

536
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,040
Yeah, let's see.

537
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,940
You seem to hint that you'd be accountable

538
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,740
in the afterlife, but you also say that

539
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,200
you were left on this planet as a

540
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:01,800
shipping error.

541
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,520
Yeah, absolutely.

542
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,480
So why would you be held accountable for

543
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,300
not assisting space heaters, in quotes?

544
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,560
Those of us among the space heaters, if

545
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:14,000
he's being here, was a mistake anyway, or

546
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,140
was it all just a story slash joke?

547
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,119
I did not understand.

548
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:17,579
Thanks.

549
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,500
It goes any way you want to take

550
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:19,920
it.

551
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:20,800
Okay.

552
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,700
You know how the mobsters, okay, when they

553
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,819
sit around and they're drinking, they start insulting

554
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,319
each other.

555
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,440
They say, no, no, I was just joking.

556
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,140
I was just joking.

557
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,320
And they try to take it to a

558
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:28,600
limit.

559
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,320
Right.

560
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,200
Where then the guy says, okay, now you're

561
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,520
not joking.

562
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,700
You say, all right, now I'm going to

563
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,280
kick your ass.

564
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,320
And with all due respect.

565
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,500
Yeah.

566
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,660
I was just joking.

567
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,320
That's too many jokes, man, in a row.

568
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,420
Now you're starting to say what you really

569
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:42,940
mean, right?

570
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,140
So I don't know.

571
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:45,740
I don't know.

572
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,220
Okay, here's the thing.

573
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,320
Someone calls me up, and he says he

574
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,320
has a model car or whatever, and it's

575
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,100
making this noise, and this is what happens

576
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:53,580
when I drive.

577
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,200
And I can tell him what's wrong with

578
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,980
it over the phone.

579
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,320
And about 75 to 90% of the

580
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,900
time, I'm correct, right?

581
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,780
This is what you need.

582
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,320
A mechanic says, no, no, no, it's a

583
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,000
$20 part.

584
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,680
It's not $900.

585
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,340
Right.

586
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,200
You could probably do it yourself in 15

587
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,520
minutes.

588
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,060
I always like to be – I tell

589
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,200
people that are afraid of working on cars,

590
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,800
if you can change a light bulb, you

591
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,660
could pretty much do most of the stuff

592
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,780
you need to do to fix a car.

593
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,140
And I can attest to that because, actually,

594
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,920
I'm somebody who doesn't do much at all,

595
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,400
and you got me to replace the starter.

596
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,040
You know, in a car.

597
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,920
If you can change a light bulb, you

598
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,900
can work on your car.

599
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,200
Right.

600
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,700
And it was pretty simple, and it did

601
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,780
not take you that long.

602
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,380
It did not take me that long.

603
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,600
But, you know, other things happened that made

604
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,360
it irretrievable.

605
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,000
So what I'm saying, the same thing applies

606
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,320
here.

607
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,240
What I'm doing is I'm not there.

608
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,660
I mean, I wasn't there when they made

609
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,680
the decree or whatever.

610
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,480
Maybe, you know, I doubt it's completely random.

611
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,240
But, you know, even random machines are not

612
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,540
random.

613
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,240
But, you know, randomness is one of the

614
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,020
hardest things for them to figure out because

615
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,200
the more they look at it, the more

616
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,220
they see a sense of order.

617
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,880
So scrap that word.

618
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,880
But for whatever reason, for me, analyzing the

619
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,640
situation over the phone, what I'm doing here,

620
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,300
what I've done and what I could be

621
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,920
doing and all these other possibilities is what

622
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,720
I've come up with.

623
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,380
I'm not supposed to be here.

624
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,620
Right, because there's a lot of people that

625
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,980
come here, are sent here to either have

626
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,260
a good time, be wealthy, which doesn't necessarily

627
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,140
mean you have a good time, or to

628
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,260
suffer pain and agony and distress.

629
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,320
I just simply don't care.

630
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,800
I just see it all as being so

631
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,200
worthless.

632
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,960
And then, of course, you take in these

633
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,100
things of natural beauty, right?

634
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,460
Because, you know, you look at a bed

635
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,960
of flowers that came up naturally.

636
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,200
Wildflowers are so beautiful, a sunset, whatever, whatever.

637
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,460
Whatever you enjoy in nature.

638
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,240
It's only a short time that you can

639
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,060
enjoy that because you say, OK, screw this

640
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:42,520
city life.

641
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,860
I'm going to go live in nature.

642
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,480
Whoever I've recommended to, I said don't because

643
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,980
you're going to find out everything in nature

644
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,640
wants to kill you, no matter what part

645
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,440
of nature you go.

646
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,780
Jungle, desert, temperate, everything there wants to kill

647
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:53,980
you.

648
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,680
So what I'm trying to say is a

649
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,720
temporary overbrush and then take in the beautiful

650
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,540
wonder of nature.

651
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,100
Yeah, just temporary because once you get into

652
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,600
it, you're going to see it's actually against

653
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,260
you also.

654
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,140
So everything seems to be that way with

655
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,500
a sense of worthlessness attached to it.

656
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,340
So then there's just taking up time.

657
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,600
It's like, OK, all right, what's next?

658
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,300
And, oh, yeah, that's so predictable or that

659
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,060
is so whatever.

660
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,720
So you just take each breath, each step,

661
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,400
each whatever.

662
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,160
But what I see going on, just like

663
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,380
when someone calls me and they want to

664
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,520
know what's wrong with their car, I've done

665
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,300
it with myself.

666
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,420
You know, remote, try to be as remote

667
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,040
as possible.

668
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,680
And I'm like, oh, I must have been

669
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,860
sent here on a shipping error because none

670
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,620
of this shit is.

671
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,140
And just put it this way.

672
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,720
I have such a unique perspective on just

673
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,240
pretty much everything that it doesn't jive with,

674
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,580
like we said, anything here.

675
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,040
And I won't say it unless I could

676
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,020
dig it up and say, hey, check this

677
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,520
out, man.

678
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:54,620
You know, look at it.

679
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,780
You figure you've been sent to the wrong

680
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,220
neighborhood.

681
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,800
I think I've been sent to the wrong

682
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,140
time.

683
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,780
I think I've been sent to the wrong

684
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,380
address, but in the right neighborhood.

685
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,400
So that's why I'm half miserable half the

686
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:05,620
time.

687
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,420
Anyways.

688
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,720
Oh, OK.

689
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,220
All right.

690
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,360
Well, it's the second half that counts usually.

691
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,360
Usually.

692
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:11,940
All right.

693
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,460
Anyways, here's one.

694
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,240
They were asking.

695
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,820
Basically, it's a long thing.

696
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,620
But, you know, like you have a day

697
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,500
where all of the electronics seem to be

698
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,400
working against you.

699
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,420
They're either breaking or malfunctioning or giving you

700
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,840
trouble and all this kind of thing.

701
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,680
And everybody mentions to this guy Mercury retrograde.

702
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,480
And he goes, oh, come on.

703
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,240
So he wonders, you know, is it spiritual,

704
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,880
electrical, a matrix glitch?

705
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,900
And, oh, by the way, what are your

706
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,340
thoughts on what some call Western astrology?

707
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,620
I know it's all airy-fairy, but is

708
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,140
it just a version of something that might

709
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,780
have been valid information in its original form?

710
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,780
Yeah, but if they make it believe.

711
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,080
What's that thing when enough people believe it

712
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,720
and manifests?

713
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,240
Egregores or what do they call them?

714
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,380
Yeah, I think it's an egregore.

715
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,860
If enough people, like the stick man.

716
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,480
I don't know if it's a fictional character

717
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,900
and people start seeing it, right?

718
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,560
Oh, yeah, yeah.

719
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,640
What do you call it?

720
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,200
Slenderman.

721
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,600
Slenderman, yeah.

722
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,200
So enough people believe it, it works.

723
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,560
But, look, I've seen, I've witnessed this where

724
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,140
they blame it on Mercury, and then when

725
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,500
Mercury's out, they blame it on Pluto.

726
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,820
So which one is it?

727
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,540
Just say it's all the planets affecting everything

728
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,700
all the time.

729
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,540
And shut up, right, is what I tell

730
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,480
the astrologers.

731
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,020
But they have been quite accurate.

732
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,240
I've had a reading by Santos Bonacci, believe

733
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,500
it or not, a long time ago, with

734
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,980
a minimum amount of information.

735
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,520
He wanted the birth date, full name, and

736
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:27,920
all that.

737
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,780
And it was really accurate.

738
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:36,020
I mean, in terms of, like, conditions, things

739
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,880
that attend to, whatever, without telling him.

740
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,020
So, yeah, whatever.

741
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,320
Santos has some interesting insights, but I'll tell

742
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:44,640
you something.

743
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,340
Once he started getting into the urine drinking

744
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,400
thing, I was out of there.

745
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,400
Drinking, yeah.

746
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,380
Well, he's a little too excited.

747
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,160
You know when people are excited about getting

748
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,840
new information?

749
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,280
Right.

750
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,280
It's good, but don't be.

751
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,080
If you're too excited, it's going to show,

752
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,120
and you're going to overstep.

753
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:57,700
Right.

754
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,600
You're going to overcompensate for it.

755
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,080
Because when you find out it's not what

756
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,000
you were so excited about, how do you

757
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,120
remedy that now, right?

758
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,680
Oh, I'm not into that anymore.

759
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,220
No.

760
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,320
But Santos Bonacci was one of the few.

761
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,660
He was on American Freedom Radio.

762
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,060
You know the history of American Freedom Radio.

763
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,020
And I used to call in, and he

764
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,300
had me as a guest, and people were

765
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,680
like, oh, I've never heard this stuff before.

766
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,740
So that was why I got vocal.

767
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,140
But anyway.

768
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,280
I was part of that history, too, and

769
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,460
Santos, I had a little thing with him,

770
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:26,680
too.

771
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,260
You were on another thing.

772
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,960
You were doing something else, I think, and

773
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,780
then you came back in when Vinny Eastwood

774
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,480
went, I don't know.

775
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,700
And Danny was a good proponent.

776
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,580
He said you and I would make a

777
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,360
good match, which is kind of true for

778
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:39,680
all this.

779
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,540
It's long-lasting.

780
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,280
It has worked out sonically.

781
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,340
Sonically, yeah.

782
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:44,960
Right.

783
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,600
But to go back to the rest of

784
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,240
the question, there was a second part.

785
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,280
The other part was more interesting, other than

786
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:51,820
the astrology.

787
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,600
What was it?

788
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,800
Oh, about all the electronics kind of turning

789
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,040
against you all at once.

790
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,160
It seems like a thing that happens every

791
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,660
now and then.

792
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,300
So what do you think that is?

793
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,840
Because everybody tells them Mercury retrograde, which led

794
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,000
to this.

795
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,300
Take it as what Archaic Brashear talks about

796
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,380
as a pattern break.

797
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,800
And welcome it.

798
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,580
For example, when I was building my first

799
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,560
prototypes, when I say prototype, like a thing

800
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,340
you can go and present and demonstrate, you

801
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,000
know, a loudspeaker.

802
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,920
Every day something was breaking that's totally abnormal.

803
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,960
Like I did laundry one day, and I

804
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,380
take the laundry out of the washing machine.

805
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,980
There's a puddle of water under the washing

806
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,300
machine.

807
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,380
Oh, my gosh.

808
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,460
You can't just say, I'll fix that later,

809
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:30,960
right?

810
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,000
Things would break.

811
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,140
Life fixture would break.

812
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,380
I mean, it's been there for 20 years.

813
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,000
It finally decides to break the next day.

814
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,540
The car doesn't start.

815
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,440
I'm at a parking lot.

816
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,820
The car doesn't start, right?

817
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,100
I just decided, you know, and then I

818
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,140
get out and I hit the starter.

819
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,300
It wasn't the starter at all.

820
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,360
I had a little bit of an oil

821
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,880
leak, and the oil leak went on the

822
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,480
starter solenoid and prevented a contact.

823
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,860
So I cleaned that, took care of the

824
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,340
oil leak.

825
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,000
And every day, just about every day, it

826
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,280
was something unusual.

827
00:24:58,740 --> 00:24:59,060
Something else, yeah.

828
00:24:59,680 --> 00:24:59,880
Okay.

829
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,380
It's like imagine as unusual as this.

830
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,640
You just bought a brand-new pair of

831
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,360
shoes, and a week later they're totally worn

832
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:05,580
out.

833
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,960
You're like, how could that be possible?

834
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:07,460
Right.

835
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,180
These things last for years, you know?

836
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:09,540
Right.

837
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,620
So, you know, good shoes.

838
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,040
And things like that, very, very strange stuff.

839
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,480
So, yeah, I'd lift my arm, shake my

840
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,500
fist at the sky and at the ground,

841
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,680
and yell out a bunch of medical terms,

842
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,300
and then go back to what I was

843
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:22,660
doing.

844
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,020
But when I went back to what I

845
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,740
was doing, I was refreshed, and I was

846
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,060
actually making even more improvements that I had

847
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,040
not thought of before.

848
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,260
So this is the, all right, what did

849
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:31,980
I just say?

850
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,980
You could have been replaced when you got

851
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,400
lemons.

852
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,360
You're right.

853
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,100
Got you.

854
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,160
Yeah, you killed the bastard who sent you

855
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,620
all the lemons.

856
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,740
No, I mean, you make lemons.

857
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,420
Yeah, right.

858
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:40,940
I got you.

859
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:41,580
I got you.

860
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:41,780
Yeah.

861
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,360
So take it as a positive break.

862
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:44,920
I got you.

863
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,400
By the way, someone asked me also about

864
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:47,920
Assyria.

865
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,940
This is very interesting.

866
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,360
Let's go back to archaics.

867
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,560
There's a lot of palindromes, like Abraham was

868
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,200
born in 1947 BC, and Israel was founded

869
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,240
in 1947 AD, right?

870
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,000
So these palindromes between BC and AD.

871
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,740
The other day I put in what happened

872
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:11,080
in the year 2025 BC, and guess what

873
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,560
came up?

874
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,600
Assyria reformed.

875
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,240
Oh, okay.

876
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,060
Yeah.

877
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,080
So I've been saying for a long time

878
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,240
that Assyria will start to form, if not

879
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,580
be formed, by 2025 or around 2025.

880
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,060
So I just found that to be like

881
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,340
a punch in the eye, maybe?

882
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,820
Better than a punch in the nuts.

883
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,960
A punch in the nuts is the worst

884
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,660
thing for a guy.

885
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,440
Vagina, you could punch a vagina.

886
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,220
I could take it.

887
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,320
But for a woman, it would be a

888
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,600
punch in the breast or a punch in

889
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,220
the nuts for a guy.

890
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,220
It wasn't that bad.

891
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,820
Listen, a punch in the nuts can ruin

892
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,560
your day, okay?

893
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,800
A punch in the eye, you can get

894
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,000
over it.

895
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,340
It'll ruin their day.

896
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,300
Yeah.

897
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,080
But yeah, because you don't want them attached

898
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,700
to your body when they're feeling that way,

899
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:48,980
right?

900
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:49,420
Exactly.

901
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,920
Remember the song, Detachable Penis?

902
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,540
Do you remember that?

903
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,960
King Missile, yes.

904
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,920
Yeah, yeah.

905
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,560
I was walking down Avenue A, I was

906
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,080
missing, and I saw it on the sidewalk.

907
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,760
Because you have to know East Village at

908
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,140
the time.

909
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,300
There's a guy shoving it on a blanket,

910
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,360
and I talked him down.

911
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,700
Yeah, I used to buy lipos.

912
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,460
I mean, because I need some lipos.

913
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,160
My favorite part is you talked him down

914
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,280
like $3 in the discussion.

915
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:15,920
Yeah.

916
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,220
Yeah.

917
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,640
This is what?

918
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,560
It was like 1980s you're talking about?

919
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,360
Something like that, yeah.

920
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,440
Oh, okay.

921
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,380
My gosh, that was 40 years ago.

922
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,640
All right.

923
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,920
But the Subway bulbs, that's from the Subway.

924
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,540
Don't buy it, because they're left-hand threaded.

925
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,940
They used to steal them from the Subway.

926
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,460
When you take lipos out of the Subway,

927
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,280
they're left-hand threaded.

928
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,500
They won't thread onto your fixtures, which are

929
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,220
right-hand threaded.

930
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,680
So I was like, oh, the bulbs don't

931
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:38,880
fit.

932
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,580
I said, let me check it out.

933
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,580
I know I've been working with mechanics my

934
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,840
whole life, and I look at the thread.

935
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,320
He doesn't hold it up in front of

936
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:44,420
you.

937
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,120
It's pointing to the left.

938
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,040
It's a left-hand thread.

939
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,240
Right.

940
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,220
And that's left-hand thread, because they're stolen

941
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:49,940
from the Subway.

942
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,360
And you won't be able to buy a

943
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,000
left-hand socket.

944
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,880
Anyway, that's from detachable penis.

945
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,900
But anyway, back to the Assyria, 2025 BC.

946
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:58,440
Right.

947
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,580
It was like a punch in the eye.

948
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,200
I was like, ooh.

949
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,200
See, the more information you get, like by

950
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,160
listening to archaics and Jason Brashear's getting a

951
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,600
different perspective and all this.

952
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,380
And even like Santos Bonacci, he's big into

953
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:09,840
astrology.

954
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,640
It can be accurate for you, but it

955
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,460
seems to work more accurately for individuals than

956
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,760
for a collective, like the electronics going bad

957
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,240
for Mercury.

958
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,780
So there are certain things that you have

959
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:23,100
to learn to apply that works for you.

960
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,500
And I hate to say it that way,

961
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,500
because I like to talk about things that

962
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,920
work across the board as well for people.

963
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,900
Like, for example, the most exciting thing that's

964
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,320
happened to me in the past six months

965
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,920
other than the audio and stuff with the

966
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,760
water, is finding out that getting rid of

967
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,960
BO in your laundry, fresh clean laundry, it

968
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,980
still has BO when you put it in

969
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,900
the dryer, is by changing your soap.

970
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:46,460
Right.

971
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,880
That works.

972
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,600
I just found a bunch of clothes that

973
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,500
I always put away, you know, washed and

974
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:50,820
all that.

975
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,140
And they had like a BO on them,

976
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,440
and I washed them in a new soap

977
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,060
that I got, and the BO went away.

978
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,620
I just gave that advice to somebody last

979
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,480
week, because we talked about this about a

980
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,420
week and a half ago or something.

981
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,320
Yeah.

982
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,940
And I gave that advice, and yeah, it

983
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,220
worked.

984
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,580
Yeah, it does.

985
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,440
Because I found that.

986
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,020
Now, if you go with regular science, they

987
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,260
tell you it's bacteria and all that causes

988
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:10,680
that smell.

989
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,240
Okay, it's fine.

990
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,360
But where does the bacteria come from?

991
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,460
Oh, it comes from, you know, whatever fecal

992
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,160
matter on the dirt.

993
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:15,480
No.

994
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,920
What I'm trying to say is the bacteria

995
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,380
that they see that supposedly gets blamed for

996
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,620
it is because they blame bacteria and viruses

997
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,260
for everything.

998
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,640
Well, the whole theme to this is the

999
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,520
breaking patterns.

1000
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,520
It's an emergent.

1001
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,500
It's an emergent.

1002
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,040
Just like, you know, you want to freak

1003
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,560
people out.

1004
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,360
Don't do this with someone who likes tripping

1005
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:32,820
on acid.

1006
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,780
Show them microscopic scans of the skin, and

1007
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,340
you see the mites, and this looks like

1008
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,420
something out of sci-fi monsters living on

1009
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,160
your skin, right?

1010
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,940
Or even just the things on your eyebrows.

1011
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,060
It's even worse.

1012
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:43,360
Yeah.

1013
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,120
And you know, the more you wash, the

1014
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,680
more they grow back, right?

1015
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,160
Right.

1016
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,540
And they're not in the air.

1017
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,240
They're not in the ground.

1018
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,140
They're only found on human skin.

1019
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:52,760
Only.

1020
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,400
So how can they say it comes from

1021
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:54,940
somewhere else?

1022
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:55,760
That's what they're...

1023
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,120
They do not...

1024
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,820
These idiots, these academic idiots...

1025
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,560
By the way, if I said they're all

1026
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,940
idiots with little exception, like the medical, the

1027
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,360
legal, the academics, it's true with little exception.

1028
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:07,940
And this is...

1029
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,480
And I've brought this up many times because

1030
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,560
some people just stop and think academics, doctors,

1031
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,180
and lawyers are idiots.

1032
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:12,780
Yes, they are.

1033
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,820
All of them, with the exception of...

1034
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,900
I've always gone over the exception.

1035
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,120
The exception is very important.

1036
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,840
You have someone that wants to be an

1037
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,300
academic, heaven forbid.

1038
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,940
It means you're not paying attention.

1039
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,240
A lawyer, a doctor.

1040
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,520
And they get all the studies.

1041
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,520
They get all the qualifications and criteria.

1042
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,260
They go into the field and they realize,

1043
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,320
what the F is this?

1044
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,580
This has nothing to do with...

1045
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,480
And now they're stuck.

1046
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,900
Now they're stuck.

1047
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,460
They're like, oh my gosh, I dedicated 10

1048
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:37,900
years to this.

1049
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,440
I found out...

1050
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,080
What do I do now?

1051
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,160
What do I do now?

1052
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,480
I got no skills.

1053
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,000
What do I do?

1054
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,940
Those people usually transition out of it within

1055
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,100
two weeks to six months, sometimes two years.

1056
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,860
I knew...

1057
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,020
I've heard of someone that took them two

1058
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,800
years to transition out of that kind of

1059
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,380
field, right?

1060
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:52,800
Okay.

1061
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,480
Those are the exceptions.

1062
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,120
But the ones that stay in there, eh,

1063
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:56,560
idiots.

1064
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,560
And then there are the ones that stay

1065
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,200
in there and they're very low key.

1066
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,140
And they're not happy.

1067
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,040
They're not happy at all.

1068
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,300
And they go both ways.

1069
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,200
They're serving two masters, right?

1070
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,820
So it's a very...

1071
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:12,260
Humans are in a very, very, very, very

1072
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,580
bad spot when it comes to looking up...

1073
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,620
Who are you going to look up to?

1074
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,740
Who are you going to go to?

1075
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,080
It's exhausting serving two masters anyway.

1076
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,980
Look, I got two more things to get

1077
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,180
to.

1078
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,540
Yeah, go ahead.

1079
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,600
So I want to get to them.

1080
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,980
And you want to go with the timekeeping

1081
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,540
question?

1082
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,080
Yeah, sure.

1083
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,480
Is that the one in the Chitango?

1084
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,920
Yeah, because...

1085
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,320
I could skip that.

1086
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,220
That's just like how to do two sacrifices

1087
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,800
in one day.

1088
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,360
That has to be looked at carefully because

1089
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,600
one of them might be at noon and

1090
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,720
the other one is at twilight, which would

1091
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,380
be dawn and sundown, and that would make

1092
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,100
it the same day.

1093
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,760
So that's done.

1094
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,920
I have to go look at it again

1095
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,660
in the language of preservation.

1096
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,600
We don't want to say Hebrew.

1097
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,040
We don't want to even think of Jewish

1098
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,860
now, do we?

1099
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,500
Oh, my gosh.

1100
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,820
99% of the people that hear my

1101
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,260
songs think I'm Jewish, by the way.

1102
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,180
Well, because you mention the Old Testament a

1103
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:58,680
lot in there.

1104
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,360
Yeah, yeah.

1105
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,720
So, I mean, this shows you how much

1106
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,160
they know.

1107
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:01,780
But anyway.

1108
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,640
Anyway, so last thing then.

1109
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,360
Your view on Bitcoin.

1110
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,120
Do you have a view on this?

1111
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:07,940
What do you think of it?

1112
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,220
Is it a pyramid scheme, a CIA creation,

1113
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:10,620
pump and dump?

1114
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,120
It's all 1,000% because it's anything

1115
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,700
that makes it.

1116
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,160
What is it?

1117
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,700
A kilo of cocaine is less than $3

1118
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,480
,000, $4,000, and it sells for $10

1119
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,640
,000, $20,000, whatever.

1120
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,160
Right.

1121
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,480
Anything that has that kind of markup is

1122
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,540
an intelligence operation.

1123
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,220
Is it lawful money?

1124
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:28,600
No.

1125
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,700
If it's not gold and silver, it's not

1126
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,380
lawful money.

1127
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,260
Lawful money is something that's based on lawful

1128
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,180
substance, and there's no substance to it.

1129
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:36,580
Right.

1130
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,420
I think it's a joke.

1131
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,220
Now, when someone said buy this stuff called

1132
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,960
Bitcoin, it's $2.50. It was in 2008,

1133
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,640
2009 when it first came out.

1134
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,660
If I bought it, would I be happy

1135
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,060
I did?

1136
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:48,540
Yeah, sure.

1137
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,840
So, like I said.

1138
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,100
If you held it to today.

1139
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,540
Look, I got offered it at $80, and

1140
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,460
I'll tell you something.

1141
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,520
I feel foolish sometimes, but then I say

1142
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,860
to myself, I would have sold it by

1143
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,180
now.

1144
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:58,920
I mean, definitely.

1145
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,800
Yeah, that's the idea.

1146
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,720
You hold it for years.

1147
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,780
You say, I'm going to hold it five

1148
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,740
years and sell it or whatever.

1149
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,140
But, yeah, the whole thing is you want

1150
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,680
to get caught up with these morons.

1151
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,300
You know what I like, by the way,

1152
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:09,700
the luxury?

1153
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,520
I'm researching the luxury industry for the Scalarator,

1154
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:19,240
and with all the tariff nonsense, the Chinese

1155
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,020
videos coming out.

1156
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,500
You know those $38,000 handbags we make

1157
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:23,780
them here?

1158
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,820
If you want to buy it from us,

1159
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,540
it's $1,400, the same one, right?

1160
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:27,180
Right.

1161
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,740
So, at least that came out because I

1162
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,820
think it went viral for a little while.

1163
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,880
And then what's funny is I watch YouTube

1164
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,620
on the big screen TV while I'm eating

1165
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,060
because I'll put on food stuff.

1166
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,300
Nothing better to put on food stuff while

1167
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,380
you're eating, let's say, right?

1168
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:42,800
Okay.

1169
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,160
And there'll be an ad for Hermes.

1170
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,280
So, now Hermes and Gucci are doing ads

1171
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,560
to counter it.

1172
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,880
That's like if you told an eight-year

1173
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,120
-old to go become CEO of these companies,

1174
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,240
that's what they would do, right?

1175
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,160
So, anyway.

1176
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:58,600
Of course.

1177
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,080
All right.

1178
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:00,840
What else?

1179
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:01,540
Yeah, is that all?

1180
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,040
Yeah, that's pretty much it.

1181
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,980
I mean, I just got one basic question.

1182
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,600
I mean, you seem really energetic today.

1183
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,040
Has it been a good day, a pattern

1184
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,620
break day?

1185
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,440
What has your day been like?

1186
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,980
I got what I needed to get done,

1187
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,860
to get out of the way so I

1188
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,100
can do other things tomorrow.

1189
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,120
So, I feel good.

1190
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,280
I feel like the day was fairly complete.

1191
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,860
It's sundown here, what they call Saturday, some,

1192
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,199
what is it, the 22nd, 3rd, 4th, something

1193
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:27,420
like that.

1194
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:28,860
20, what, 25th maybe?

1195
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,540
Yeah, it's the second week of the second

1196
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:31,960
month.

1197
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:35,199
Yeah, 26th, 26th technically, yeah.

1198
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:35,980
Okay, yeah.

1199
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:36,500
All right.

1200
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,420
It's fine.
