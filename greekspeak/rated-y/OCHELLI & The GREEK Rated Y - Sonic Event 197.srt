1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,280
Rated Y, Sonic197, anyway, Greek, you know, the

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,220
chat's been interesting lately, but how are you?

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,260
Is times interesting your way or what?

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,360
Everything's good.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,440
I'm making coffee, feeding the cats, I got

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,840
like a chicken puree, you know, I buy

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,260
a big bag of 10 pounds of chicken,

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,320
I par-cook it, you know, every few

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,760
days and I make like a baby food

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,040
for them and with veg and stuff and

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,840
yeah, par-cooked, just it's all pink, you

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,680
know, how they should be and you got

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,760
to give them organ meat during the shedding

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,300
season.

15
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,680
People don't know that the organ meat, most

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,920
animals, you know, when they first had zoos

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,840
and they fed carnivore steaks, they got sick

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,240
and died because they eat the organ meat

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,940
first, right?

20
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,760
Yeah, because they were missing the other parts,

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,000
all the other stuff.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,740
Well, that's essentially what they go for, so

23
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,000
I basically buy chicken livers, beef liver, beef

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,340
heart and it's amazing how cheap it is,

25
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,360
I got a huge hunk of beef heart,

26
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,220
it was like two bucks.

27
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:05,120
Oh, nobody wants to buy that.

28
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,660
A big package, right?

29
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,860
I was going to ask you if you

30
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,340
were still getting the chicken cheap, actually, because...

31
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,680
Yeah, it actually dropped in price.

32
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,100
Really?

33
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,440
It went, it's down to $6.87 for

34
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,200
the 10 pound bag, it was almost as

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,440
high as like, just under eight dollars, when

36
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,080
I first started buying it, it was five

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,440
something.

38
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,180
Damn, I got to move to where you

39
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,300
are, the prices are dropping.

40
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,060
Tucson is cheap, yeah, but you know, they're

41
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,160
still paying $10 an hour over here right

42
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,400
now.

43
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,460
I'll give you an example, in 1986, I

44
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,880
was making $25 an hour and it was

45
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,780
good, you know, I wasn't wealthy, but I

46
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,340
never thought of anything that I needed, I

47
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,720
couldn't afford, you know what I mean?

48
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,900
Taking home a thousand bucks a week in

49
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,240
1985, 86.

50
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,600
85, 86 in New York, New Jersey area,

51
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,600
you were doing just fine at 25 bucks

52
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:48,700
an hour.

53
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,120
Yeah, I lived in Manhattan too, and because

54
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,520
back then, a good starting salary at a

55
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,740
college was 30 grand, which is not a

56
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,500
thousand bucks a week, a thousand bucks a

57
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,640
week is 50 grand, right?

58
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,200
Oh yeah, well, the way I understood it

59
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,520
is, see, I'm a little younger than you,

60
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,900
so for me it was 50,000 was

61
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,900
the good way to go, right?

62
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,620
Yeah.

63
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,380
And you could start there, you had a

64
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,220
good job at 50 grand, about a thousand

65
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,600
a week.

66
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,420
Yeah, and the interesting thing, what I did

67
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,880
through the weed man, the weed man was

68
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,260
the best, because you go and you sit

69
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,820
there, he prepares it, and there's other people

70
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,480
coming to get their weed, I met like

71
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,780
the great chefs of the world, I met,

72
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,640
this one guy, he came in, I said,

73
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:28,960
what do you do?

74
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,480
He says, I do decorative plaster restoration, Jason,

75
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,440
and he says, we're, you know, in the

76
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,060
old theaters, they were taking out the stuff

77
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,800
they put in the 50s and 70s with

78
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,440
the drop ceilings and they revealed all the

79
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,700
plaster ornamentation and the beautiful mural work, so

80
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,020
in a way it preserved it, but when

81
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,260
they put sprinklers through, they just blasted through

82
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,900
the beautiful ornamented, gilded, you know, ornamental plaster

83
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,540
and stuff, like little cherubs cast out of

84
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,740
plaster, pulling a bow and arrow or a

85
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,080
heart, that thing was broken, so these Texas

86
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,880
oil people were buying these theaters and wanted

87
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,020
to bring them back to their 1902, 1890

88
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,740
glory.

89
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,340
Plus they were busting holes for cable wires

90
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,080
and stuff at certain points, too, you know.

91
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,860
Oh, everything, and then they put the drop

92
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,780
ceiling in, right?

93
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,980
Right, and then the other terrible thing was

94
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,520
when they centralized some air and they just

95
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,320
ripped entire sections of stuff out.

96
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,080
Yeah, so all that had to be repaired

97
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,340
and restored, and the company, Kasloff Landau, they

98
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,160
were, and a long story, he says, we

99
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,260
need some laborers, and it was winter, I

100
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,280
was a bike messenger, which one of the

101
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,760
best things I've ever done in my life,

102
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,640
and in terms of an occupational quote-unquote

103
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,440
job, and bike messengers, you just split the

104
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,380
ticket, right, so it's $10 delivery, you get

105
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,960
five bucks, the company gets five, there's no

106
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,120
taxes, nothing, you're a subcontractor, right, you're really

107
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,000
wild, you know?

108
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,780
So anyway, I figured I'd get off the

109
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,940
road for a little while, so they started

110
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,860
me at $8 an hour as a laborer,

111
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,140
and to make a long story short, in

112
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,220
two weeks I was making $25 an hour,

113
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,620
because after a week and a half I

114
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,560
was like, you know, I could do that,

115
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,640
I see what they're doing.

116
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,400
They imported people from Hungary and Romania in

117
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,940
their 70s and 80s, because no one here

118
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,260
knew how to do that kind of stuff,

119
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,800
and they brought these old guys over, and

120
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,260
one of the Hungarians was into, what do

121
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,700
you call it, corporal punishment, if you didn't

122
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,980
do it right, he had a switch in

123
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,420
his pocket and he hit you in the

124
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,440
head with it real hard, I said if

125
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,620
he does that with me, I'm gonna kill

126
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,240
him, but he didn't, and I said, you

127
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,200
know, I could do this, I said no,

128
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,400
you can't, we got a five-year apprenticeship,

129
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,060
you know, you wanna do that?

130
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,420
I'm like, nah, nah, fuck it, I'm gonna

131
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,480
do it right now, so I started taking

132
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,840
stuff home and restoring models and bringing it

133
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,680
in, and then they bump you up to

134
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,660
$25 an hour.

135
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,640
Half the people there hated me, because they

136
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,640
were doing the five-year apprenticeship, because it's

137
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,200
also merit, it's not like in Japan, where

138
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,360
you have to torture the apprentices, like if

139
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,820
you're an apprentice in Japan, they like inflicting

140
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,540
pain on you too, by the way, you

141
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,540
know, like in the movie Jiro's Sushi, you

142
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,300
know, Jiro Uno's Sushi, the apprentices, you know

143
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,900
how you go to have sushi and they

144
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,600
give you a hot towel, right?

145
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,460
The messed up stuff like they show you

146
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,500
in the Kill Bill movies, where he pays

147
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,120
homage to a lot of that cinema, and

148
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,300
he does the whole thing with training the

149
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,480
girl, and he has to eat the rice

150
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,000
every single day, and he smacks her when

151
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,220
she doesn't eat the rice properly.

152
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,140
Or just making the way you're giving them

153
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,780
to do harder, like getting the sushi guys,

154
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,960
you know, what they do is they make

155
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,940
the, instead of the water just being hot,

156
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,940
it's like boiling hot, and the apprentice can't

157
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,340
wring it out, he's a weenie, so they

158
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,480
just inflict pain.

159
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,300
But I didn't go through that, and it

160
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,780
was good, and then after this company stopped

161
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,360
doing what they were doing, I got into

162
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,920
it like a wildcat decorative plasterer, and I

163
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,460
mean, then you're making $1,000 a day,

164
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,060
I didn't know what they were billing us.

165
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,820
So that's the thing, that $25 an hour

166
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,980
was nothing compared to what they were taking

167
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,200
in.

168
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,720
Oh, they were billing us out at $1

169
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,440
,000 to $1,500.

170
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,040
Look, when the company went under, we organized

171
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,940
a couple of people there, and I went

172
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,980
to go bid on a job, and I

173
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,340
was afraid to give them a price for

174
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,080
$1,500, it was a couple of feet

175
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,800
of molding that was missing plaster, and they

176
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
were like, come on, give me a price,

177
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,040
give me a price, and I didn't have

178
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,840
the balls to tell them $1,500, every

179
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,200
day was a day, two days work, three

180
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,320
days, you know, touch it up, $500 a

181
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,020
day was good, just talking about 1986.

182
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,780
Yeah, so that's a lot of money still,

183
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,020
yeah.

184
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,800
Yeah, people, you know, I mean, Union Carboners

185
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,080
are basically making at the top end $100

186
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,020
a day, right?

187
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,780
So anyway, I didn't have the, you know,

188
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,640
the gumption to tell them such a high

189
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,160
price, because I thought it should be priced

190
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,200
higher than normal labor.

191
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,880
They said, listen, if you could do it

192
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,540
for less than five grand, you got it,

193
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,100
and I'm like, oh my God, oh my

194
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,520
God.

195
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,220
I'm like, what the hell, you know, and

196
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,200
I was like, what, okay, Joe, you're pressing

197
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,260
me, I can do it for five.

198
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,480
I walked out, and I was like, walking

199
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,220
on air, I'm like, this is a day's

200
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,840
work, I'm getting five grand for that, you

201
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,120
gotta be kidding, and then I got in

202
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,560
touch with the people that worked them, like,

203
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,380
oh yeah, you thought you were making good

204
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,080
money, but they were billing you out for

205
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,980
$1,500 a day, I was like, oh

206
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,280
my gosh, and they were giving me $250,

207
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,580
I was getting ripped off.

208
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:55,460
Yeah, right, you're getting paid maximum $400, and

209
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,220
they're walking away with, you know, $1,200,

210
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:57,960
$1,800.

211
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,200
$1,000 a day, so I said, every

212
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,060
time they had a guy on the crew

213
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,600
there, just count the heads, that's $1,000

214
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,900
in the company's pocket for each person that

215
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,800
showed up to work, I was like, oh

216
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,780
man, no wonder they shut it down and

217
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,040
left.

218
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,640
So yeah, so I did this for a

219
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,120
little while, and it was great, because I

220
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,260
was bike racing and all that, and I,

221
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,720
you know, back then, a high-end bike

222
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,300
was $3,000, $4,000, now they're $20

223
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,660
,000, and I was like, oh yeah, just

224
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,440
give me the KPC record, give me the

225
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,080
Mozzy frame, give me the wheels, the guys,

226
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,400
ooh, what the hell is this guy, you

227
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,560
know, I'm like, guys, I remember, you're a

228
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,040
bike messenger, how are you affording this, I

229
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,700
don't do that anymore.

230
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,900
I got my own company doing restoration work,

231
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,640
and what was cool, and I still used

232
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,720
to do it, even in Tucson, you go

233
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,740
in the yellow pages for construction, you find

234
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,820
thousands of plumbers, carpenters, cement people, whatever, right?

235
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,260
Ornamental plasters, there's two in New York City,

236
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,340
and you call them up, and they're like,

237
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,360
oh yeah, we have a waiting list for

238
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,720
nine months, right?

239
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,660
What are you gonna do?

240
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,020
Because these construction companies, when they finish the

241
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,640
job, they have a retainer, and they don't

242
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,620
get paid the last 15% until the

243
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,880
job is completely done, and you had these

244
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,300
Park Avenue apartments with pieces, you know, that

245
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,200
were just unfinished.

246
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
So word got out that I was doing

247
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,480
it, and a couple of other people I

248
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,800
encouraged to do it, we were hitting all

249
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,580
these projects, and I still did it, even

250
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,340
today, sometimes, you know, I would, I mean,

251
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,180
recent years, like 10, 20 years, when I'd

252
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,680
get a call, I'd say, yeah, we have

253
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,420
a, you know, if it's May, I'll say,

254
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,180
I can't get out there till July, and

255
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,460
they're like, oh man, blah, blah, blah.

256
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,360
So now you can really gouge, right?

257
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,059
Well, you know, we have a service for

258
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:36,640
where, you know, you have a contractor, an

259
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,960
architect involved, and there's a retainer payment, we

260
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,880
can expedite, we can front-end expedite.

261
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,140
How much is that more?

262
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,420
You know, we double the price.

263
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,400
So it was like two of us basically

264
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,700
doing $20,000 or $30,000 a month

265
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,560
with two people and a laborer.

266
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,140
Look, when we hired laborers, we just, we're

267
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,760
talking about someone who just pushes a broom,

268
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,220
fills up buckets, cleans the tools, right, goes

269
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,880
get coffee.

270
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,240
We're not talking about someone that's required to

271
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,260
do skilled work, right?

272
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,340
But they have to be there, and they

273
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,620
have to be willing to do what we

274
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,340
need, right?

275
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,320
We started them off at $25 an hour.

276
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,360
Do you know the, you know, because the

277
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,960
laborers then were like six, seven bucks an

278
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,800
hour, maybe minimum wage even, and you wouldn't

279
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,600
believe the reputation, you know, it's like, oh,

280
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,780
go work for these guys, push a broom,

281
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,240
get $25,000, we're talking 1986.

282
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,260
Yeah, right.

283
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,440
No, I would have been glad to get

284
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,720
five bucks to do that back then, even

285
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,240
though I was a kid.

286
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,240
So we took care of, whoever worked us,

287
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,140
we took care of them, Paradigm Restoration.

288
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,520
That's one of the best times in my

289
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:33,940
life.

290
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,720
We're looking for a studio space, couldn't find

291
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,500
it, and this opera singer, Don Ewell, ran

292
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:40,920
into it.

293
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,560
It was Jay Adams.

294
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,740
His wife was an artist in New York,

295
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,520
famous sort of, and he says, listen, I

296
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,940
bought this warehouse building on Underhill Road and

297
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,000
Vanderbilt Avenue, and I need somebody in there

298
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,300
because they're going to burn it down, you

299
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,160
know, because it's a really rough neighborhood.

300
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,040
And I was like, all right.

301
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,760
So he basically got a 2,000 square

302
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,440
foot loft on the second floor for free

303
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,780
just to occupy it because, you know, they

304
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,760
find out there's a white landlord there.

305
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,440
We're talking the 80s.

306
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,740
A white landlord, he's not there.

307
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,060
I'd burn the fucker down, right?

308
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,400
You know?

309
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,340
Yeah, so at least there's somebody there that

310
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,740
can't go in there and screw around with

311
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,260
the Yeah, it was great.

312
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,120
And he called a plumber.

313
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,660
I remember he dropped, like, five grand to

314
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,960
install a new gas line on one of

315
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
those forced air heaters.

316
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,020
He treated us great.

317
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,460
Right.

318
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,960
So here's the thing.

319
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,480
We're waking in the high end of construction,

320
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,660
you know, for two people and free rent

321
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,300
and this.

322
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,480
It was just like, this is like, what's

323
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,260
going on here?

324
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,640
What's going on?

325
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,540
You know, this is life was different, but

326
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,840
it was, you know, doing that kind of

327
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,460
work in New York.

328
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,500
First of all, you can't park anywhere, right?

329
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,060
Right.

330
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,660
You have to pay off the meter maids.

331
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,700
I remember a Verderami construction.

332
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,400
They parked anywhere.

333
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,320
And I was like, how do you guys

334
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,580
do this?

335
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,100
Oh, yeah.

336
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,800
Verderami construction.

337
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,360
OK.

338
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,280
Gambino, whatever family.

339
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,780
And it was the female side of the

340
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,080
Gambino.

341
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,120
Anyway, all the meter maids walked by, you

342
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,960
know, double parked.

343
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,600
Didn't matter.

344
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,240
I was like, I got to get privileges

345
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,740
like this.

346
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,980
I never quite got them.

347
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,040
So we would just hire people instead of

348
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,860
having our own truck.

349
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,260
It was cheaper in the long run.

350
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,840
There were trucks for hire by the hour.

351
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,960
Hey, you know, hey, we got to know

352
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,100
them.

353
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,060
Go pick up this material.

354
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,480
Bring it here.

355
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:14,900
Bye.

356
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,520
No parking.

357
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,000
We never have to change the oil.

358
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:18,880
Pay the insurance.

359
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,180
Right.

360
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:19,680
Right.

361
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,220
And if we wanted to needed a bigger

362
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,880
truck, we found something, you know, his brother

363
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,680
had a bigger truck.

364
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,520
So we found out renting like, you know,

365
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,860
it's cheaper to use a cab in New

366
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,720
York than own a car.

367
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,040
Right.

368
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:29,500
Yeah.

369
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:29,800
Of course.

370
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,980
I look at New York City.

371
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,460
You'd be better off going to, like, say,

372
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:32,900
Home Depot.

373
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,400
Right.

374
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,660
And you get the van for a couple

375
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,060
of hours.

376
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,220
You make a couple of runs back and

377
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,080
forth to the store.

378
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,980
And then that's the end of it.

379
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,300
Drop it off and take a cab back

380
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:40,520
to the.

381
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,380
No, we didn't even do that.

382
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,440
This came with the driver.

383
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,620
There was a paper called the Village Voice.

384
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:44,920
Yeah.

385
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,120
No, I know the Village Voice.

386
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,940
You can hire anybody to do anything just

387
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,940
about because there was always.

388
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,320
Yeah.

389
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,780
And literally the massage parlor section.

390
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,440
Oh, yeah.

391
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:52,740
No, no.

392
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,560
Everything from escorts to paint my ceiling.

393
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:55,980
Yeah.

394
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,920
No, whatever you needed.

395
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,060
You could hire somebody.

396
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:58,620
Always.

397
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,240
Yeah.

398
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,000
So this just gave you a slice of

399
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,540
the 80s.

400
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,120
And do you believe that's 40 years ago?

401
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:04,980
I mean, not exactly.

402
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,480
But, yeah, 40 years ago, the 80s were

403
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,700
in the mid 2020s.

404
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,200
So 40.

405
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,440
Right.

406
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:09,820
Yeah.

407
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,680
No, I can't believe how clear I remember

408
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,720
the 80s, you know, and it's like 40

409
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,340
years ago.

410
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:14,720
Wow.

411
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,320
I can't believe I say something like that

412
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,900
now for decades, which is which is a

413
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,020
legitimate generation.

414
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:20,540
Yeah.

415
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,160
Forty years is a generation, you know, biblically

416
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,640
and otherwise.

417
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,820
So and you know what?

418
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,580
Not much has changed.

419
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,320
My advice to young people is that your

420
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,120
your 20s and 30s are your best years.

421
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,080
But it doesn't mean that the years after

422
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,360
that are not your best years.

423
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,240
But you're really an adult.

424
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,140
You're free to function.

425
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,220
You're still viewed as not really the youth,

426
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,100
but young and you'll have the most energy

427
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,820
and recovery.

428
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,200
Like, you know, you could work 20 hours

429
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,480
a day for a week in a row,

430
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,300
sleep on a slate on a Saturday and

431
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,780
you're fine.

432
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,020
You can't do that when you're 60.

433
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,220
You need to get enough to sleep for

434
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,780
three days to recover.

435
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,300
Yeah.

436
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,920
So but your debt, your best days are

437
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,680
in your I've even told someone recently, you

438
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,520
know, it was like 20 something.

439
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,720
I said, these are best years of your

440
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,100
life.

441
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,520
Take advantage of the the energy that you

442
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,920
have and it doesn't mean the other years

443
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,840
won't be good.

444
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,240
It's just that your your recovery powers are

445
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,800
the greatest.

446
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,200
Right.

447
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:10,680
Right.

448
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,320
You can recover.

449
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,180
You could take a hit and bounce back.

450
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:13,720
Absolutely.

451
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,360
And also, you're young and beautiful.

452
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,520
If you're not sorry, if you're not young

453
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,100
and beautiful in your 20s and 30s, it

454
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,840
ain't going to get better.

455
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,560
That's the truth.

456
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:23,960
Anyway.

457
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,000
So what do you got?

458
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,720
I mean, that was my that's kind of

459
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,020
personal.

460
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,780
But I think that whole thing I went

461
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,640
over just now, but it gives a little

462
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,260
bit more light into how anyone could view

463
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,320
their lives now and right now, no matter

464
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,080
how I look, let me just say this.

465
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,360
The political environment, because of the media, we

466
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,060
got media, more media now than we did

467
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:43,580
back then.

468
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:43,820
Right.

469
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,160
Right.

470
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,440
I mean, back then, the most technology you

471
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,600
had, there were computers, but the Internet was

472
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,140
not prevalent.

473
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:50,960
There was an Internet.

474
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,280
But the most information you got back then

475
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,980
were billboards, TV, movies, newspapers were still important.

476
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,300
And if you answering machines were pretty common,

477
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,960
but if you had a fax machine, wow,

478
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,720
you got a fax machine, you know.

479
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,420
Right.

480
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,940
So so that was it.

481
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,660
But now, because the bombardment, the political situation

482
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,100
now, people let the young people let themselves

483
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,300
bring them down and don't because the political

484
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,340
situation back then was World War Three and

485
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,380
a mutual destruction with the Russians.

486
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,000
Right.

487
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:21,980
Right.

488
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,800
So, yeah, I think the political situation was

489
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,720
worse in the 80s.

490
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,080
And it is now very similar.

491
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,520
It's very similar with inflation on a global

492
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,040
scale.

493
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,020
You know, yes.

494
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,040
But quite honestly, I don't know.

495
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,280
It just seems like people were freer that

496
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,960
you know what I mean?

497
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,180
They were free, like to not be at

498
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,180
war with everybody around you all the time,

499
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,380
unless you were in the wrong neighborhood.

500
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,080
You know what I'm saying?

501
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,420
Well, not only that, there was a lot

502
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,840
of animosity with the yuppies, the young up

503
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,820
and cut the Wall Street.

504
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,780
Yeah, right.

505
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:56,500
People was a lot of animosity for gentrification,

506
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,700
like classic neighborhoods being turned over and flipped.

507
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,720
You know, the traditional people moved out and

508
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,780
flipped over for this gentrified, you know, the

509
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,700
big box thing was becoming a problem a

510
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,860
little bit, you know, like Avenue A.

511
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,060
I mean, right now I look at walking

512
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:15,500
videos through the village and Avenue A.

513
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,640
I mean, that's Avenue A.

514
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,080
So that was like Lafayette Street or Broadway.

515
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:19,920
What the hell?

516
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,060
Yeah, totally different.

517
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,940
It does not look like the Alphabet City

518
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,420
of old.

519
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,060
Oh, you can smell the piss, urine and

520
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,640
vomit and heroin from Thompson Square Park before

521
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,320
you got to Avenue A, you know?

522
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh, absolutely.

523
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,280
Yeah.

524
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,140
And oh, my gosh.

525
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:35,520
Yeah.

526
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,420
Hey, look, I lived on East 9th Street

527
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,080
between what was it, A and 1st, right?

528
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,220
So, yeah, OK.

529
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,500
I lived on 11th between 2nd and 3rd.

530
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,380
Dori Ashton was my landlady.

531
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,960
And I didn't well, I knew at the

532
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,620
time in a little shed about 50 million

533
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,460
dollars worth of artwork hanging on our walls

534
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,960
because she was one of the most prestigious

535
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,400
art critics in New York.

536
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,600
She had all kinds of stuff.

537
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,340
And I would go to her parties occasionally.

538
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,760
But, yeah, 11th Street between 2nd and 3rd,

539
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,000
right, right down from the St. Mark's Church.

540
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,080
You were between 9th and 1st.

541
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,400
So you're down you're out of near Venero's

542
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:13,840
Bakery.

543
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,860
Yeah, well, the pizza joint, Doc Holidays.

544
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,840
The right was on the corner there.

545
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,800
I could I could step out onto my

546
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,060
stoop.

547
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,540
I could throw a rock to the left

548
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,260
and land it in Tompkins Square Park.

549
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,240
That's that's right.

550
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,480
Yeah, right.

551
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,980
So what a park I never considered.

552
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,940
But that's where I first learned about vegan

553
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,320
food.

554
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,500
And boy, was it delicious.

555
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,120
And then these other people trying to pawn

556
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,700
off the crap they cook is vegan.

557
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,520
It doesn't taste good because it's vegan.

558
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,980
I said, you got something wrong because they

559
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,620
do the free food.

560
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,340
Those guys show up in their school buses,

561
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,640
remember?

562
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,300
And they come out with chanting with their

563
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,520
little finger symbols.

564
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:47,840
Yep.

565
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,900
And they give out food on Thompson Square

566
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,740
Park on the weekends.

567
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,600
Yep, exactly.

568
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,260
No, I love that.

569
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,320
That was that was great.

570
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,040
And it was delicious.

571
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,100
You get these white people try to say

572
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,660
it doesn't taste like that because it's vegan.

573
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,720
So what are you talking about?

574
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,940
Vegan food is like super delicious.

575
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:03,980
If you know what you're doing.

576
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,819
Yeah, you better know what you're doing.

577
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,319
Exactly.

578
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,740
So, OK, I got a question.

579
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,980
Is there any literature out there or resources

580
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,380
where I can look more into the concept

581
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,280
of induction and things being replicated by the

582
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,800
body instead of absorbed?

583
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,319
Which is obviously wrong.

584
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:20,760
Sure.

585
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,560
Such a fascinating concept.

586
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,780
But yeah, they want to see if there's

587
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,440
reference material.

588
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,260
Well, right.

589
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,140
I haven't looked at Lewis Kevran.

590
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,260
K-E-V-R-A-N.

591
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:31,940
Lewis Kevran.

592
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,880
He was buddies with Michio Kushi and George

593
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,920
Asawa and all these other guys into transmutation.

594
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,780
Other people.

595
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:39,440
OK.

596
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,360
Lewis Kevran.

597
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,280
He, I think, does use absorption term.

598
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,760
So, no, there is no place.

599
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:53,120
But biological transmutation would be Lewis Kevran is

600
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,220
a good place to start.

601
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,320
Unfortunately, OK, this is like, let me just

602
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:57,580
segue.

603
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,060
The water device that I use uses a

604
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,680
magnet magnetic reactor.

605
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,980
It's actually a nuclear reactor, but magnetic reactor.

606
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,520
But it doesn't use the North or South

607
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,260
Pole, the magnets.

608
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,480
Matter of fact, if you if you apply

609
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,880
that, it shuts down the device.

610
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,660
I'm using what's called the block wall.

611
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,220
Right.

612
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,340
And I was speaking to an engineer, which

613
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,980
I'm speaking to often because we're in negotiations

614
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,300
for a lab and all this other stuff.

615
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,380
And I said, you know, the last time

616
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,280
a white paper was written on the block

617
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,020
wall was by Felix Bloch in 1946.

618
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,160
How easy is it to pick up something

619
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,420
that was last written about just two pages

620
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,280
in 1946 and continue that research?

621
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,520
How easy would that be?

622
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,560
It's pretty damn easy because no one's looking

623
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:41,920
at it.

624
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,120
Right.

625
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,780
So any research you do is the research

626
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,100
is the looking up.

627
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,140
You're going to have to do it.

628
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,960
The best place to start is put your

629
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,840
put your cheaters on and don't be cheated.

630
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,980
You know, cheaters like reading glasses go look

631
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,080
at cross sections of the lungs, the skin,

632
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:02,160
even microscopic illustrations are good of the intestines.

633
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,020
Any nothing goes through any of that tissue

634
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,020
at all at all.

635
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,540
There are glands that have I forgot what

636
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,900
they're it's like an opening sometimes, but those

637
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,000
are highly controlled.

638
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,260
And but nothing goes through that.

639
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,360
So now start formulating what's going on by

640
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,080
going into the chemistry and the physicality.

641
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,220
Now, they're they're covering this just like, can

642
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,560
you go to the library and look up

643
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,980
how to build a nuclear device?

644
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,620
No, you'll see a general sketch and they'll

645
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,440
lie to you about it.

646
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:31,640
Right.

647
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,000
Right.

648
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:35,560
So well, once you understand the concept, right,

649
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,900
you'll find out you can't do it.

650
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,220
Right.

651
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,400
Because it's just like it's just like printing

652
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:39,820
money.

653
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,160
You need a special printer.

654
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:41,780
Right.

655
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,660
You just don't need government special engraving.

656
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,140
Yeah, yeah.

657
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:45,420
Yeah.

658
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,840
And by the way, when they tell you

659
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,800
anybody's building them, it's not accurate at all.

660
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,580
They at least they stop scaring people about

661
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,120
it recently.

662
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:55,480
So.

663
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,000
Fair enough.

664
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,320
So there was also this discussion in the

665
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,760
chat about noises and somebody hearing a bunch

666
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,280
of noise in the kitchen and a voice

667
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,960
coming together, calling out their name.

668
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,920
Yeah, that's common.

669
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,800
Yeah, that's common.

670
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,540
I've had a cat had to be put

671
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,980
down and I hear him meowing occasionally because,

672
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,500
you know, they all have different specific voices.

673
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,720
And, you know, this is in the echoes

674
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,220
in the field and that's being taken advantage

675
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:20,760
of.

676
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,820
I put I posted Lookout for Charlie.

677
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,040
Look at F.A. Charlie, the YouTube channel,

678
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,560
because he's an audio guy.

679
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,240
But what he does, he's just not telling

680
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,440
you he's showing you.

681
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,120
Right.

682
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,560
So that's a good place to start.

683
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,760
If you understand the stuff I've been speaking

684
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,100
of for all these decades now, put that

685
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,380
together with this and make your own hypothesis.

686
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,420
You know what?

687
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,060
Yeah.

688
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,820
But you don't hear with your ears, right?

689
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,680
You hear with your brain.

690
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,640
So you can affect someone's brain and have

691
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,020
them think.

692
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,340
Right.

693
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:49,860
Yeah.

694
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,060
Well, I was going to ask you about

695
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,300
that because, you know, I went on that

696
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,580
channel and started listening and paying attention.

697
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,900
He was doing the thing on Waco.

698
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,900
Did you did you check out that one

699
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,080
yet?

700
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,100
No, I'm going backwards.

701
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,620
In other words, I'm going from his oldest

702
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,800
to his newest to see how it develops.

703
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,100
OK, I picked it random.

704
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:04,540
Right.

705
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,880
And went through a couple of different things

706
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,240
in the Waco thing stood out.

707
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,300
But I start listening to this and everything

708
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,680
that he's hearing and saying that is being

709
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,320
said, I'm hearing exactly different things.

710
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,800
And I mean, repetitively, and I'm trying to

711
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,760
hear what he's saying is being said.

712
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,020
Right.

713
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,460
I picked that up on one of the

714
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,260
videos about the haunted house.

715
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,840
But the good one is the one he

716
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,280
does.

717
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,920
Well, this is his own house.

718
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,640
Well, this is him pulling apart the 30

719
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,200
seconds of the audio from Waco.

720
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,720
And he's saying that hidden within there are

721
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,660
all these different voices and things they're trying

722
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,400
to say to people.

723
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,720
And I'm hearing different things from what this

724
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,380
I mean, clearly.

725
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,040
Well, you're hearing things to that.

726
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,280
Yeah.

727
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm just joking.

728
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,620
But what I'm saying is if you go

729
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:49,200
to most of his stuff, most of his

730
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,460
stuff is right on the money.

731
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,080
OK.

732
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,620
You know, I haven't heard that one, but

733
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,760
I wouldn't hang on one thing.

734
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,260
It seems like it was obscure because he's

735
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,720
picking up the recording also from some media.

736
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,080
Right.

737
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,060
Well, so but if you go look at

738
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,800
when you record ambient quietness at night, you

739
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,080
know, there are voices in that.

740
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,580
Yeah.

741
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,820
But have you watched that?

742
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,180
Yeah.

743
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,640
What's funny is, is I've gone through a

744
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,280
bunch of his stuff.

745
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,000
But the Waco one I stood at for

746
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,880
a while going back and forth over it

747
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,500
because he was saying it's so obvious, it's

748
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,000
so obvious.

749
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,180
And I'm like, it's not obvious to me.

750
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm hearing different stuff and I hear different

751
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,340
things than what he's doing.

752
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,700
Well, look, yeah, in his defense, not that

753
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,260
he needs it.

754
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,340
I go out and talk about stuff and

755
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,620
people don't understand it.

756
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,600
And it's really obvious to most and to

757
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:33,860
some.

758
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,540
So it's subjective also.

759
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,040
But I understand what he's saying.

760
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,420
And I'm sure that he's right, that there

761
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,720
are these hidden, you know, that there are.

762
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,440
Well, they're not hidden.

763
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,980
I mean, they're they're masked.

764
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:44,600
They're masked.

765
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,000
They were hidden.

766
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,460
You know, they're there.

767
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:46,900
They're there.

768
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,780
They're just very subtle.

769
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,120
Yeah.

770
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,740
But but it's beyond that.

771
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,400
What I what my focus is on is

772
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,340
your own inner voice that you think is

773
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,940
you that you actually you know, when you

774
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,260
when you hear a voice in your head,

775
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,540
meaning your your thought, your simple thinking patterns.

776
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,120
Right.

777
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,240
And that you hear yourself, you know, thinking.

778
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,880
And it's usually in your own voice.

779
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,300
And I'm telling you, that's not you.

780
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:10,860
Right.

781
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,880
That's another thing.

782
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,420
So and now, look, I have no problem.

783
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,380
There's an A.I. that runs everything.

784
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,700
Breshears is into it.

785
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,760
Much of the people I talked about that

786
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,460
long time ago.

787
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,140
But there's no reason to stress it because

788
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,220
you can't do anything about it.

789
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,100
One thing you'll notice, what I always discuss,

790
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,760
oh, not always, but mostly is things you

791
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,840
could do something about.

792
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,220
Like you got B.O. in your laundry.

793
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,740
It's because you're using the same laundry.

794
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,440
So there's no one online that's going to

795
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,120
give you.

796
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,420
I shouldn't brag like that.

797
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,580
So many practical things that you can actually

798
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,560
do something about over so many different fields,

799
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,180
over 20 different subject matters, at least that

800
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,400
you can actually listen to the sonic and

801
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,440
go do it right away.

802
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,480
So that's why I posted the Charlie stuff,

803
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,580
because.

804
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,800
If you if you're savvy enough, you can

805
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,420
download what is it, audacity, and you could

806
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:08,120
put a recorder, a non digital, preferably, which

807
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,040
is an old camcorder would probably be the

808
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,380
best.

809
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,260
And you can find them at Goodwill still

810
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,820
functioning for like five bucks, right?

811
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,400
Well, I got a cassette boombox, actually, that

812
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,900
that's that's even better.

813
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,140
Yeah.

814
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,020
Nothing digital.

815
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,180
Not like a smartphone.

816
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,140
Now there are there are better digital ones,

817
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,420
but why not digital?

818
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,020
I don't know.

819
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:26,660
I don't know.

820
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,120
Can't trust it.

821
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,340
Right.

822
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,380
Like Public Enemy says, can't trust it.

823
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,840
But and now you've got the background noise

824
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,000
of your street or the country or whatever.

825
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,180
And if you got audacity and you know

826
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,180
how to use, you know, different frequency bands,

827
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,000
you could reduce it.

828
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,700
You could hear stuff in there.

829
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,600
And he showed that.

830
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,040
Yeah.

831
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,560
And that's important because he's not talking about

832
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,260
like most of the stuff like you don't

833
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,840
hear with your ears, hear with your brain.

834
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,860
You don't see with your eyes, hear with

835
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,120
your brain.

836
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,740
They're not talking about anything exotic.

837
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,460
He's saying that it's actually in the sound

838
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,720
field versus microwaves that could make you think

839
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,500
you're hearing something.

840
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:00,880
Right.

841
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,800
But he says that it seems to me

842
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,620
he's saying that both exist, but he's trying

843
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,820
to show you the one that he can

844
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,200
reproduce.

845
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,300
Yeah, it's plain audio.

846
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,120
It's not microwaves.

847
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,440
Yeah, I know you could post microwaves that'll

848
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,860
make people feel like their head's going to

849
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,120
explode.

850
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,580
Micro is unnecessarily make you feel just like

851
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:15,840
you can.

852
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,520
You can also send these very narrow sound

853
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,220
waves that are only say, you know, like

854
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,080
present in one foot of space.

855
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,640
And if you stand in that one foot,

856
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,420
that one square foot, you'll hear it.

857
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,700
You see you step out of it and

858
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,200
it's no longer audible to you.

859
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,980
It's no longer being like shoved into your

860
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,240
head.

861
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,140
I understand all this stuff.

862
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,600
And I understand what you're saying about the

863
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,080
inner voice.

864
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,600
What I'm telling you is that apparently my

865
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,600
brain is picking up a different frequency.

866
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,680
Oh, yeah, it should.

867
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,760
It should, because you got the the reason

868
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,140
I'm saying it is not for nothing.

869
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,780
You have an eye disability, right?

870
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,400
So when that goes, the other ones tend

871
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,040
to unfilter less, meaning they're more open.

872
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,460
Well, and my eyes actually see different spectrums

873
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,120
of light already.

874
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,940
So I'm thinking that my brain is just

875
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:02,120
trained to pick up different frequencies anyway, because

876
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,400
like, for example, with food and cooking, people

877
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,700
that are very finicky about their food and

878
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,500
they can't find good food to eat.

879
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,940
Those are the people you want to make

880
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,340
prepare your food because they're hypersensitive to that.

881
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:14,620
Right.

882
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:14,980
Right.

883
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,640
So it's it's about sensitivity.

884
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,280
Anyway, enough about that, because that subject goes

885
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,740
on forever.

886
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,780
The most important thing we've discussed tonight is

887
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,060
how do you learn about induction?

888
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,400
And I don't know.

889
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,200
I don't know.

890
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,320
You're going to have to piece it together

891
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,080
yourself, like 99 percent of the stuff I

892
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,760
talk about and start off with your visual

893
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,620
cues, like when you're looking at something.

894
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,200
That's why when I go back to the

895
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,320
induction, I always say to a cross-section

896
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,360
of the intestines, do a split screen and

897
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,900
get an image of a cross-section of

898
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,340
a steel belted tire.

899
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,060
Look at them.

900
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,700
They're the same thing.

901
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,580
Pressure difference, very robust construction and nothing in

902
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,600
the design or the engineering allows for anything

903
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,940
to penetrate through the wall.

904
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,860
It's a failure if it does.

905
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,520
So all of it, everything is like that,

906
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,640
how the induction works.

907
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,000
Look, I wanted to look.

908
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,880
I can't even get a food seminar together

909
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,380
that I wanted to by now.

910
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,060
I want to get more into the human

911
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,100
body with some simple experiments to show how

912
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,680
all this stuff works by midsummer.

913
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,740
I said, I don't know if I'm going

914
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,940
to be able to do it, but it

915
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,820
doesn't mean I can't talk about it and

916
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,440
get other people to do it.

917
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,120
And that's the whole thing.

918
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,840
I've always been trying to get other people

919
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,300
to just.

920
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,720
I don't know.

921
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,140
I want to get a band together.

922
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,680
Does that make any sense?

923
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,540
No, you know, I need it.

924
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,180
I need to draw.

925
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,180
OK, I need a drummer.

926
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,220
I need a guitarist.

927
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,120
I need a vocalist.

928
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,020
Does that make any sense?

929
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,780
Yes, it does.

930
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,360
And you're starting to get people interested in

931
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,180
at least learning how to play an instrument,

932
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,740
which is good, because eventually you're going to

933
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,620
come across somebody who's a decent enough drummer.

934
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,460
You want to work with them.

935
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,560
I mean, that was my experience from trying

936
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,620
to build it from scratch.

937
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,060
Yeah, and all these subjects I require with

938
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,240
the financial stuff.

939
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,280
And I don't know.

940
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,120
I mean, I'm just sitting back and watch.

941
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
Look, look, I'm not supposed to be here.

942
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,460
So why am I going to act like

943
00:27:59,460 --> 00:27:59,880
I am?

944
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,120
Right.

945
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,280
But at the same time, you know, you

946
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,940
make an effort.

947
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,380
You see how it goes.

948
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,340
Whatever.

949
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,420
OK, what else?

950
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,220
You got any other questions?

951
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,220
Yeah, I got a few.

952
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,080
What are the Greeks thoughts on aromatherapy?

953
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,080
Any suggestion for some way to bring scent

954
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,240
into the equation to make a day more

955
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,060
productive, relaxing, et cetera?

956
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,280
Should I open a day with certain things

957
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,020
or close a day with certain things?

958
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,220
These are all questions.

959
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,660
Yeah, but don't get OK.

960
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,680
The problem when you bring up aromatherapy right

961
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,060
away, everyone's mind goes to the marketing side,

962
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,540
which is all these essential oils.

963
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,380
Most essential oils that out there can actually

964
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,800
do more harm than good because of their

965
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,580
natural solvents like tea tree oil will dissolve

966
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,160
plastic.

967
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,000
Any plastic tea tree oil is pretty, yeah,

968
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,560
pretty rough.

969
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,300
I mean, actually, like, you know, you get

970
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,240
a bottle of acetone in plastic and that's

971
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,860
pretty aggressive.

972
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,860
Good for tea tree oil.

973
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,120
They come back a week later and let

974
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,540
me know how it's like chewing gum now.

975
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:49,800
Right.

976
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:50,940
Tea tree oil.

977
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,180
So so right.

978
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,940
So the thing it's just like vegan people.

979
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,600
Everything's got to have jackfruit.

980
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,620
I'm like, oh, what's wrong with you?

981
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,420
So what I'm saying is when aromatherapy is

982
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:03,240
brought up because of the propaganda, everyone's going

983
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,780
to run and buy someone's essential oil for

984
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,260
some reason.

985
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,240
That's not what aromatherapy is about.

986
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,100
Right.

987
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,460
It's it's more like this.

988
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,560
Remember the scratch and sniff stickers again in

989
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,820
the 80s or 70s?

990
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,140
Right.

991
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:14,620
Right.

992
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,480
That's when that aromatherapy started.

993
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,720
Otherwise, why do a scratch and sniff?

994
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,380
Any other is they do anymore?

995
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,500
No, there's no more scratches.

996
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,380
I haven't seen those in years.

997
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:23,700
Yeah.

998
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,580
Long, long time.

999
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,260
I don't know.

1000
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:25,460
Somebody.

1001
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,300
And if you went to eBay and bought

1002
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,280
one new old stock, guess what?

1003
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,960
It probably doesn't have any more sniff to

1004
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,100
it.

1005
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,300
Right.

1006
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,300
I don't know.

1007
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,260
It's probably stale.

1008
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:33,580
Yeah.

1009
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,640
So anyway, never seen him get that old.

1010
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,660
Happens.

1011
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,280
The smell of clean is the best you

1012
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:40,860
can have.

1013
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:46,220
Clean doesn't mean Dow Corning and Johnson and

1014
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,160
Johnson cleaners.

1015
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,720
Clean means water and rinsing.

1016
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,860
And if you need an oxidizer, use hydrogen

1017
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,620
peroxide with a spray bottle on it.

1018
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,700
By the way, never dilute hydrogen peroxide and

1019
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,500
never expose hydrogen peroxide to light.

1020
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,760
That's why it always comes in the dark

1021
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,440
brown bottle.

1022
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,140
It will.

1023
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,180
It'll do, which I want to when I

1024
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,400
start talking about water again, the most important

1025
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,500
thing for water is away from light.

1026
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,080
And I've been doing experiments with that.

1027
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,580
And the fastest way to degrade water is

1028
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,760
to subject it to light.

1029
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,460
People say, well, I went to a beautiful

1030
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,300
lake and whatever.

1031
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,220
It was in the sunshine.

1032
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,380
No, you know, we're talking about maintaining water

1033
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:19,840
quality.

1034
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,980
So keep it absent from light.

1035
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,400
Now, aromatherapy, get it where you can.

1036
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,660
You know, if it smells good, eat it.

1037
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,300
It was a bumper sticker like that in

1038
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,040
the 70s.

1039
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,120
That was next to the one that said,

1040
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,100
no, no cashews, ass or grass or no

1041
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,860
ass without gas, grass or something.

1042
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,440
Or no, no ride without cash, grass or

1043
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:40,860
ass.

1044
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,200
Yeah.

1045
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:41,660
Yeah.

1046
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,020
And next to it was if it smells

1047
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,700
good, eat it and whatever.

1048
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,540
And smile.

1049
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,120
Yeah.

1050
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,700
OK, so aromatherapy is not what the people

1051
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,940
that are getting into it now in the

1052
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,600
past 10, 15 years is.

1053
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,000
It's good stimulation.

1054
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,900
The best kind of clean is the good

1055
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,800
kind of clean.

1056
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,000
I use that term all the time is

1057
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,260
keeping things clean.

1058
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,540
Doesn't mean using soaps and chemicals unless they're

1059
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,820
homemade soaps or, you know, organic soaps.

1060
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,340
But the best aromatherapy is actually fragrance and

1061
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,400
fragrance free pheromones that attract humans are actually

1062
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:20,760
sent.

1063
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,920
They cannot be detected.

1064
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,000
Right.

1065
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,140
It's like, you know, when you get a

1066
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,720
hearing test and it goes above your ear,

1067
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,740
you don't raise your hand.

1068
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,340
But there is a frequency being there.

1069
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,760
But they're so the the best aromatherapy are

1070
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,480
the ones that you don't pick up as

1071
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,180
having an aroma, believe it or not.

1072
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,340
And then it goes down to fresh things

1073
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,020
like when you go to, you know, when

1074
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,600
you walk into a really good organic market

1075
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,140
on the vegetable side.

1076
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:44,600
Right.

1077
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,740
Smells really good.

1078
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,220
And then the meat side smells like meat.

1079
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,520
And then you go to the cleaner side.

1080
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,500
That's not toxic.

1081
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,660
It just, you know.

1082
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,180
All right.

1083
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,300
So if you get used to walking around

1084
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,320
like a natural market, I would say whole

1085
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,800
foods, but I don't know how good natural

1086
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,760
market is.

1087
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,340
Aromatherapy.

1088
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:00,600
Right.

1089
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,060
And you start tuning yourself, but don't don't

1090
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,560
please.

1091
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,300
I'm not saying don't buy essential oils, but

1092
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,220
don't fall for that trap because they do

1093
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:12,740
have aromatherapy kits and it's 50 bucks.

1094
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,280
And guess what?

1095
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,580
All these little bottles of what?

1096
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,600
Essential oils.

1097
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,920
And most of them are toxic.

1098
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,860
If you use them the way that they

1099
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,440
they have to be diluted.

1100
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,280
They're natural solvents.

1101
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,700
No different than getting some petrol or gasoline

1102
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,720
or WD-40.

1103
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,040
No different.

1104
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:28,920
Right.

1105
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,940
So, you know, you're not for the using

1106
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,620
the melts and all that kind of stuff.

1107
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,060
No, no, especially no heat changes it.

1108
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,060
When you get more into the induction, you'll

1109
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,460
understand.

1110
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,420
Most of them will become toxic to you.

1111
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,320
You might get.

1112
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:41,820
Oh, yeah.

1113
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,840
Smell that cinnamon.

1114
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,220
Yeah.

1115
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,680
Oh, smell that geranium.

1116
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,120
It smells nice for a minute.

1117
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,260
Yeah, it's toxic.

1118
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,940
It's going to end up being toxic to

1119
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,040
you.

1120
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,480
And it's going to be another fad that

1121
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,440
you pass through your life.

1122
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,640
Don't fall for that is what I'm trying

1123
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,000
to say.

1124
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,760
Fair enough.

1125
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,360
So they have another question here, and I'm

1126
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,480
going to boil it down real fast about

1127
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:01,880
marriage.

1128
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,640
OK, so they note that you're married, but

1129
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,320
also you're not having children.

1130
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,280
You're not procreating.

1131
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,680
But you also recently mentioned that the whole

1132
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,500
purpose of, you know, sex is procreation.

1133
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,620
That's all.

1134
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,520
What if you hold on in terms of

1135
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:16,920
purpose?

1136
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,380
You got anything else?

1137
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,200
Let me know in terms of purpose.

1138
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,520
Well, what that word means.

1139
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,180
Ultimately, the question is, what is the purpose

1140
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:27,160
of a marriage if you're not procreating?

1141
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,900
Well, it's supposed to be partnership coupling.

1142
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,480
You know, there are certain animals that that

1143
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:34,900
what are they?

1144
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,460
What are they called?

1145
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,260
Couple for life.

1146
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,300
I think doves do that.

1147
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:37,560
Right.

1148
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,300
Who knows?

1149
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,280
I mean, dolphins, I think they say.

1150
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,440
Yeah, we have to trust what they tell

1151
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,280
us to a degree.

1152
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,000
But the idea is cute to think about

1153
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:47,500
the idea.

1154
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,080
It's not for everyone.

1155
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,520
I think it's it's it's a matter of,

1156
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,460
you know, that term I got you, right?

1157
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,500
You know, you know, you got somebody got

1158
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,160
got your back.

1159
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,640
But, you know, what's the interesting thing in

1160
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,540
Western society, especially American, the most horrific stories

1161
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,140
of betrayal come from what?

1162
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,120
Oh, yeah.

1163
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:07,980
People that have been married.

1164
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,179
People that are married are the worst.

1165
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,480
So you could scratch what I said right

1166
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:11,739
there.

1167
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,380
If you feel like you're in that category,

1168
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,760
it's a tough one.

1169
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,520
If I had to do it all over

1170
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,400
again, yeah, I'd do it.

1171
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,300
That's why I keep saying being here is

1172
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,480
a complete waste of time.

1173
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,520
How many times you heard someone, you know,

1174
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,219
they're in prison?

1175
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,080
Would you regret it?

1176
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,080
No, I don't regret it.

1177
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,460
You know, or, you know, I lost everything

1178
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,719
in a bad business deal.

1179
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:31,540
I don't regret it.

1180
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,060
I would do it.

1181
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:33,639
Yeah, I understand.

1182
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,760
If you lived in a real world, there

1183
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,739
would be very clear demarcations about, oh, no,

1184
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,840
I would never do that again instead of

1185
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,679
most of the time.

1186
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,260
Oh, yeah, I understand why.

1187
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,520
Yeah, I would do it again, you know,

1188
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,580
wherever I would.

1189
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,280
That it was not it wouldn't be this

1190
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,080
wishy washy.

1191
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:52,179
You'd have more black and white, very clear

1192
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:54,120
yeses and no's.

1193
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,540
Well, we don't live in a real world

1194
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,020
because we're here to waste our time.

1195
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,680
So if you're wasting your time alone or

1196
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,900
with a marriage or in prison or out

1197
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,400
in the world, it doesn't fucking matter because

1198
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,200
it's everything here is a waste of time.

1199
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,720
It's just passing the time.

1200
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,340
Fair.

1201
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:07,820
Right.

1202
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,880
So how do you want to pass your

1203
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,260
time?

1204
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,280
Well, there is no specific instruction to marriage

1205
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,280
other than if you want a specific instruction

1206
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,200
on marriage, read the old test.

1207
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,420
Yeah.

1208
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,160
Yeah.

1209
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:19,840
Fair enough.

1210
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,920
But that's that's why they were asking, though,

1211
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,760
because it just seems like procreation is one

1212
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,140
of the keys to marriage.

1213
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,040
But, you know, but if you're not doing

1214
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,760
that, why be married is the question.

1215
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,100
Anyway, forget it.

1216
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,460
That's that's all good.

1217
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,800
And we're here to waste time.

1218
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,760
But last question is that they've always felt

1219
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,280
that music definitely has a spiritual element to

1220
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,900
it and all that.

1221
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,280
But the question for you is, does it

1222
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,300
is it a useful tool when it comes

1223
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,740
to emo work music?

1224
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,080
Of course.

1225
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,660
So well, again, we go back to the

1226
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,240
sound, which is a very broad topic.

1227
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:54,980
Let me just say this.

1228
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,240
Your survival is not based on your sight,

1229
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:57,480
right?

1230
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,260
You're in a dark forest, can't see we're

1231
00:35:59,260 --> 00:35:59,760
in a cave.

1232
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,860
Your height, your survival and your defensibility and

1233
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,240
all that depends on location, on sound.

1234
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,480
Sound is so important.

1235
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:07,820
Right.

1236
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,300
And half of the time that you're breathing,

1237
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,540
you have to rely on sound if you're

1238
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,580
in a natural world, because guess what?

1239
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,060
It's dark.

1240
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,080
Your sound is underrated.

1241
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,940
That's why one of the things is wherever

1242
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,900
you go is crappy sound, whether, you know,

1243
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,720
wherever you go, everything sounds terrible.

1244
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,140
We have a fix for that, by the

1245
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,360
way.

1246
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,940
But it's not you're not going to get

1247
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,740
it unless you get it from me or

1248
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,540
anyone that's I'm working with a fully coherent

1249
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,120
sound.

1250
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,960
It's a very simple fix, very inexpensive.

1251
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,180
It could be put into production very easily.

1252
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,600
But you don't get this stuff, just like

1253
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,160
you get toxic food and all that.

1254
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,540
But music, music is people ask me what

1255
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,460
kind of music you like.

1256
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,760
It's like asking me what kind of food

1257
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,220
do I like?

1258
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,300
You mean like salty, savory, sweet?

1259
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:48,900
What?

1260
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,740
There's no such thing as what what sound.

1261
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,700
If it sounds good, if it's well done

1262
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,540
to you.

1263
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:55,620
Right.

1264
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,460
Like, for example, you know, the mosh pit

1265
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,140
songs, you know, that call when I walk

1266
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,740
in a place of playing that heavy metal.

1267
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,120
Sure.

1268
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,540
I'm like, oh, you're playing love songs.

1269
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:03,800
Right.

1270
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,440
And I could see how I don't like

1271
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,980
that, but I could see how I could

1272
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,540
get into it because I recently was somewhere

1273
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,160
waiting and I heard the whole song.

1274
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,940
It was like some band out of Sweden.

1275
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:15,480
Right.

1276
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,720
And heavy, very heavy.

1277
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:17,960
Right.

1278
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,440
And I was like, I get it, I

1279
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,400
get it there, you know, but it's not

1280
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,460
my type of music.

1281
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,200
Right.

1282
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,620
You see, like I met someone recently who

1283
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,940
were like, oh, I don't like jazz music.

1284
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,120
I mean, how can you say that?

1285
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,620
How can you say I don't like jazz

1286
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:31,020
music?

1287
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,940
That's stupid.

1288
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,740
You know, keep your mouth shut, you know,

1289
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,900
because you sound dumb.

1290
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,240
Now, when it comes to music, look, I

1291
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:37,960
like some things.

1292
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,040
I don't like some others.

1293
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,140
And you know what?

1294
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,500
It changes over time.

1295
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,020
And my mood changes.

1296
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,520
I might be more happy.

1297
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,840
And also what's being delivered.

1298
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,300
Like somebody, I don't like Chinese food.

1299
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,340
How can you say that?

1300
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,200
I mean, how do you know?

1301
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,400
I mean, you know, it's always different.

1302
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,180
And at what level, you know, are you

1303
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,380
operating on, you know?

1304
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,580
So, yeah, the music is extremely important.

1305
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,540
As a matter of fact, I for when

1306
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,680
I'm having, let's say, a challenge, challenges in

1307
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,160
my life.

1308
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,480
And I know I need to sleep well.

1309
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,180
I put some music on in the background.

1310
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,160
Right.

1311
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,700
And what I do is I go to

1312
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:17,580
Nemo's dreamscapes and he it sounds like 1930s

1313
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:17,800
old.

1314
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,380
He's playing in the background with rain.

1315
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,400
All right.

1316
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,940
So YouTube channel and yeah.

1317
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,380
Antique radio playing music in the background in

1318
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,140
another room.

1319
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:28,140
Right.

1320
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:28,840
Cool.

1321
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,900
And that'll just lull you away.

1322
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,360
Who knows what kind of subliminal crap is

1323
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:33,960
in there, too.

1324
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:36,060
But that really helps.

1325
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,840
And yeah, you will you will find if

1326
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:43,320
you integrate music into your life properly.

1327
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,500
The only thing is.

1328
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,540
I've seen people that can't afford a system

1329
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,540
or have roommates where they get headphones, don't

1330
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,680
don't get stuck on the headphones because music

1331
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,300
is tactile.

1332
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,060
You get more information through your skin when

1333
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,680
you're relaxing with music and not listening to

1334
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,340
it directly than you do through your ears.
