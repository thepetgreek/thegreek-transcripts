1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:11,120
Hey, it's Sonic Event 200, first time on

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,720
Jitsi, so hopefully the sound quality is good.

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,060
Anyways, how are you doing tonight, Greek?

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,080
Good.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,540
It's more about getting the message.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,320
Is the quality good enough to get the

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,080
message across?

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,380
It's all about the message, right?

9
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,300
Oh, absolutely.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,260
Absolutely true.

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,620
But actually, you sound a little better on

12
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,940
this now than I had you sounding on

13
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:29,260
Skype.

14
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,120
Yeah, it's different processing.

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,100
It's all numerics.

16
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,980
You know, with these stupid rectangles, when people

17
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,480
take pictures, I can tell.

18
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,340
It's numeric photography.

19
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,940
It's not real light that you're seeing.

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,320
All cell phone cameras have a fisheye effect

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,300
because they're so small.

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,280
You know, if anyone knows about photography, I

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,860
don't need to get into the technical aspects

24
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,240
of it.

25
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,880
And because it's been calibrated at the engineering

26
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,460
level, they numerically even everything out.

27
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,420
That's why when I'm taking pictures of food

28
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,320
on a stupid rectangle, the proportions are totally

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,940
out because it doesn't know what to do

30
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:10,880
with a lot of...

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,940
when an object like a plate is taken

32
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,300
on an angle, it's elliptical, right?

33
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,400
And it makes the small plate look really

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,280
big, you know, and you can see it's

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,000
all distorted.

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,540
Things that, you know, it has to decide

37
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,780
what scale to give certain things.

38
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,520
And you could always tell with the numeric.

39
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,060
It's very rare that you see a non

40
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,100
-numeric photography.

41
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,040
And when you do, what's non-numeric photography

42
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,940
is photo negatives that have to be developed

43
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,840
and prints chemical.

44
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,200
Yeah.

45
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,840
Chemical print.

46
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,960
Because everything else, basically, when you get down

47
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,640
small enough, it's little squares.

48
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,200
And quite frankly, if there's no information in

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,500
the square, the computer fills it out.

50
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,320
Yeah.

51
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,660
But what I'm saying is that lens can

52
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,460
only show you what looks like a fisheye

53
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,680
view, cannot show you what you're seeing.

54
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,140
So it has to do it numerically.

55
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,600
Right.

56
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,200
It has an aftertaste.

57
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,840
I call it the AI aftertaste.

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,340
Oh, yeah.

59
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:04,800
There's that.

60
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,440
But there's also the after process, right, where

61
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,919
you end up with these squares, like I

62
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,139
said.

63
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,520
And if there's no information, the computer does

64
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,540
the fielding.

65
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,060
It fields.

66
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:15,500
Yeah.

67
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:15,900
Yeah.

68
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,940
So I call it digital.

69
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,020
We could coin a phrase, the AI aftertaste,

70
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,760
the digital aftertaste.

71
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,240
Digital aftertaste.

72
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,420
Just call it an aftertaste.

73
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,180
Because that was really big in the 80s

74
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,640
and 90s.

75
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,160
Remember, with certain no aftertaste.

76
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,560
Remember, who was doing that?

77
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,760
It was one of the beer companies.

78
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,120
Remember, it said no aftertaste.

79
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,180
No aftertaste.

80
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:33,620
It's light.

81
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,540
No aftertaste.

82
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,100
Anyway.

83
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,600
See how the programming works?

84
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,220
Yeah.

85
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,760
Well, I think it was a soda company

86
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,740
that did the no aftertaste because you're getting

87
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,120
it mixed up with the beer company where

88
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,680
it was less filling, tastes great.

89
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,780
And then they added in no aftertaste.

90
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,040
Right.

91
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,040
But the soda companies did it first because.

92
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:49,460
Yeah.

93
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,240
So in this case.

94
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:50,720
Yeah.

95
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,500
Let's bring it up for this.

96
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,320
All this crap.

97
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,920
I keep telling you, I'm working with an

98
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,280
engineering group and said, there is no.

99
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,400
You keep saying technology, technology.

100
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,360
What about innovation?

101
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,640
Technology is not innovation.

102
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,340
No.

103
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,420
It's not the same word.

104
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,440
It's using the same technology from the 1930s.

105
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,880
All the sensors that are used in all

106
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,660
the smart devices have been around since the

107
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,680
1930s.

108
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,000
Here's the spiel on it because I've gone

109
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,020
over this a lot of times the past

110
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,360
month.

111
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,200
All the sensors that are what you're calling

112
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,100
technology is nothing but a grouping of sensors

113
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,600
and processing the information numerically and then presenting

114
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,300
it in analog form to the user.

115
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,900
So yeah.

116
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,880
So what they're doing is all the sensors

117
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,100
in your smartphones and all these AI things

118
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,540
have been around since the 1920s, 1930s.

119
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,700
By the 1950s, they went away from vacuum

120
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,160
tubes, made everything a semiconductor, which by the

121
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,400
1970s, a lot for miniaturization all the way

122
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,020
to the 2000s.

123
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,540
And then it became mass produced, mass produced

124
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,860
and further miniaturized and then thrust into the

125
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,940
public, right?

126
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,140
Thrust into the public.

127
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,180
In other words, you don't have a choice.

128
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,920
Like Ferrari hasn't thrust themselves into the public,

129
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,320
right?

130
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,740
You can't go get a Ferrari for 10

131
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,660
grand or 20 grand.

132
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:10,940
Never.

133
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,180
They didn't ever had the Econo version, right?

134
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:13,600
Never.

135
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:14,660
Right?

136
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,500
Or the gas, right?

137
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:16,959
You see?

138
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:17,640
So...

139
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,600
All they've done is speed things up, really.

140
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,100
They've sped up the delivery system and they've

141
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,000
sped up processing so that things don't...

142
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,340
Yeah.

143
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,860
That's part of the miniaturization.

144
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,560
Yeah.

145
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,000
That's right.

146
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,420
Now there's a hundred billion switches in a

147
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,360
regular latest, let's say, regular smartphone.

148
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,920
I was impressed with the 16 billion.

149
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,400
All of that in principle, if you were

150
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,140
to teach how it works in principle on

151
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,520
a chalkboard or a whiteboard, it would be

152
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,160
the same stuff that was taught in principle

153
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,180
in the 1930s.

154
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,000
So there's no innovation.

155
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:50,920
No innovation.

156
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,280
No innovation would be to create an entirely

157
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,180
different process.

158
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,300
See, that's the thing.

159
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,400
The process would be...

160
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,100
And the approach and the outcome would also

161
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,520
be different.

162
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,040
Like if you figure out a different way

163
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,520
to capture light being reflected off of objects

164
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,320
and you come up with a different capturing

165
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,960
system, that would be innovation.

166
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,460
But no, that's not what they've done.

167
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,120
They've taken the same process and they've kind

168
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,180
of sped it up, like I said, and

169
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,040
miniaturized Well, they miniaturized it and then they

170
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,760
thrust it in front of you because you

171
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,800
won't find...

172
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,740
You see, these cell phones and tablets, they're

173
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,480
really cameras that happen to be computing also.

174
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,620
They're focusing on that for some reason.

175
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,760
You know, by the way, when Apple says

176
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,220
they're doing a battery upgrade, what they're really

177
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,040
doing...

178
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
It's not hard to find.

179
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,320
This is not conspiratorial.

180
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,080
If you look hard enough, you'll find this.

181
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,260
They're searching your files and all of your

182
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,400
photos have GPS location and time.

183
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,340
And they're looking at your photos for people

184
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,340
in the background that the authorities asked them

185
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,760
to look for, for a fee, and they're

186
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,060
looking at everybody's phone.

187
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,740
Let's say, you know, you're out at Pizza

188
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,580
Hut and you're leaving Pizza Hut and you

189
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,320
do a selfie and the guy all the

190
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,660
way in the back of the frame is

191
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,740
the guy they're looking for.

192
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,740
They know what time he was there and

193
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,020
also the coordinates, right?

194
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,620
The GPS coordinates are in there.

195
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,360
Yeah.

196
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,740
And they start putting information.

197
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:04,980
Yeah.

198
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,520
It's all for hire.

199
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,880
Like, I knew someone who worked at the

200
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,500
DEA.

201
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,160
He was...

202
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,740
He still does.

203
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,440
He's...

204
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,460
What do you call it?

205
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,200
Witness Protection Program official and a bunch of

206
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,760
other stuff.

207
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,960
And we were...

208
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,580
He was...

209
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,100
We were looking...

210
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,520
Well, I wasn't.

211
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,680
We were interested in something and he says,

212
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,900
you know, it's too bad.

213
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,260
It's, you know, this time of year because

214
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,500
the satellite that would do it for us

215
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,380
is not in plane.

216
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,500
You know, it's not, you know, in position.

217
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,080
And I said, really?

218
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,020
Yeah, we can.

219
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,360
They're allowed to share because government agency, right?

220
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,960
They could share their files, but you have

221
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,640
to pay them.

222
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,920
So when you hear about government agencies like

223
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,920
the FBI doing this with this company, they

224
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,800
don't do it for free.

225
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,380
No.

226
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:47,980
They have to...

227
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,440
The FBI has to pay a fee and

228
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
who or vice versa.

229
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,200
So you can go, for example, here's an

230
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,780
extreme case.

231
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,460
You can go to the provost marshal of

232
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,120
an Air Force base and give them enough

233
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,600
money and make a small private contract to

234
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,480
drop, have an F-16 or whatever, drop

235
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,220
a bomb on someone's house and they will

236
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:03,520
do it.

237
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,880
And that's been done before during the Obama.

238
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,180
I busted them pretty good when there's this

239
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,540
lady in San Francisco, very, very outspoken, right?

240
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,560
Let's say.

241
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,780
And they said the block blew up.

242
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,440
Everyone said they heard a low flying jet

243
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,780
and there was a big explosion and they

244
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,700
said it was a gas line explosion.

245
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,640
And the...

246
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,780
What do you call it?

247
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,400
The media got there too soon and you

248
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,800
see this long flatbed truck dumping old gas

249
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,080
pipes into the street.

250
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:33,740
Right.

251
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,220
First of all, if it was a gas

252
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,680
line explosion, there would be nothing of the

253
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,400
pipe left.

254
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,040
And it was basically that typical conical crater

255
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,700
that you see.

256
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,720
Just go look at, you know, any DMZ

257
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,900
zone when they drop an aerial thing.

258
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,080
It looked to me from what I know

259
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,240
about high speed explosives, it was 120 pounds

260
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,100
and that's all I'm going to say.

261
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,560
Fair enough.

262
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:56,780
Yeah.

263
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,940
And all the witnesses were planted and the

264
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,200
real ones in some other parts of media

265
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,360
said, yeah, it was a low flying jet.

266
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,040
We heard an explosion.

267
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:05,740
Okay.

268
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,760
It's pretty obvious, especially, you know, when the

269
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,800
gas company shows up and starts...

270
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,940
Why would the gas company be the first

271
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,800
to show up to drop old pipes on

272
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,120
the street?

273
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,980
Literally, you see the guys pushing the pipes

274
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,680
off the truck.

275
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:18,700
Yeah.

276
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,680
To make the scene look realistic.

277
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,960
But the people are so stupid.

278
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,120
It's like 9-11.

279
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,160
They would never understand, you know.

280
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,320
Hey, fair enough.

281
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,460
Before you get into a thing that you

282
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,260
saw in chat, because I know you want

283
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,500
to talk about that, but I got a

284
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,120
couple of questions, just a few real quick

285
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,460
ones.

286
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,539
And so this one says, a question for

287
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:37,740
the group.

288
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay.

289
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What are his thoughts on shungite?

290
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,020
Okay.

291
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,220
S-H-U-N-G-I-T-E.

292
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,460
I'm not sure if that's spelled correctly.

293
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,140
I got it.

294
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:45,700
Yeah.

295
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,560
Particularly when it is used in or around

296
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,600
water.

297
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,300
That's the hoopla about it.

298
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,540
I've worked with it a little bit.

299
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,180
I have not noticed anything marketable, like they

300
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:55,420
say.

301
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,900
So in other words, if you start getting

302
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,520
the notion via the web or people saying

303
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,400
it and try it out yourself, you're going

304
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,000
to say, oh, great.

305
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,480
You know, before you even try it, you're

306
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,240
like, I got shungite.

307
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,040
This is like the touted to really help

308
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,280
water.

309
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,440
And you're like, I don't see it doing

310
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:12,860
anything.

311
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,780
That's all I'm going to say.

312
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,240
No, no.

313
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,240
You won't see it do anything.

314
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,920
Now, I have a five inch by five

315
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,160
inch by five inch tall shungite pyramid.

316
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:22,720
Okay.

317
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,460
Okay.

318
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,300
What does that mean?

319
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,040
You can go out and buy a little

320
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,760
shungite rock that's like 30 bucks, a little

321
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,380
thing holding you the size of a gumball.

322
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,480
This is a five inch by five inch

323
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,040
by five inch piece of shungite.

324
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,700
There's different types of shungite.

325
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,100
And that doesn't do anything for me.

326
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,240
Now, there's a lot of people that believe

327
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,920
that it does.

328
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,420
You know, we got things like the mood

329
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,420
ring, the pet rock, all that stuff.

330
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,600
I got one of those shungite pyramids somewhere

331
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,120
around here.

332
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,700
Everything does something, but it's not quite doing

333
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,500
it the way that led you to get

334
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:56,640
it.

335
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,280
You know what I mean?

336
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:57,960
I know.

337
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,600
These guys were going to clear all kinds

338
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,260
of things for me and it didn't do

339
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:02,560
it.

340
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,700
Like, for example, it's really, I haven't experimented,

341
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,300
but it's really good.

342
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,180
You know, the mirror trick, putting it behind

343
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,900
a smart mirror, a smart meter.

344
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,160
So it sends the, you know, the mirror

345
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,060
has to face the meter.

346
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,960
So it sends it, yeah, it has very

347
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,020
good reflective properties and absorptive properties in the

348
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,780
absorptive properties, supposedly process the energy.

349
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,900
So it doesn't stay in the room, whatever.

350
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
Since I've been working with the devices that

351
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,160
I, so the devices that I do are

352
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,620
in your face, you know, it's, it's, it's

353
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,780
like, boom, it's like, even it's like, wow,

354
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,180
this thing is really, you know, really notice

355
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,980
a difference, right?

356
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
So that's what I'm interested in.

357
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,240
The subtle stuff I'm interested in also, but

358
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,240
that's not going to really fix a lot

359
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,480
of the issues people have.

360
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
But, you know, I'd say experiment with it.

361
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,040
You know, I think it's mass dependent.

362
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,320
In other words, Shungud, you need a lot

363
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,640
of it, not a little bit of it.

364
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,760
So well, and as you've said, often all

365
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,540
fields are open.

366
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,720
So I imagine there's plenty to be discovered

367
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,160
because, you know, people haven't discovered very much

368
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:05,860
in a long time.

369
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:06,740
All right.

370
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,900
So I'm curious, please ask the Greek about

371
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,880
the entities that are inner voices and dreams.

372
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,940
Are they part of the A.I. running

373
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,920
this joint or are they separate?

374
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,160
Both think of the A.I. as a

375
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,540
tool.

376
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,900
So let's say think of it.

377
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,980
Think of that question this way regarding the

378
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,780
A.I. you go to a real primitive

379
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,040
society and when they do agriculture, what do

380
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,380
you see?

381
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,980
A lot of people with metal strapped to

382
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,940
a wooden stick and they're poking at the

383
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,240
ground.

384
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,100
They might have a plow or not with

385
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,980
an ox pulling it.

386
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,260
Right.

387
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,780
Manual labor.

388
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,060
Right.

389
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,960
But you go to a more developed society.

390
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,880
You got four or five people, you know,

391
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,520
doing thousands of acres with these big machines.

392
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:50,860
Right.

393
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,720
Then you go to a more evolved society.

394
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,760
No one's on the farm.

395
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,080
Everything is being metered and completely automated.

396
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:57,640
Yep.

397
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,420
OK, so when you bring in A.I.

398
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,940
So let's say A.I. is running this

399
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,380
place that was developed by extremely evolved.

400
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,620
So they don't have to be there.

401
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,000
They have the A.I. and it is.

402
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,900
That's how it is.

403
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,320
And the voices is is a catch up

404
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:14,740
in the air.

405
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,460
You get to run a logic train on

406
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:17,560
it.

407
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,420
It's one of two things of both of

408
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:19,780
these things.

409
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,560
It's the A.I. that's actually doing it

410
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,920
or it's a leftover or let's say semi

411
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,340
-prominent species that is non-physical that is

412
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,800
still here and views us as being evasive

413
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,160
or they view us as being a host.

414
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,200
They're getting some energy from us by doing

415
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:36,460
that.

416
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,020
Well, lastly, I wonder this, you know, often

417
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,500
when people look for an either or answer

418
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,880
on this, it could be both.

419
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,340
Could it not?

420
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,260
That's what I'm saying.

421
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,100
I think it's both.

422
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,040
Now, I don't think it's all it could

423
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,260
be.

424
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,060
It could be all exclusively the A.I.

425
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,160
And there is no such species was replaced.

426
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,780
But is it possible to have a fully

427
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,760
automated farm or self-driving tractors and meters

428
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,080
for the water and self-harvesting and self

429
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,800
-planting and then have a primitive group living

430
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,700
on the sideline doing what they're doing to?

431
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,280
Yeah.

432
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,300
And in Star Wars, they had that.

433
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,260
Then what's that planet?

434
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,660
You know, they're the drone.

435
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,440
They would go around picking up drones and

436
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:13,720
stuff.

437
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,480
Those little sand people are not sand people.

438
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,080
The other ones.

439
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,280
Yeah.

440
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:16,720
Yeah.

441
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,400
The the Jawas would run around.

442
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,360
So I believe it's a combination of both.

443
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,520
But I would say the A.I. is

444
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,120
predominant.

445
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:23,880
There you go.

446
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,620
OK, so I have a question about nine

447
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,480
star key.

448
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,580
And more specifically, the magic square used for

449
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,280
prediction and how the numbers shift within the

450
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,360
square on a day.

451
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,200
Mostly, I don't know.

452
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,300
I don't know about the magic square enough

453
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,140
to talk about it.

454
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,860
OK, I would like to ask Greek if

455
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,420
he uses the magic square.

456
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,540
OK, you already know that in his life

457
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,760
for timing things, but OK.

458
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
The idea of going along or against the

459
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,180
current.

460
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,920
OK, but what about going along with or

461
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,040
against the current of atmospheric flow?

462
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,200
Yeah, that's whether that's a weather question.

463
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,360
OK, so that's a weather.

464
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,360
It's kind of a combination.

465
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:02,920
That's fine.

466
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,760
That's fine.

467
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,100
If you go with the flow, you're going

468
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,500
to get cooling and blocking.

469
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,680
If you go against the flow, you're going

470
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,500
to get warming and discharge.

471
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,280
OK.

472
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,500
Anyone who is at the weather seminar, I

473
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,440
might want to do another weather seminar just

474
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,340
to interject, I'm still getting people emailing about

475
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,700
joining free classes and paid classes, no matter

476
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,020
what.

477
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,220
I mean, I'm in a transition right now,

478
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,740
setting up a lab, a water lab specifically

479
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,860
around the scale of radar.

480
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,800
And that's why I said I wanted to

481
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,660
do it pretty much in the springtime before

482
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,080
spring is over is a good time.

483
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,320
And also I wanted to do the food

484
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,260
seminar before anything else because you got to

485
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,420
eat, right?

486
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,720
You want to know this stuff before your

487
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,220
next meal.

488
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,560
So your next meal will be delicious.

489
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,640
So I don't know.

490
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,340
I might do a short free food seminar.

491
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,380
But you know how I am.

492
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,520
It's nothing short.

493
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,780
And I think, you know, so and I

494
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,920
deserve to see the information is free, but

495
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,600
my time isn't right now and it really

496
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,540
isn't available.

497
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,920
So I don't know how we're going to

498
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,160
work that out yet.

499
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,500
I still haven't announced it, but everyone beware

500
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,320
that I would give a minimum of 10

501
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,660
days to two weeks notice.

502
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,000
So it's not like I'm going to say

503
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,820
I'm doing the fee based seminar in three

504
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,380
days and no one you know, people don't

505
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,760
find out you'll have plenty of time.

506
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,140
I'll do an email blast, you know, Skype

507
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,400
blast, whatever.

508
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,580
If I've got you in ever communicated with

509
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,980
you ever, I will communicate that there's a

510
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,680
class going.

511
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,060
Yeah.

512
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,780
So I'll try and let people know on

513
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,280
my list that are, you know, associated with

514
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:31,840
you as well.

515
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,960
You know when.

516
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,460
Yeah.

517
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,880
And it's not like you're going to miss

518
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,140
it.

519
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,340
It'll be recorded and it's going to be

520
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,840
three three hour sessions.

521
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,160
Not this stuff.

522
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,540
You know, the real look when when I

523
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,240
when when I was exposed to classes that

524
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,640
were the real deal, they were eight hour

525
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,220
long and 10 hours long.

526
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,020
They were, you know, if anyone, heaven forbid

527
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,960
you work in the medical or legal profession

528
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,820
when they do their class seminars, it's the

529
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,400
entire day.

530
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,780
Seven in the morning to seven o'clock

531
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,220
at night.

532
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:58,520
Right.

533
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,740
And that's just even just just to cover

534
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,440
the news to not really full.

535
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,140
Yeah.

536
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,520
But the way I'm going to present it,

537
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,460
it'll be recorded.

538
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,760
I'm thinking of doing some bullet point stuff

539
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,800
so you don't have to go through a

540
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,140
recording.

541
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,700
I don't know.

542
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,760
I would like to partner up with someone

543
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,220
on it.

544
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,520
And if I hint, hint, someone wants to

545
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,440
partner up with me on on setting it

546
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,680
up and all that, that'd be great.

547
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,440
So far, no one's come forward.

548
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,980
I've got a way of setting up chapters

549
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,280
and stuff on an audio recording, which we

550
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,220
could do without too much of a problem.

551
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,980
It's almost as good as an audio book,

552
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,980
basically.

553
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,320
Yeah.

554
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,620
So let's just see if we run out

555
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,040
of time.

556
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,960
Maybe we'll do it, you know, via this.

557
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,480
It'll be a fee based, though, because this

558
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,300
way it's separate.

559
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,640
We can put it in a separate part

560
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,040
of the page.

561
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,960
Look, I'll definitely announce it on the page

562
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,080
when you announce it.

563
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,120
But if you want, we could possibly put

564
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,460
it in the page out in a special

565
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,960
section that it's like, you know, you can

566
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,740
come and get it here and then that's

567
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,800
a separate fee or whatever.

568
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,540
That's up to you.

569
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,740
But but I'm just saying that's one of

570
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,940
the things that could happen or we could

571
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,660
put it there afterwards up to you also.

572
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:04,079
So, you know.

573
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,400
Yeah.

574
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,359
But I do really have to focus.

575
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,700
We'll see, because three I mean, I'll commit

576
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,960
to it if I commit to it.

577
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,579
But it's I'm getting like almost every minute

578
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:15,040
of my day squeezed out of me, not

579
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,240
because anyone's doing it.

580
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,500
I know how to tell people to back

581
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,240
off and give good time limits for myself.

582
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,819
I always you know, if I know something

583
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:23,180
takes a week, I'm going to tell you

584
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,619
a month.

585
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,800
So you'll get it in two weeks and

586
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,300
be like, wow, he really delivered.

587
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:26,560
Right.

588
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:29,980
So, yeah, the only thing on my personal

589
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,180
side is I'm getting a reputation I'm meeting

590
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,100
with these so-called water experts.

591
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,400
And they pretty much get destroyed after having

592
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,420
me on for three hours.

593
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,600
And they're like, oh, my God, this guy

594
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,160
is like the world water expert.

595
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,720
And I'm not.

596
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,920
But I just happen to be.

597
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,040
If that makes any sense.

598
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,540
It's kind of like that movie Idiocracy.

599
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,840
You know, he's the smartest guy in the

600
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,100
world.

601
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,740
And I'm like, oh, my God, this guy.

602
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,460
Not sure is the smartest guy in the

603
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:53,760
world.

604
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,600
He's got like an average going to fix

605
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,560
all our problems, fix everything.

606
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,140
That's what's happening.

607
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,460
And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no.

608
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,540
And they're like, yes, yes, yes.

609
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,420
I'm like, OK, then.

610
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:03,980
All right.

611
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,340
What was telling you to put water on

612
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:06,700
the crop?

613
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,420
Yeah, I look outside and everything's Carl's Jr.

614
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,920
And Brando, stop using Brando on everything.

615
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,980
I know you're getting paid, but stop using.

616
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,740
Yeah, but but here's the thing.

617
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,740
It's it's that's why I have more juice

618
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,380
and more rights and more.

619
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:21,920
What do you say?

620
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,040
Confirmation on me saying where everyone is here

621
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,680
to waste their time, boy, and I will

622
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,880
talk about it a little bit tonight.

623
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,260
I'm telling you, I'll give you reasons that

624
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:29,740
are solid.

625
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,180
And I love that people it gets when

626
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,280
people hear that you're here to waste your

627
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,260
time, not you specifically, but everyone.

628
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,300
It gets under some people's skin.

629
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,300
And that it's called triggering, right?

630
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:40,720
It does.

631
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,880
And you and you look at the reasons

632
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,220
why they're not wasting their time.

633
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,180
And you look at the reasons you're like,

634
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,220
oh, you really are wasting your time.

635
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,420
You know, so that's like so obvious.

636
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,480
So anyway, what else you got?

637
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,700
I'm going to ask you, I got one

638
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,520
last question here, and then we'll move on

639
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,020
to to that thing that you want to

640
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,380
discuss.

641
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,800
What are the Greeks thoughts on suicide?

642
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,800
OK, my cousin committed suicide a year ago,

643
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,780
and I wondered what effect would have such

644
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,660
an act on the spirit of the individual.

645
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,240
I know mainstream religious mostly condemned such an

646
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,480
act.

647
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,160
But what would be a more realistic assessment

648
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,000
is the more realistic assessment would be it's

649
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,680
the easy way out, no matter how painful

650
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,120
it is.

651
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,260
It's a lot less painful for, you know,

652
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,980
usually if you don't if you're going to

653
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:27,500
commit suicide and you don't do it within

654
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,760
three days of trying.

655
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,500
Right.

656
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,960
You're probably not going to do it.

657
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,760
You know, whatever.

658
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,380
It's it's a lot easier and quicker than

659
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,900
putting through a lifetime here.

660
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,000
Now, depends on what you consider, like most

661
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,960
people are completely oblivious and clueless.

662
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,180
So for them, it would be a terrible

663
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:44,600
thing.

664
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,600
For someone like myself, it would be a

665
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,120
godsend.

666
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:52,020
But I figured I would rather put up

667
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,180
in the if there's a zone between the

668
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,360
afterlife, because if we're reincarnated, we are in

669
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,460
the afterlife right now.

670
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:00,780
Right.

671
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,740
So it would be like, look at this

672
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,960
coward, you know, and I'm, you know, condolences

673
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,460
to anyone who knows who cared about someone

674
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,200
who killed themselves.

675
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:11,420
Yeah.

676
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,520
But you might be called a coward, this,

677
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,100
that or the other.

678
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,540
It's not condemned in the scriptures.

679
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,400
Let's say the Old Testament or the New

680
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,140
Testament even brought up.

681
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,160
There's no there's no it's not mentioned.

682
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:22,720
Right.

683
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,060
So it's not not even what is mentioned

684
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,300
as someone falling on their sword.

685
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:27,680
Yeah.

686
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,260
Oh, well, someone falling on their sword.

687
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,020
But it was not it was not viewed

688
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,340
as derogatory or demeaning or cowardly.

689
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,740
Just something that happens.

690
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,160
Right.

691
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,280
Because of the because they didn't want to

692
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,440
suffer the alternative, which is being captured by

693
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:40,800
an enemy.

694
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,680
Yeah.

695
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,640
But but OK.

696
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,400
So you don't want to suffer the alternative.

697
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,840
Let's expand that concept.

698
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,240
You don't want to suffer the alternative.

699
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,520
What is the difference, especially if reincarnation is

700
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:50,740
real?

701
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,120
It would be OK.

702
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,160
This is the alternative.

703
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,020
In this case, to be more specific, would

704
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,140
be taken prisoner by an enemy and then

705
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,660
degraded and then killed.

706
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,180
Yeah.

707
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,920
But that would be the fast way to

708
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,520
say, now, I think living here a normal

709
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,820
life is very degrading.

710
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,900
Unless you can.

711
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,240
Yeah.

712
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,280
Depends on what level you're at, you know,

713
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,620
and there are levels, but they're not vertical.

714
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,880
Like one is higher than the other.

715
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,300
They're all lateral, like inner circle, outer circle.

716
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,360
And the more you go towards the inner

717
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,880
circles, the more you see what's going on

718
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,740
in the outer circle.

719
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:20,960
Right.

720
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,400
Like you don't see the center of the

721
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,460
onion from the outside.

722
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,800
You have to get closer to the middle

723
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,880
that you look out.

724
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:27,880
Right.

725
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,780
And all this stuff about getting outside the

726
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,020
box.

727
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,620
No, you want to be in the box.

728
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,560
You want to be in the box, in

729
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,020
the very center of the box.

730
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,240
So you get the full vantage of the

731
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,920
box and everything through it, because the box

732
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,860
is translucent, transparent.

733
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,820
So, you know, I'm going to come up

734
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,840
with stuff that's contrary.

735
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,640
But no, I have no real thoughts on

736
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,480
it other than if you're given, let's say,

737
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,980
you know, the lot or the fate to

738
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,960
live through.

739
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:56,240
Do it.

740
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,440
Now, I do understand, like some people in

741
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,740
the early days of chemistry, they experimented with

742
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,920
chemistry so much that they ruined their fitness

743
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,680
level, their health so much that they had

744
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,420
to commit suicide because they're in such pain.

745
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:08,660
Right.

746
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,140
So there's levels like that.

747
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,820
But if there is a conscious level in

748
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,120
between, you're going to say, well, you know,

749
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,420
let's say there is reincarnation.

750
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,460
That means we're in an afterlife.

751
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,340
Now, let's say you kill yourself today.

752
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,560
In 40 days, you're born again, 40 or

753
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,500
let's say 55 days.

754
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,280
You'd be born into another.

755
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,160
But you want to.

756
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,540
Ooh, that's spooky.

757
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,460
It doesn't matter what level, you know, whether

758
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,040
you're born in the ghettos and in the

759
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,300
ditches of Calcutta and India as an untouchable

760
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,660
or a wealthy whatever in some court.

761
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,680
I think it's shit.

762
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,340
And I'll get into it.

763
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:44,600
Why?

764
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,540
It's the entire general thing.

765
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,460
But no, I have no real view on

766
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,160
it other than I think you should fight

767
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,600
it through.

768
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,900
In other words, go through your life.

769
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,100
And it is a fight, whether you know

770
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:55,560
it or not.

771
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,460
So I just see it as a drastic

772
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,140
overreaction, because the truth is, look, we're here

773
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,580
for sure.

774
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,740
Yeah, unless it's necessary.

775
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,080
Yeah.

776
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,120
You know, so to me, it's like but

777
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,280
it's a drastic overreaction.

778
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,160
People have to it when it happens also,

779
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,040
you know, and that's the thing.

780
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,180
That's all about the program.

781
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,480
Well, it's the program.

782
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,300
It's your culture.

783
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,860
The culture is your programming.

784
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,380
And the culture also dictates the family life.

785
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:18,620
Right.

786
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,480
Right.

787
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,500
You know, so because if you look at

788
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,780
what family life based on culture, they're all

789
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,500
pretty much the same, you know, so it

790
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,740
goes culture by culture.

791
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,180
And, you know, like, for example, if you

792
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,360
say, you know, the culture in Afghanistan, the

793
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,520
Pashtun people, well, if you when they move

794
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,600
over here and have a neighborhood here, let's

795
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,220
say in Chicago or New York or Tucson

796
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,560
or whatever, it's all it's they're going to

797
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,860
bring that same culture within their household here.

798
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,160
Right.

799
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,480
So it's not so the geography as much

800
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,380
as it is the culture.

801
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,580
So fair enough.

802
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,880
So I guess this is a good segue

803
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,780
to go into the constant battles you were

804
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,480
asked about or you were starting to discuss

805
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,580
in chat.

806
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:57,940
Yeah.

807
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,380
Yeah.

808
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,840
What brings this brings this up is I

809
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,580
really like Lookout for Charlie.

810
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,780
It's Lookout F.A. and then Charlie.

811
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,640
He just put up a video recently about

812
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,700
what are the Bolsheviks?

813
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,020
I recommend viewing it.

814
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,120
He put a pretty good.

815
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,240
It's not a political thing.

816
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,620
It's just to bring chaos, the antagonistic group

817
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,160
to bring chaos, mayhem and death.

818
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:17,880
That's what they do.

819
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,260
It's not just the Russians, the Bolshevik, by

820
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,840
the way, in Russian means majority, but it's

821
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,660
Bolshevism or something.

822
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,040
And that's where it came from.

823
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,880
It's not political.

824
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,900
So what you do is you figure out

825
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,180
what a counterculture would be.

826
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,640
So if you want to do the Bolshevik

827
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,940
maneuver in a Christian, let's say whatever mindset,

828
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,360
Western, you get the people that want to

829
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,240
be transvestites, drug users or whatever, pay it,

830
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,840
you know, whatever, whatever counterculture.

831
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,200
And you give them power to to fight

832
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,820
the culture, to bring it and get people

833
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,620
to subdue.

834
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,420
Right.

835
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,820
Because if you put all that, he made

836
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,220
a good point, like, you know, with the

837
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,100
trannies in sports, if you took all the

838
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,140
trannies that get into, let's say it's mostly

839
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,440
men going to women's sports.

840
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,640
If you took all the men that want

841
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,080
to be women and made their own team,

842
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,040
they wouldn't want to do it.

843
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,120
They only do it to inject themselves one

844
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,520
or two in the women's sports to ruin

845
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,320
women's sports.

846
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,660
Right.

847
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,040
Well, there is a way for them to

848
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,040
form a team anyway.

849
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,700
There's, you know.

850
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,360
Oh, sure.

851
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,560
Well, they make them there.

852
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,900
No one wants to be like that.

853
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,540
They're made that way, by the way.

854
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,560
You know, I made I find it really

855
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,920
fascinating how much time people spend on that,

856
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,360
considering how few people there are that this

857
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,960
is, you know, it's like talking about it.

858
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,740
Well, it's the media control the media.

859
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,500
All the media has always have been.

860
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,380
So, OK, for example, the National Socialist Movement

861
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,800
in Germany, which are called the Nazis, which

862
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,540
is a derogatory term, by the way, was

863
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,340
if they didn't develop the that they would

864
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,400
have gone just like the Soviet Union was

865
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,300
stuck in the book because Bolsheviks.

866
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,700
So anyone can go research.

867
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,440
There was a video.

868
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,600
I think it was taken down.

869
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,860
Guy did his research.

870
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,420
And after World War one, all the way

871
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:59,160
to the 30s, Berlin was the heroin capital

872
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,740
capital heroin usage capital of the world.

873
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,980
It was like 60 percent of the women

874
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,260
were prostitutes.

875
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,280
30 percent of the 60 percent women were

876
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,640
pregnant prostitutes.

877
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,840
10 percent of the men were transvestite.

878
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,600
Every form, everything that you saw going on

879
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,520
with the woke movement was going on in

880
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:18,800
Germany.

881
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,800
And the people were silent because the media

882
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,060
and the universities started publishing books to say

883
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,520
how great it was, just like now.

884
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:27,880
Right.

885
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,280
The same thing.

886
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,340
Everything that's been going on since the 2020

887
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,180
with the Bidens and all that was going

888
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,420
on identical in Berlin.

889
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,640
And then the National Socialist Party stepped in

890
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,700
and said no more.

891
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,560
That's what that was.

892
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,840
The anti-Jewish movement really was against this

893
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,440
academia.

894
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,400
And then it just spread because, you know,

895
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,560
people always just like look after 9-11,

896
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,080
because there were supposedly Muslims involved.

897
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,320
There were there were people that were from

898
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:56,680
India.

899
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,500
What were they called?

900
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,360
There were turbans, Sikhs.

901
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,240
There were Sikhs that were gunned down and

902
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,740
beaten up at gas stations.

903
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,140
Right.

904
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:05,680
Yeah.

905
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,340
For 9-11.

906
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,000
S.I.K.H. I worked at a

907
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,600
gas station around 9-11.

908
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,700
And, yeah, I actually they don't cut their

909
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:11,960
hair.

910
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,500
They wrap their beard because hair is cutting

911
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,420
your hair is mutilation.

912
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:14,900
Right.

913
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,640
Yeah.

914
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,020
I had a Sikh, someone that when we

915
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,160
had the restoration business, he was a Sikh.

916
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,700
Golu was his name.

917
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,480
And yeah, and people said, well, because they

918
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,020
look that way, we have to beat them

919
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,360
up.

920
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,240
You know what I mean?

921
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:30,660
Yeah.

922
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,720
And that's how the anti-Semite movement started

923
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,300
in Germany.

924
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,960
And they just let it go, run away.

925
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,060
People don't know the real history of that.

926
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,080
And you know, you're not going to get

927
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,780
out of these history books because when you

928
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,000
pick up a history book, does it say

929
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,720
the true history of so-and-so or

930
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,240
just says history, just says history.

931
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,020
So it's bullshit.

932
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,260
So mixed in with it, you know.

933
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,420
But yeah, that's anyway, we went from this

934
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,320
to that, to the other.

935
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,220
But anyway, constant battles.

936
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,240
Look out for Charles.

937
00:27:59,320 --> 00:27:59,460
Yeah.

938
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,340
Look out for Charlie's last video.

939
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,480
I looked at the video you talked about.

940
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,000
I had no problem with the audio, but

941
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,880
that's fine with a site like that.

942
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,220
You got to help them out if you

943
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:08,500
can.

944
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,200
If you disagree with him, put a comment

945
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,140
in there respectfully.

946
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,460
He usually gets back and he'll correct it.

947
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,080
The other thing is he I wanted.

948
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,760
I don't have the time to invite him

949
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,220
or do it, but he knows nothing about

950
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,520
the money system at all.

951
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,700
He was in a car accident.

952
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,040
The insurance money didn't help.

953
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,160
You know, if if you go to an

954
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,220
insurance company and it's a million dollars worth

955
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,580
of damages, they only want to give you

956
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,180
20 grand.

957
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,500
You know, they got the million and they're

958
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
keeping it themselves.

959
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,060
And they're just giving you 20 grand.

960
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,580
And this happened with North Carolina and hurricanes

961
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,320
and all that stuff.

962
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,560
All you got to do is go change

963
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,300
the terms and services and say, you know,

964
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,140
I'm taking back full security interest.

965
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,800
I need the entire amount, because when I

966
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,740
wrote on a piece of paper that it's

967
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,460
a million dollars that I need, you got

968
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,120
it and I could prove it because you

969
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,660
go to here, here, here, here.

970
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,340
And this is how you got it.

971
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,860
And they still they're not going to just

972
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,780
roll over, give it to you, but at

973
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,680
least you're working on something that will get

974
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,340
you that right.

975
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,560
So he doesn't know anything about the money

976
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:03,960
system.

977
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,760
And most people don't and they probably never

978
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:06,100
will.

979
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,400
But that's part of this thing.

980
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,040
It's all a constant fight.

981
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,860
So you're born the constant fight before.

982
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,860
This is the preface.

983
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,560
We have about 60 centuries of history.

984
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,620
OK, we're in almost none of it.

985
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,300
Almost nothing.

986
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,340
If you look at 60 centuries of history,

987
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:29,160
technology, innovation, development, almost none of it applies

988
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,440
today in any way where people say, I

989
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,500
can make that decision because I know 60

990
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,460
cent, you know, almost 6,000 years of

991
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,720
blah, blah, blah.

992
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,280
No one people are walking around just as

993
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,860
primitive as they would have been if you

994
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,580
only had a hundred years of human history.

995
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,520
So, so first of all, time doesn't make

996
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:49,800
it better.

997
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,000
By the way, I'm going to interject this

998
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,960
little character stuff.

999
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,680
Whenever you run into someone in a trade

1000
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,000
or a business and the first thing they

1001
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,540
say, I've been doing this for 20 years,

1002
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,100
I've been doing this for 35 years, I'm

1003
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,760
this for 10 years.

1004
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,500
That is the most insecure person.

1005
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,180
I would not want that person's services unless

1006
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:07,880
I had to.

1007
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,100
I had no choice.

1008
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:09,520
Why?

1009
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,420
If the first thing you have to project

1010
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,920
is how many years of experience you have

1011
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,960
and you fall for that, well, you deserve

1012
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,540
the rest.

1013
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,180
You get it?

1014
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,920
Because someone has 30 years of experience doing

1015
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,460
whatever, whatever.

1016
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,120
Now there's several ways to look at it.

1017
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,220
It's 30 years of edifying and growing and

1018
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:31,880
developing it.

1019
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,780
Or you really have one year experience 30

1020
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,380
times.

1021
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,500
In other words, what you're still doing, what

1022
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,340
you did when you only had one year

1023
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,400
experience because you're lazy, whatever.

1024
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,720
And most people I found out through the

1025
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,280
character, if the first thing they project is

1026
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,460
how many years experience they have, I avoid

1027
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:49,700
them.

1028
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
I'm like, you got anybody else?

1029
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,620
I would rather have someone with a month's

1030
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,220
experience that's better at that service than someone

1031
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,800
with 30 years experience that just puts it.

1032
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,680
And one of the signs that they're insecure,

1033
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,620
they're not confident is the, that's the first

1034
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,480
thing they put in front of you.

1035
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,420
So just pay attention.

1036
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,860
Whenever you do it, looking for a serve

1037
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,980
someone in the service industry.

1038
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,140
And the first thing they put in front

1039
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,480
of you in an ad, when they speak

1040
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,920
or whatever, um, they're, they're, they're giving you

1041
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,780
a facade.

1042
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,880
And when you get past that curtain, you'll

1043
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,220
notice they're not very good at what they

1044
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,340
do because people that are good at what

1045
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,900
they do, don't bring that kind of stuff

1046
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,140
up.

1047
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,180
Right.

1048
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:28,920
Yeah.

1049
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,640
So anyway, um, so this is where we

1050
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,060
are right now.

1051
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,800
If anyone comes here and sees humanity says,

1052
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,840
you guys have 60 centuries, almost 6,000

1053
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,100
years of history, and this is how you're

1054
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,380
living.

1055
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,960
This is what you know, what a bunch

1056
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,400
of idiots, because I've said this many times

1057
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,840
on Sonics for decades, that all of your

1058
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,660
science, all your whatever, whatever, whatever that you

1059
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,820
consider your development and your state of the

1060
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,240
art or whatever, as less than 150 years

1061
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,060
old, right?

1062
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,720
Let your medicine, everything up until the 1920s

1063
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,400
was abandoned.

1064
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,320
All of your medicine is from 1920s, 1930s,

1065
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,840
the Flexner, you know, 1912, whatever it was

1066
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,420
in after.

1067
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,260
Right.

1068
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:08,500
So what happened?

1069
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,040
So why are you constantly throwing stuff away?

1070
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,360
I caught one of Jason Brashear's local, uh,

1071
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,600
last, uh, videos.

1072
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,080
And I'll make a comment there also.

1073
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,180
I enjoyed it.

1074
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,180
Not the last one, several ones about what,

1075
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,640
about the, the compendium or nexus of archaics,

1076
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,840
you know, from the beginning, then it was

1077
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,700
a good thing to show a beginner.

1078
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,240
Um, and he said, basically, there's a lot

1079
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,700
of commentary by historians and philosophers that earth

1080
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,280
is a history of just catastrophe after catastrophe

1081
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,080
after catastrophe.

1082
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,920
But if you ask a typical surface dwelling

1083
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,880
earth inhabitant, he doesn't, they're not aware of

1084
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,500
that at all.

1085
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,160
So part of being human is not being

1086
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,360
aware at all about anything other than what's

1087
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,020
put in front of you.

1088
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,880
It's like the goldfish effect.

1089
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,240
How many times have you ever brought up

1090
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,060
something that happened more than two weeks ago

1091
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:54,680
to a normie?

1092
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,720
And they said, Oh, it was too long

1093
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:55,940
ago.

1094
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,840
That was two weeks ago.

1095
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,060
That doesn't matter now.

1096
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:58,800
Right.

1097
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,680
So you're in this stupor, this, this dull

1098
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,700
effect where no one, it's really bad.

1099
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,500
And you haven't no accumulation of anything.

1100
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,020
Now put that aside.

1101
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,200
Cause that's your wisdom and knowledge base, right?

1102
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,900
Like one thing I was doing with the

1103
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,180
financial seminar or when he, anything that I

1104
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,060
teach, whether whatever it's a get the information,

1105
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:20,800
but that's good.

1106
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,780
But it's not necessarily everything because do you

1107
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,860
have the wisdom to use that information?

1108
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,380
Right.

1109
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,860
So you have the wisdom when, and the

1110
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,720
wisdom is, you know, how, when, and you

1111
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,220
know, how much of it should you use

1112
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,760
or should this be considered?

1113
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,760
And that's the thing when they do you

1114
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,340
have the wisdom to see what's going on,

1115
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,540
not just information.

1116
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,860
People think it's just information.

1117
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,540
It's not to make the right decision.

1118
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:43,840
Okay.

1119
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,420
When you put all that aside, look at

1120
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,940
when you're born, the very few other species

1121
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,240
other than the hermit crab, right.

1122
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,220
Which is looking for a shell.

1123
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:51,960
You have no clothing.

1124
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,360
If you're, it's called exposure, a child will

1125
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:54,640
die.

1126
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,300
If it's exposed, right.

1127
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,640
You have to hunt and forage for food,

1128
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,840
mostly forage and do agriculture because you really

1129
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,440
cannot go out and eat whatever's in your

1130
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,500
environment without some level of preparation or agriculture.

1131
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:07,940
Yeah.

1132
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,900
You got to do something to it.

1133
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,139
Right.

1134
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,980
You either got to cut it up, split

1135
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,659
it, cook it.

1136
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:11,900
Yeah.

1137
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,179
Something.

1138
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:13,100
Yeah.

1139
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,520
And you've people have heard me in the

1140
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,699
recent say that I've always given advice to

1141
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:17,920
people who want to go live off the

1142
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,100
grid.

1143
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:18,860
Don't do it.

1144
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,719
You're going to find your energy cost is

1145
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,080
going to be five to 10 times more.

1146
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,440
And you're going to find out everything around

1147
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,620
you wants to kill you.

1148
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,260
Oh no, but we're going to be living

1149
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,159
near crater lake.

1150
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:27,659
It's beautiful.

1151
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,420
I said, oh, okay.

1152
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:28,739
All right.

1153
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,179
Talk to me about when you come back.

1154
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,360
They're like, oh, Greek.

1155
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:31,620
You're right.

1156
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,739
Everything wants to kill us.

1157
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,860
Doesn't matter if you're in the mountains on

1158
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,400
the Prairie in the desert, it doesn't matter

1159
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,900
what in the tropics, everything around you wants

1160
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,460
to kill you.

1161
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,000
Because the epitome of man, he always starts

1162
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,280
in a garden ends up in a city

1163
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,179
of the highest evolution, meaning unraveling or development

1164
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:52,420
for humans is to be in a city,

1165
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,920
an efficient city.

1166
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:54,280
Right.

1167
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,300
So it's like it or not.

1168
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,360
I mean, Hey, okay.

1169
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,900
Now the fight, you have the social aspect.

1170
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,200
Now that's the nature that wants to kill

1171
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,420
you.

1172
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,480
You need shelter and all this until you

1173
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,600
need to provisions.

1174
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,560
Then you have the characters within your society

1175
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,360
that want to kill you, right?

1176
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,000
Well, not necessarily want to kill you, but

1177
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,220
you could be stolen from, you can be

1178
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,700
robbed, you could be raped and murdered.

1179
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,020
Right.

1180
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,860
And in some cases it's in more places

1181
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,180
than others, especially when you have police, right

1182
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,560
around.

1183
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,620
So, uh, and or a semi militant, uh,

1184
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,120
what's called paramilitary in the society.

1185
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,240
So they, they want to kill you.

1186
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,160
You have treachery amongst people that are close

1187
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,340
to you, right.

1188
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,200
That want to fight you.

1189
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:37,480
Right.

1190
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,780
And then you have the big social thing

1191
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,540
with wars.

1192
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,940
One group, one collective wants to fight another

1193
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,380
collective, right?

1194
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,840
Again, the battle.

1195
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,380
Okay.

1196
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,480
Now within going back to the social, uh,

1197
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,460
you have groups of people like the Bolsheviks

1198
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,020
that are, that are put poison in your

1199
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,600
food, poison in your water.

1200
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,240
Right.

1201
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,300
It's pretty clear.

1202
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,800
Uh, like they talk about food safety.

1203
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,720
There's so many chemicals in the food, you

1204
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,400
know, they all ran do this for food.

1205
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,540
You know, make sure you wash it.

1206
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,200
There was some idiot sheriff talking about we

1207
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,940
can't eat the lettuce in the fields because

1208
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,000
the illegals come and defecate in the field

1209
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,680
food safety.

1210
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,780
I'm like, what an idiot food safety.

1211
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,960
Look at what they're putting in children's food

1212
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,420
and all this other stuff.

1213
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,800
What complete moron.

1214
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,580
Um, so you have a fight here, a

1215
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,480
fight there, a fight there.

1216
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,020
If you deal with the medical people that,

1217
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,480
first of all, they don't know anything.

1218
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,320
And that was the other thing, not to

1219
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,320
disparage, but archaics had an ad.

1220
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,300
It was a holistic alternative, uh, healer.

1221
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,660
I was just laughing my ass off.

1222
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,860
I said, Oh my gosh, just, yeah, whatever.

1223
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,640
They don't know anything there.

1224
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,440
You know why they're, uh, the, the, the

1225
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,440
alternative is worse than the mainstream because it's

1226
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,180
a false hope and they don't know, they

1227
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,040
don't know what they're doing.

1228
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,160
Ask any alternative.

1229
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,540
Is the heart a pump?

1230
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,720
What do they say?

1231
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,320
I had someone I've told you more than

1232
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,780
once say Greek, this person's a doctor, but

1233
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,420
no, no, no Greek.

1234
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,160
They're pretty cool.

1235
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,080
They have this stuff that naturally gets you

1236
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,340
your lower blood pressure.

1237
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,740
I'm like, dude, there's no such thing as

1238
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,300
blood pressure.

1239
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,160
It's total fiction.

1240
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,860
Oh my gosh.

1241
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,860
You know, put them on, put them on.

1242
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,180
And you know what the first thing they

1243
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,940
said to me when I brought up a

1244
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,440
little thing, I have 30 years experience as

1245
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:20,940
a medical.

1246
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,240
Oh my God.

1247
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,220
Boom.

1248
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,280
I got no time for this idiot.

1249
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,140
Right?

1250
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,960
So, and they're all like that because here's

1251
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,300
the thing.

1252
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,680
They cannot exist in the field in good

1253
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,560
conscious once they find out how the human

1254
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,260
body works.

1255
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,440
I haven't found any exceptions in any field.

1256
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,160
It doesn't matter.

1257
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,500
Dentistry, chiropractic, alternative, this, that, whatever.

1258
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,180
None of them know what's going on.

1259
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,160
You know, the blood pressure thing, the blood

1260
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,460
pressure thing brings up a question that I

1261
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,060
can't remember if I got to it a

1262
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,100
couple of Sonics ago, but it just came

1263
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,840
back to my mind.

1264
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,340
And I think I might've forgot to ask

1265
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,680
it, which is, you know, somebody said, okay,

1266
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,040
blood pressure is nonsense, but it indicates something.

1267
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,060
Yeah.

1268
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,740
It's like without getting technical, I used to

1269
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,160
be able to recite all the technical.

1270
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,720
It's the pause between beats.

1271
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,060
Within the beat, there's really like a double

1272
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,360
beat.

1273
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,000
The heart beats is a beat that's measured.

1274
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,880
Then there's another beat that's measured at the

1275
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,580
point of measurement known as the cuff.

1276
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,460
They wanted to know what could, could there

1277
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,000
be something useful in that information?

1278
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,680
That's how they wanted to know.

1279
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,080
No.

1280
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,480
And I'll prove, I'll prove it here.

1281
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,740
Well, I can't prove it, but this is

1282
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,740
how it was proved to me.

1283
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,300
Back in the eighties, there was the, the,

1284
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,860
these medical could have been a red cross

1285
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,340
or some international health group, whatever.

1286
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,360
They went over to investigate, uh, where centurions

1287
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:40,640
live.

1288
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,620
Like people live over a hundred places like

1289
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,760
Crete, Okinawa, uh, Valley here, you know, where

1290
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,320
it's known where a lot of people have

1291
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,520
the most people live over a hundred.

1292
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,340
So they visited, I read the long form,

1293
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,780
the long story about it.

1294
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,800
And they couldn't find them because they were

1295
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,820
out working these people over a hundred.

1296
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,700
They were out, you know, just like everybody

1297
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,060
else.

1298
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,860
And then what they did was they took

1299
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,220
blood tests and blood pressure.

1300
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,100
Their blood pressure was the highest they've ever

1301
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:06,460
measured.

1302
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,380
And their blood sugar was the highest they've

1303
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,240
ever measured.

1304
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,840
So if they would have lived in this

1305
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,320
society, they would have never made it that

1306
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,100
long because they would have been on the

1307
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,640
fake diabetes drugs and blood pressure drugs.

1308
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,580
They would have made it past 60 or

1309
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,400
70 never.

1310
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,140
There's no way.

1311
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:21,500
Right.

1312
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,700
And I do have a pretty one day

1313
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,620
we'll talk about, uh, if you do take

1314
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,620
the drugs for diabetes, which isn't, there's no

1315
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,300
way to measure blood glucose, by the way,

1316
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,060
the way they're telling you, it's, it's like

1317
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,840
the PCR test just as accurate.

1318
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,240
And I don't believe they're selling strips for

1319
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,460
people and all these devices.

1320
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,920
Um, imagine a home PCR test.

1321
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,900
I'm going to run out and get one

1322
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,620
of those for sure.

1323
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,080
Right.

1324
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,320
Right.

1325
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,540
That's where the suicide part comes in.

1326
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,340
But, and the blood pressure, uh, what are

1327
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,700
the symptoms and how many various other diseases

1328
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,820
arise from that?

1329
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,460
And what they are specifically.

1330
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,640
And you could see specifically what they're giving

1331
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,060
you to cure non-existent things like diabetes

1332
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,540
and, um, blood pressure specifically how, what it

1333
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:01,860
does.

1334
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,160
And you'll see like, Oh my gosh, this

1335
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,440
is all public information.

1336
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,120
Yeah.

1337
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,200
There's like, there's like what, 30 million people,

1338
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,480
40 million people on blood pressure medication, just

1339
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,020
as many on diabetic medication.

1340
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,340
So you're looking at a hundred million people,

1341
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,440
uh, a year, let's say accounted for they're

1342
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,320
on a death sentence.

1343
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,840
Uh, yeah.

1344
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,780
So anyway, like if you know, grandpa or

1345
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,000
your parents or older person, and they're sitting

1346
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,520
in a chair watching TV and suddenly they

1347
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,700
stop breathing and the ambulance doesn't get there

1348
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,180
in time and they're dead, that's blood pressure

1349
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,700
medication.

1350
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,040
We can get into all this stuff.

1351
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,560
And I could show you specifically because like

1352
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,540
we did specifically on the AIDS, we like

1353
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,560
getting into the chemistry stuff, what that is.

1354
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:38,820
Right.

1355
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,640
Um, so it's the treatment that's actually the

1356
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,100
disease.

1357
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,620
How about a fight there?

1358
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,120
How many people know that the med would

1359
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,140
say the medical industry is corrupt and dangerous.

1360
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,740
Just about most people, I'd say 50, 50.

1361
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,620
But where do they go?

1362
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,500
Where are they going to go to an

1363
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,260
alternative doctor for what, for what, what's the

1364
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,120
alternative going to do?

1365
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:00,860
Nothing.

1366
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,580
So with all the fighting and all the

1367
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,400
things against your food is totally toxic.

1368
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,140
By the way, most people have never had

1369
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,460
real food, especially Americans never in their lives.

1370
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,460
If you were born after 1930, let's just

1371
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,600
say 19, especially after world war II, when

1372
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,860
all the chemicals were put in.

1373
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,180
So what it is is I've always said

1374
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:22,660
this before.

1375
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,940
It's all this stuff, the fighting and the

1376
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,800
contra energy against you, the contradictions that are

1377
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,660
put on you and you're still here as

1378
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,280
a species, um, is a Testament to the

1379
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,940
robustness of the human condition, both physical and

1380
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,300
mental.

1381
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:41,360
Because I think the, the attack, the physical

1382
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,860
attacks, like the, the microwave attacks, the sound

1383
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:48,080
attacks would look out for Charlie talks about

1384
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,340
as these are audible sounds.

1385
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,480
It's not microwave stuff.

1386
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,760
So it's being on that level.

1387
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:52,540
Right.

1388
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:56,040
Um, and all these other things, I think

1389
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,220
it's better that people don't know that it's

1390
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:58,800
going on.

1391
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,980
It's better to not know that the doctors

1392
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,400
don't know anything and they're just playing.

1393
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,520
They're literally, the doctors are literally playing doctor

1394
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,500
if whatever that term means.

1395
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:08,840
Right.

1396
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:14,020
And the attorneys are practicing, you know, attorneys

1397
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,640
don't know anything about law.

1398
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,300
So you have all these 6 million people

1399
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:21,360
that are illegally and unlawfully in prison, all

1400
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,800
of them, all of them, unless you've gone

1401
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,740
through a superior court or Supreme court, uh,

1402
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,420
it's all illegal.

1403
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,400
So, and if you ask the attorney generals,

1404
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,660
why they say, well, they agreed to it.

1405
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,660
They won't even bother defending their position.

1406
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,220
So here's the thing.

1407
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,760
This is a Testament of how robust people

1408
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:36,960
are.

1409
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,940
And in order for this punishment or whatever

1410
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,160
condition exists to go on, they have to

1411
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,420
not be aware and they're doing a very

1412
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:45,260
good job at it.

1413
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,260
Like in other words, they're relying on the

1414
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,320
people being unaware and the people are very

1415
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:49,860
reliable.

1416
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,460
So again, it's a consciousness thing because you're

1417
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,200
being destroyed on a physical side, on every

1418
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,380
side, right?

1419
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:02,800
Not destroyed, but decimated decimated means one 10th.

1420
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,560
Right.

1421
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,560
Um, I've had real food.

1422
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,520
I've had real water and it is nothing,

1423
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,460
nothing like back to the food, which is

1424
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:10,740
a thing.

1425
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,060
I, when I was going around the Midwest

1426
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,680
central part of the country, doing plaster mining

1427
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,060
with, um, uh, people that worked for Carl

1428
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,500
Meyer, whose name was called, he was the

1429
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,200
uranium King.

1430
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,680
He was the biggest uranium mine.

1431
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,780
You'd actually look up uranium, uranium King, Carl

1432
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:27,120
Myers.

1433
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:28,120
He died in 2015.

1434
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,940
So it was around 2007, 2008, his own,

1435
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,040
the chair, chair, chair people took over the

1436
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:35,440
company.

1437
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,180
Yeah.

1438
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,440
Um, and then it fell apart, but I

1439
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,420
was, uh, when you're, when you're going from

1440
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,940
mine to mine, you know, mines are usually

1441
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:46,680
like, can be a couple of hours outside

1442
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,900
the nearest town even.

1443
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,280
Right.

1444
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:51,340
So when you went places you weren't put

1445
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,100
up in hotels, you just knew someone, knew

1446
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,660
someone there and you stayed over with them.

1447
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,280
So I stayed over here, stay over there,

1448
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,520
New Mexico, Colorado.

1449
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,840
I mean, uh, our places, Arizona, Texas, that

1450
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,420
whole area, your four corners area, whatever white

1451
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:04,840
people.

1452
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,560
And I ate what they ate, did what

1453
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:07,920
they did.

1454
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,640
And I felt sick, low energy, whatever.

1455
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:13,380
And I was like, I was asking him,

1456
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,140
how do you feel?

1457
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,040
And they're like, I feel fine.

1458
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,280
I said, no, you don't.

1459
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,820
There's no way you could feel fine and

1460
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,900
eating this was his hot pockets and whatever

1461
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,960
you're eating every day.

1462
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,760
This is family stuff.

1463
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,580
So they're already really sick.

1464
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,560
So the food thing is very, very important

1465
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,100
to get them into a more physical wellbeing.

1466
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:35,700
Because I remember I couldn't think straight eating

1467
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,420
what they ate.

1468
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:36,700
Right.

1469
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,800
Uh, you know, whatever.

1470
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,180
I still, you know, I clean it through

1471
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,740
his pork, no pork on my fork.

1472
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:42,060
Right.

1473
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,580
Uh, but they ate just junk.

1474
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,280
I mean, like stuff you buy, you know,

1475
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,880
ready-made at Walmart or low quality iceberg

1476
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:51,680
lettuce and hot house tomatoes was a salad

1477
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,160
with some kind of wishbone dressing.

1478
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,080
That's all toxic.

1479
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:55,520
Right.

1480
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,200
So, and this is what I saw.

1481
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,840
So it's like, if you want to know

1482
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,560
how these people feel, go live with them

1483
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,020
for a week, eat their food.

1484
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,280
And then when you're feeling like that, see

1485
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,160
what kind of new information you're going to

1486
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:06,340
take.

1487
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:06,500
Yeah.

1488
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,260
You don't want to know you, you nothing.

1489
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,100
So they're, they're locked in spiritually or mentally.

1490
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,500
They turn on the tube, they go to

1491
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,920
church, they read the paper, whatever, if there

1492
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,760
is a paper anymore.

1493
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,180
And they're locked in mentally, they're locked in

1494
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:19,780
spiritually.

1495
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,140
Um, new Pope, by the way, it's not

1496
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,480
such a big deal, but I guess it

1497
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,520
is in some places, Leo or something.

1498
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:26,780
Yeah.

1499
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,100
I was going to ask you about that

1500
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,540
because, uh, Oh, how ridiculous.

1501
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,300
That's like new Mickey mouse.

1502
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,120
There's like, that stuff has nothing to do

1503
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:35,820
with anything.

1504
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,780
Are you so stupid to buy?

1505
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,800
I mean, I mean, yeah, look, people are

1506
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:42,320
so stupid.

1507
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,080
They don't even have to sell it anymore.

1508
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,660
They look for it.

1509
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:46,820
Try anything.

1510
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,600
Just think about that years ago.

1511
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,180
If they had to sell that shit or

1512
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,980
intimidate you now, it's like the people, Oh

1513
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:54,820
my gosh.

1514
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,520
So you're in a, so this is the

1515
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:57,960
point.

1516
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,720
The point is here.

1517
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,280
Everyone here is wasting their time.

1518
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,820
You're in a transition threshold.

1519
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,800
It's called your life.

1520
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,020
Unfortunately, it's what 60, 70, 80 years old,

1521
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,220
90 maybe.

1522
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,500
Um, the people that are happy here about

1523
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,460
everything are clueless, which if you're listening to

1524
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:15,920
me and comprehend what I'm saying, you're probably

1525
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:18,160
not one of them, but the person next

1526
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,580
to you probably is who knows.

1527
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:20,260
I hope not.

1528
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,600
Um, cause it ain't gonna last.

1529
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,660
But the point is just put up with

1530
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:25,840
it.

1531
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:26,860
It's a battle.

1532
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,220
Get a good night's rest.

1533
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,640
This is the most important thing.

1534
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,400
If you can have good food that makes

1535
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,600
you feel good, good company, you know, good

1536
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,900
conversation, halfway decent communication.

1537
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,700
If you can afford it, uh, you should

1538
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,440
want to afford good communication cause it's all

1539
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:42,980
communication.

1540
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,560
Uh, good food, a good clean place to

1541
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,220
rest clean.

1542
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,000
Right.

1543
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:51,140
Um, try to avoid what you see the

1544
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,300
majority doing, which is the Bolsheviks, right?

1545
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:54,980
Bolshevik means majority.

1546
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,300
And you'll be fine because you need to

1547
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,360
recover for the next day, which is going

1548
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,600
to be a little worse than the day

1549
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,040
before.

1550
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:01,960
Right?

1551
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:03,940
Because that's the whole thing today is a

1552
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,840
little worse than yesterday, but it's not going

1553
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,960
to be as bad as tomorrow.

1554
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,660
And if you know how to look for

1555
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,300
that, you'll see what I'm saying is true.

1556
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,760
And I sound like the ultimate pessimist, but

1557
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,480
no, sorry.

1558
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,060
You know, there's the suicide element, right?

1559
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,460
But do you want to really risk that?

1560
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,140
I mean, that's kind of like Russian roulette.

1561
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,720
Um, I think just be a trooper like

1562
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,420
they say in a warrior and just keep

1563
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,500
fighting through.

1564
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,300
Cause it's a fight without fighting.

1565
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,560
You're not fighting anything.

1566
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,940
Now there are people that lose it and

1567
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,260
they think they have to fight, right?

1568
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:35,460
Typically it's a, they bought into that idea.

1569
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,340
Uh, so just it's called endurance.

1570
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,340
You just have to endure it, man.

1571
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,680
And it's much better to have good food,

1572
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:43,280
good rest.

1573
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,140
Like when it's, you know, good food, good

1574
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,920
clothing, shelter, right?

1575
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:47,940
All that stuff.

1576
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:48,960
What really matters.

1577
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,600
So you can recover for the next day.

1578
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,760
Uh, and that's where, that's what it's about.

1579
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,040
The world ain't going to be a better

1580
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,440
place.

1581
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,440
It's going to get worse.

1582
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,460
It's slightly incrementally every day.

1583
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,080
Uh, so you're going to have to be

1584
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,300
able to recover from today's mess to deal

1585
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,260
with tomorrow's mess.

1586
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,000
And that's just how
