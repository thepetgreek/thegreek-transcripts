1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,040
Ah, Rated Y, Sonic Advent 2-3-3,

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,180
anyway, what it be, Greek, how are you?

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,640
Hey, that was quiet, I usually hear the

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,780
bumper or whatever they call it, I'm doing

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,100
alright.

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,120
Let's go for it.

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,480
You gave me a link by the way,

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,500
Alive Water in Canada, those guys have been

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,280
around for a long time, I remember seeing

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,240
them even before the Spring 2.0 days,

11
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:35,120
and vortexing water in a copper pipe doesn't

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,140
really do that much.

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,300
It does, it's better than not, otherwise I

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,760
would have gone that route, I've tried it.

15
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,720
It's marginally small improvement, yeah, but yeah, there's

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,300
a lot of stuff, I'm even with potential

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,600
clients now, they ask me, so what's the

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,920
best water structuring or water whatever device?

19
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,180
I'm like, the best?

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,600
I don't know, but this is what I

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,540
can do, and this is, you know, and

22
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,380
no exaggeration, and if you feel like, you

23
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,920
know, you really want to know, you have

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,500
to try it.

25
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,780
It's like, you know, you ever ask someone

26
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,360
what they thought of that movie, you know,

27
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,940
and then you go see the movie yourself,

28
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,600
and it's like, it wasn't like that at

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,000
all, right?

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,660
So, I tell people, go buy them all,

31
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,940
buy everything, just do it all, I mean,

32
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,680
but yeah, we have no competition.

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,880
What I want us to throw out is,

34
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,520
you guys, I put enough, you go to

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,820
waterhelix.com and see what the scalerator looks

36
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,740
like, you know, it doesn't, you don't need

37
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,460
a, if you go shopping, you don't need

38
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,140
a $30,000 Hermes bag to put your

39
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,080
groceries in, as a matter of fact, they

40
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,000
give you cheap ones for free, and now

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,520
you got to pay 11 cents or whatever

42
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,980
for some places, and bring your own bag,

43
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,620
so the way you bring your own scalerator

44
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,980
is just go to thewaterhelix.com, and of

45
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,000
course, you're not going to be able to

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,980
bend pipe like that, I know it sounds

47
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,400
sarcastic, but no, you're not, you can try.

48
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,039
Well, you didn't say lay in pipe, you

49
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,860
said bending pipe, so, you know, I guess,

50
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,840
maybe it's the same thing?

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,260
Yeah, well, here's the thing, they're not going

52
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,120
to be able to make the device, but

53
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,940
what you can do is imitate everything that's

54
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,080
going on, you just use a bunch of

55
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,280
45s, you just go to the hardware store,

56
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,480
and you spend, you're going to need at

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,200
least 8 to 10 45s, maybe 12, and

58
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,520
for one inch, they're going to cost you

59
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,300
like 10 bucks each, and figure another, so

60
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,880
200 bucks with the magnet, and you could

61
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,940
just start bending them around on a Sunday,

62
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,620
get a heat gun in case you got

63
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,140
to move things a little bit, because when

64
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,420
you're working with plastic, it's going to be

65
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,140
able to warm it up, and you could

66
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,100
actually mimic that, you can even mimic it

67
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,940
with just putting the 45s at 10 o

68
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,420
'clock, 1 o'clock, 8 o'clock, and

69
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,300
4 o'clock, and using T's on the

70
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,980
end with two magnets, I mean, there's so

71
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,700
many ways to mimic the scalarator geometrically, pretty

72
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,820
close, it won't be on, you'll get 90

73
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,140
% if you lay everything flat and centered,

74
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,940
and try it, so yeah, you just got

75
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,600
a bunch of squirrel noise back there, you

76
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,420
wire or something?

77
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,880
Yeah, yeah, I just moved something, because it

78
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,560
seemed to be wrong, so I just moved

79
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,820
it, sorry about that, didn't mean to make

80
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,140
noise.

81
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,820
Oh, that's fine, that's fine, but people ask

82
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,960
me all the time, like, what should I

83
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,920
read, right?

84
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:30,820
What do I say?

85
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,620
Read everything, try everything, you got to read

86
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,160
the shitty books too, because you got to

87
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,340
know what a shitty book is, if you

88
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,980
only read the good books, you wouldn't know

89
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,780
what a bad book was, right, so what

90
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,300
is it, I can't read everything, yes you

91
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,420
can, just read what comes across you, whatever

92
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,040
the echo puts in front of you, right,

93
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:53,040
ECCO, Earth Coincidence Control Office, it's God's field

94
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,600
office, right, you want to be simple, they

95
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,580
control the long term, you control the short

96
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,380
term, when they say, when you figure out

97
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,740
how they do the long term, then you

98
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,300
never have to come back here anymore, so,

99
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,040
but you can play with these guys, in

100
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,060
other words, it's, what's that movie, guys used

101
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,080
to wear fedora hats and they controlled this

102
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,160
guy playing the senator, running for the senator,

103
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,100
Matt Damon, the Adjustment Bureau, the Adjustment Bureau

104
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,900
was totally on the ECCO, not as overt,

105
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,320
because it wouldn't, if you really, I guess,

106
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,160
you can't interact with the ECCO, maybe they

107
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,280
do, I don't know, whatever.

108
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,440
Well most people did in that movie either,

109
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,120
right, it was just because that was what

110
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,000
was special about the main character, is that

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
he knew what was going on, he tried

112
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,080
to fight it.

113
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
Yeah, and they went interviewing him, remember they

114
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,040
had another case back when, and yeah, but

115
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,760
you got to do everything, but you got

116
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,460
to do it in the way that it's

117
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,940
put in front of you, remember it's the

118
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,000
journey, not getting there, right, I never understood.

119
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,520
Some people do search for stuff though, like

120
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,380
we do have somebody asking again about, you

121
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,400
know, do you have a suggested, because I

122
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,080
can't find the literature, I can't find a

123
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,120
book, this person says, so you know, but

124
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,200
go ahead, yeah, go ahead.

125
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,840
Well everything works on, the entire ethereal, anything

126
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,020
alive, anything in weather, anything that was so

127
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,640
-called ether, right, the primary force, it's not

128
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,980
even a force, it's a substrate, is all

129
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,940
by induction, there's no material exchange other than

130
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,440
what we see directly called material exchange, but

131
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,860
most of the things that we think are

132
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,600
material exchanges, they even got everyone, well not

133
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,200
everyone, but yeah, I'd say statistically everyone, 90

134
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,360
% of the people convinced that they're actually

135
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,900
electrons moving down a wire, most idiotic thing,

136
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,400
you know, I've told you about my experiment

137
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,100
with cutting the wire with a dustpan and

138
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,840
a microscope and I cut the live wire

139
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,540
waiting for the electrons to fall on the

140
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,640
floor so I could scoop them up and

141
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,040
look under a microscope, yeah, that sounds ridiculous,

142
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,920
right, but that's how ridiculous they are and

143
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,540
they got these websites like Veritasium and some

144
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,740
other moron with physics, whatever, like 10 million

145
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,020
subscribers, millions, I mean it's like just hopeless,

146
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,200
that's why I'm like, you know, you got

147
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,580
more than a few thousand people listening to

148
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,060
you, you're tickling them, because people are idiots,

149
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,160
this is just the way that it is,

150
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,780
sorry, I mean I might be the only

151
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,600
one speaking, using these words, not strictly in

152
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,080
medical terms, but when I say idiot, I

153
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,520
mean in the medical, it's a medical term,

154
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,220
they don't like to use it anymore, and

155
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,620
look, I was having a discussion, someone says

156
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,120
a businessman, I said really, what do you

157
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,360
do when you get a bill of exchange

158
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,380
or like a bill, oh, I write a

159
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,440
check and pay it, I said you're not

160
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,760
much of a businessman, are you, you mean

161
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,260
pay for it twice, you ever go to

162
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,080
Starbucks, you know how they order, you order

163
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,520
the coffee, they put your name on the

164
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,020
cup, you pay for it then, and what

165
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,160
would you do if your coffee's ready, you

166
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,540
gotta pay for it again, and then you

167
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,040
gotta pay for it again when you walk

168
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,140
out the door, and plus they send you

169
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,500
a bill at home, would you do that,

170
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,140
no, pay for it four times, no, and

171
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,760
why are you doing the electric company and

172
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,900
the gas company and the car, no, and

173
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,660
the house, it's paid for three, four times

174
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,040
over, and I never heard of that, maybe

175
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,980
I should look into it, I said yeah,

176
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,140
you've been on this planet for more than

177
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:21,440
a month, you know, anyone that, well, anyone

178
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,860
that's known me since 2002, I'm saying, you

179
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,820
know, you sign your name on a piece

180
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,200
of paper, I get fully monetized, remember, I

181
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,460
used to be on Revolution Radio, and I

182
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,440
said, you know, when you guys fill out

183
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,120
applications and all that, you know, that's the

184
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,960
full monetization plus everything, and I've been telling

185
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,080
people this for 20 years, and it wasn't

186
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,020
until recently Brandon Joe Williams, you know, made

187
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,540
Fun and Simple and Discovering Mansa, and through

188
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,040
Brandon Joe and a couple of us said,

189
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,980
oh, look at these young guys, finally, because

190
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,480
when I got into it, it was, oh,

191
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,560
you stand up, my left leg again, I

192
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,440
gotta take a hot bath after this, Herb

193
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,740
Crawford and Roger Elvick, Rice McLeod, these people

194
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,540
were doing since the 80s and 90s, they

195
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,700
were buying in the Midwest with a draft,

196
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,040
just, you know, it looks like a check,

197
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,340
it's just a draft, you know, you just

198
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,380
go buy something that looks like a check,

199
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,900
they were buying tire companies and stuff in

200
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,620
the Midwest and all these big things, and

201
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,420
the FBI would come back and say, oh,

202
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,120
that's a fraudulent instrument, oh, it's all right,

203
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,500
you say it's fraudulent, give it back to

204
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,160
me, and they get a copy, and it

205
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,060
says received by the bank, so just writing

206
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,980
a few things on a piece of paper,

207
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,700
the bank uses it, man, there's no such

208
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,580
thing as a bad check unless you agree

209
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,200
to it, if you, you go into shops

210
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,080
and it says bad check, attorney general's message,

211
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,640
attorney general, whatever, says bad check writers will

212
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,240
be prosecuted, yeah, they're gonna also prosecute you

213
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,680
for stealing rocks from the moon, you'll probably,

214
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,040
they'll probably be able to get more evidence

215
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,860
on you for stealing rocks from the moon,

216
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,340
evidentiary, let's say stuff, case, than writing a

217
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,520
bad check, you cannot, it's impossible to write

218
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,640
a bad check, now, you don't know what's

219
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,920
going on and they tell you their funds

220
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,680
weren't there to cover it, and you agree

221
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,020
to it, you wouldn't know better, by the

222
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,180
way, if you write a check for someone

223
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,060
and you come back later on and you

224
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,380
see, let's say, $100 check, right, and they

225
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,040
took $100 out of your checking account, that's

226
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,180
100% banking fees you paid, there's no

227
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,380
reason for that, the person who you sent

228
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,420
the check to when they endorsed the back

229
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,120
of it, that bank that he did that

230
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,180
with produced $100 from that signature, the two

231
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,220
signatures, they see if there's signature front and

232
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,560
back, and then they told the other person's

233
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,040
bank, hey, we did that thing, you better

234
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,580
take $100 out of it because we're keeping

235
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,620
this show, this game going, and when they

236
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,700
do that, when you pay 100% banking

237
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,600
fees, anyone who's ever written a check or

238
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,760
done a debit thing, that's 100% banking

239
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,900
fees, so I was proposing with a bank,

240
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,720
listen, I'd be happy with 10% banking

241
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,600
fees, and when I explained to them what

242
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
they were doing, they thought I was crazy,

243
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,120
because how long have you been working in

244
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,900
a bank, 22 years, never heard of this,

245
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,400
and I showed them, this is how it

246
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,600
works, that's like going to a car mechanic

247
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,960
for 22 years and he doesn't know what

248
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,120
a steering wheel is, right, I said, look,

249
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,720
I write a check to someone for $100,

250
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,600
take $10 out of my account, 10%, if

251
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,900
I write $1,000, take $100, not the

252
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,900
full amount, that's all banking fees, because the

253
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,520
amount is created on the other end, wholly,

254
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,920
and completely, right, so one proposal is when

255
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,600
people figure this out, why are you doing

256
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,020
any kind of checking with 100% banking

257
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,260
fees, everyone needs to just possibly stop for

258
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,540
a few days, write a letter, just call

259
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,480
the bank, why are you charging me, there's

260
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,540
100 million, I don't know, 50 million people,

261
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,900
for three days, just say, hey, bank, I

262
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,400
have a checking account with you, why are

263
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,120
you charging me 100% banking, explain it,

264
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,140
it's a negotiable instrument, if it says pay

265
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,940
or order to pay or promise to pay,

266
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,420
the funds are generated from the instrument itself,

267
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,860
it's just bookkeeping, the other thing I suggest

268
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,480
to people is if you get a bill

269
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,480
and you don't know how to handle it,

270
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,260
right, you don't owe the money, it's all,

271
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,700
you know what it says, it says the

272
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,660
account is due, does it ever say you

273
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,860
owe, occasionally you'll see that, because they're dumbing

274
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,740
it down, because you know, your average, I

275
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,120
was going to say, sometimes you might see

276
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,000
a you owe this amount, yeah, just saying,

277
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,360
go ahead, right, because that's like going to

278
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,020
the coloring book section, I got a four

279
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,960
-year-old, what, you know, I got a

280
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,680
five or I got a seven-year-old,

281
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,260
what should I, what kind of book should

282
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,560
I get them, oh, and by the way,

283
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,860
I'm doing some financial business, it's in the

284
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,980
same category, seven-year-old, right, your average

285
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,440
college professor is operating on six to seven,

286
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,200
what is that, third, fourth grade, your average

287
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,960
college professor, doctor, lawyer, they're third or fourth

288
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:06,280
grade, they're wordsmiths and all that, but it's

289
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,120
all about accounting, so they don't know what

290
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,800
to do with this, like for example, let's

291
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,580
say you get a bill of exchange and

292
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,380
you don't know how to properly negotiate it

293
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,620
or perform on it, just write up a

294
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,040
bill for the same amount and send it

295
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,600
to whoever sent you the bill and watch

296
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,160
what happens, it's all about accounting, really, because

297
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,120
it's, right, because now your accounting, you see

298
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,620
what I mean, balances their accounting, well, yeah,

299
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,520
right, if you each owe each other, let's

300
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,340
say a hundred dollars, I owe you a

301
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:37,740
hundred dollars, you owe me a hundred dollars,

302
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,820
there's no reason to change anything, yeah, right,

303
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,760
and the easiest thing to say, so let's

304
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,060
say you get a bill for $1,750

305
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,000
or whatever, this is just from your typical

306
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,940
scumbag utility company or whatever, you just send

307
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,600
them a bill, you acknowledge that you got

308
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,860
their bill for $1,750 and you're sending

309
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,800
them a bill for $1,751 or you

310
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,680
can make it a dollar more, because it

311
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,840
doesn't matter, it has to be more than

312
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,660
a dollar more to matter a difference, right,

313
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,200
to create a debt, right, so $1,751

314
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,540
is still even and you say the reason

315
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,820
for sending you the bill is for, it's

316
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,660
a processing fee for processing the $1,750

317
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,600
bill they sent you, it's called a processing

318
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,880
fee, you've seen that before, of course, it's

319
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,840
all accounting, there's nothing being exchanged here, guys,

320
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,720
the banks are the borrowers, 12 USC, 1431,

321
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,000
very clear there, they're the borrowers and everything's

322
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,120
backwards, right, it's like satan is your god,

323
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,680
right, and everything's backwards, you know, so yeah,

324
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,200
the devil is actually the one that you

325
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,260
think, right, so it's all bad, that's what

326
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,600
these religious things are telling you, the whole

327
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,180
world is backwards, if you read, I think

328
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,060
it's Isaiah 28 somewhere, it tells you they

329
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,720
inverted everything, everything's inverted, but the easiest logic

330
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,820
for sending a bill is telling, please, this

331
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,300
is for accounting purposes only, I'm sending you

332
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,260
a bill for $1,750 as you requested,

333
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,280
after receiving your bill for $1,750 and

334
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,020
the $1,750 is for processing that $1

335
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:21,060
,750 processing fee, please apply this to your

336
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,460
records and when you do, we'll consider this

337
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,860
to be a zero balance, if you have

338
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,180
any questions, please contact me no later than

339
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,800
seven days, that's it and it's like, holy

340
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,760
crap, man, this is so simple, it's all

341
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,440
accounting, now, of course, it's not going to

342
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,400
go very smoothly, but you've satisfied everything legally,

343
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,020
right, completely according to the banking rules, which

344
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,720
nobody knows, just like, show me a medical

345
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,800
doctor that knows, knows functionally that the heart

346
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,300
is not a pump, it's actually a breaking

347
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,740
mechanism or what cancer really is or here's

348
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,820
a good one, if you know one of

349
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,780
these medical morons, ask him, what's the organ

350
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,220
for the immune system you guys are always

351
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,860
touting, I think that story might be worth

352
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,400
repeating, with the one day, you know, where

353
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,260
everyone was supposed to mask up and I

354
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,780
would, I wouldn't wear a mask and then

355
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,520
they'd say, hold on, hold on, you got

356
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,560
to come in with a message, I don't

357
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,580
have an immune system, so I can't wear

358
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,620
a mask and they'd be like, oh, oh,

359
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,880
you don't, okay, well, hold on, then, then

360
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,740
the manager would come out, okay, where did

361
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,120
you want to buy today, he walked, he

362
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,760
says, wait till this aisle clears, are you

363
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,940
done here, sir, please move out, okay, go

364
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,200
ahead, what did you want to get, and

365
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,320
carried my stuff, brought me to the register,

366
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,440
opened up the register, you know, brought me

367
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,100
to an empty closed register, opened it up,

368
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,900
right, yeah, yeah, chauffeur, I said, man, this

369
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,280
is great, this is like private shopping, yeah,

370
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,780
right, and I could have, yeah, I could

371
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,180
have taken a thousand lie detector tests and

372
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,620
the most sophisticated lie detector test equipment and

373
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,580
I would pass every single one, you know

374
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,180
why, because I know for sure there is

375
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,080
no such thing as an immune system, so

376
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,300
no mask plus concierge service, huh, yeah, and

377
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,040
for people are hearing this for the first

378
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,780
time, ask the medical morons, what's the organ

379
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,860
for the immune system, very good, there isn't

380
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,400
one, thank you, I knew you'd know that

381
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,680
right away, all right, what's the function of

382
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,460
the immune system, what's the function, well, you

383
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,360
see, there are antibodies and nodes, I was

384
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,900
talking, they're taken away and took it out

385
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,660
of the body, oh, so it's removed from

386
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,960
the body, so it's the elimination system, yes,

387
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,240
I have an elimination system, as a matter

388
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,840
of fact, a lot of people ask you,

389
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,620
you know, did you eliminate today, that's a

390
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,380
very polite way to say, did you take

391
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,620
a shit, right, yes, I do have that,

392
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,080
I do take a shit, yes, so, yes,

393
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,900
yeah, even with their strange explanation about these

394
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,180
antibodies, which come out of nowhere, you know,

395
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,880
because induction, they're not immune, it's eliminative, eventually

396
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,600
it gets to, this stuff has to be

397
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,940
eliminated out of the body anyway, even their

398
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,359
long, stupid, crazy explanation, eventually you're eliminating something,

399
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,660
right, it's all about the elimination system, and

400
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,040
I will swear on a stack of Bibles,

401
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,579
like they say that, yes, I do have

402
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,380
an elimination system, I do, and it's fully

403
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,859
functional, right, but I do not have an

404
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:18,000
immune system, I'll take the most sophisticated lie

405
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,119
detector test, retina scans, whatever, and you will

406
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,740
see that I am telling the truth, and

407
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,060
this is a fucked up, ridiculously stupid place,

408
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,000
this planet, so have fun, have fun while

409
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,940
you're at it, really try to have fun,

410
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,540
speaking of this, but you're not, but here's

411
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,980
the thing, if you're operating like they are,

412
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,840
sorry, if you're operating like they are, you're

413
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,140
not going to have fun, no, so you

414
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,400
got to be smart about it, but anyway,

415
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,140
go ahead, I'm having trouble adapting to doing

416
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,740
the things, I'm getting the concept now, it's

417
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,680
taken me a while on what you just

418
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,440
discussed, I'm getting the concept, but executing is

419
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,080
yet another step, and I'm trying to, I'm

420
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,000
working on it, I tell you I'm working

421
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,480
on it, because that's why we do this,

422
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,080
well, yeah, anyway, depends on what it is,

423
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
with a capital T, it could be a

424
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,900
hard one, but we talk about, if you

425
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,740
notice, like sometimes, like I'll have an argument

426
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,000
with someone about something really trivial, like how

427
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,720
to open a jar when it's too tight,

428
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,960
for example, and I show them a method,

429
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,980
and they're like, you know, this has nothing

430
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,540
to do, I'm being aggressive, because it has

431
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,120
nothing to do with opening a jar, it

432
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,380
has to do with the approach, it could

433
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,320
be a jar, it could be something else,

434
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,780
it's what approach do you have, most people

435
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,640
do what they do, I'd say most women

436
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,260
that I've seen through my life, 90%

437
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,180
of them, 90% of what they do,

438
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,960
they learn, guess where, on television, from watching

439
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,160
television, so yeah.

440
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,480
And yeah, the amazing thing about the jar,

441
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,660
again, it's like Sun Tzu was not an

442
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,600
idiot, you know, the whole thing about you

443
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,220
win the war before you ever go into

444
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,620
the battle, it's kind of right there, it's

445
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,440
just metaphoric, anyway, and we could get into

446
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,140
Sun Tzu at some point, but not today.

447
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,380
Greek said the next thing coming is going

448
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,720
to be cleansing, of which you can't compare

449
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,480
to any other times, okay, biblically speaking, this

450
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,580
era began with the Assyrians wiping out all

451
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,100
of the neighboring tribes, so if the circle

452
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,940
continues, well, I'm just reading what it says,

453
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,260
if the circle continues, that's what should happen

454
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,100
at the end, severe wiping out of humanity,

455
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,180
but wouldn't that have happened anyways, with the

456
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,960
earth shift and cataclysms?

457
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,160
Yeah, yeah, I think so, I'm leaning, see,

458
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,640
I'm evidence-based, right, evidence-based, if that,

459
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,780
whatever that means, right, to you, or what

460
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:47,640
the term means, which is forensics, forensics means

461
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,020
evidence, I think, if you look up that

462
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:54,520
word, right, so the chronology that Jason Breshears

463
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,260
puts out on archaics, I think, is Trump's,

464
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,760
a lot of the stuff that I've talked

465
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,180
about prophetically, on the minutiae and movements, on

466
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,220
the, most people think I'd never say this,

467
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,380
right, but I'm just, you know, we're here

468
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,020
to learn, on when things will happen, and

469
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,220
even how they're going to happen cosmically, because

470
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,320
the Bible is like Swiss cheese, and I'm

471
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:18,020
the kind of person that, when I see

472
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,620
Swiss cheese, I'm like, I don't want to

473
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,420
buy it, because unless they could give me

474
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,120
all the stuff to fill in the holes,

475
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,400
right, where's the, if you can get the,

476
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,260
I'll buy the Swiss cheese, if you can

477
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,100
give me the rest of the cheese, fill

478
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,860
in those holes for me, right, then I'll

479
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,720
take it, right, so the biblical text has

480
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,780
been severely messed with, I predominantly go to

481
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:43,420
it for law, because guess what, right, pretty

482
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:45,060
much all laws are based on it, like

483
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,460
it or not, know it or not, right,

484
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,080
and like regulation Z, the three-day right

485
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,040
of refusal, by the way, where does that

486
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,060
come from, right, all these things that you'll

487
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,920
find in business, and there's business, and there's

488
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,640
busyness, there's two different things, but I would

489
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,700
say prophetically, I'd say, I think the phoenix

490
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,400
is right on, I think still the, and

491
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,920
the other two things to be seen, and

492
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,820
it looks like the chronology does line up,

493
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,460
I would say that a Middle East union

494
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,840
is still in favor, actually, believe it or

495
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,100
not, I did see something about a week

496
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,700
ago that Egypt is now collectively trying to

497
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,820
create a Middle East NATO to unite nations

498
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,520
as a protective front against Israeli aggression, yes,

499
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,120
isn't that interesting, it is, so let's see

500
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,940
how that, man, I said 2025 would be

501
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,340
the point for that, so I'm more relaxed

502
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,040
about all that stuff, but, and all the

503
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,060
stuff that I've put forward is pretty accurate,

504
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,160
excuse me, pretty accurate based on what's in

505
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:49,860
the text itself, it's very clear, it only

506
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,660
has to say it once, like Assyria will

507
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,180
rise up in the end, right, it's only,

508
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,460
it's only listed once in the Psalms, and

509
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,880
that's enough, you don't have to, you know,

510
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,320
people, what is the mind-control thing, Chuck,

511
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,220
they keep repeating it, like TV, right, and

512
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,520
all, repeating, repeating, Osama bin Laden, Osama bin

513
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,420
Laden, COVID, COVID, COVID, repetition causes people to

514
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,380
believe that a statement is more true even

515
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,760
without any supporting evidence, there's a theorem to

516
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,480
that, but yes.

517
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,120
Yeah, yeah, there is, but then you have,

518
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,380
so that would be something that is not

519
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,340
true, meaning non-existent, not important, then you

520
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,080
have someone falling off of a cruise ship,

521
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,360
and they're saying, help, I'm drowning, what did

522
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,040
he say, that's too short, can you repeat

523
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,560
that please, right, you know, so you just

524
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,620
got to say some things once, right, so,

525
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,020
and that's what I've been picking up on

526
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,740
it, and have picked up on it, but

527
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:49,480
yeah, I would say human carnage is definitely

528
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,400
on the front, financial ups and downs on

529
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,520
the front, like you've never seen before, because

530
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,440
remember, there's no more money, guys, it's all

531
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,360
credit, so all they can do is make

532
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,240
stuff hyperinflation, or prevent you from getting credit,

533
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,360
by the way, whenever you're denied for anything,

534
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,520
they've gotten the full amount paid already, so

535
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,020
Henry Ford was right, if the people found

536
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,760
out how the money system worked, he was

537
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,760
talking about applications also, yeah, there would be

538
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,640
a revolution, I don't think there should be

539
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,440
a revolution, because the people are too dumb

540
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,480
to even go read the constitution, which supports

541
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,800
everything, you don't need anything more, you know,

542
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,620
it's like someone walking around with a Swiss

543
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,780
army knife in their pocket, or one of

544
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,980
the deluxe models, and like they say, do

545
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,420
you have a knife, do you have a

546
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,940
toothpick, do you have a scissor, do you

547
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,400
have a file, you got it all in

548
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,220
there, have you ever looked?

549
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,540
Well, that's what I find most frustrating about

550
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,180
all this, is that it does seem as

551
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,360
though we're going to come to a point

552
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,900
where, yeah, war is inevitable, and sure, civil

553
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,620
war is coming, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

554
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,700
we're hearing that a lot lately, but here's

555
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,400
the thing, not over anything that actually counts,

556
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,880
it's going to be all over BS, and

557
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,040
that's what the problem is.

558
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,680
Well, it's a sport, nobody really wants to

559
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,220
go to war, nobody ever, ever wanted to

560
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,260
go to war, it's a sport, how many

561
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,300
people get excited about what are the NBA

562
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,520
playoffs, and the stupid bowl, and the World

563
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,960
Series, that's how you get people excited about

564
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,260
war.

565
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,940
It's people who chose to go on the

566
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,580
field of battle, who chose to have an

567
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,160
opponent, who selected one, and then put on

568
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,720
a uniform voluntarily, this is literally what's happening,

569
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,640
and, and, yeah, so this is not a

570
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,900
metaphor, no, of course not, that's why sports,

571
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,760
that's, that's why there was always sports, and

572
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,900
that's why, remember, whenever there was guerrilla warfare

573
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,980
through history, it was frowned upon, because all

574
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,940
the soldiers, the infantry had to line up,

575
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,020
you know, a certain way on both sides,

576
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,740
and then start the fight, right, so like

577
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,940
the Parthians, and you know, the American, the

578
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,300
Revolutionary War was all taking pop shots, guerrilla

579
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,820
warfare, right, hiding, and yeah, they weren't used

580
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,260
to that, there was no training for that,

581
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:53,880
so that's bad sportsmanship, that's like, imagine the

582
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,880
Super Bowls going on, and somebody, let's say,

583
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,300
with a couple of drones, drops 50 footballs

584
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,660
on the field while the Super Bowl's going

585
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,040
on, right, and play, all of a sudden,

586
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,720
all these footballs fall everywhere, and they're like,

587
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,400
whoa, whoa, which one, what, right, so that's

588
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,420
guerrilla warfare, just mess them up like that.

589
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,620
Anyway, yeah, not much of an answer for

590
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,860
that one, but I'm glad, glad for the

591
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,180
comments, always glad to hear that people are

592
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,160
thinking about stuff.

593
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:19,980
What else you got?

594
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,180
They are, well, this one almost sounds redundant

595
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,640
with what you just said, but let's try

596
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,060
it anyway.

597
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,480
Also, if there's a new financial system coming

598
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,040
out, and if this is the seventh cycle,

599
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,780
do you think new lawful money is being

600
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,720
introduced to replace the old?

601
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,600
Okay, that's what I thought you would say,

602
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,060
but no, it's not a new financial system

603
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,320
at all, it's still going to be based

604
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,420
on the Federal Reserve Act, and if you

605
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,320
read the 16th Amendment, by the way, it

606
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,560
prefaces that it's not introducing anything new, so

607
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,820
that's why there's people that don't study, cry

608
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,600
about the 16th Amendment, and you know, with

609
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,320
the IRS and the Federal Reserve and all

610
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,640
that, but if you read it, it basically

611
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,580
says this doesn't bring anything new, in other

612
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,420
words, whatever's in this amendment's already been going

613
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:07,380
on, it's like an acknowledgement, so it's a

614
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,100
moot point, no, it's all credit, and the

615
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,200
main thing is that you never find out

616
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,500
that it's all based on securities, just forget

617
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,460
about credit, forget about money, forget about currency,

618
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,280
look up securities, what are securities?

619
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,820
It'll tell you it's checks, drafts, promissory notes,

620
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,500
orders to pay, bills, coupons, blah, blah, blah,

621
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,980
anything that you could possibly, stamps are securities,

622
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,760
everything that you call money, currency, or whatever,

623
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,460
anything that has a bill notation on it,

624
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,840
anything that says pay, or a number with

625
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,080
a cent, was it a cent stamp, or

626
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,100
a dollar sign on it, is a security,

627
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,920
it's all about securities, and the main thing

628
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,020
is that you never find out how they

629
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,480
work, that's what the new system is, it's

630
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,560
just another distraction, there's no such thing as

631
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,300
a new system.

632
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,760
So that tackles, just to let everybody know,

633
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,780
that tackles all your CBDC questions, that tackles

634
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,720
the other new system questions, I'm just clearing

635
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,920
them out of the way here, because you

636
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,860
already answered it.

637
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,600
You can do an injunction on all that

638
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,700
stuff, learn what injunctions are, you know, I

639
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,840
was going to look up, let's, you know,

640
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,420
since I have the laptop, go ahead and,

641
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,300
let's see how well I can multitask, how

642
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,860
well I can answer the next one, or

643
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,820
discuss the next one, while I'm looking up

644
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,680
driver's license injunction.

645
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,660
There's a guy who did the first one

646
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,860
that hit the media, right?

647
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:24,520
Right.

648
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,020
Let's see, so go, yeah.

649
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,840
Yeah, no, absolutely, I'll move on, but I'm

650
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,400
just clearing away first all of this stuff

651
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,480
that needs to be cleared away, because it

652
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,640
was already just answered.

653
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,580
There is a weird short question here, Greek

654
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,320
in the spirit of the best food, clothing,

655
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,400
and shelter, yes, okay, I got that right.

656
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,260
Is renting a place to call home lawful?

657
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,720
I feel like having my name on a

658
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,740
deed won't necessarily make life better, but open

659
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,780
to hearing info on this, like, what are

660
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,320
your thoughts of renting versus owning?

661
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,300
I like, well, right now I'm in an

662
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,900
owning situation, but renting, it could go either

663
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,900
way, depending, see, if you rent and something

664
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,360
breaks, you're not compelled to fix it.

665
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,960
You're not compelled to fix it if you

666
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,500
own either, but you have to suffer the

667
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,940
costs, let's say, right, and time and all

668
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,180
that.

669
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:18,960
I know stuff, people that rent and something

670
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,540
breaks, and they never get it fixed, right?

671
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,440
You've heard, you know, slumlords or whatever, they

672
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,560
never get to it or whatever.

673
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,380
I'm renting, and I'm having mixed results with

674
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,500
that myself, personally, because some things have been

675
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,480
fixed right away, and other things, eh, not

676
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,280
so, you know, maybe not, depends.

677
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,760
Anyway, it's a mixed bag situation for me,

678
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,460
but the lawful, I think what they're looking

679
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,600
for is, they're personally, are they lawfully okay,

680
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,420
like, is that acceptable to be a renter,

681
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,720
is the idea, I guess, yeah.

682
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,320
Depends if you're competent, yeah, of course, I

683
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,180
think it's lawful.

684
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,100
I think the Rechabites in Jeremiah, they never

685
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,980
lived in houses and never drank wine.

686
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,060
They lived in tents, food, clothing, shelter.

687
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,940
Yeah, well, the thing about having a deed,

688
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,360
you can develop equity as long as you

689
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,600
buy low, sell high.

690
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,380
Remember, if you go apply for, go apply

691
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,040
for a house, expect to be denied, and

692
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,360
then say, that's fine if you deny me

693
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,820
because you don't like my shoe size or

694
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,520
whatever, my breath stinks or whatever.

695
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,040
Just that application, which has the full price

696
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,520
of the house plus all the interest and

697
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,960
everything, just apply that towards the account, because

698
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,240
when you apply for a house, you're actually

699
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,980
opening an account with that company.

700
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,500
It's an account number on it, right?

701
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,200
Just say you want to maintain the account,

702
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,100
and you already have a collateral in there,

703
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,700
and just start building up your case.

704
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,280
And yeah, or you can find a banker,

705
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,100
like the kind that have a little office

706
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,620
hole in the wall, a couple of guys

707
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,760
started a bank, right, and it's possible to

708
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,960
find that and say, listen, I'm going to

709
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,520
come and apply, and I expect to be

710
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,900
rejected, denied, and then I'm going to come

711
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,420
back and apply again in a month, but

712
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:02,040
this time, I want 76% of that

713
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,160
application to go towards the account, right, because

714
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,060
you do a 24-76 split, and then

715
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,060
I'm going to sign a purchase order agreement,

716
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,840
and I want 76% of that to

717
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,680
go towards the account.

718
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,180
You guys keep 24%, and then I'll sign

719
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,140
a promissory note.

720
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:20,720
So now you've just created four times the

721
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,660
value of the house, and you're getting 76

722
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,580
% of each one, so four times 76

723
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,420
% is way over 100, so you're good.

724
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,620
Any extra money to tell them, yeah, I

725
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,680
want to invest it in your company, and

726
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,000
let's settle the account and transfer all the

727
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,920
necessary titles and deeds.

728
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,080
See what they say.

729
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:39,820
Try it.

730
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,720
You don't have to go.

731
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,600
Everyone online is fighting everyone.

732
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,540
You got to sue them.

733
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,900
Well, just go and find a banker.

734
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,720
Hey, look, you know, you don't, you know,

735
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,860
it's just, you want to play?

736
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,260
This is, you're the borrower.

737
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,480
The banker is the borrower.

738
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,200
12 USC, 1431.

739
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:53,420
Not you.

740
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,220
And the same amount at 76% by

741
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,460
four means that you've got 304%, right, of

742
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,300
the original price if you consistently negotiated for

743
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,060
76% of it each time, right?

744
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,820
And they got 96%.

745
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,100
Yeah.

746
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,080
There you go.

747
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,020
Okay.

748
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,140
Because remember, you're going to do a split

749
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:12,800
on each one.

750
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,660
So yeah, yeah, I can, now I just

751
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,380
gave you the short, the short form, the

752
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,400
outline on how to work with banks properly.

753
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,600
Now that's funny.

754
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,660
I will say, I did, I went, I

755
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,580
did this, like I said, that's what you're

756
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,700
saying is illegal.

757
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,080
Greek, a banker told me, right?

758
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,840
So I'm like, would you be able to

759
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,800
put that writing that it's illegal?

760
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,820
I'll be glad to consider it.

761
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,700
If you put it in writing, show me

762
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,280
how it's illegal when you're the borrower.

763
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,840
I've never heard of you're the borrower.

764
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,380
I don't care about the law.

765
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,760
He caught himself, caught himself.

766
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,020
You know what it's like to imagine?

767
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,020
Could you imagine you have a guy in

768
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,060
a suit with a, that's a banker and

769
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,080
you have the, the nightly news there.

770
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,980
And he says, I don't care about the

771
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,240
law.

772
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,560
Do you, how good would that be for

773
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,200
his business?

774
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,200
Not so good.

775
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:58,780
Yeah.

776
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,240
Yeah.

777
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,240
On the topic of cheese, so you didn't

778
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,380
bring up cheese earlier.

779
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,300
On the topic of cheese, I have heard

780
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,640
that the majority of rent it used today

781
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,080
as GMO from Pfizer.

782
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,240
Is that true?

783
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,780
Does the Greek have a recommendation?

784
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,200
Sorry.

785
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,640
Yeah.

786
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,600
Rent list would be the best cheese, but

787
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,120
the rent is just a cow.

788
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,300
It's, it's not really proper cheese.

789
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,320
It's forced cheese.

790
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,820
And they've done that for a long time.

791
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,420
Rent list cheese, or, you know, cheese with

792
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,220
a natural, a non rent culture.

793
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,420
It's taken from the cow's stomach.

794
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,580
I don't think that's really a good cultured

795
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,280
cheese, but yeah.

796
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:35,540
Good.

797
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,480
Continue with that.

798
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:36,680
Yeah.

799
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,320
Yeah.

800
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,160
So is that true about Pfizer?

801
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,120
They ask, I'm not certain about that myself,

802
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,840
but it wouldn't surprise me.

803
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,460
Yeah.

804
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,400
Yeah.

805
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,280
The thing about GMO is very simple.

806
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,740
These people are idiots.

807
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,180
So how are they going to do GMO?

808
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:50,520
Right.

809
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,060
Everything comes from cabbage, all your green vegetables,

810
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,900
whether it's lettuce, broccoli, kale, whatever.

811
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,220
It all came from cabbage because of seed

812
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:00,900
manipulation.

813
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,800
Chihuahuas are GMO because there's no such thing

814
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,780
as a Chihuahua.

815
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,820
It was bred down certain dogs.

816
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,780
But there's a distinction.

817
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,600
Of course.

818
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:12,880
Yeah.

819
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,760
But there's a distinction.

820
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,760
The apple head.

821
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,200
Between.

822
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:15,660
Oh yeah.

823
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,980
The apple head versus the deer head or

824
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,720
whatever they call it.

825
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,540
But the thing is there, there's a distinction,

826
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,780
I think though, between breeding something and manipulating

827
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,600
the gene, the genome that way.

828
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,220
And literally.

829
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:27,880
That's the thing.

830
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,380
I think how are they, how are they

831
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,020
going to manipulate?

832
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:31,440
Okay.

833
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,360
Here's the thing people let's, let's liven up,

834
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,120
listen up and liven up and sit up

835
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,400
when these morons are playing around with cells

836
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,280
and all that stuff.

837
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,160
Do they know how to keep it alive?

838
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,360
And you know, when you break a cell

839
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,340
wall, how damaging that is, do you think

840
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,060
the cell is going to have virility to

841
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,800
continue?

842
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,040
It has to be regrown and regrown.

843
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:54,880
Yeah.

844
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,280
Yeah.

845
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,100
Over and over and over their success rate

846
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,200
with what they got you thinking that they

847
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,180
could manipulate all this stuff is so low

848
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,780
that it almost doesn't exist.

849
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,880
What they're doing is mixing some crazy horrific,

850
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:11,900
like Frankenstein stuff using 200 year old technology,

851
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:12,960
right?

852
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,260
The technology hasn't changed.

853
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,000
Well, yeah, they have led lighting and cell

854
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,340
phones.

855
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:16,800
Okay.

856
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,320
But the concept even of cloning is very

857
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,800
simple.

858
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,840
There's you don't need any fancy technology.

859
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,219
You just have to accommodate what it takes

860
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,000
to grow a clone of a human, right?

861
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,659
So like, for example, they got away from

862
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:34,760
glass, stiff glass containers, because as the clone

863
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,880
is growing, and it gets it flinches a

864
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,960
leg, it could break the leg.

865
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,659
So then you put grow them in plastic,

866
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,920
soft plastic bags.

867
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,159
But the, the genetic engineering, like, for example,

868
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,340
they're finding stuff in nature, like, that that

869
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,420
meat substitute stuff, there's certain algae that produces

870
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,460
something very close to hemoglobin.

871
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,180
So they're making like a vegetarian blood to

872
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:58,900
put in stuff.

873
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,800
So you think you're eating beef, and you

874
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,320
shouldn't be eating that anyway.

875
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,520
You can do selective breeding, and gene manipulation,

876
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,360
but these morons doing getting down and doing

877
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,980
what they're saying.

878
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,170
Oh, for some reason, you disappeared there.

879
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,550
Let me see what's going on.

880
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,430
Because I don't know if you dropped off

881
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,270
or muted yourself.

882
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:24,900
Let's see.

883
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,740
Well, you're still there.

884
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,540
But you you're not making noise.

885
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,040
So after an interruption there, where we're quite

886
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,780
frankly, look, I lost internet first, then power

887
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:37,200
went out.

888
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,120
So you know, what can you say for

889
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,700
where I live?

890
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,020
But anyway, little weird confusion there.

891
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,440
I've been hearing tales of odd behaving electronics

892
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:46,820
lately.

893
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,300
But that's not what we were talking about.

894
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,260
We were talking about cheese when we were

895
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:50,660
interrupted.

896
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,140
And yeah, that's right.

897
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:54,560
I remember.

898
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:54,880
Yeah.

899
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:55,480
Yeah.

900
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,520
So that's where we were.

901
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,100
And I had only given you a part

902
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:58,560
of the question.

903
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,380
So anyway, just as a refresher, just just

904
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,460
just to fill in, Chuck, hold on.

905
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,680
When was this today?

906
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,480
That was four or five days ago.

907
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,200
So we're going to basically catch up from

908
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,560
a few.

909
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,380
Yeah, yes.

910
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:10,700
I know.

911
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,540
I just gave it away.

912
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,220
But yeah, no problem.

913
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
I didn't know if you wanted to.

914
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,560
So I didn't do it, but you did

915
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:15,680
it.

916
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,220
So cool.

917
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:16,540
Whatever.

918
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,060
That's fine.

919
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,960
Just however, however, the recording is, however, the

920
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,480
recording is, it ends up that way, right?

921
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,860
Trying to take this with good humor.

922
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,720
Anyways.

923
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,120
All right.

924
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,540
So the question was that when we were

925
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,540
interrupted, does the Greek have a recommendation for

926
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,280
cheese that's easier on the gut?

927
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,880
I get a raw milk cheese from Switzerland

928
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,740
that specifically states it has a non GMO

929
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:44,840
rennet goes down, you know, while most of

930
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,880
the crap in the U.S. gives me

931
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,300
issues, I believe the non pasteurized goes down

932
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,980
easier with enzymes that benefit digestion that I

933
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,020
would be cooked off that would be cooked

934
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,280
off in the standard process.

935
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,960
There's the whole question, finally.

936
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,580
So, yeah, cheese.

937
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:01,880
Yeah.

938
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,920
Vandy posted some Michio Kushi stuff.

939
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,320
I put it on and peruse Filo Kushi

940
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,860
or just put in Michio Kushi.

941
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,300
His son has a channel.

942
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,860
And it was interesting.

943
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,900
He was speaking like eggs, cheese, chicken.

944
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,100
Um, why chicken?

945
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,040
Because it's usually poultry.

946
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,980
Turkey will probably do the same.

947
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:30,660
So eggs, bird, poultry, meat and cheese generally

948
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,320
contract.

949
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,980
The center part of the body is very

950
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,480
contracting, compacting, and you're going to feel a

951
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,700
tightness and all that.

952
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,900
Now, you know, all American food has been

953
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,300
poisoned since the 70s.

954
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,820
I remember back in the early 70s, having

955
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,000
a McDonald's burger and it was actually delicious.

956
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,020
Right.

957
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,280
And it's it's I don't think it's edible

958
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,700
now.

959
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,500
But all American food, unless you have good

960
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,640
sources and vetted sources, vetted, meaning it's not

961
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,280
just a label.

962
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,160
You know, it says it's good.

963
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,720
You know, it's good as a reputation for

964
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,200
being good.

965
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,080
And it is good.

966
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:06,380
Right.

967
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:08,600
You have to really work hard.

968
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,660
That's why food, clothing, shelter, right, are the

969
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,480
three main things.

970
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,460
If you could figure that out, that's a

971
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,000
whole life.

972
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,540
Life's worth of work.

973
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,760
But cheese, in essence, if you're sensitive to

974
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,920
it, you're sensitive to those types of foods.

975
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,920
So I wonder, let's just leave it at

976
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,240
that.

977
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,440
You know, let's say a retort or a

978
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,700
question back would be, are you also sensitive

979
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,100
to eating poultry, which would be chicken, turkey,

980
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,080
which is the most common.

981
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,400
We don't have to get into exotic birds.

982
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:40,880
And eggs.

983
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:41,940
Right.

984
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,800
If you're sensitive to that, then it lines

985
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,820
up with the concept of it contracting, which,

986
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,540
by the way, Michio got into when you

987
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,840
eat that kind of food, cheese, poultry and

988
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,340
eggs, it leads to, quote unquote, diagnosis for

989
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,720
diabetes, which is he didn't know that diabetes

990
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,220
and AIDS were fake diseases.

991
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:00,600
Right.

992
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,260
But it harms the liver.

993
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,520
So my question back would be, it's not

994
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,000
the food so much as it is the

995
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,620
quality of the food and not just the

996
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:14,440
quality of preparation and handling and, you know,

997
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,960
top tier quality as we consider it.

998
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,460
But what does the food actually do in

999
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,220
the body?

1000
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:21,600
Right.

1001
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,940
A simple one would be like sugars, typically

1002
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:31,360
very highly refined sugars make people whimsy.

1003
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:31,660
Right.

1004
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,240
Like lightheaded sugar rush kind of you've heard

1005
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,520
of the great Milky Way Snickers bar or

1006
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:37,840
whatever.

1007
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:38,540
Oh, yeah.

1008
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,320
And that's the quality of that.

1009
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,020
They got a whole thing with the Snickers

1010
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,380
where it's like, look, you want to change

1011
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,740
your day, actually eat a Snickers.

1012
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,200
Right.

1013
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:47,840
Yeah, no doubt.

1014
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,020
Yeah, you definitely will.

1015
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,880
That's for sure.

1016
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,460
It will change it.

1017
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,440
Now, will it make it better?

1018
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,600
There's another question.

1019
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,800
That's a different question.

1020
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,860
Well, well, also in the 70s, candy bars

1021
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,680
were delicious.

1022
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:00,660
Yes.

1023
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,420
Now, candy bars are just sweet.

1024
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,400
You don't taste anything else but the sweet.

1025
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:04,960
Right.

1026
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,600
So now an objective observer, though, might ask,

1027
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,920
is this something that is just attached to

1028
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,940
your changes or has the food actually changed

1029
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,120
or is it a bit of both?

1030
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,660
Because someone might say that as you.

1031
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,880
OK, because as you mature, right, it would

1032
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,960
be more extreme.

1033
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:22,680
Yeah.

1034
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,200
So it's just a more extreme because of

1035
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,840
your age.

1036
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,060
You've now gone to a different place where

1037
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,140
you're a bit different from where you were

1038
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:30,880
in the 70s.

1039
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,160
Right.

1040
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,380
So therefore, you've got to factor both of

1041
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,440
these things into that equation.

1042
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,820
It's not just the candy changing, but you've

1043
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,560
changed as well.

1044
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,020
Yes.

1045
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,620
Well, yeah, I'm also experimenting with myself because

1046
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,600
I do a lot of crowd.

1047
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,120
I'm like 20 or 30 grams a day,

1048
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,200
which is not a lot.

1049
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,340
There's people who do five times that amount,

1050
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:51,080
but it slows down digestion, but it makes

1051
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,700
it stable.

1052
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,400
So it won't harm you.

1053
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,620
So in other words, if you do too

1054
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,400
much of any kind of opioid, you get

1055
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:57,340
constipation.

1056
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,320
So I've noticed my digestive has changed, but

1057
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,700
I do a lot of coffee, like two

1058
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,760
and a half, three liters of coffee and

1059
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,400
about a pack of cigarettes every day.

1060
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,120
And I could feel the effects of each

1061
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,340
one.

1062
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,060
And I compensate.

1063
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,980
I know how to compensate and balance it.

1064
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,840
But just just on a side note, I

1065
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,360
mean, these things are, it's real hard to

1066
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,480
derive a good answer.

1067
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,160
Give me an example.

1068
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:20,920
This is a side note.

1069
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,960
I listened to our cakes video lately, and

1070
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,440
he was touting that he's got this archaic

1071
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,600
underground, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

1072
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,900
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and he's got

1073
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:30,700
a health and wellness section said, Oh, okay,

1074
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,320
let's check it out.

1075
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,920
So I went in there, and I signed

1076
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,720
in, I forgot what password because you got

1077
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,620
to have a very complex password.

1078
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,380
I didn't write it down.

1079
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,480
One, let me get in again, at least

1080
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,140
on the phone, but the computer is still

1081
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:41,560
on it.

1082
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,900
And I went to the health and wellness

1083
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,780
section, and all these people are posting all

1084
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,320
this stuff.

1085
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,800
And I'm like, all I said was greetings,

1086
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:50,920
y'all, you know, and a couple of

1087
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,400
question marks, you know, are you the Greek,

1088
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:52,740
whatever?

1089
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,220
I didn't answer back.

1090
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,920
But I went down and saw what people

1091
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,300
are consider health and wellness to be and

1092
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,800
I'm like, there's no way I'm going to

1093
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,300
post here.

1094
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,380
There's so much background.

1095
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,580
In other words, the stuff that we discuss

1096
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,180
here and the stuff that I tell people,

1097
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,460
basically, is so radically different.

1098
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,700
You can imagine imagine a health and wellness

1099
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,960
section on alternative media, what people are going

1100
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,160
to be posting, right?

1101
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,740
I don't have to get into it.

1102
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,700
I don't have to imagine.

1103
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,060
Yeah, I've seen it.

1104
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,780
So yeah, yeah, you've probably seen it.

1105
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,360
Okay, yeah.

1106
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,080
So there's no way I can go there.

1107
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,560
I'm not gonna I can't.

1108
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,440
And it hit me.

1109
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,540
It was good that I did that.

1110
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,380
Because like, I'll just put a few things,

1111
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,000
you know, why don't we just say health

1112
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:33,900
is really fitness.

1113
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,960
And believe it or not, there are people

1114
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,720
with their fitness is so poor, they're always

1115
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,400
in pain and can't walk, right?

1116
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,360
Duh, you would call them unhealthy, right?

1117
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,360
So let's look at it as fitness.

1118
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,740
Let's look at seasonal eating.

1119
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,880
Let's look at the energy movement in the

1120
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,260
body, Boba, are you kidding?

1121
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,620
Are you kidding that will go over like,

1122
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,900
I don't know, like a Led Zeppelin, right?

1123
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,780
That will not work.

1124
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,160
No, you need to smooth.

1125
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:57,720
I don't know.

1126
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,840
Here, Chuck, I don't know how to introduce

1127
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,300
this stuff, even though it's just dead nuts

1128
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,560
simple, right?

1129
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,240
I just don't know how to bring it.

1130
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,140
I mean, it would have been better.

1131
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,840
It needs to be done on a sonic

1132
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,260
only it cannot be written.

1133
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,140
There's just too many things.

1134
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,580
I could definitely speak faster than I can

1135
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:16,900
write.

1136
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,460
But I cannot be done.

1137
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,120
It has to be done in conversation.

1138
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,220
I just maybe it's because I saw what

1139
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,140
else was being posted.

1140
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:28,000
I said, there's no way this is this

1141
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,680
is going to, you know, so I just

1142
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,200
want to bring this up when when questions

1143
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,460
about things like specifically about the cheese, it's

1144
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,220
not just the cheese, which was there were

1145
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,080
right to ask, you know, the quality cheese,

1146
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,760
like American cheese versus not American cheese, but

1147
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,060
American manufacturer versus European and all that.

1148
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,200
That's a big difference.

1149
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,300
But then there's also what cheese any cheese

1150
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,540
does to the body, you might be sensitive

1151
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:49,860
to that.

1152
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,800
So there's always two layers.

1153
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,180
And also there's seasonality.

1154
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,280
You might do better with cheese in cold

1155
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,000
weather, Wisconsin cheddar, right?

1156
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,180
You know, it's 40 minus over there in

1157
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:00,580
the winter.

1158
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,940
You might do better in cold, higher latitude,

1159
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,340
or very low latitude, depending than near the

1160
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,480
tropics or moderate latitude in the summer.

1161
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,060
Right?

1162
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,480
So that has to be taken into consideration

1163
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:13,540
seasonal eating, right?

1164
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:13,960
Right.

1165
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,740
You know, but what do you do?

1166
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,720
You know, like, years ago, especially when I

1167
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,240
was bike racing, and I would order a

1168
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:20,740
pie, right?

1169
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,340
Pizza pie.

1170
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,720
Yeah, we call them pies, by the way.

1171
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,780
When you order, you go to a pizzeria,

1172
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,580
I'll take a pie, they know exactly, you

1173
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,660
know, you know, you didn't say they know,

1174
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,220
you don't mean apple or cherry, right?

1175
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,860
So there's a lot, there's a lot of

1176
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,300
cheese on a pie like that, right?

1177
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,520
So and I would eat a quite a

1178
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:39,960
bit of it.

1179
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,180
And I didn't feel like doing as much

1180
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,680
baked goods in the summer than I did

1181
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,020
in winter.

1182
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,320
This is before I contemplated all these things.

1183
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,640
Then I have recall.

1184
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,960
So I would, I would emphasize seasonality, I

1185
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,660
would say that the majority of the people

1186
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,420
that I've helped the most are the ones

1187
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,180
that took seasonality as a as the strongest

1188
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:02,780
message.

1189
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,680
And think of it this way.

1190
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,940
Even if you know nothing about the effects

1191
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,220
of seasonal eating, or you know, cold food

1192
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,160
for cold climates, tropical food for hot climates.

1193
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,380
Think about it.

1194
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,100
Imagine a hot day back east, you're not

1195
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,800
going to eat as many slices as you

1196
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,980
would in the wintertime.

1197
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:21,740
No, logically, I mean, you just can't you

1198
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,880
just write so you're going to get the

1199
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,000
Italian ices and you're going to get whatever,

1200
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,720
you know, so it's not the same.

1201
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,840
In other words, try to tap into your

1202
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,700
intuition, try to recall how you you know

1203
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,820
how you found yourself eating anyway, combine that

1204
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,880
with seasonality.

1205
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,280
And that would be the most arching effect

1206
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,280
overarching effect on anything, right?

1207
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:46,240
Even when I was a kid, difficult.

1208
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,660
Even when I was a kid dating, the

1209
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:50,500
girls would often say, look, it's too hot

1210
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:50,880
to eat.

1211
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,900
You end up with one slice of pizza

1212
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,620
piece, maybe on a date where you're out

1213
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,960
for, you know, six hours.

1214
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,920
And yeah, so that's that.

1215
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,520
I mean, it just would come up naturally.

1216
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,440
Anyway, it's what you're you know, and that's

1217
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,280
the other thing is you got to kind

1218
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,480
of pay attention to what your body signals

1219
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,500
it needs, I think.

1220
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,200
Or do you disagree with right?

1221
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,720
And no, no signals.

1222
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:17,240
But recall, recall how you eat when it's

1223
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,380
hot out and how you eat when it's

1224
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:18,900
cold out.

1225
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,340
And you'll notice it's very different.

1226
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:20,680
Oh, yeah.

1227
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,780
You intuitively do that.

1228
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,480
But you can even observe it, like I

1229
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,900
say, in a date, right, where she would

1230
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,100
be like, look, it's too hot to eat.

1231
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,620
And like I say, you both end up

1232
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,180
getting one slice of pizza piece.

1233
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,160
Now, that's not going to work in the

1234
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:32,360
winter.

1235
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,520
You're going to want more of that just

1236
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:34,920
naturally.

1237
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,740
It's going to come up.

1238
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,960
But but one slice and keep walking and

1239
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:38,880
make sure you have a drink.

1240
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,140
All these natural things come up because you

1241
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,200
seem to desire them.

1242
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:45,140
But your desires actually give you a prescription

1243
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,660
in a way.

1244
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,820
I mean, I hate to use that word,

1245
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,080
but it seems applicable.

1246
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:49,740
What do you think?

1247
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,640
No, I agree.

1248
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:53,520
That's fine.

1249
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,200
Fair enough.

1250
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,620
It's a very broad subject.

1251
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:55,900
Yeah.

1252
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,260
So a couple other quick, broad subjects, and

1253
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,460
then we'll close this one up.

1254
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,020
And by the way, I'm going to address

1255
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,920
something that people might have heard that I

1256
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,480
should have just addressed, but I'm not going

1257
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:04,620
to.

1258
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:05,480
We're going to do it in a separate

1259
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,600
short sonic, which which will be posted after

1260
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:08,880
this.

1261
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,300
OK, but anyway, let's talk a bit.

1262
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,680
This is another topic.

1263
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,400
What is that?

1264
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,660
What topic would that be?

1265
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:17,800
Oh, because you brought up forums and you're

1266
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:18,200
going to address.

1267
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,860
Yeah, you brought up forums and politics.

1268
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,380
So I'm going to do that in the

1269
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,460
next short sonic that's concentrated on that.

1270
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:25,440
Anyways, got it.

1271
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,300
Let's talk a bit about this is, again,

1272
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,260
another comment about the first ever A.I.

1273
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,960
prime minister of Albania.

1274
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,120
She looks very sexy.

1275
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:37,360
Are they testing first in these banana countries?

1276
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,860
I didn't hear of this, but apparently, you

1277
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,580
know, there is some talk online, but I

1278
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,680
haven't seen it myself yet.

1279
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:46,120
But they're like there's an A.I. prime

1280
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,020
minister of Albania.

1281
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,760
Sounds like Jack Fresco stuff.

1282
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:51,380
It does.

1283
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,940
Jack Fresco talked about replacing the government with

1284
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,420
computers.

1285
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,500
They do a better job.

1286
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,060
I have no I have no comment.

1287
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,180
To me, it doesn't matter if it's you

1288
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,720
only have the rights that, you know, and

1289
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,740
people don't know anything.

1290
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,000
So the complaining about the way they're being

1291
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,740
treated by governments financially, however they are, you

1292
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:15,320
know, politically, religiously, whatever, as long as everyone's

1293
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,720
following what's been what the agreements are.

1294
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,020
Right.

1295
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,580
And but no one knows what the agreements

1296
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:20,880
are.

1297
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,540
So they do it.

1298
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:21,860
Right.

1299
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,380
So it to me, it doesn't matter as

1300
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,940
long as the agreements are being held.

1301
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,840
You know, each party's performing according to how

1302
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,900
they're supposed to be performing.

1303
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,100
And I find that to be untrue anywhere

1304
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,480
I look regarding any subject.

1305
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:34,820
Right.

1306
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:35,520
Fair enough.

1307
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,860
So it doesn't matter.

1308
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,700
And assuming this is true, look, the A

1309
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,600
.I. prime minister or whatever would just be

1310
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,400
the interface or the face of what's going

1311
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,040
on anyway, which wouldn't be all that much

1312
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:47,980
different from you looking at the president on

1313
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:49,800
Twitter, TV and all these other things.

1314
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:50,760
It's the same.

1315
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,960
You're not actually interfacing with a human being

1316
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,460
anyway.

1317
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,060
You'll interface with the bureaucracy.

1318
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:57,400
But yeah, OK.

1319
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:58,380
You know, so.

1320
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,560
But they're telling you.

1321
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,140
OK, so they're telling you it's A.I.,

1322
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,620
but they're not telling you that we have

1323
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:04,260
clones here.

1324
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,220
Right.

1325
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,320
So so what's the point?

1326
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:07,880
There you go.

1327
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,340
Is they going to.

1328
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:09,580
Yeah.

1329
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,200
So no.

1330
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,560
Yeah, I think the worst what I pray

1331
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,360
when for for for people is that their

1332
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,100
government gets so bad that they have to

1333
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,300
throw it, overtake it, get rid of it,

1334
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,080
and they have to educate themselves like we

1335
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,620
haven't had any real revolutions in a long

1336
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,020
time.

1337
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,120
We almost had a real revolution here.

1338
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,320
Actually, it is that we had a pretty

1339
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,220
good revolution here in the US.

1340
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,120
But, you know, Lafayette said before he left,

1341
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,040
he says, well, we'll get you back using

1342
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:39,540
commerce.

1343
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:42,000
You know, don't don't worry about it.

1344
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,180
You know, whatever.

1345
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,460
And then Franklin, didn't he say something?

1346
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,640
Was it Franklin or Jefferson?

1347
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,940
You know, it's you have a republic and

1348
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,460
a constitution.

1349
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,420
If you can keep it, something like that.

1350
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,240
Yeah, I believe Franklin.

1351
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:52,620
So.

1352
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,100
Right.

1353
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,680
Because they asked him, what kind of government

1354
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:57,160
do we have?

1355
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:58,600
Mr. Franklin is the legend.

1356
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,680
And he said, well, you know, you've got

1357
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,880
a republic or, you know, if you can

1358
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:03,800
keep it.

1359
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,120
So, you know, there you go.

1360
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,060
And obviously that didn't work out.

1361
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,200
It did not work out.

1362
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,380
We didn't keep it, so to speak, or,

1363
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,520
you know, the proverbial we.

1364
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,160
Anyways, I Chuck, can you ask your greatest

1365
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:18,280
thoughts on, quote, ego and quote, specifically the

1366
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,540
idea that if you hate a person, you

1367
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,100
hate something in him that is part of

1368
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:23,640
yourself.

1369
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,000
Is this wisdom or new age distraction?

1370
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,440
New age, all of it is like, for

1371
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,620
example, the ego is no, that is that

1372
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,080
is a Freudian construct.

1373
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,980
You're you have one sense of conscious and

1374
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:41,440
then you have a sense of unconscious.

1375
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,580
And that unconscious also is capable of dreaming,

1376
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:45,520
meaning asleep.

1377
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:45,820
Right.

1378
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,560
When you're not conscious and when you're conscious,

1379
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,560
it's it goes back to the John Mace

1380
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,180
therapy that we talked about.

1381
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:58,400
Because everything in the brain is held mostly,

1382
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,340
I should say mostly by imagery.

1383
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,320
It's your ability to bring up those images

1384
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,280
and relate those images to your identity.

1385
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,700
There is no ego or super ego or

1386
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,100
it or whatever.

1387
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,840
That is all Freudian constructs.

1388
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,440
Um, so no, I believe a lot of

1389
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,820
the these quote, unquote niceties that people, you

1390
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:24,520
know, like, for example, when someone isn't doing

1391
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,760
well, socially, they say that you're the problem.

1392
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:27,820
Right?

1393
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,000
No, they're the problem.

1394
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:30,320
Right?

1395
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:31,620
Depending on the individual.

1396
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,920
Usually, they're the problem, the society's fucked up.

1397
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,460
And you're not adjusted to it.

1398
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,640
Like, you know, I'm interviewing people constantly.

1399
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,620
And I get resumes.

1400
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,660
Fortunately, I have someone filtering it.

1401
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,120
And I said, look, I don't want to

1402
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:46,880
see any more resumes.

1403
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,180
If they have an interesting name, put their

1404
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,820
or put their name in one of those

1405
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,340
pieces of paper in a fishbowl and pull

1406
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,160
one out, right?

1407
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,100
It doesn't matter.

1408
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:55,880
What is that?

1409
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,720
Like, you know, random?

1410
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:57,260
Yeah.

1411
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,320
Random generator.

1412
00:51:58,960 --> 00:51:59,400
Yeah.

1413
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,740
And if you get any resumes, the best

1414
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,980
resume would read dropped out by the eighth

1415
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,220
grade have been on the FBI most wanted

1416
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:09,160
list between 2015 and 2024.

1417
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:13,220
And I couldn't afford art school, or I

1418
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,240
didn't want to afford it.

1419
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,440
And I have my own art studio, that

1420
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,620
would be the prime candidate.

1421
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:18,960
Right?

1422
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,620
So that wouldn't make it too far anywhere,

1423
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:22,860
right?

1424
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,320
Imagine no corporate job have been in the

1425
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,020
FBI most wanted list for the eight years,

1426
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:26,260
right?

1427
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,760
Or I dropped out of the eighth grade.

1428
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,340
Can you imagine?

1429
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,540
That'll still take your application, though?

1430
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,760
Yeah, it's it's not the society is messed.

1431
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,100
In other words, the models, that's what okay,

1432
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:39,120
dropping out by the eighth grade, being on

1433
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,540
the FBI most wanted list, and starting your

1434
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,540
own art studio, to me as one, in

1435
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:45,040
air quotes, a model citizen.

1436
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:49,160
You know, so I might be the wrong

1437
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,200
person to ask these things.

1438
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,700
Because if you go somewhere and say that,

1439
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:56,060
which is true, that the ego is in

1440
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:58,480
super ego, all these are Freudian constructs, and

1441
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,240
they're watch what happens to the person you're

1442
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,040
telling this to.

1443
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:02,780
Right?

1444
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,840
Yeah, they can't they can't see it.

1445
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,040
I've kind of done that where I've been

1446
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,860
like, Oh, so you've been reading Freud, you

1447
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,580
know, that's all that is you're reading Freud.

1448
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:12,920
So that's an influence on you.

1449
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,100
But other than that, you know, it is

1450
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:16,680
a construct.

1451
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:18,460
Well, he would do like Darwin got it

1452
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:20,080
from the stuff at the time.

1453
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,260
It's like Einstein, right?

1454
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,060
And relativity and all that.

1455
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:23,960
So all this stuff.

1456
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:28,280
Yeah, there's gonna be no, no, no.

1457
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:33,200
I say that everyone around you, whoever's listening,

1458
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,700
everyone around you is fucked up in a

1459
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,340
severe way.

1460
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,660
Can't be fixed.

1461
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,880
What are you going to do about it?

1462
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,920
There's no fine point to it.

1463
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,760
And this is sledgehammer, right type approach.

1464
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,760
And you might as well watch Dr. House

1465
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,800
if you want psychology, you know, beginning with

1466
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,620
everybody lies.

1467
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,680
You know, I'm just saying the guy making

1468
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,860
fun of the medical industry with that show

1469
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,300
is that one all the time?

1470
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,300
Yeah, all the time.

1471
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,180
Everybody's stupid.

1472
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,380
And nobody knows what they're doing except him

1473
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,420
and kind of well, kind of reminds me

1474
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:02,760
of somebody.

1475
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:08,160
Anyway, there's there's my joke.

1476
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,180
I don't know.

1477
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,940
There's my attempt at a joke.

1478
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,200
But speaking of jokes, and I'm not sure

1479
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,760
if this is a serious question or somebody

1480
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,520
just trying to, you know, like poke us

1481
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,740
poke you with a stick or not.

1482
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,380
But here goes anyway.

1483
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,420
Question.

1484
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,720
Every time somebody starts question with a question,

1485
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,280
I got to tell you, it usually means

1486
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,520
they're trying to stick a point.

1487
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,320
So I don't know why that indicator is

1488
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,080
that stick away, stick away.

1489
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:32,460
Here we go.

1490
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,900
Question if the Greeks died, if the Greeks

1491
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,540
died is so good, why does he have

1492
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,340
such bad teeth?

1493
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,540
Oh, that's a good point.

1494
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,840
Hereditary everyone on the father's side lost their

1495
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,960
teeth, like in their 40s.

1496
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,720
And I had perfect teeth, and they just

1497
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,880
started falling apart.

1498
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:50,980
Why?

1499
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,320
Because the teeth are the head is young.

1500
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,200
And what makes the teeth so sensitive is

1501
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,960
they're not antagonistic to the head.

1502
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,800
The teeth are very young, right?

1503
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:02,180
Right.

1504
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,040
No matter how you look at it, and

1505
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,320
shape and texture and everything, right?

1506
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,740
Even in color, young is white, right?

1507
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:15,640
So you have a young attachment to with

1508
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,120
two to a young object by another young

1509
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,480
object, who is just waiting for something to

1510
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,300
flip it over.

1511
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:25,920
So teeth can be very, very sensitive energetically.

1512
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:30,260
So, but what was interesting is I remember

1513
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,660
as a young child, and it was like,

1514
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,940
you know, so and so uncle, whatever is

1515
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,620
getting dentures, I'm like, he's not that old.

1516
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,880
And, and then social uncles getting dentures, and

1517
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,840
he's not that old, maybe I will, too.

1518
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,360
But I still have teeth, some teeth.

1519
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,680
But, yeah, and I bring up all these

1520
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,080
personal things, because I know there's other people

1521
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,800
going through things similar and whatever.

1522
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,760
And I try to, you know, speak about

1523
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,280
how I've dealt with them.

1524
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:55,860
And here's the thing about teeth.

1525
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,060
When I was very young, I broke the

1526
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:03,040
number of eight to throw teeth in the

1527
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:03,280
front.

1528
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,040
And I had a bridge put in when

1529
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:05,680
I was 13.

1530
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:07,980
Like I had my adult teeth for two

1531
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,940
weeks, and I broke them right, falling off

1532
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,220
of one of those monkey bars perform really

1533
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:13,600
high, like, don't go up so high as

1534
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,440
I'll be all right.

1535
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:19,500
So I've had a bridge the entire life

1536
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,760
until about 10 years ago, I started getting

1537
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,640
loose and all that.

1538
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,200
And I was like, Oh, man, you know,

1539
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,340
I don't want to get a partial I

1540
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:25,700
don't want to.

1541
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,260
Anyway, I had it removed, and I had

1542
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,060
a partial made, which was a temporary flipper,

1543
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,820
which I'm still using a decade later, because

1544
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:32,740
I rebuilt it.

1545
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,500
And I make my own, by the way,

1546
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,160
temporary teeth and all that no one can

1547
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,460
tell that they're temporary.

1548
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:43,220
But what was amazing as the dentist acquaintance

1549
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:44,820
that I have, I got really upset at

1550
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:45,740
him, I said, Why don't you tell me

1551
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:49,080
temporary teeth, and partials are wonderful, I can,

1552
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:51,100
I can buy it into anything I want.

1553
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,600
There's no temperature sensitivity, right?

1554
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,720
If I want, I could put titanium inserts

1555
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:58,460
in there, right?

1556
00:56:58,880 --> 00:56:59,980
Like jaws, remember?

1557
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:03,620
And right, so I'm really big on that.

1558
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,540
Moonraker, Moonraker, Moonraker jaws, you mean not, you

1559
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:08,320
know, jaws, the shark?

1560
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:08,760
Yeah, good.

1561
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,340
Yeah, the Moonraker jaws.

1562
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:10,620
Yeah.

1563
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,680
But the teeth that bites through suck.

1564
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,760
I mean, I've joked around, it's like, because

1565
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,380
I make spark plugs, I have the ability

1566
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:22,390
to make, you know, very Swiss Army knife

1567
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:23,170
thing.

1568
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:24,970
Now, I don't want a full denture, I

1569
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:29,630
have enough teeth that they're called abutments where

1570
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:32,610
the temporary like fits into no metal.

1571
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:35,610
And I'm really, really, really pleased with it,

1572
00:57:35,690 --> 00:57:40,010
versus sensitive teeth that were not doing so

1573
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:40,350
great.

1574
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:41,290
Right?

1575
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:45,970
I'm very impressed with the temporaries, which technically,

1576
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:48,130
according to the UN that makes me a

1577
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:48,670
cyborg.

1578
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:52,210
Because I have artificial, if you have anything

1579
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:54,330
artificial in your body, doing what your body

1580
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:56,070
would normally be doing, like an arm, a

1581
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:57,690
leg, teeth, teeth, whatever.

1582
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,590
I think they call it was a transhuman,

1583
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:02,630
whatever you have.

1584
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:05,910
Yeah, technically, you you now are what do

1585
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:07,690
you call when you integrate technology with a

1586
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:08,250
human body?

1587
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:09,810
Well, there's a whole philosophy of what I

1588
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:10,910
call transhumanism.

1589
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:11,230
Yeah.

1590
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:12,850
Yeah.

1591
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:16,050
So technically, I'm partaking in that by having

1592
00:58:17,010 --> 00:58:17,710
synthetic teeth.

1593
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:20,270
And I tell people, does it look like

1594
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:20,910
these are not made?

1595
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:22,910
No, those teeth look like they're your teeth

1596
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:23,950
as Oh, ha, gotcha.

1597
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:25,130
And you know what, I made them.

1598
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:28,390
I built these things, you know, so I

1599
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:30,030
feel sorry for people, by the way, that

1600
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:32,290
are getting partials and dentures from dent from

1601
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:36,430
dentists, because they're so large and cumbersome.

1602
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:39,230
There's no reason for them to be the

1603
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:40,910
way that's why you ever hear someone dentures,

1604
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,070
you're like, Oh, I could tell he's wearing

1605
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:42,550
dentures.

1606
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:43,570
Yeah, right.

1607
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:46,090
They're not, they're, they're not fit to the

1608
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:46,790
mouth properly.

1609
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:48,390
And they don't do that.

1610
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:50,650
I go back and even recently, I went

1611
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:52,230
to have some dental work done, I had

1612
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:54,590
to add two teeth to the bottom in

1613
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:56,410
the past two years since I've seen him.

1614
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:57,790
And he's so proud.

1615
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:00,110
He, the dentist takes it out, I take

1616
00:59:00,110 --> 00:59:01,650
it out, show him and he shows his

1617
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:04,090
assistants, dental assistants, look, he made this.

1618
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:05,950
And they kind of look the other way,

1619
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:07,490
you know, like, Oh, whatever, you know, like,

1620
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:08,830
they're, they're just there for whatever.

1621
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:09,770
But he's so impressed.

1622
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:12,690
And dentists usually are very impressed when their

1623
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:15,290
patients make their own body parts, shall I

1624
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:16,270
say, but Yeah.

1625
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:19,070
But anyway, that was a diatribe about teeth.

1626
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:20,630
But if you have a bum tooth, have

1627
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:22,990
it pulled if it's in an area, like

1628
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:24,630
in the front part of the mouth, like

1629
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:26,690
anything between six and 12.

1630
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:30,990
Or let's say 22 and 30.

1631
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:32,970
Get partials.

1632
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:34,890
I'm really but yeah, but you're gonna have

1633
00:59:34,890 --> 00:59:36,010
to get a dremel and you have to

1634
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:36,290
learn.

1635
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:38,930
I get most of my stuff from Amazon,

1636
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:40,530
by the way, dental supply.

1637
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:43,150
Because years ago, if you walked into a

1638
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:45,570
dental supply store, especially you know, wherever they

1639
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:46,630
say you, you know, you have to be

1640
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:48,070
a dentist to buy from here, right?

1641
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:50,830
So Amazon doesn't discriminate.

1642
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:53,530
So I wonder if they have a brain

1643
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:54,410
surgery kit.

1644
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:56,250
But anyway, fair enough.

1645
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:58,490
You know, and lastly, just to just to

1646
00:59:58,490 --> 00:59:59,610
recover that question.

1647
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:03,030
Look, like you said, hereditary, hereditary issues are

1648
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:03,870
the problem there.

1649
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:06,390
Frankly, I mean, look, mine are busted and

1650
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:09,030
messed up because men usually don't even live

1651
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:09,730
to be my age.

1652
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:12,070
So therefore, yeah, their teeth fall out and

1653
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:12,550
then they die.

1654
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:15,370
So I'm about to your teeth didn't live

1655
01:00:15,370 --> 01:00:17,630
to your teeth didn't live to be that

1656
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:17,830
age.

1657
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:18,750
Look at it that way.

1658
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:20,230
But you remain Yeah, right.

1659
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,430
I'm still you know, I'm stretching that side

1660
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:24,610
of the average.

1661
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:25,090
That's all.
