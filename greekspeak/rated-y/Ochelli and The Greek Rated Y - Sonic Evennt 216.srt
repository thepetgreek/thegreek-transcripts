1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,880
We're rated Y, Sonic Event 2, 1, 6.

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,580
Anyway, Greek, you know, weird weather over here

3
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,120
kind of knocked me out for a little

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,320
while, but I also had a personal fiasco

5
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,640
earlier today, but we're not here to tell

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,180
personal stories.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,660
We were just talking about weather, and maybe

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,300
we should reiterate it, because it's interesting.

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,620
A lot of people here have taken the

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,200
webinar, the weather webinar I did.

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,260
It was three, three-part.

12
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,920
You know, I kind of like saying that

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,920
I did a three-part, nine-hour webinar

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,300
a while back, and whoever's new here is

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,140
like, oh, I missed that.

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,720
Yeah, you did.

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,900
But we might do it again.

18
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,400
But there was like 50 people.

19
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:42,640
Wait a minute.

20
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,860
There was 50 people on it.

21
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,500
How many people do you think actually went

22
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,180
to work on it?

23
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:46,880
Ten.

24
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:47,440
Ten.

25
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,240
I know for sure.

26
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:48,760
Okay.

27
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,280
Okay.

28
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,380
Well, that's pretty good.

29
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,700
Which is enough to just mess up all

30
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,880
the weather in the Western Hemisphere, believe it

31
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,140
or not.

32
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,700
And to be honest with you, look, one

33
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,920
out of five, or yeah, one out of

34
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,040
ten even, but one out of five is

35
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,620
pretty good for a rate of turnover on

36
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,860
people actually taking any webinar and doing something

37
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,140
with it.

38
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,100
So I'm just letting you know.

39
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,060
I don't know if you're aware of the

40
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,940
rate of webinars and stuff like that, but

41
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,400
that's a good turnover for something, especially something

42
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,900
that's kind of, let's call it unusual.

43
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,700
Well, it's really unusual, because you're not supposed

44
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,040
to, no one's, like Mark Twain says, everyone's

45
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,960
talking about the weather.

46
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,500
When is someone going to do something about

47
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:25,700
it?

48
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,020
Because there were people working on it in

49
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,180
San Diego while he was still alive.

50
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,160
That's another thing you could look into.

51
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,940
Weather work was popular in the late 1800s.

52
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,040
I thought it was San Francisco, not San

53
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,160
Diego.

54
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:37,700
It was San Diego?

55
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,940
There's a statue of a guy who, he

56
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,240
used to do it chemically.

57
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,660
He used to have these little cans.

58
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,460
He'd light up some mixture on fire, make

59
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,900
all these smoke little pockets all over town

60
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,480
and rain would come after he did that.

61
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,920
It was like sulfur and some other things.

62
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,180
There's a memorial somewhere in San Diego attributing

63
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,040
his weather work, believe it or not.

64
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,240
Yeah, cloud seeding kind of stuff he was

65
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,640
doing, right?

66
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,120
Yeah, but it wasn't really high enough to

67
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,520
go up.

68
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,280
It was just like, imagine opening a can

69
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,600
of beans, but instead of a can of

70
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,039
beans, it's like sulfur and a bunch of

71
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:09,600
other stuff and setting it on fire, on

72
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,000
the ground.

73
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,260
So anyway, what I've been learning is that

74
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,840
the weather, it's really hot.

75
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,400
I noticed that when I do weather work

76
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,620
to cool it down, it made it hotter,

77
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,800
like a lot hotter, like 112, right?

78
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,780
And instead of 100 or 90, like at

79
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,400
the altitude that I'm at at 2,600

80
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,160
feet, 100 degrees is like 85 in New

81
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:31,740
York, right?

82
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,500
So it's dry.

83
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,820
And if you're under the shade, like even

84
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,700
from a twig or a branch of a

85
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,080
tree, it feels 10 degrees cooler.

86
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,800
So it's not bad.

87
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,300
But this intense heat keeps coming on and

88
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,480
I've been looking at the flows.

89
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,180
Anyone who was around for the webinar heard

90
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,500
me say that it works opposite the physics

91
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,220
that we're taught.

92
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,200
The colder flows move quickly, where in the

93
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,180
physics we're taught, when you chill something down,

94
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,200
it slows it down, right?

95
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,460
And the hot flows move slowly, right?

96
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,400
Colder stuff like that just seems lighter in

97
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,620
its appearance to me.

98
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,580
I mean, again, I got, you know, you

99
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,780
have different forms of density.

100
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,860
The hotter is denser with the ether and

101
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,560
the colder is more rarefied.

102
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,960
That's why the cold rises with the ether

103
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,980
and the heat goes down.

104
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:15,920
That's what I was saying.

105
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,840
That's what I visually observe, is that cold,

106
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,440
even though they've always told me it's like

107
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,000
heavier and this and that, it's not.

108
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,020
It is actually lighter.

109
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,520
No, no, no.

110
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,040
There are two types of cold and two

111
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,960
types of heat.

112
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,300
There are.

113
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,240
But generally speaking, that's what I observe in

114
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:31,600
the air.

115
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,960
I'm just saying what I observe.

116
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,140
Look, I may not have observed everything.

117
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,760
Well, even without observing, just the knowledge that

118
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,320
the higher up you go and up to

119
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,340
the colder gets.

120
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,920
But in order to make when you chill

121
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,200
something, it gets denser.

122
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,200
So one is a chemical reaction of cold

123
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,180
and heat where heat rises and cold goes

124
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:50,460
down.

125
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,020
Then you have the energetic reaction where the

126
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,820
cold rises and the heat goes down.

127
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,200
So when you're using that energy is not

128
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,120
a good term because people think in terms

129
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,400
of when you say energy in terms of

130
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,940
power and work, they think like electricity and

131
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,680
transference.

132
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,460
But that's not.

133
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,880
Yeah, we're talking about the stuff that makes

134
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,020
everything right is still making everything right.

135
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,640
So, you know how the human body has

136
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,580
the 28 elements that you find in soil,

137
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,160
like our bodies are made from your mother

138
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,700
is pregnant.

139
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,260
She doesn't eat what's on the earth.

140
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,980
You know, you're not you don't form.

141
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,200
So we're made from all everything is made

142
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,180
from the same stuff.

143
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,320
And the finer and the less composed it

144
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,940
is, just like when you the early mental

145
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,500
of periodic table, you know, was constantly being

146
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,460
reworked, took him a long time to publish

147
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:35,880
something.

148
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,860
They just publish it because he was wrestling

149
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,420
with several gases that are lighter than hydrogen,

150
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,420
smaller than atomic number one.

151
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:44,680
Right.

152
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,440
Because so just screw it.

153
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,820
Just make hydrogen one as well.

154
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,400
It's not one.

155
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,040
It's a grouping.

156
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,780
Walter Russell had known that.

157
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,820
And if you study what's called an imponderable

158
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,620
gas, you'll find a study of imponderable liquids.

159
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,400
What that means, like a ponderable liquid means

160
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,600
when you put a liquid in a container

161
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,820
and it's a well-structured container with a

162
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,460
good seal and a lid, you come back

163
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,920
any given amount of time and it's still

164
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,640
in that container.

165
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,000
Right.

166
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,920
But that's a ponderable liquid because you ponder

167
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,120
it.

168
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,760
You know, you know what it's how it

169
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,880
behaves and imponderable liquid.

170
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,620
You would put it in a well-structured

171
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,760
container with a good seal lid.

172
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,700
You come back the next day or a

173
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,340
week later and it's all over the table

174
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,240
and you study the container and there's no

175
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,540
hole.

176
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,640
There's no breach.

177
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,800
There's no corrosion.

178
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,180
The seal is still perfectly fine.

179
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,660
You're like, how the hell did this thing

180
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,920
get out of the container?

181
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,060
Right.

182
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,480
It went like right through the container without

183
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,040
breaching any of the structure.

184
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:43,420
Right.

185
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:43,640
No.

186
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,680
Yeah.

187
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,900
So you can't ponder it.

188
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,240
You know, it's like, my gosh, I can't.

189
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,140
I can't ponder that.

190
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,640
I mean, you can't accept it.

191
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,340
Right.

192
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,240
So there are imponderable liquids.

193
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,320
You can read about them.

194
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,420
There's less and less online, by the way.

195
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,740
But no one's talking ever about imponderable gases.

196
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,060
Now, back in the early 2000s, I mingled

197
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,920
with people that worked in aerospace, military, weapons

198
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,560
design, energy, all kinds of stuff.

199
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,780
And they were really funny.

200
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,520
I'll just give a paraphrase.

201
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,340
When they go up to high altitude into

202
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,580
space, they said, you know, there's a smell

203
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:18,740
there.

204
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,660
That's why I'm Freeman.

205
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,260
About 10 years ago, I was the first

206
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,920
person ever to say, you know, space smells

207
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,900
like burning flesh.

208
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,200
Not like a steak on a grill, you

209
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,260
know, that smells good.

210
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,980
That sharp fat.

211
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,480
No, no, no, no.

212
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,800
It smells like you threw a cat in

213
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,160
the fire or human burning.

214
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,500
It's very foul, like burning flesh smell.

215
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:36,720
Right.

216
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,060
That's an ugly smell.

217
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,300
Yeah.

218
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,740
I mean, because I've been near people that

219
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,520
are caught in fires and it's a nasty

220
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:42,960
smell.

221
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,240
Yeah.

222
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,580
That's what space smells like.

223
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,920
That's why when those ships come down, like

224
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,500
that probe from the Navy, they have to

225
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,800
hose it down and all that because they

226
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,960
think it's the Thorazine, not Thorazine, Thorazine.

227
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,820
The Zine, whatever fuels that are super toxic

228
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,120
uses rocket fuel like a drop of it

229
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
can kill 100 people.

230
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,020
That's why they also tell people to stay

231
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,380
away from it because of radiation.

232
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,520
It's B.S. Yeah.

233
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,500
So it's just the smell on it is

234
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,040
so bad they have to wash it down.

235
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,240
Because think about it.

236
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,640
When they're washing it down, it's falling on

237
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,000
the runway.

238
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,740
If it was really that toxic, they have

239
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:16,620
to contain all that.

240
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:16,980
But anyway.

241
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,460
Yeah.

242
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:17,960
No kidding.

243
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,680
Because that's that's that's the real thing.

244
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,360
So they.

245
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,900
So one of the things was when they

246
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,080
go, really, they have planes that go into

247
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,940
space and vice versa, other than the space

248
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:26,260
shuttle.

249
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,700
And if they were serious about space travel,

250
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,840
they wouldn't be launching them from the ground,

251
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,380
by the way.

252
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,860
They would be launching them from high altitude.

253
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,200
Right.

254
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,540
But anyway, the stuff they show you is

255
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,260
not how it works.

256
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,300
Back in the 80s, I knew people that

257
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,560
I was in contact with that were just

258
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,940
elevated platforms that hovered at 20,000 feet.

259
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,700
But but anyway.

260
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,180
Yeah.

261
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,100
What they did is when they go into

262
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,920
space or what they call space, they have

263
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,660
these containers and they fill them with space

264
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,040
gas.

265
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,700
But every time they brought Earth, they were

266
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,280
empty.

267
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,120
And they were plumbed.

268
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,160
Whoa, you're breaking up.

269
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,640
Whoa, you're breaking up.

270
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,640
You're breaking up real bad.

271
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,220
Oh, yeah.

272
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:07,540
OK.

273
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:07,800
Yeah.

274
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,700
That's because I'm walking near a weather machine.

275
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,320
Let me get away.

276
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:10,620
Yeah.

277
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,520
I'm outside.

278
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,760
So yeah, it's amazing.

279
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,400
You know, it's you can measure these.

280
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,060
They're past totally passive devices.

281
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,940
Yet they screw up smartphones.

282
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,920
So because, you know, there's like what, 30

283
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,080
billion transistors in a smartphone.

284
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,280
So there's you know, when you get that

285
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,060
small, it's sensitive.

286
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,960
So anyway, they would try to put space

287
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,320
gas and they just couldn't.

288
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,520
And they saw the container is not thick

289
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,080
enough, you know.

290
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,539
But they did get to the point where

291
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,860
they figured out how to capture.

292
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,200
And I'll let you know how they did

293
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,620
it just to the point, because I just

294
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,080
explained imponderable liquids, the same thing with gases.

295
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,120
They figured out that if they get an

296
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,660
aluminum container like a tank, a gas tank,

297
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,100
aluminum and it has honeycomb structure inside of

298
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,720
it and you put a lid on it.

299
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,920
But like, you know, when you get a

300
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,760
bottle of soda and someone doesn't put the

301
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,260
lid on too tight and it spills out

302
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,980
right now, whatever you do, don't put the

303
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,680
lid on tight.

304
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,860
Just get an aluminum container with honeycomb structure

305
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,560
inside, you know, pretty much filled the inside

306
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,880
of volume of the container.

307
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,000
It's all honeycomb structure.

308
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,380
Fine honeycomb has to be honeycomb and a

309
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,060
loose cap.

310
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,580
You will be able to bring that gas.

311
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,900
It will not escape.

312
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:22,760
But if you compress it, it just escapes

313
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,420
and disappears.

314
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,600
Yeah.

315
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,260
So weird, weird stuff.

316
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,480
Imponderable gases.

317
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,960
Another way to make them is with what's

318
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,180
called a Joe cell.

319
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,540
HHO, hydrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, HHO.

320
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,620
People try to make HHO gas for their

321
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:40,880
car.

322
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,860
You need a tremendous amount of electricity to

323
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,920
make you to run your car.

324
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,520
I've done it.

325
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,140
You don't want to use that.

326
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,840
You want to use the gases that are

327
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,820
lighter than hydrogen.

328
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,160
A Joe cell basically works by charging the

329
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,080
water in a certain arrangement.

330
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,980
There's very little online.

331
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,880
I've had over eight hour conversations with him

332
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,300
about stuff.

333
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,960
He doesn't really know how it works, which

334
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,400
is fine.

335
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,680
I mean, I make stuff that I don't

336
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,840
know how it works, but it works.

337
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,800
That way you can you can delve into

338
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,520
the Joe cell.

339
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,880
You can experiment and get to those imponderable

340
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,340
gases.

341
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,420
That's still the imponderable gases are still what

342
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,020
make to go back to the ether and

343
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,280
all that.

344
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,420
It's still part of what makes us makes

345
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,500
up our entire reality, including our bodies.

346
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,880
So with the weather work, make a long

347
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,700
story longer.

348
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,840
I've been discovering that whatever I'm doing here

349
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,380
is slowing down the flow.

350
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,020
So when you slow down the flow, it

351
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,540
warms.

352
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,820
It's a warming trend, right?

353
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,360
When you quicken the flow, it's a cooling

354
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,600
trend.

355
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,460
It's the opposite of what physics is.

356
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,140
You know, the chemical physics.

357
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,760
So, yeah, the only disadvantage of every time

358
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,840
I do work, it destroys Texas because it's

359
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,380
downstream.

360
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,700
And Georgia, Florida, and then it goes to

361
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,100
Europe.

362
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,160
It's because everything goes west to east.

363
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,440
So the solution for me would be to

364
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,740
go about 100 miles west of Tucson and

365
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,500
work there.

366
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,000
So it drops on Tucson.

367
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,180
Or I need to invest time and put

368
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,560
a rain magnets on the ground.

369
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,660
I have to make a map of where

370
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,260
I live and go out to the perimeter.

371
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,660
And a few near the center, like maybe

372
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,080
five or ten devices, very small devices, the

373
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,140
size of a can of soda or can

374
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,420
of beer.

375
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,920
And place them and they have to be

376
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,760
monitored and run every day.

377
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,460
So I'm not doing that stuff.

378
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,280
I was just conveniently trying to cool it

379
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,700
down here and just making it hotter.

380
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,420
I've never seen anything like this before, but

381
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,740
I'm able to diagnose it.

382
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,800
Yesterday, I did have some success of making

383
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,560
a storm, a zero chance of rain and

384
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,380
a storm ensued.

385
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,240
But it came very fast and discharged.

386
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,240
I didn't get any rain, but a lot

387
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,920
of people east of me got rain.

388
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,500
And I made a map of the radar

389
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,020
map shows everything surrounded where I was, coincidentally,

390
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,540
and I was directly in the center, like

391
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,140
a donut with an opening on it.

392
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,320
So, yeah, the weather work is excellent because

393
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,040
it's something that, it's not even discussed, right?

394
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,840
And when you speak to a normie, so

395
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,300
you do weather work, you mean you're monitoring

396
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:16,900
the weather, right?

397
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,000
You're doing weather monitoring, right?

398
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,360
No, no, actually, they can't, it's unfathomable to

399
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,540
them.

400
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,560
They cannot get it.

401
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,020
You're a meteorologist.

402
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,180
Yeah, they cannot understand that you can actually

403
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,060
manipulate the weather.

404
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,880
There was a guy back in the most

405
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,900
recent, well, one that was someone who cannot

406
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,760
understand it that actually had success, was a

407
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,800
guy that worked out in Corpus Christi, Texas

408
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,180
as a helicopter factory.

409
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,920
Anybody near there would know that when they

410
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
make those Apache helicopters and stuff.

411
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,860
He was building a house in Corpus Christi

412
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,580
and they were framing the house with wood

413
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,920
and all this rain kept coming and it's

414
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,300
hard for them to work in the rain.

415
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,680
So I said, look, just do this, this

416
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,260
and that.

417
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,840
That's not where they make the Blackhawks, by

418
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,060
the way?

419
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,780
I think so, yeah.

420
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,520
Sorry, go ahead.

421
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,000
Well, some of the parts.

422
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,420
It would be really, for any military, it

423
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,640
would be dumb to make everything in one

424
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:09,960
spot.

425
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,660
Well, a lot of them, what they did

426
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,100
is they split the business up and they

427
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,460
started making things in parts.

428
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,180
So you no longer have a factory that

429
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,020
just makes a tank.

430
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,500
And they're assembled in like a warehouse that's

431
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,780
nondescript or underground or whatever.

432
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,500
Oh, right.

433
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,040
So you see a bunch of machine parts

434
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,140
that go all over the country and then

435
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,600
everybody's got to get paid to ship them.

436
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,280
This is how you expand a business, by

437
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,540
the way.

438
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:36,180
Also, the largest submarine naval research facility is

439
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,560
in the middle of the Nevada desert.

440
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:38,820
Well, right.

441
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,940
It's true.

442
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,380
You can drive up, yeah.

443
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,400
Submarines sail underneath the desert, underground tunnels.

444
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,280
And in Connecticut, in a body of water

445
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,760
that has no connection to the ocean, is

446
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,360
also another place where they do submarine tests.

447
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,760
So it's just...

448
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,120
Yeah, it's all underground.

449
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,360
Kind of like the James Bond thing.

450
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,020
There was a movie that had an underground

451
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,160
submarine parking lot kind of thing.

452
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,920
And this thing is like, you go under

453
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,660
that small...

454
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,080
Let's just say you have a river, just

455
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,980
theoretically, you have a river and then you

456
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,520
go underneath the river and there's a place

457
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,120
to go under the river.

458
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,960
So that's what happens there.

459
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,420
Yeah, and people think in Hollywood, when you

460
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,800
say under the river, that it's small.

461
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,240
Some of these caverns, you know, when they

462
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,280
get up to 900 feet tall, they have

463
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,680
their own weather system again.

464
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,720
Yeah, city size.

465
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,380
Yeah, literally, like in a large city, not

466
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:27,640
small.

467
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,620
Yeah, so anyway, he just screwed a piece

468
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,980
of pipe and made a weather gun.

469
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,900
And he was like, I can't believe it.

470
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,860
It's raining everywhere around me, but it's not

471
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,840
raining where they're framing the house.

472
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,500
Yeah, and I said, he called the people.

473
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,560
They wouldn't come out to work because they

474
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,140
didn't believe it.

475
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,400
And they came out and worked, said, hey,

476
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,780
look, this guy could stop the rain.

477
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,140
This was about stopping the rain.

478
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,480
Didn't really want to get into particulars.

479
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,300
He says, look, at this point, if it

480
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,080
works, I'll do it.

481
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,700
And it sounds wacky, but I'll do it.

482
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,600
And he actually did it.

483
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,840
So in other words, brought that up because

484
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,440
there is a...

485
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,000
Wilhelm Reich talked about the why factor, meaning

486
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,720
like you are...

487
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,760
And so does...

488
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,140
The connections in three directions to make the...

489
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,300
Yeah, the person's intent can affect the machinery,

490
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:12,740
right?

491
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,180
That's why a lot of times when a

492
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,260
technical machine like a phone or a computer

493
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,380
or whatever stops working and the operator gets

494
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,180
nervous, it's really hard for them to fix

495
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,760
it because their energy goes into it.

496
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,980
It's better to call someone else who's not

497
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,600
nervous about the device not working.

498
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,300
But the why factor is what Wilhelm Reich

499
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:30,940
talked about.

500
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,640
And there's a guy, Pond, his name is.

501
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,200
He works on some devices from Keely.

502
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,460
These pressure devices with platinum stuff in it.

503
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,180
I saw one once.

504
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,460
It's got to be all the input of

505
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,500
the operator because I can't see how this

506
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,340
thing is doing anything.

507
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,640
But with this case, though, the why factor

508
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
had nothing to do with it.

509
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,680
The person's intent or knowledge had nothing to

510
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,080
do with it.

511
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,360
He just followed instructions.

512
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,220
As a matter of fact, you know, when

513
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,420
you build a weather gun, it's on a

514
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:02,660
pivot.

515
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,840
You should be able to move it around.

516
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,820
Think of a telescope.

517
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,120
He screwed everything in place.

518
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,240
I told him where to aim it on

519
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,660
the map.

520
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,500
I sent him a map on email.

521
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,960
And he screwed everything in place, immovable.

522
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,340
Kind of like in France in World War

523
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,240
I or so.

524
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,760
Before World War II, the French gave Hitler

525
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,780
a tour of their wall, of their guns.

526
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,640
What is it?

527
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,560
The marginal line.

528
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,120
And their guns were fixed in the wall.

529
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,840
So Hitler just went around them, right?

530
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,100
So he was fortunate enough that the storms

531
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,360
were coming frequently from the same place.

532
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,640
He just screwed this gun, basically a tube,

533
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,200
in place.

534
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,040
It was not movable.

535
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,500
And it still worked.

536
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,420
It pretty much had the most basic, basic,

537
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:44,760
basic.

538
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,640
So the thing is, when you bring this

539
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,520
up, because there's a thing that there's the

540
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,900
doubt that does it work or not.

541
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,280
Because no one hears about it.

542
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,600
And then there's the other aspect, which is

543
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,120
Wilhelm Reich or Pond talks about the Y

544
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,180
factor, the intent of the operator or the

545
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:59,900
energy character of the operator.

546
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,359
And I've seen where with weather devices, it

547
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:04,040
doesn't matter.

548
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,060
But it does.

549
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,579
In other words, if the person is fine

550
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,380
-tuned and the device is fine-tuned, there's

551
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,280
nothing better, right?

552
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,079
That's basically how it works.

553
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,119
Also, the people that are most successful with

554
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,680
it are the ones that go for low

555
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,339
-hanging fruit.

556
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,500
What I mean by that is, you remember

557
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:28,320
how growing up, we read literature and things

558
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,420
about how fighter aces from World War I

559
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,000
and World War II were idolized, right?

560
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,240
Young people don't know what the hell is

561
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,840
a fighter ace.

562
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,980
You don't hear about that anymore.

563
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,940
At all.

564
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,580
It's like rotary phone.

565
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,580
So the fighter aces, when one of them

566
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,180
was interviewed, more than one actually, the reason

567
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,800
they were fighter aces is because when a

568
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,660
pack of airplanes showed up, they were able

569
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,460
to intuitively and skillfully pick out the least

570
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,920
experienced and the most novice and the worst

571
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,000
fighter pilot and go after them.

572
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,920
The reason they were ace fighter pilots is

573
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,840
not because they went against good pilots.

574
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,940
It's because they found out who was not

575
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,780
good and shot them down and kept doing

576
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,440
that repeatedly.

577
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,260
The low-hanging fruit critique.

578
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,540
And that's where you can prove the weather

579
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,820
work is the easiest.

580
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,500
The low-hanging fruit.

581
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,100
If you have a storm coming, you could

582
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,100
slice down the middle.

583
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,680
You can do that with these devices.

584
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,840
What's complicated is being in the high desert

585
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,320
and having a heat wave type of year

586
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:36,880
and drought.

587
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,660
When we have droughts here, they last several

588
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:38,980
years.

589
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,180
And we're in one right now.

590
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,000
It's come back.

591
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,080
So I'm curious about fighting the drought.

592
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,760
And as I'm saying that, I set up,

593
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,340
I made a change before we got on.

594
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,620
And there's massive clouds forming in less than

595
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,780
the time that we've been on.

596
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,280
It was pretty much blue sky.

597
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,480
Now I'm under cloud cover.

598
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,080
Go figure.

599
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,360
That low-hanging fruit thing makes perfect sense

600
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:00,760
though, Greg.

601
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,660
Because here's the thing.

602
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,960
It's got multiple benefits.

603
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,260
Because every time you go out in a

604
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,300
squadron, you come back.

605
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,940
And, hey, the new guy didn't come back

606
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,320
with us.

607
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,280
Every single time.

608
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,700
It's sort of like, who's going to want

609
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,020
to be a red shirt on Star Trek?

610
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,440
Nobody.

611
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,820
So you're going to have trouble recruiting people.

612
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,060
You have to adjust for the fact that

613
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,820
you lost people.

614
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,220
And you're going to consistently do it.

615
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,960
And it was acceptable that the new guy

616
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,720
was shot down.

617
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,820
Yeah, it's acceptable.

618
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,760
But after a little while, somebody's going to

619
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,660
say, hey, you know what?

620
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,700
I don't think I want to go up

621
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,100
there as the new guy because they never

622
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,620
come back.

623
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,940
So you demoralize, depopulate, and de-incentivize your

624
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,260
enemy just by picking off the low-hanging

625
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,300
fruit first every single time.

626
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,220
So that consistent strategy makes more sense than

627
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,480
I think people would want to recognize.

628
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,780
Well, actually, too, I would disagree.

629
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,480
I think the champion, like years ago, the

630
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,420
two armies would meet.

631
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,700
Each one would send a champion.

632
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,160
And the champions would fight.

633
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,340
And the winner would be the winning army.

634
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,040
Oh, yeah, yeah.

635
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,860
So I think taking out the champion is

636
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,840
the demoralizer.

637
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,320
It's a multi-layered thing, though.

638
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,280
Oh, it is.

639
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,340
If you can do both, I'm just saying,

640
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,160
if you do both of those things, then

641
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,740
it's excellent.

642
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,780
Because you take away the incentive for the

643
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,360
new ones, you take out their best guy.

644
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,640
And it's just like if you ever saw

645
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,500
the movie Troy, they send out Achilles, right?

646
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,960
Yeah, the champion, yeah.

647
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,300
Well, anyway, Achilles killed everybody until Paris hits

648
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,280
him with the arrow in the Achilles tendon.

649
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,460
It's a secret.

650
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,880
Yeah, his mother held him in Hades and

651
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,600
down the river, held him from the ankles.

652
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,460
Right, and that's how he was not invincible

653
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,260
right there.

654
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,400
Anyway, but I'm just saying, if you do

655
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,040
both, it creates a very interesting dynamic when

656
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,060
these guys have to go home.

657
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,140
Yeah, but imagine, I think there's some people

658
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,740
listening, if you don't know what a fighter

659
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,680
race is, look it up.

660
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,940
They were quite glorified even until the 1970s.

661
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,120
Oh yeah, matter of fact, they would have

662
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,720
never even bothered to try and make those

663
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,580
movies, those Top Gun movies or anything, if

664
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,720
they weren't still trying to populate that and

665
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,080
popularize it as one of the big things,

666
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,280
right?

667
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,760
Because that was nothing but military propaganda.

668
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,200
Yeah, Top Gun would be the most contemporary.

669
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,440
Yeah, and they just made a sequel not

670
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,460
long ago, I don't know if you're aware

671
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:07,620
of that.

672
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,360
Anyway.

673
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,920
Yeah, I didn't even bother streaming that.

674
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,880
Yeah, well, who would?

675
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,900
You know what the story is.

676
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,480
So, look, I know you're into the weather

677
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,620
thing and all that, but I want to

678
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,080
get to just a couple of quick comments

679
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,240
before you run out of gas, because I

680
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,080
know you're going to probably get disinterested pretty

681
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,580
quick here.

682
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,660
No, no, don't say that.

683
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,760
Let's just do it anyway.

684
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,020
Okay, I'm sorry, maybe I misread it.

685
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,300
Anyways, now look, there was a little bit

686
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,120
of a discussion on a previous Sonic about

687
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,480
somebody not being a cushy or cushy not

688
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,840
liking cannabis or whatever.

689
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,820
So, there was a bit of a discussion

690
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,440
back and forth, and people wanted to know

691
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,600
about your view on that.

692
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,480
Oops, I heard a little introduction.

693
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:46,820
You're breaking up.

694
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,500
My connection's not that good.

695
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,880
Let me move from where I'm at.

696
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,400
Sorry.

697
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,800
There's something about cannabis.

698
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,280
Go ahead.

699
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,300
Yeah, cannabis.

700
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,240
A discussion broke out about cannabis, and then,

701
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,960
simultaneously, people wanted to know what your view

702
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,160
was on it, because I find it to

703
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:01,540
be useful.

704
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,200
And just a quick note here, you know,

705
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,380
the Greek is the only guy I ever

706
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,280
heard who is not a pagan, and is

707
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,820
not one of these woo-woo people, and

708
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,580
is not a witch, that attempted to explain,

709
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,940
and you don't see this online anywhere, that,

710
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,880
you know, the five-pointed star has a

711
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,140
meaning, and the six compartments and all that,

712
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,140
and what it actually stands for.

713
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,180
He actually had that correct.

714
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,980
And they used to teach pagan healers, by

715
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,020
the way, that everything was made of 27

716
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,900
elements, but that's because one of them is

717
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,520
duplicated in the 28 that's scientifically laid out.

718
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,900
Anyway, just throwing that in there, that's pieces

719
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,980
of those knowledge that never seem to get

720
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,360
out there.

721
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,260
Anyway, about cannabis.

722
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,600
They basically were going back and forth about

723
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,280
how, you know, certain people disapprove of it,

724
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,160
and they were talking about it for dreaming.

725
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,280
Okay, I'm obviously consolidating this for you, okay,

726
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:50,960
this discussion.

727
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,200
Dreaming.

728
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,320
The fact is that it does help people

729
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,880
sleep, and it does help them, say, not

730
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,100
dream and all that kind of stuff, because,

731
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,420
you know, it's useless interface, and people screwing

732
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,220
with them, or entities, not necessarily people, but

733
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,520
maybe people, screwing with them and all that.

734
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,500
So they want to know your view on

735
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,020
the use for cannabis to get those entities

736
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,800
to stop screwing with you while you're sleeping.

737
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,800
Well, here's the thing.

738
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,640
Isoch, Bentov, and a couple of other people

739
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,580
have read this, and I've also intuited this

740
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,120
intuitively, that nothing is wasted in nature.

741
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,020
When you're sleeping, your consciousness is being used

742
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,760
somewhere else.

743
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,360
And if you're not dreaming, they're just using

744
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,280
you entirely.

745
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,740
I think dream time would be something to

746
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,380
be looked at.

747
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,020
First of all, I have a feeling that

748
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,940
dream time, you can have a very long

749
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,400
dream, and it's only 30 seconds, right before

750
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,720
you wake up, is what you're getting.

751
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,020
Oh yeah, I've had stuff that I think

752
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,740
is days long, and then I find out

753
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,560
I've only been asleep 10 minutes, you know.

754
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,440
Yeah, exactly.

755
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,620
So it's just a download that you're getting.

756
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,620
Your consciousness, I would suggest, and I would

757
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,900
imply, that is being, when you're asleep, is

758
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,400
being used somewhere else, and you have no

759
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,600
memory of it, let's just say, there is

760
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,520
a, even in the biblical narrative, there is

761
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,460
a consciousness after death, after a certain time,

762
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,360
called the resurrection, whether you're in a body

763
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:12,920
or not.

764
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,820
So that would then pertain to the question,

765
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,940
is there a consciousness prior of you being

766
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,240
born?

767
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,980
Do you remember, I mean, let's say past

768
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,740
life memories aside, or even included, what do

769
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,440
you remember from before you were born?

770
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,420
So one of the most serious things that

771
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:35,140
has not been investigated, and it's discussed to

772
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,180
a certain degree technologically under the Donald Marshall

773
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:43,000
stuff, where your memory is given to you.

774
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,640
So when your consciousness, what I'm trying to

775
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,620
say, one thing that has to be looked

776
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,420
at is, how is it possible to so

777
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,900
thoroughly wipe memory?

778
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,500
So if your consciousness is being used somewhere

779
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,640
else, and you don't remember anything at all,

780
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,340
and you would call that a slept well

781
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:00,880
without dreaming, what kind of technology is used

782
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,860
to block that?

783
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,600
That's what I'm curious about, because maybe you

784
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,000
don't want to unblock that, right?

785
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,480
Well, a Faraday cage can block lots of

786
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,980
EMF, so why not?

787
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,620
Yeah, Faraday cages and all that, but they

788
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,380
can break through that also, because there's a

789
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:13,660
tuning.

790
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,840
Here's the thing, there is a tuning to

791
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,460
all shielding devices.

792
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,280
It's not discussed, just like the weather manipulation

793
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,000
is not discussed, but you can break through

794
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,220
any form of shielding if you understand its

795
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:27,600
tuning.

796
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,220
You can say frequency, but it's beyond frequency,

797
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,340
because there's no frequency at that point, it's

798
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,860
longitudinal, right?

799
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,940
There's no wave function, but it still has

800
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,380
a tuning to it, because there is a

801
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,080
function, let's say a frequency.

802
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,380
Frequency means how much per second, or how

803
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,080
much per given amount of time.

804
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,720
When you eliminate the time factor, that's why

805
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,300
when Tesla first started talking about his power,

806
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:59,440
it wasn't volts per amp or watts per,

807
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,600
it was volt amps, right?

808
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,420
There's no time.

809
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,020
When you say per, like miles per hour,

810
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,080
right, gallons per hour, volts per amp, you

811
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,160
have this time factor.

812
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,680
In order to break through shielding, and I

813
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,340
believe that this is the thing, to break

814
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,960
through the memory, you have to break through

815
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,740
what's called the time or event factor.

816
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,140
Event is a better, like there's no time

817
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,000
travel, right?

818
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,120
Because time is a made up construct, but

819
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,960
there is event travel, where you go to

820
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,800
past events, future events, this and that.

821
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,800
That's more accurate, and the reason why our

822
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,500
language, almost every word in our language is

823
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,000
an oxymoron, you know that, right?

824
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,360
Once you start researching the way our communication,

825
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,060
everything is an oxymoron, so we have to

826
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:38,960
start cleaning that up.

827
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,280
Everything is backwards too, like everything is mislabeled,

828
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,680
I mean it's like somebody just randomized the

829
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,860
whole thing and decided to flip it all

830
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,620
upside down.

831
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,180
Well, the key to unlock many things is

832
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,020
to discover how to break through the memory

833
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,060
wipes, is another way, it's called a memory

834
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:58,980
wipe, lack of memory, a memory wipe, because

835
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,260
you know, for example, if you were conscious

836
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,260
before the now, meaning when you were born,

837
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,320
and even when you were born, many people

838
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,520
are not conscious, the earliest conscious memories are

839
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,220
maybe one, two, three, four years old, so

840
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,980
there's a memory wipe or lack of retention,

841
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,480
that is the thing, that is the major

842
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,740
contention of breakthrough, or breakthrough, let's say, technology

843
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,480
or skill to have, is to break through

844
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,460
memory wipes and memory blocks.

845
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,420
Well, it's not necessarily a problem with the

846
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,480
memory, it's a problem with the access to

847
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,920
it, and the problem with the access to

848
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,720
those earlier memories is that you have, you

849
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,500
know, that certain bit of your neurology is

850
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,800
still incomplete, so you don't have the recall

851
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,920
memory, I think that's fairly solid.

852
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,940
I don't think it's physical, I think it's

853
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,360
tuning, it's a tuning issue.

854
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,660
Have you ever looked at the neurological development

855
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,460
previous to, because if you look at it

856
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,700
from a certain standpoint, that time period matches

857
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,240
perfectly with the time period where still the

858
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,220
blood-brain barrier is incomplete, and you have

859
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,080
this difference in the neurological makeup of the

860
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,880
babies versus, you know, the toddlers even, the

861
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,500
transition.

862
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,380
As your size changes, just like anyone does

863
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,640
AM radio, as the size of the antenna

864
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:16,340
determines the frequency band, that's still a narrow

865
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:16,800
spectrum.

866
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,620
Oh, you hear thunder?

867
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:18,940
No, I do actually.

868
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,220
That's pretty quick, that was a very rapid

869
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,200
storm forming, but it's not going over where

870
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,480
I am at.

871
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,880
It's very subtle, I'm not sure if the

872
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,260
recording picked it up, but yeah, I did

873
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,140
hear a little thunder there.

874
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,120
Yeah, it's about 15 miles to the east.

875
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,720
Shoot, I need it to come over here.

876
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,580
Yeah, okay, last thing I want to interject

877
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,060
in here is just one thing about this,

878
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,400
which was not in the notes or the

879
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:36,820
discussion.

880
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,600
I hear all the time from a lot

881
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:44,320
of these woo-woo people that they've had

882
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,980
all kinds of choices previous to the...

883
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,660
Yeah, but hold on, again, that argument is

884
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,520
an open-ended thing until we really, where's

885
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,040
the evidence?

886
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,480
And the evidence would be, you know, because

887
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,100
contracts can be verbal, right?

888
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:56,640
Right.

889
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,780
So if you're being held to a choice,

890
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,320
it's a contract, so it could be verbal.

891
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,520
Do you remember saying that or emitting such

892
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,180
an agreement, you know, from you mentally or

893
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:07,500
whatever?

894
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,120
That's the thing, it goes back to memory

895
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,300
wipe and memory block.

896
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,800
So if you can't ever open the box,

897
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,880
that argument never ends.

898
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,800
Well, that's why the MKUltra guys called them

899
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,160
memory caps, right?

900
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,820
Memory cap, yeah, all that stuff.

901
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,500
To me, that's the biggest, what would you

902
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,120
say, block?

903
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,640
Once we can eliminate the memory cap, the

904
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,140
memory block, the memory wipe without time factor,

905
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,120
in other words, you can have access to

906
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,620
all information from all time, that would be

907
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,780
the ultimate answer.

908
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,740
And then you could form your questions properly,

909
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,780
because right now all those questions are valid,

910
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,440
but they cannot be addressed with these memory

911
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,800
blocks.

912
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,300
Imagine having a box with something in it

913
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,840
and the box cannot be opened and is

914
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,780
never opened.

915
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,640
That's all philosophical then.

916
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,500
Yeah, it's academic, you can speculate all day

917
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,160
as to whether that box is empty or

918
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,980
what it contains, it doesn't matter because you

919
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,660
can't get into it to actually prove.

920
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,920
Yeah, academic is actually a really bad word,

921
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,300
by the way, but yeah, I get it.

922
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,160
But that was the point of me using

923
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,100
it, because it means that it's just about

924
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:20,040
that useless, because if you cannot solve the

925
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,100
thing anyway, because you don't know what X

926
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,160
means, then there you go, you're out.

927
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,540
X doesn't necessarily solve by not knowing it

928
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,180
in that case.

929
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,600
What academia is about is all these different

930
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,420
ways to dumb you down, is what it

931
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,560
is, really.

932
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,680
But yeah, so it's a part of the

933
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:37,900
dumb.

934
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,840
If you're putting energy on something that you

935
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,440
know cannot be resolved, it's a form of

936
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,080
dumbing down.

937
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,060
And it's a good way to keep people

938
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,420
distracted and wasting their time, which I talk

939
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,640
about all the time, and so do you.

940
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,680
And ultimately you say that's the meaning of

941
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,560
life, so fair enough, I don't argue with

942
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:56,720
you.

943
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,880
Okay, so here's something about the hierarchy, and

944
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,320
I'm going to just read the whole thing,

945
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,320
which is only a couple sentences, but it

946
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,020
needs to be read because I want you

947
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,300
to take in the whole thing and they

948
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,580
know that their question was asked.

949
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,060
I'm new to learning here, so please excuse.

950
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,000
I thought Yahweh is the God of Israel,

951
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,560
so that is different than biblical Christ?

952
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,940
Satan being God of this world, does that

953
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,700
factor in?

954
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,540
Okay, what they're trying to understand is these

955
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,140
different names, and what are they actually talking

956
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,320
about, and what is the reality of it?

957
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,440
Well, here's the thing.

958
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,040
The Bible is very, very simple, by the

959
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,320
way.

960
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,420
Just look at the story.

961
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,340
We're looking at the story regardless.

962
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,560
Okay, so when you get some information here,

963
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,440
check this out.

964
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,720
I don't know what it is, whatever body

965
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,240
of information.

966
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,540
You have to go through what's in the

967
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:49,520
information first, and then decide whether it's fact

968
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,420
fiction or whatever.

969
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,200
It's very cohesive.

970
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,800
For example, let's use what Jason Breshears talks

971
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,460
about.

972
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,080
You know, like Yahweh is a desert demon

973
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,700
popped out of a burning bush.

974
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,280
First of all, there's no burning bush.

975
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,620
It's very clear that Moses is speaking to

976
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,920
an angel that's radiating flames, and he's afraid,

977
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,280
and the angel then puts a bush between

978
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,600
himself and Moses, so Moses is more coherent,

979
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,760
but his flames do not burn the bush,

980
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,020
so there's no burning bush.

981
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,880
Yes, that sounds like a large cicada bug

982
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,400
behind you, like a loud bug.

983
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,040
It is.

984
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,640
I'm going to go to the other part

985
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,220
of the house because cicadas that come out

986
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:27,620
when they're hot.

987
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,920
So the burning bush thing right away, when

988
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,120
you hear someone say that means they don't

989
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,980
know, they haven't read it, or they're going

990
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,520
along with what somebody else wrote, you know,

991
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,900
that person's going along with what somebody else

992
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,160
wrote.

993
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,380
The other thing is when the conversation does

994
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:44,140
take place about who are you, he says,

995
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,020
I am the God of your forefathers, so

996
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,400
he was known, but prior, he's not newly

997
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,880
introduced in the book of Exodus, like, let's

998
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,220
say, Brashear says, he says, I am the

999
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,740
God of Abraham and your fathers, and Jacob,

1000
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,940
and so on and so forth, so he's

1001
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,180
not new, so again, it didn't come, wasn't

1002
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:05,660
entered there.

1003
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,600
So using that as an example, no stain

1004
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,240
on Brashear, he puts out some good stuff,

1005
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,680
but he's terrible with the biblical stuff, in

1006
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,440
my opinion, and I could back it up,

1007
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,060
he would never debate me on this because

1008
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,140
there's no debate.

1009
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,120
We just go back to the text.

1010
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,740
The name shows up.

1011
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,720
Now, it doesn't matter if this is written,

1012
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,500
it was written 20 years ago or a

1013
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,720
thousand years ago or at the time that

1014
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,320
it was supposed to be written, let's say,

1015
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,860
either way, it doesn't matter.

1016
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:35,580
The text is very cohesive by bringing up

1017
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,840
the Yahweh and who the Christ is and

1018
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,680
all that other stuff.

1019
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,980
The main thing about the Christ stuff is

1020
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,680
very simple.

1021
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,800
He's the God of Israel and it's not

1022
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,680
a geographic Israel, right?

1023
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,560
You get it?

1024
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,240
But it happens to be because you can

1025
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,040
say, if you say the land of the

1026
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,440
Italians, it's Italian here or whatever, it's close

1027
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:58,820
enough.

1028
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:04,100
The thing about the Christ, again, it's based

1029
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,000
on, I knew someone years ago who, when

1030
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,840
religious arguments would come up, he says, yeah,

1031
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,000
you believer in Jesus, and they're like, yeah,

1032
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,980
what religion was Jesus' religion?

1033
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,000
That shuts people up right away, right?

1034
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,639
Because it's not Christianity.

1035
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,800
So the thing about that is, again, very,

1036
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,460
very easy to see that I don't trust

1037
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:28,040
having a discussion with anyone regarding, let's say,

1038
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,719
the New Testament or who the Christ was,

1039
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,100
because when you bring that figure up, most

1040
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,600
people think of a guy nailed to a

1041
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,060
cross wearing a diaper, right?

1042
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,199
And the three wise men coming, right?

1043
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,480
So quick dispelling that, when the Christ was

1044
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,440
born, the wise men, we know it was

1045
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,520
two or more, not three, it was two

1046
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,219
or more, it's probably a caravan of 100,

1047
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,100
the Christ was about two and a half

1048
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,300
years old when they came to him, right?

1049
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,000
That's pretty clear in the text, very clear,

1050
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,380
right?

1051
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,320
The amount of time it took to The

1052
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,980
other thing is, we're talking identity now, and

1053
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,340
when he was born, was given by an

1054
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:08,500
astronomical alignment, and that astronomical alignment, if you

1055
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,620
take it back, would be the year 3

1056
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,640
BC, the month of September, the day of

1057
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:13,940
11.

1058
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,020
That's why they had that big birthday party

1059
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,020
for him, right?

1060
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,500
In September 11th.

1061
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
So the other thing is, when he was

1062
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,460
arrested by the Judaean, notice I didn't say

1063
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,980
Jewish, Judaean religious authorities, and brought to the

1064
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,720
puppet king, and then brought to the prefect

1065
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,400
governor Pontius Pilate, Pontius Pilate says use your

1066
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,040
law, right?

1067
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,880
And your law to the Judeans, and there

1068
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,160
was a retort that says how can we

1069
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,060
use our law under Caesar?

1070
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:44,200
So the law, the Judean capital punishment, is

1071
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,880
death by stoning, and Deuteronomy 21 says it's

1072
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,380
a high crime, you're nailed to a tree,

1073
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,640
and he uses the word son.

1074
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,420
So you have three men nailed to an

1075
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,680
almond tree, because we know there's almond tree

1076
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,160
references, not olive tree, almond tree references, and

1077
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,600
the same tree, and the people passed stoning,

1078
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:02,940
right?

1079
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,680
Passed from third to seventh, on and on

1080
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,880
and on, we know that from the book

1081
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,640
of numbers, anything hanging from a tree is

1082
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,540
a curse and to be burned, that's why

1083
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,760
they cast lots for the clothing, because the

1084
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,560
people were made aware of the ceremony, right?

1085
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,820
So it's kind of like, let's say the

1086
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,500
Chinese took over the U.S., and they

1087
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,220
do 4th of July here, and the Chinese

1088
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,640
military that's occupying the U.S. doesn't know

1089
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,900
anything about it, so it's like you have

1090
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,440
to explain to them on the fly, what

1091
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,480
is the 4th of July about?

1092
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,020
Oh, well, they have hot dogs, hamburgers, and

1093
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:27,700
they blow up fireworks.

1094
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,520
Oh, okay, right?

1095
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,920
Oh, so blow up the fireworks, okay, we

1096
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,980
need to have a fire, you know, but

1097
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,220
what if there's a fire, you know, whatever.

1098
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,000
So anyway, the Romans were made aware of

1099
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,700
this, the tree was going to be burned

1100
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,080
and all that, and so there's no, I

1101
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,440
cannot, all of, in other words, all I

1102
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,740
hear online, in books or whatever, it's all

1103
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,220
false, because it seems like we're not even

1104
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,120
talking about the same text, so I don't

1105
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,460
really want to have, when I do biblicals

1106
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,140
talk, I almost don't want to hear what

1107
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,000
the other people have to say.

1108
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,120
I will talk at you, I'll talk at

1109
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,140
you, but I won't talk to you, I

1110
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,400
won't talk with you, speak with you, unless

1111
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,000
you can prove that you know what I

1112
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,960
just mentioned, and, which comes from the text.

1113
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,540
I have no belief in this, I just

1114
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,820
happen to know the text, and that's all

1115
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,260
we have.

1116
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,580
It's like, I don't bother, you mentioned Italians

1117
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,300
before, I don't bother to speak to people

1118
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,800
unless they understand that Italy's a construct, actually,

1119
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,160
and you're talking about Sardinia, Sicily, and Rome

1120
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,120
all being cobbled together.

1121
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,320
If you don't know that, we're not talking

1122
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,000
about the same thing.

1123
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
Yeah, well, it's actually a model, it's a

1124
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,400
similar thing that's happening here, you know, the

1125
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,160
50 states here are all 50 nations, independent,

1126
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,320
they each have their state constitution, you have

1127
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,640
the powers of the state, and all that.

1128
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,160
The only thing was, you know, they put

1129
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,060
Mussolini in power, they're like, you know, what

1130
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,720
are you going to do for, if we

1131
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,740
put you in power, you got to do

1132
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,580
us a favor and make the Vatican, it's

1133
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,920
a state, you know, it's an independent state,

1134
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,220
right?

1135
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:50,740
Yeah.

1136
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,920
And that's what he did, so that's why

1137
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:53,880
they put him in power, he was the

1138
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,140
only one that was going for it, because

1139
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:00,100
he basically denationalized the group that he was

1140
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,580
that he came from by doing that.

1141
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,080
But anyway, it's another discussion, I don't know

1142
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,320
much about it, but I thought that was

1143
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,800
really funny how Mussolini declared the Vatican an

1144
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,280
independent city-state, so.

1145
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,680
Yeah, it's because it was the central bank

1146
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,860
essentially, and it needed to be, yeah, I

1147
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,660
know, but that's the They run everything through

1148
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,460
there, yeah.

1149
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,440
So people don't understand that part of that

1150
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,780
history, so it's like, when they start talking

1151
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,500
about Italy, I'm like, oh God, you know

1152
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:22,800
nothing.

1153
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,940
The Italian language was even...

1154
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,780
Well, the Italian, I mean, you can go

1155
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,560
from one state in Italy, one country in

1156
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,160
Italy, because it's all these little countries put

1157
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,560
together, and there's animosity between others.

1158
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,380
An example would be Spain and Catalonia.

1159
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,900
Catalonia in Spain is an example of what's

1160
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,000
happening in Italy, really.

1161
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,800
And you have the Swiss, you know, the

1162
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,780
Italians near the Swiss border are radically different

1163
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,300
than the ones in central about, and then

1164
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,980
radically, Sicilians might as well be Greeks, so.

1165
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,400
Well, there you go, and that's where my

1166
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,860
people come from, and that's what I'm saying.

1167
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,740
It's a different situation.

1168
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,560
It was a different language, too.

1169
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,920
They actually unified the languages through the military.

1170
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,900
Anyway, but that's my point.

1171
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,920
Yeah, they made some kind of Latin revision

1172
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,640
and all that, yes.

1173
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,880
Yeah, and they did that by saying, okay,

1174
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,120
we're going to put a Sicilian, a Sardinian,

1175
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,280
and a Roman together.

1176
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:15,820
Here you go.

1177
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,920
You guys each get to speak this new

1178
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,660
language, which is Italian, which is part of

1179
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,140
each of your three languages, and that's how

1180
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:21,940
they cobbled it together.

1181
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:22,880
I'm just saying.

1182
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,380
Yeah.

1183
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,620
You got Torino, Bologna, Bolognese.

1184
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:29,620
Yeah, they all have distinct...

1185
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,920
Actually, it's proven.

1186
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,060
They also have distinct bloodlines, by the way.

1187
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,480
Yeah, I know.

1188
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,960
They're not even related in terms of DNA

1189
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,040
or whatever genetics.

1190
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,920
They're a bit more intermingled now, but...

1191
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,740
Yeah, after World War I, yeah.

1192
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,320
Yeah, after World War I, but starting in

1193
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,340
about the 1800s, so it's not this...

1194
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,360
Italy's an ancient country.

1195
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,900
No, it's not an ancient country.

1196
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,640
It didn't exist a long time.

1197
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,580
The Roman Empire existed here and there, but

1198
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,560
not...

1199
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,380
Well, yeah, Libya was a colony of Rome

1200
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,600
up until 52, was it?

1201
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,260
And Germany.

1202
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:04,820
Germany was owned by Italy, basically, by Rome,

1203
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,280
and not only that, but...

1204
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,020
Yeah, they had the Hungarian Empire and all

1205
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,340
that, yeah.

1206
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,580
The entire road structure in what they call

1207
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,020
Great Britain, right, in England, the entire road

1208
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,740
structure is based on the Roman engineers who

1209
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,180
set it up.

1210
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,780
Oh, yeah, the Roman miles and the way

1211
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,060
the roads are laid out, yeah.

1212
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:23,280
Exactly, exactly.

1213
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,900
So, anyway, look, I didn't mean to go

1214
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,940
too far...

1215
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,280
Well, that came from Greek technology, which was

1216
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,260
tied in with Egyptian technology.

1217
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,860
Yes, because that's what the Romans did.

1218
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,500
They picked up on all the...

1219
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,340
But my point is that people that don't

1220
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,280
know this history think that it's this other

1221
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:40,500
thing.

1222
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,960
Anyway, I understand what you're saying.

1223
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,420
Oh, we got off on that, but, again,

1224
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,000
memory block is a big deal.

1225
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,400
That's the main thing.

1226
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,720
That's why I check up on Donald Marshall's

1227
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,360
stuff, because he's able to Again, I just

1228
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,800
read what's being said about it.

1229
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,300
There's quite a body of work that he's

1230
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,820
put out where your consciousness can be snatched

1231
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,120
using technology, basically, and I believe it.

1232
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:09,120
But one of the keys to understanding the

1233
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,520
technology is you cannot factor time in it.

1234
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,040
It can't be something per something else.

1235
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:19,900
Like the concept of decibels is independent of

1236
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:20,460
time, right?

1237
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,220
An old term is measuring things by decibels,

1238
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,120
which was Nieper's.

1239
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,880
And if you have any encyclopedias from pre

1240
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,100
-1920, dig in and look up pressure, pre

1241
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,700
-1920, electrical pressure and all that stuff, you'll

1242
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,780
be like, oh, my gosh, what happened to

1243
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,500
all this engineering?

1244
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:42,400
If we would have just continued applying the

1245
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,740
stuff that was discovered up until the 1920s,

1246
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,940
man, we would really be, you know, let's

1247
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,280
say, advanced at this point.

1248
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,900
Half the stuff we discuss here would not

1249
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,200
even be advanced at this point.

1250
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,140
It would be normal.

1251
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,040
So something happened around the 1920s...
