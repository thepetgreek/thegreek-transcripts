1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,820
Rated Y, Sonic Event 139, and here we go, Greek, how you doing?

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,680
Okay, I need a nap, but this is a good substitute for a nap, right?

3
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:19,240
Excellent.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,940
You were yawning before we started recording, I was wondering if that was going to continue.

5
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,880
Anyway, look.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,500
Yeah, you know what that means, a yawn, I think we talked about what flatulence is, but a

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:38,340
yawn is when you're, the exchange of nitrogen to oxygen, because you're not absorbing oxygen

8
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,020
and giving off CO2, like they say, oh, that is so, I remember as a child, when they say

9
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,700
you absorb, take in, right, oxygen from the environment, and then you give off CO2, right?

10
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:57,800
It didn't sound right, because even if you, even if you, how would you say, even if you

11
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,820
establish that, right, and say that's the way it is, it doesn't make any sense, there's

12
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,280
no way, I mean, how does it happen?

13
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,160
And they don't tell you how it happens, right?

14
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,860
Yeah, weirdly, they explained to me when I was a kid, I thought, this is the explanation,

15
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,300
that you take it in and it's got oxygen and all these other things in it, you use the

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:18,540
oxygen and you put back out everything else, and some of the oxygen even comes back out.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,140
But how?

18
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:19,780
How do you separate it?

19
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,120
Here we go, but then that's where we go with the absorption, you know, where they say we

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,880
absorb oxygen.

21
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,680
Or the exchange.

22
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,640
The only way to do that is by ion exchange.

23
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:32,260
You need something else to do it, and they never get into that, and they give a bullshit

24
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:38,640
excuse for it, but what that means is the ability to convert the elemental nitrogen

25
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:46,960
or the compound nitrogen into oxygen is somehow thwarted, delayed, not optimum, right?

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,460
That's why, oh, I need some sleep, right?

27
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,960
Because sleep is therapy, recovery.

28
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,760
Right.

29
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:59,620
And you breathe deeper and you breathe slower and all that stuff during that time, you know,

30
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,660
that's always interesting.

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,860
Your heart rate goes down.

32
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,580
And just for a recap, people don't know, what happens is the nitrogen in the air, we're

33
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:11,900
nitrogen breathers, not oxygen breathers, and the nitrogen, when it meets the lung tissue,

34
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,680
there's a field in the lung, which will get into the ether, there's a field, each organ

35
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,800
has its own composition in nature.

36
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,300
In early Greek speak, I'll get into, by the way, what we might do with, we might want

37
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:33,060
to recap everything in the future when we start again, or continue or whatever, because

38
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,820
like a reboot, you know, but really go over the subjects again, again, again, and again,

39
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,340
right?

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:46,660
Okay, what's going on is there's some field, or a potential, not field, but a field means

41
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,000
it's already in action.

42
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,040
The potential, just like the block wall and the magnet, you know, the part that doesn't

43
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,320
stick to anything is the potential.

44
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,520
So that part, when the body is ready, again, how does it get ready?

45
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,980
It converts the nitrogen into oxygen.

46
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,360
But in order for it to nitrogen, let's say, if you look at the periodic table, either

47
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:15,220
the Walter Russell one, or the Mendeleev one, you'll see that as nitrogen descends

48
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,120
into oxygen, it passes carbon, right?

49
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,940
Just like when you take carbon and turn it into iron, it passes nickel.

50
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:30,200
So you retain those qualities and produce some of it also, and it gets in the mix, right?

51
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,580
And it gives the illusion that there's an exchange, because there is no drop of oxygen

52
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,360
in the air.

53
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:45,060
You know, if you're in a sealed room, and you say, I'm running out of air, you see it

54
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,060
in movies all the time, right?

55
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,720
I'm running out of air.

56
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,220
The oxygen level doesn't really decrease.

57
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:57,100
What's going on is the conversion rate of the nitrogen is screwing up the oxygen, the

58
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,220
nitrogen balance, right?

59
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,020
Because of the conversion rate.

60
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,100
That's another discussion.

61
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,060
It can be proven by experimentation.

62
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:11,300
And there is a decrease in oxygen, because the oxygen then, the ready oxygen, proportionately

63
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,220
decreases, but it's not that you're using up the oxygen.

64
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:20,560
Sometimes, in some situations, you do require, the body will take the oxygen, but under high

65
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:20,959
stress.

66
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,180
Right?

67
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,800
Just like, for example, they tell you that, what is it, blood cells are produced in the

68
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,500
bone marrow, right?

69
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,240
Only, okay, how did they figure that out?

70
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,080
They took subjects, and they fasted them, and they had them under closed conditions,

71
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,460
and they noticed that around the end of the bones, you know, where the strands are tied

72
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,660
together, there was an emission.

73
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,500
But under normal conditions, that's not where the blood cells are formed, because remember,

74
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,200
they were under very strict conditions.

75
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,340
That's not normal.

76
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,260
Like, blood pressure testing is not a normal condition, right?

77
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,320
So the conditions that they created are not normal conditions.

78
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,940
In normal conditions, blood cells are produced on the inside part, meaning the outside of

79
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,340
the intestinal walls, right?

80
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,520
So you can, yeah, this is the whole thing on the body.

81
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,800
So once you start looking at this, you can do real research, which the Flexner Report

82
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,700
kind of banned, because if you look at the Flexner Report, which was done in 1910, 1912,

83
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:27,620
15, or whatever, it said that only exists, listen, he says, this is how the AMA is going

84
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,860
to be run, and only existing techniques and whatever are going to be used.

85
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,440
That's it.

86
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,520
So that means there's no more research, right?

87
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,320
If you make a decree that you're only going to use current and existing techniques, that

88
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,700
means there's, so, right?

89
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,720
So there's no more research.

90
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,140
Well, you can do all the research you want, but you're not going to apply it.

91
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,140
It's not going to be acknowledged, yeah, but it's all based on the military's need for

92
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,460
medicine.

93
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,020
That's why there is research, to a degree, for injuries.

94
00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:00,560
So anyway, that was a big tangent, where the original thing is the Bar Association, right?

95
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,500
Did I bring that up?

96
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,540
We're going to talk about that?

97
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,180
You did mention the Bar Association, but we didn't get there yet, today, anyway.

98
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,160
I was asking you about the ether, and then we got into this thing about the oxygen, so

99
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,340
yeah.

100
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,900
Someone put a Bar Association in the chat, I think, Vandy, what does it stand for?

101
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,940
And that's an age-old question, no one knows, and some say the British Accreditation Regency.

102
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,320
All of the stuff online about them is bullshit, as they are.

103
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,140
Well, does it have anything to do with where they say you go for a side bar, like they

104
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,600
literally say it's a bar?

105
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah, well, the bar is the architecture, it's an architectural element, and there's two

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,920
of them, the one in the back and the one in the front.

107
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:47,640
And it's part of a procedure that they have, it's a ritual.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,520
I think, like, when Christopher Hauser did his research about justice, it's based on

109
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,900
the Greek goddess D-I-K-E, on the Isle of Lesbos, can't make that up, right?

110
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,020
Also interesting that the judge speaks from a bench, and yet the entire audience is sitting

111
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,900
on what I would identify as benches, every courtroom in the world pretty much looks like

112
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,420
that, right?

113
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:18,960
Yeah, but this is an old tradition, and it's gone away with you, okay.

114
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,600
The bar association is one of those organizations like the CDC.

115
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,700
It doesn't, CDC is a private, like CNN.

116
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,860
So it's a private company that serves a function.

117
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,960
Yeah, but it's an association, okay.

118
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:39,120
Associations are like Boy Scouts, Sierra Club, Girl Scouts, those are associations, Boy Scout

119
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,000
Association.

120
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,280
It's actually a format for forming an organization, like a title, which is another thing, Brandon

121
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,520
Joe came up with, why don't we just do organizations and no corporations or trustees?

122
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,160
Because when you have an organization, you don't require a charter, right?

123
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,720
So because I remember having trust, well, I still do, and they use it, and they're like,

124
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,560
oh, we want to see your trust.

125
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,240
And I was like, oh, I don't like to see the trust.

126
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,000
But so what you do is a certificate of trust, right, and you have them have it on file.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,120
And it's a lot of paperwork.

128
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,940
Yeah, with an organization, all you need is an organizational principle.

129
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,980
All you got to say is you're an organization and that's enough.

130
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:23,500
You don't need to show anything, any bylaws or rules or charters or organizational founding

131
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,200
documents.

132
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,300
No, okay.

133
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,360
That would be the way to go.

134
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,980
And also conferring nationality, which I've been thinking about, because now that when

135
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:37,760
Brandon brought up, you can confer nationality, however, and by whatever means, right, necessary

136
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,340
or possible.

137
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,520
I can say right now I'm conferring the nationality of Finland on us, both of us, and you agree

138
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,160
for this sonic event, at the end of the sonic event, well, we're going to confer the nationality

139
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,380
of, I don't know, Spain on us.

140
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:58,160
And that makes us that nationality, because I remember when I went to expatriate and everybody

141
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,500
was kind of like the vice counselor, who's the head honcho of the embassy, he's like,

142
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,660
I don't know, you know, you really, you know, do you really want to?

143
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,820
It's like, you guys don't really know what you got to do to say it, right?

144
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,640
Well, it's interesting.

145
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,380
It's almost like that one guy who declared himself, you know, just a citizen of the world.

146
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:16,900
Right.

147
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,720
He said, I'm just a citizen of the planet.

148
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,460
It helps it.

149
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:25,460
Well, the title states that it would allegiance to a state, which is a group of people.

150
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,140
So the world as a state, you could say United Nations, which doesn't have a geographical

151
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,360
list.

152
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,220
You don't have to have a geography to be a state.

153
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,620
But let's bounce back to the Bar Association.

154
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,900
There, there was a, I still, you know, Mandela effect.

155
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:48,200
I'm really, really a big proponent of it, because I remember reading stuff, even holding

156
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,780
a book in my hand and then recalling it five years later, I can't find the book, can't

157
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,840
find the author, can't find any of it.

158
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,120
Right.

159
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:03,220
But what you'll find is commentary, federal, retired federal judges, several of them have

160
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,020
written books on how corrupt the system is.

161
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:05,360
Right.

162
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:05,780
Right.

163
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,640
And they always talk bad about the lower courts, but also what they're doing.

164
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,760
But one federal judge went into the history and the whole thing about attorneys, the main

165
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:22,340
crux of attorneys is that they were most popular in a feudal state because the feudal slaves

166
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,600
and serfs couldn't go in front of the lords, you know, the landlords that would be represented.

167
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,040
And it just means that, you know, you're giving up 30 percent every time you deal with these

168
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,280
guys.

169
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:30,980
Same as today.

170
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,640
But in ancient Greece, there were a bunch of academics that were trained in arguing

171
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,340
and winning arguments and debates.

172
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:42,160
And they were so highly educated and they always bitched about not making as much money

173
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,920
as other people who were less educated.

174
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,240
So what they started doing is started accusing wealthy people of things and arguing it to

175
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,840
the point where they made them look like they actually were guilty.

176
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,080
So the wealth.

177
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,780
So the wealthy people would give them fees and retainers to leave them alone.

178
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:03,580
And that's how the the attorney culture started in ancient Greece or I'm sure in other places

179
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,860
that were just as sophisticated.

180
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,400
Right.

181
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,620
Sounds like talking basic protection record.

182
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,100
But go ahead.

183
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,300
Yeah.

184
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:08,500
Yeah.

185
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,340
Just like wealthy people have an attorney on.

186
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,340
Yeah.

187
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,180
It's the same.

188
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:12,520
Right.

189
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,160
Same thing.

190
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,220
I personally think they're scumbags.

191
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:22,720
Now, as a group, as a whole, you could just get a stamp, write scumbag and put it on their

192
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,200
forehead and it would be apropos.

193
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,560
But I don't want to base that just on opinion.

194
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,600
But the word opinion, when you look it up, it's a judgment or decision made on with very

195
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:41,860
little or no knowledge based on no judgment or decision based on very little or no knowledge.

196
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:42,840
Right.

197
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:42,940
Right.

198
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,440
So I can back it up with a lot of things now.

199
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,700
Well, what would you call an opinion that's actually backed up by knowledge?

200
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,720
It's got to have a different name.

201
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:50,940
Then.

202
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,100
Yeah.

203
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:52,520
Yeah.

204
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,360
Then it's not an opinion.

205
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,560
That's more of a fact.

206
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,300
But the now what happens, as I've mentioned, with very little exception, there are people

207
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,420
that want to go into the trade and they find out what it's about.

208
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,600
Now they're stuck because now they got to go do something else.

209
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:09,080
So you got to give them two weeks to two years to transition.

210
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,940
The same with the medical.

211
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,560
Right.

212
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,860
Usually if you see an old attorney or whatever, that's talking about serious scumbaggery there.

213
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,200
Right.

214
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,000
Mm hmm.

215
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,760
Very serious.

216
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,220
It's a bar.

217
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,720
I think in Eastwood used to use that term a lot.

218
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,100
A lot.

219
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,360
Yeah.

220
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,880
They're not good people at all.

221
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,640
There's no such thing as a good attorney.

222
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,220
You might have a more competent one, but none of them know any law at all.

223
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,380
I want to go.

224
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,480
Let me go back inside.

225
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,220
I just came outside.

226
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,320
I'm going to go back inside the house and go in front of the computer recently pulled

227
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:38,640
up.

228
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,280
There's you know, they do court cases online.

229
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,680
Right.

230
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,000
Yeah.

231
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,620
Video tape.

232
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,940
This one is a more of a proper tribunal.

233
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,500
They have three judges about some kind of bill of exchange.

234
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:54,340
They railroaded this guy into that it was a it was a fake instrument or bogus instrument,

235
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,120
which is bullshit.

236
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,900
It's not in the law.

237
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,260
There's no such thing as a bogus bill of exchange.

238
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,500
But it's it's the name of the YouTube.

239
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,880
You could watch it if you even if you're not really well versed in law, you'll see what's

240
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,420
going on.

241
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:14,560
It's actually best if you don't know the laws to watch it, you'll get a feeling of something's

242
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,260
wrong here.

243
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,360
And then when you start learning the law, you'll see what kind of a bunch of jokers

244
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,580
and morons these people are.

245
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:25,580
It's the Law Chronicles is the YouTube channel, the The Law Chronicles.

246
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,060
And the YouTube is from two years ago.

247
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,100
It's called Bills of Exchange Court Appeal SF, California.

248
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,100
I want to see a bunch of idiots and jokers.

249
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,820
They they give.

250
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,340
But what's interesting, if you don't know any laws at all, you'll say, but wait, it sounds

251
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,380
like they know the laws or using law.

252
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,860
It sounds like they are.

253
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,420
But once you study, like I said, if you study law definitions, not the laws themselves, but

254
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,180
the definition.

255
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:04,060
So each group of law has a title or a section or a subchapter that defines what's in the

256
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,800
group of law.

257
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,100
And that group of law could be hundreds of pages.

258
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,960
But don't delve into that.

259
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,620
Just read the definitions, right?

260
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,460
So if you it doesn't take very long to get familiar with the definitions of a few minutes

261
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:20,140
a day on each section, you will know more than all the attorneys in the country, because

262
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,920
if there are three, let's say two million attorneys in the country, which two million

263
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,380
times zero is still zero.

264
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,240
So that's how you will know that much more than all of these guys.

265
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:29,860
It's a joke.

266
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,280
It's kind of like when you say, you know, the pope's work schedule, you go to, you know,

267
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,080
what he taught.

268
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,380
I've never heard of it put that way.

269
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:37,940
This is the attorneys.

270
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,760
They know no law.

271
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,510
Yeah, it's a scourge.

272
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,400
They're a scourge on society.

273
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,860
Now, are they bad people, inherently bad people?

274
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,800
No, because you can take a wrong turn in life and want to do that.

275
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,060
Right.

276
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,080
But they're not good people.

277
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:59,220
Like I have a thing that if I offer several devices and things that I do for people, if

278
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,120
you're an attorney, I'm not.

279
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,300
You're not getting my stuff.

280
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:01,680
Sorry.

281
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,680
You know, if you're a judge, attorney or an M.D., you're not getting a scale rate or you're

282
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,440
not getting accuracy.

283
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:07,980
Argentum.

284
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,740
Sorry, dude.

285
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,520
Go get go.

286
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,300
Take your medicine.

287
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:15,860
You know, I'm biased towards them and I don't think they deserve better things.

288
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,600
That's my opinion on that.

289
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:18,920
Right.

290
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,100
Because someone else might say they do deserve it.

291
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,660
Fair and equal.

292
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,080
Right.

293
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,660
But is that a point of view based on little knowledge?

294
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,400
That's part of you based on my personal bias against them, but not based on knowledge.

295
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:37,020
And the knowledge base that I have accrued about them has led me to that as my opinion.

296
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,060
OK, because I can't tell someone else.

297
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,300
Well, it would look if I were king for a day, I say that's it.

298
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,260
No, no.

299
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:43,820
Don't.

300
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,900
If you're an attorney, you're not allowed to come into any store, buy anything.

301
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,840
I would definitely say that.

302
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,040
I would definitely push that on people if I had the power to do that.

303
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,200
Right.

304
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,560
So you can't buy food.

305
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,600
You can't buy clothes.

306
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,660
You can't get gasoline.

307
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,260
Right.

308
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,500
So to starve them out of organized society.

309
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,080
Oh, yeah.

310
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,520
Yeah.

311
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:02,920
I would.

312
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,180
Yeah.

313
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,460
That would be a good way to go.

314
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,820
So that that's how bad it is.

315
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:13,240
Now, they know in law, if you have to prove intent, it's going to be hard to prove that

316
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,400
all of them are bad.

317
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,900
Like I said, they're not bad, but they're not good.

318
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,260
Right.

319
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Just because someone's not directly bad doesn't mean that they're good either.

320
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,280
Most of them are just imbeciles.

321
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,680
They're just doing it for a paycheck, like everybody else out there doing something for

322
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,060
a paycheck to feed their family.

323
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:37,100
But you should actually, after being working in the field for three or four months or even

324
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,180
two weeks, know like, wait a second, you know, but they have a really good way.

325
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,860
I've spoken to people working in banking and they're like, well, why does the bank endorse

326
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,020
it?

327
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,660
This all because that shows that there's a lien.

328
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,660
Everybody goes, oh, OK.

329
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:49,880
And there is no lien.

330
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,520
You know, the bank is taking your stuff, right?

331
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,140
You know, like the part where you run down your bank account and the bank transfers it

332
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,840
over to a part of the bank that you don't see and they take it from you.

333
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,820
They tell their own people, well, oh, that's because we have a lien on it or something.

334
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,099
And they're like, OK, that's a good reason.

335
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,240
Because if you ask for too many reasons, you may not get a paycheck.

336
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:08,720
Right.

337
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,780
If you ask too many questions.

338
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,180
Yeah, that's exactly what happens.

339
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:14,220
Yeah.

340
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:14,599
Yeah.

341
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:19,960
So that's so again, but but it shouldn't be that way because everything's already been

342
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,500
paid for.

343
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,560
It's a really fucked up place we live in.

344
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,460
Now, the MDs are just as bad, by the way.

345
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,400
Not very.

346
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,359
None of them know how.

347
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:27,920
OK.

348
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,240
If you listen to Greek speak for like six months, you'll know more than all the doctors

349
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,320
in the U.S. put together.

350
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,360
Because how many doctors are two million?

351
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,740
What's two million times?

352
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,200
Zero.

353
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,260
Still zero.

354
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,140
Yeah.

355
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:39,840
Right.

356
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,500
Now, we're not talking a procedure.

357
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,900
Oh, by the way, I have spoken to surgeons.

358
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,600
Right.

359
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,500
Major surgeries, too, like 18 hours.

360
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:46,960
Right.

361
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,500
And they take a break and they come back for 12 more hours.

362
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,780
That kind of surgery.

363
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,100
Right.

364
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,440
OK.

365
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,140
I'm like, well, how do you, you know, basically having a discussion a little bit, then how

366
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,720
does the body.

367
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,620
How do you anticipate recovery and convalescence?

368
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,120
Oh, the body heals itself.

369
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,300
The body heals itself.

370
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,200
Chop.

371
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,360
You know, the body heals itself.

372
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,640
They don't know about doing anything to assist it to heal.

373
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,000
Right.

374
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:09,940
At all.

375
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,080
They don't know how it works at all.

376
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,760
They admit it.

377
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,340
We don't know.

378
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,080
Well, they'll start.

379
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,320
Yeah.

380
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:13,620
Yeah.

381
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,760
But, you know, they'd rather not talk about it.

382
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,700
They don't know.

383
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,000
Right.

384
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,940
Which I say is a testament to the robustness of the human condition in the human body.

385
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,280
You are so robust that you can actually.

386
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,560
The human body can take so much, quote unquote, neglect and abuse and still recover.

387
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,380
That's why they're getting away with what they're getting away with.

388
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,660
Right.

389
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,460
So the Bar Association, I don't know what it stands for.

390
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,820
I think they just it was called the crown also.

391
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:49,360
And in Canada, I think Australia may be most likely that many a lot of ministry stuff in

392
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:54,900
Australia and New Zealand, all the other places of where England is or was.

393
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,780
They call it ministries and crown.

394
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,860
But it's it's borrowed.

395
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,800
It's the typical pagan stuff.

396
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,580
I haven't used that term in a long time.

397
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,180
Pagan just means ignorant.

398
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,300
It just means ignorant.

399
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,080
They're just ignorant.

400
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,420
So, yeah, it's it's negative.

401
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,320
But that's part of the here's the thing.

402
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:21,060
If you're just passing through here and like for me, I know and with all my intuition that

403
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:26,320
I was I'm here because of an administrative error, somebody stamped either for me to come

404
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,960
here at this time.

405
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:27,920
They fucked up.

406
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,700
So I have to go through this.

407
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:29,880
Right.

408
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,940
I know I don't belong here.

409
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,540
Let me put it this way.

410
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,320
From when you're six years old, you flip a coin or 10 years old, sometimes you flip a

411
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,340
coin to see or the, you know, the eight ball thing.

412
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:40,980
Yes or no.

413
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:41,500
Whatever.

414
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:41,920
Yeah.

415
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,440
Flip the coin every time I flip a coin or do any kind of, quote unquote, quick divination

416
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:49,880
on that.

417
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,560
You know, the quick, you know, ask the gods a lot every time.

418
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,360
Not, you know, nine out of ten, but ten out of ten.

419
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,080
Every time it comes out that I shouldn't be here when I cast lots, I could cast lots,

420
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,640
you know, pulling straws every time because I shouldn't be or shouldn't be or should it

421
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,280
solid.

422
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:13,160
So from a casting box, which is biblically lawful, by the way, it's a form of divination.

423
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
Right. Because you're not OK.

424
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,280
Anyway, that's the Bar Association.

425
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,180
We don't know. We don't care because they shouldn't even I shouldn't say this.

426
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,840
But one time I had a discussion with an assistant D.A.

427
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,600
and brought up some things that they were doing and they just stopped and said, are you

428
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,640
saying we don't have a right to exist?

429
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,320
I didn't even bring up anything ensuing that.

430
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,960
Right. That's how they think.

431
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,780
They're on the defensive.

432
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,040
Now, again, if you don't know law now, you know how, you know, law is the definitions

433
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,780
of law, not the laws themselves.

434
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,080
How can you know law? There's like five hundred books and there are five hundred pages

435
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,700
thick. No, it's the definitions that you need to know to apply it.

436
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,800
Right. See, like words are tools and the definition of the word is how you use that tool.

437
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,700
Right. Right. You could use a screwdriver, a Phillips screwdriver or a Torx

438
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,460
screwdriver. You know, the ones that have the five or eight faces.

439
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,140
Right. OK. Spline screwdrivers, flathead screwdriver.

440
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,220
You know, that'll make a fine paint stirrer.

441
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,300
You know, if you have a small container of paint, you can chip ice with it, too.

442
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,400
Yeah. Right. Chip ice with you while your fridge is plugged in and then wonder why it

443
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,720
doesn't get cold anymore. Right.

444
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,720
So that happens often.

445
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,960
And so but you see what I mean, it's that's not that's it's not being used as defined,

446
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,960
like the word nice is not being used as defined.

447
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,620
So they're really a bad thing.

448
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:34,820
But they're there. They're here.

449
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,400
There's their purpose here is to move things along that actually prevents more controversy

450
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,460
than there would be without them, without law.

451
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,760
And they're part of the scourge.

452
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,540
It just reminds you like, you know, this is not a good place and they will always be here

453
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,840
until the place is redone.

454
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,900
You're not going to change it.

455
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,400
Just avoid them. But just really here to keep things in motion, pretty much.

456
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah. Yeah. And I've got it.

457
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:04,500
I've been studying these idiots for 30 years now, three decades, pretty on it pretty

458
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,540
earnestly since 2003.

459
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:12,580
And especially from people who have family members that work in the law field.

460
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,540
And they're like, yeah, they really don't know anything.

461
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,180
I was in some Greeks who asked some questions and they answered exactly.

462
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,280
They said exactly what you said they would.

463
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,680
Great. Duh.

464
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,060
Yeah. Talk about like doing nothing.

465
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,660
But anyway, but that's how that's how things run.

466
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,540
That's how things work. By the way, if you want to know, it's not indirect.

467
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,820
Go. There's plenty of attorney generals that have been quoted in newspaper articles and

468
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,560
journalism. Let's say that, you know, it's not who reads the newspaper now.

469
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,720
It's on the Internet. Right. Right.

470
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,660
So there's plenty of attorney general quotes.

471
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,040
Go, go read them, all of them.

472
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,940
And you tell me this is like some bum out of the eighth grade that's trying to bully

473
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,520
someone. Right. Have you ever noticed how they speak?

474
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,480
Yeah. Not smart at all.

475
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,980
These people are like, oh, the one that was in the spotlight and it was the most verbose

476
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,260
probably since the 70s was that Eric Holder guy.

477
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,580
It's like every time he said something, he put his foot in his mouth.

478
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,440
Right. Right.

479
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,540
And but they all do.

480
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,000
But people are just raised.

481
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,980
I mean, it's a very bad situation.

482
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,140
But is it any worse than having the Catholic Church in your country?

483
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,580
Think about it. Yeah, could be like the worst possible thing is to be Catholic and

484
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,920
attorney, a Catholic attorney.

485
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,200
Can you imagine now you win the ticket?

486
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,280
You win the prize.

487
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,440
Yeah, because I mean, how do you get any worse than that?

488
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,560
I don't know that, you know.

489
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,980
Yeah. You won the prize.

490
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,660
You know, they put the big medals on the medals, like 20 pounds, you know.

491
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,220
You win it. You won.

492
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,560
Yeah, it's it's bad.

493
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,620
That's the gold standard knowledge.

494
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,580
That's the gold standard for being a shit.

495
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:50,240
The absolute worst thing that could be around.

496
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,760
Yeah. Oh, my gosh.

497
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,380
Yeah. And that's not let's just say that's an opinion, but it's based on a lot of

498
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,960
fact. So, OK.

499
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,260
So, yeah, that question about the ether, though, where I started to begin with,

500
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,800
though, the question that came to me was, is there more than one type of ether?

501
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,880
That was the big question.

502
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,720
No. Yeah. Yes.

503
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,160
Man, man. OK.

504
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:24,280
Ernst Lehr was I'm paraphrasing here because I haven't been into Steiner for a

505
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,160
long time. Too airy fairy for me.

506
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,600
Get to the point.

507
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,940
People, it's kind of like, you know, the charismatic professor and all the young

508
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,740
girls and ladies like sitting in the front and they will go over, you know, kind of

509
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,300
thing. OK. But that's the point where the guys were doing that with Steiner, too,

510
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,960
you know. But he had a secretary, Ernst Lehr, and Ernst Lehr waited until

511
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,680
Steiner passed before he wrote the book Man or Matter, because Steiner was such an

512
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:57,120
asshole. The last thing you want is criticism from your boss, who's an asshole.

513
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,340
Right. Yeah, of course.

514
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,780
Yeah. It just makes it doubly worse.

515
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,660
Right. And it's almost worse than having a boss, a boss who's Dutch, you know, from

516
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,600
Holland. I don't think I've ever had.

517
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,940
So, yeah, you don't want to know.

518
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,140
Now, the wife is Dutch.

519
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,940
So, yeah, but she's I don't know.

520
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,440
She's the boss. It doesn't matter.

521
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:23,420
But, yeah, you don't want to work for a Dutchman or woman or from Holland.

522
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Yeah. Anyway, so he waited.

523
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,640
I'm paraphrasing here.

524
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,560
And Man or Matter gets into the four ethers.

525
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,560
You have the light ether, the heat ether, the life ether and the chemical ether.

526
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,200
And they each have corresponding shapes and colors.

527
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:44,040
I don't I don't get into that because in order to subdivide the ether means you have to

528
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,560
know enough to subdivide it.

529
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,800
And I don't think we really know enough about it because we're it's the common substrate

530
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,620
of all things. And because it's a common substrate of all things, you can't see it.

531
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,940
You're you're barred from you're barred from objectifying.

532
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,940
You know, because it's so common, there's no contrast to it in our current space.

533
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:09,280
So and just just as a quick question, though, Man or Matter, you're talking about an

534
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,660
introduction to a spiritual understanding of that book, right?

535
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,500
Yeah. Yeah. So what I don't know the year I'm outside again, so I'm not in front of the

536
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,720
laptop. No problem.

537
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,460
But they did. What year was it?

538
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,220
A third edition.

539
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,860
30s. What was it?

540
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,720
Well, no, a third edition was published in 2014, apparently.

541
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,200
So. Yeah, yeah. Good, good.

542
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,600
That's again, there's too much a lot of Steinerism.

543
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,100
Now, don't don't take it that Steiner stuff isn't good.

544
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,660
I'm not saying that at all. It's brilliant.

545
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,760
But it's just the way that he puts it out is just get to the point, dude, you know, and

546
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,380
your your ideas of cosmology are fine.

547
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,560
You know, you should keep half of it to yourself and tell us what works in the meantime.

548
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,200
But it's just what happens.

549
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:58,240
What I'm saying is when you get to know people, like if you are a sensitive and very

550
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,200
sensible person, like if you read a lot of people, OK, if you read the Bible and you

551
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:08,100
find yourself in the setting, like you can almost sense the setting, you know, the

552
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,200
light. Is it a cloudy day?

553
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,160
Is it a sunny day?

554
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,140
Is it winter? Is it summer?

555
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,480
You know, what's the feeling if you if you're like that, like you can pick up a book

556
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,660
and start reading and you get the setting so much like you're there.

557
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,640
Right. They've actually done Disney movies like that, where they open a book and then

558
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,840
suddenly you're in the book. Right.

559
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,160
Right. Right. Yeah. Children's movies and things like that.

560
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,060
Yeah. They do that transition, that visual like they open the book and then they fill.

561
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,300
Yeah, that's a good point. If you can transition into the setting of what you're

562
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:42,020
reading, you'll pick up a lot of stuff with Steiner and you'll be like, oh, man, this.

563
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,760
No, no. But but I know there's something I can use and it's worthwhile here.

564
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,340
But the rest of it, no, not for me.

565
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:55,220
And it's kind of like the same mentality that one of those short, short

566
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,640
novelettes that the Lonely Housewives in the 70s, where it was a big boom of these

567
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,280
little. Who is that, Fabio?

568
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,520
The long they they they made these.

569
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,060
Oh, he was one of them. Yeah.

570
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:10,400
The little like the tawdry little sex novels, like they were romance

571
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,120
romance novels or whatever they call romance novels.

572
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,180
Yeah. He's like a he's like a new age romance novel, whatever.

573
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,960
No, don't buy it for me.

574
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,540
Doesn't work. But he does put out some good stuff and he gets into the ether or

575
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,020
whatever. Am I knocking Steiner?

576
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,740
Yeah, you could take me knocking Steiner.

577
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:34,280
The Steiner put forward some really good work and that you could use a lot of it.

578
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,140
Yeah, absolutely.

579
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,920
So you have to sift through it.

580
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:41,020
It's not necessarily like trying to have said this in a long time, eating

581
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,320
undigested corn out of somebody's poo.

582
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,940
It's not like that. Right.

583
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,280
What do you mean? That corn is perfectly good.

584
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,800
Right. So who wants it after it's been?

585
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,040
Yeah. You never you know, I'm the only one who gives analogies like that.

586
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,420
So. Right.

587
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,860
But you're not it's not that bad.

588
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,800
It's not that bad. The mainstream media is like that.

589
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:05,260
If you're trying to study something based on what the mainstream media put out,

590
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,340
you're definitely eating undigested corn out of somebody's poop.

591
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,640
It is much like trying to sift through that and get it back out.

592
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,560
Yeah, that's true. Like, you know, searching for a needle in a needle stack,

593
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,980
for God's sake, that's what you do.

594
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,200
Actually. Yeah, right.

595
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,580
That would be a needle haystacks.

596
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,680
Easy. You just get a strong magnet or not so strong magnet, a broad magnet.

597
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,600
You'll find it fast.

598
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,560
That's why I said a needle in a needle stack, right?

599
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,060
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. But then which needle?

600
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,580
Yeah, exactly. Which needle?

601
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,020
Real quick. The ether. Yeah. Yeah.

602
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,560
Sorry. No, I get back to the ether.

603
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,800
We don't know enough about it because it's the substrate.

604
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,600
We cannot objectify it.

605
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,260
Right. Fair. Like. Yeah.

606
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,960
It's like asking, hey, I what voltage is it running?

607
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,640
And, you know, what am I? What what are you, AI?

608
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,540
You know? Yeah, that gets in some weird space

609
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,380
because I've seen people do that with the A.I.

610
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,620
And a lot of people are starting to do like little substats

611
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,800
about their conversations with A.I. now.

612
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,520
And it's kind of interesting, I think.

613
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,220
But real fast, the Bar Association thing.

614
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,640
Last thing is they mentioned in the chat, you know, like it's all in all caps.

615
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,040
And again, that's that means that it's something that's not

616
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,260
real thing, right? Because.

617
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,800
Well, yeah. Well, yeah, it's a true.

618
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,580
If you look up the style manuals, every country

619
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,860
in the U.S., they buried the style manuals, except for, I think.

620
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,960
Kansas and Ohio, you can find style manual.

621
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,820
And basically it's grammar.

622
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,540
You know, it's improper whenever you see it.

623
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,580
OK, in the third grade, if you wrote your name in all caps, you fail.

624
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,260
They'll fail you.

625
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,620
Third grade and penmanship class is improper.

626
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,380
So in order to justify why the improper spelling,

627
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,580
they have to define it in what's called a style manual.

628
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:45,960
Every every recently, the United States style manual resurfaced online, I heard.

629
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,420
And they basically tell you if it's in all caps, it's either an acronym,

630
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,260
abbreviation or trust, legal fiction or corporation.

631
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,720
And so in this case, it would be a trust because it's not a corporation

632
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,800
or a legal fiction. OK. Yeah.

633
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,480
OK, so that's what Bar Association is.

634
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,940
So the last thing we know, we don't know what it is.

635
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
We know who it encompasses.

636
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,700
Oh, by the way, there is no license to practice law.

637
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,040
There is no such thing.

638
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,760
It's a bar card. It's a membership card.

639
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,340
It's like saying I have a license to be a Boy Scout.

640
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,440
And the Boy Scout pulls out his membership to the BSA Boy Scouts Association.

641
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,300
I have one of those.

642
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,540
I from 1972 or 1973.

643
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,540
It is always a membership card.

644
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,040
Yeah, and I had one a little later, a couple of years later,

645
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,340
because I'm BSA with the eagle, the phoenix or whatever it is. Yeah.

646
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,580
So the last thing, though, is that you were talking about

647
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,140
Chad GPT just before we started also.

648
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,660
And the thing is this.

649
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,960
I'm watching people write and have these weird conversations.

650
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,400
And, you know, you ask Chad GPT what it is.

651
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,460
And you and I talked about this way earlier.

652
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:55,000
I forget which sonic way back, though, where we talked about it on Rated Y here.

653
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,300
And and I said, what do you think of this?

654
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,000
You know, what is your and you just said, well, it's really nothing yet.

655
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,900
Uh, do you still think that way or do you think it's

656
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,980
no, I'm with Archaic's on this and I didn't he put it together.

657
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,720
He's got more because this whole thing is Archaic's, which is art.

658
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,940
It's based on artificial intelligence X, whatever.

659
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,520
That's the accurate way.

660
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,980
But years ago, I've said that this whole thing runs on an artificial intelligence

661
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,580
very simply, just like you have self-driving cars, right?

662
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,500
When you're the OK, when you're the boss,

663
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,520
you hire people to do stuff for you, like the captain of a ship, right?

664
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,700
Doesn't do anything, right?

665
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,280
Yeah. I mean, physically do anything or perform any tasks.

666
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,860
He's the captain. Right.

667
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,080
But let's say you have a really advanced ship.

668
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,040
Is it possible to have the captain on the ship and the whole thing is automated?

669
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,040
The dog. Yeah.

670
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,840
Actually, that's offered right now.

671
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,540
Right now on any kind of ship.

672
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,480
So for having it fully, it's just need more sensors.

673
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,320
And I was arguing with someone at the smoke shop recently about AI.

674
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,680
And so that's all sensors, man.

675
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,660
There's no way the more sensors, the more sensitive it gets. Right.

676
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:03,020
So anyway, you know, the self-driving cars work on sensors.

677
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,400
That's all. The more there's just smaller, miniaturized sensors

678
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:11,780
and all networked together and feeding, you know, tasks, information tasks.

679
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,880
Yeah. And that's all it is.

680
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:19,500
And anyway, so if you're the boss and you have a crew doing stuff for you,

681
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,540
can they be replaced by a machine? Yeah, of course.

682
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,520
And that's all it is.

683
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,900
And so basically everything is run by something

684
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,380
that is not how we normally see things running.

685
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,980
Like I know the weather is run by some kind of organic AI.

686
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,160
I know that because I interact with it. Right.

687
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,200
Not on a cognitive level, like I talk to it because they do weather work.

688
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,140
I see what it's doing. Right. Right.

689
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:48,980
And I know if I know when to do weather work and when not to do weather work.

690
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,600
And when you figure that out, you're like, oh, yeah,

691
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,280
I'm dealing with an intelligent thing here.

692
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,120
So the common people will be fooled by it,

693
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:01,000
just like they're fooled by everything, the shot, the vax. Right. Right.

694
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,100
Okay. Don't they know there's no such thing as, oh, by the way, tangent.

695
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:10,340
They're starting to spray New York City fumigate for West Nile mosquitoes.

696
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,760
Guess what you're going to see in about a month to three months.

697
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,320
Babies crippled polio.

698
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,560
Polio. There's no such thing as polio. Right.

699
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,199
Well, they just said they had a few cases pop up for the first time

700
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:27,400
in like 60, 70 years in in Palestine, in Palestine.

701
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,840
They just had a few of them pop up. Oh, yeah. Yeah. They're spraying.

702
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,739
Yeah. They could also be weaponized.

703
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,920
You could spray the stuff and cripple everyone. It's a neurotoxin.

704
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,440
Yeah. This is not a conspiracy theory.

705
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,199
This is proven.

706
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,760
There was over a dozen doctors that went to Congress

707
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,980
to ban DDT because there was stuff again

708
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,320
with Jason talks about insects appearing and things.

709
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,239
But all through the teens, 20s, 30s and even as late in the 50s,

710
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,840
a lot of medium sized towns throughout the US during the busy time of day

711
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,580
on mainstream, I mean, Main Street and busy time of day.

712
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,960
Swarms of flies would show up like something out of the Book of Exodus

713
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,700
enough that the swarm would cast a shadow over the street.

714
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,980
Right. Like people would be horrified by it. Right. Right.

715
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,320
So they had these DDT trucks going around. Right.

716
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:22,380
And then suddenly young children and adults couldn't walk.

717
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,440
And they said it was right.

718
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,520
A polio and they did a vaccine, which didn't do any of this.

719
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,280
And there was doctors that went to Congress.

720
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,940
And there was a woman that wrote a book, Spring Time, something,

721
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,860
and who said there's no such thing as polio.

722
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,440
It's the DDT spray. Right.

723
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,500
But, you know, as long as it's not acknowledged by the authorities

724
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,360
and the people look at the authorities, they're going to believe.

725
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,440
So anyway, what I'm saying is in New York City,

726
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,100
it depends on how much spraying they do.

727
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,880
Watch out for babies. That'll be crippled.

728
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,740
And then they're going to say it's a virus and it's not.

729
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,500
You know, so it's pretty insidious.

730
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,960
Talk about the Bar Association.

731
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,360
And now, you know, why lawyers and doctors don't get scaler, right?

732
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:02,920
Yeah. And so and by the way, there's two of them that have been denied already.

733
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,680
So good. Well, you know, 50, 60 years ago,

734
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,800
there were plenty of things where the U.S.

735
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,800
government finally did admit that they sprayed a whole bunch of crap in New York.

736
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,440
They sprayed stuff in the subway and they did all kinds of specially.

737
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,440
They did radioactivity and bio and chemical.

738
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,920
And there was even that lawsuit in New Jersey, which is another fun thing

739
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,120
is, you know, people say there's no such thing as chemtrails.

740
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,660
Well, there's artificial clouds that are created.

741
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,700
No, there's no such thing as chemtrails.

742
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,420
But if you look up stratospheric aerosol injection, it's fully acknowledged.

743
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,560
Yeah. And not only that, but why is it that the state of New Jersey

744
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,740
would turn around and sue other places over the fact that this stuff

745
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,020
was being generated and there were artificial clouds being created over the state?

746
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,380
So they're just trying to generate revenue.

747
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,060
They don't care. But that happened in the 70s, by the way.

748
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,120
No, no, no. I get you.

749
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,940
But from the stuff that's been released,

750
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,500
but I think there was someone who was hammering the foyers

751
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:58,640
back in the early days of the I think the teens of the 20 teens.

752
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,320
And they got put a lot of information online.

753
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,440
I checked some of the FOIA stuff and they did radiological in New York City

754
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,440
subway at the at the Battery Park, you know, where the number one ends down by Wall Street.

755
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,520
Yeah, they did. That's right.

756
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,000
Radiological. They did radiological.

757
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,720
And other times they did chemical.

758
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,460
And other times they did biological, biological.

759
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,480
And no one really got sick.

760
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:25,620
There was no reported mass, you know, mass illness from it.

761
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,320
So again, we're pretty tough.

762
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,380
Right. So we're pretty tough as a species.

763
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,120
But you got that's why I'm a firm believer

764
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,820
in when they talk about custom genetically tailoring the stuff.

765
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,660
That's that's absolutely the way to do it.

766
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:45,640
You know, like if you look at black people get blood.

767
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,380
What is it? Sickle cell.

768
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,280
Sickle cell. White people get Cooley's anemia.

769
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,860
That's basically when the cell torques itself instead of laying more flat.

770
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,140
It bends in half like a potato chip.

771
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,660
But only white people that have a very distant relative

772
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,520
somewhere way back that was black, really.

773
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,300
Yeah. But there's Cooley cell sickle cell.

774
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,420
There's another one. Yeah.

775
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,840
But the Cooley cells is Sicilian.

776
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,160
That's why I know it.

777
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,840
But that's a Sicilian thing.

778
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,920
That's yeah, there's several.

779
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,600
The African. Because yeah, when you try it there.

780
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,420
Yeah. But still, when you when you try it, when you see it on that level

781
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,840
and that's what you're trying to do.

782
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,840
Yeah, that's how you can genetically engineer.

783
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,680
That's what. Yeah, that one.

784
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,520
In other words, listen to one.

785
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,700
Right. There's nothing.

786
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,960
There's no DNA splicing or anything like that.

787
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,240
They're just mimicking, you know, the trial and error to see what will cause

788
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,700
these things are already known,

789
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,720
you know, to be detrimental. Right.

790
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:46,260
So like lead poisoning, you know, a bullet is lead poisoning. Right.

791
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,840
I mean, essentially trauma also.

792
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,580
But, you know, what I would say is

793
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,380
just to go back to the ether, you cannot objectify it.

794
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,980
But if you understand it's a it has effects

795
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,460
in other words, William Reich

796
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,540
basically made the statement that it goes from low to high potential.

797
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:11,440
It's the opposite of the way we were taught potentials move.

798
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,100
So once you understand that, that's how the weather devices work.

799
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:21,120
The other thing is, I remember reading a report from the FBI.

800
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,660
He was heavily monitored, William Reich.

801
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:28,460
And one of the reports that they had a plant, a laboratory technician

802
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,560
FBI put in Robert in Wilhelm Reich's lab.

803
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:37,680
And I read one of the reports, FBI report on the what

804
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,800
the laboratory technician was reporting to the FBI.

805
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,620
And it says, well, we really even though I've been working there,

806
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:48,920
she said for several months, I still don't quite understand it.

807
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,440
I don't think Wilhelm Reich does, but he's the only one

808
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,760
that could really understand it more than the rest of us.

809
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:57,820
But what we do know is that the the Oregon experiments

810
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:02,840
and the ether experiments we do know for sure is that it's slow moving, slow acting.

811
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,940
It's very effective, very potent, but it's slow moving.

812
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,980
Right. So in other words, when you're looking to affect something using the ether,

813
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,700
it's not like hitting a switch on the wall and the lights come on.

814
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,320
It's it could take 20 minutes, two hours, 20 days.

815
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,560
It's very slow, but it does happen.

816
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:24,240
So they found it was about potential going from low to high. Right.

817
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,300
So that's what we do with the weather stuff.

818
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,100
And I'm still speaking to people that are interested in the weather.

819
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,700
And I coach them here and there.

820
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:37,040
You know, I'd like to see them come back and what they learned and coach,

821
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:37,920
you know, tell me.

822
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,700
But, you know, you cannot use basic stuff

823
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:47,760
that we consider to be science and physics to apply is a new discoveries.

824
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,960
And the point that I always make is just remember a low potential.

825
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,980
So how do you create a low potential with a reflective surface?

826
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:58,920
The ether, instead of moving, let's say, on a flow would be like

827
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,420
if you put a stick in the river, you don't slow down the whole river.

828
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,980
But when the water makes contact with the stick

829
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,980
and you get this turbulence around the stick, that water is now slower

830
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,080
and represents a lower potential, doesn't it?

831
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,080
And then when it leaves the turbulence around the stick

832
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:19,160
that you're holding in the water, it goes back to the high potential again.

833
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,660
You see? And that's how the ether works.

834
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:26,200
So you disturb it using metallic, non-organic reflective surfaces.

835
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,240
Let's say a tube with a mirror in it.

836
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,800
And when the ether is in there, it will bounce around momentarily.

837
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,820
And when it's released into the main flow, it'll reflect the low potential,

838
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
which will feed the high potential. Right.

839
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,140
So actually charging the ether when you do this, people are like that.

840
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,580
When you have a very charismatic individual on stage

841
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,840
and all these mainstream normies in the audience,

842
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,280
who's the high potential? The guy on stage speaking, right?

843
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,960
And then who's the low potential? The people in the crowd.

844
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,020
Now, you can't tell me that the low people in the crowd

845
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:04,020
are not feeding the high guy up on the stage.

846
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,480
I've seen it.

847
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:10,120
If you look at someone making a speech that's considered charismatic,

848
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:13,420
has the full attention of the crowd, which is the low potential,

849
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,520
when they get off that stage, they're fully charged.

850
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,820
I've done people who requested me to speak and I'm just some nothing.

851
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,500
And in front of 50 people after an hour and a half when I left,

852
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,400
I was like, hi.

853
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,860
And for an hour or two hours for me to come down off of that

854
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,020
because they were so happy. Right.

855
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,180
Yeah. Now, I've performed plenty of different ways in front of people on a stage

856
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,260
and the people that are out there that. Yeah, absolutely.

857
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,100
They absolutely will charge you up. Yeah, they charge me up.

858
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,840
You can't just finish your performance and go to sleep.

859
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,800
You'll be like wired for hours after. Right. Right.

860
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,840
It's exactly it's exactly what the ether is like.

861
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,740
But you got to keep reminding yourself that now

862
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,040
the man or matter author talked about in others,

863
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,420
but I think it originated with him, the light ether, the heat ether,

864
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,340
the chemical ether and the life ether.

865
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:06,740
He talked about it in that form when giving different shapes and colors to each one.

866
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,600
Guess which one is the heat ether?

867
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,200
Right. What color you would associate to that?

868
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,360
Right. Red. Right. Yeah.

869
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,380
And the light would be yellow.

870
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,920
Right. Yellow. The chemical ether, I think, is blue.

871
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:22,740
And the life ether was purple, like a violet violet.

872
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,500
Yeah. Like the purple robe. Right.

873
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,580
So these things are just symbolic in a way to organize it in your mind.

874
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,980
But again, I've been trying to objectify it.

875
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,520
But on other on the other side, there's also the electrical ether

876
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,880
than the chemical. OK, let's go back.

877
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,080
Light ether is pretty obvious because light doesn't travel.

878
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:43,840
There's no speed.

879
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
It just it just vibrates in the field longitudinally, instantly.

880
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,660
And depending what material is in the air,

881
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,220
it will change its ability to, you know, luminesce.

882
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,300
Light ether is pretty obvious.

883
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,880
The heat ether is pretty obvious that things are warming.

884
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,580
But and then the life ether is pretty obvious,

885
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,540
which I would say is biological vacuum.

886
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,540
When in order for something to be alive, it needs to sustain

887
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,540
a slight negative pressure to hold itself together and animate.

888
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,380
And the chemical ether is every old material, metals, mineral.

889
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,380
Water is all chemical ether.

890
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,240
Right. Everything that you find on the periodic table.

891
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,020
And that's the breakdown.

892
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:27,180
But then there's the electrical ether, which is between light and heat.

893
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,680
But if you go back to the heat ether, for example,

894
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,080
before you get into electrical, you notice that you have two types of heat.

895
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,220
You have descending, densifying heat in natural living objects.

896
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:44,480
Then you have rarefied rising heat when you do chemical decomposition. Right.

897
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,240
So in all living things, the heat goes down and the cold goes up.

898
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,740
All things that are decomposing.

899
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:51,780
The heat goes up.

900
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,240
And, you know, a young person asked me, what about a campfire?

901
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,320
The heat goes up. I said, OK, what's in the campfire?

902
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,680
Wood. Right. When the fire is going, are you building up the wood

903
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,920
or are you breaking down the wood?

904
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,020
You're breaking and decomposing it. Right.

905
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,160
Without its oxygenation, really. Right.

906
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:10,060
So can they get it right away? Just give me an example.

907
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,780
What do you want? And just right away, show them a real simple way to deduce it.

908
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:16,620
So when you talk about the heat ether from Ernst Lehrer

909
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:19,360
there in man or matter, he doesn't break it down like that.

910
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,660
So it can be broken down for, you know, there's two types of heat.

911
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:23,860
There's two types of light. Right.

912
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,480
The chemical ether, what you know, that's all ponderable material,

913
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,360
but there's also imponderable material.

914
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,680
And the life ether, you can pretty much

915
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:40,220
go across the like a rock has a life also. Right.

916
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,720
A piece of stone. Right. To a degree.

917
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:47,960
You know, they even in chemistry, the half life of uranium.

918
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,100
Right. Is lead right to a certain point.

919
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,840
Or is it one hundred thousand years or something? Whatever.

920
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,280
I don't trust anything that they say, especially with the carbon dating.

921
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,060
I mean, when I hear carbon dating,

922
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,000
I just relegate that as a dating site for senior citizens

923
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:06,940
or something, you know.

924
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,300
Right. Anyway, they should make a senior citizen dating cycle, carbon dating.

925
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,800
Anyway, that's a dumb joke.

926
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,720
But yeah, well, age, get it, you know. Anyway.

927
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,940
Yeah, like I'm going to pretty soon,

928
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,960
I'll be old enough that I'll go to an antique shop and they won't let me go.

929
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,900
Right. Anyway. Yeah.

930
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,320
They try to keep you. Then that's. Yeah, that's right. So anyway,

931
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,720
these things are not as simple.

932
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,960
They can be objectified. No, I don't think they can.

933
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,160
I think if you can objectify the ether, you will not be able to communicate it

934
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,160
for the sake of the ether, because now you're going to start

935
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,360
to take apart this place.

936
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,120
You can literally take apart this place.

937
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,600
That's what so you know, when you study nuclear energy, there's so many

938
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,720
what do you call detractors about it?

939
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,780
Oh, no, it's dangerous.

940
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:57,120
We're going to destroy ourselves. Right.

941
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,140
Walter Russell is big on a lot of people in Tesla.

942
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:04,180
Tesla make fun of the people thinking nuclear power was strong

943
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,600
because he says my capacitive discharge makes your nuclear reactions

944
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,620
look like an infant's consumptive breath.

945
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,380
And he's right about that.

946
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,100
He made fun of them, you know, but it is pretty dangerous

947
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,000
because it shorts out the ether.

948
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,660
Right. It's literally shorting. It's a short.

949
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,100
What I mean by short is just like when you short an electrical circuit.

950
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,780
It's a violent shorting.

951
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:27,240
So there's a big thing that's been put out there.

952
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:30,100
The elite, they always put stuff out there like, you know,

953
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,700
the flat earth, round earth thing. Right.

954
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
They they decide what the population because there's articles

955
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,140
written in mainstream about flat earth, round earth. Right.

956
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,280
So the elite decide what will go to the mainstream.

957
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,560
What will never be discussed in the mainstream.

958
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,120
They've also discussed nuclear in the mainstream. Right.

959
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,320
But will never be discussed as the financial system.

960
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,280
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.

961
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,880
That will never be discussed. Right.

962
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,340
Because it's all based on trust law and they don't want you understanding that.

963
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:00,800
But what will also never be discussed in the mainstream,

964
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,960
they'll discuss simulation, but then they will not.

965
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:07,900
They will not discuss shorting it out and how to make it go haywire.

966
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,740
And the way you do that is with nuclear reactions.

967
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,920
Now, what they are doing is they put out in the media,

968
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:15,360
especially a lot of alternative people.

969
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:16,560
There's no such thing as nuclear.

970
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,140
Those are just really big bombs.

971
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,020
You know, you've heard that right recently. Yes.

972
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,660
Well, here's people say, oh, it's not nuclear. They're lying.

973
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,680
There's no such thing.

974
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,180
Well, yeah, they are lying because you can't split an atom.

975
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,240
You can't split something that cannot be split

976
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,960
because it's just a gyroscopic movement of ether. Right.

977
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,980
The chemical ether can't splitting.

978
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,800
It doesn't mean any doesn't do anything.

979
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:39,160
These fusion and fission reactions are just complete bullshit,

980
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,020
like blood pressure and diabetes. Right.

981
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,720
No such thing. You have to believe in it or like the money system.

982
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,540
You have to believe in it in order to have value.

983
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,340
If you don't believe in it

984
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,180
and look at it through a knowledgeable perspective, there is nothing

985
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:55,720
really as atomic energy, but it is dangerous.

986
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,080
It is shorting out the ether.

987
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,140
You're hacking the physical reality

988
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,200
with a shortcut, with a short.

989
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:08,800
Basically, it's like throwing a wrench over a big, heavy transformer bus bar,

990
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,220
you know, where they make the main connections.

991
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:14,380
It's just going to blow. And it's the same thing.

992
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,800
If you've seen anyone blow a car battery with a wrench over it,

993
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:21,940
you pick up your wrench and whatever touch is vaporized, it's gone.

994
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:26,420
If you have a Geiger counter, when you do a big short like that,

995
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,700
you will see it peak just like nuclear.

996
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:31,840
But it's a different type of reaction, right?

997
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:34,920
Because when you short out an electrical circuit,

998
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,600
so in essence is nuclear electrical, yes, but not as simple

999
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:41,060
because when you short out something electrical,

1000
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:46,180
you're grounding this potential and work that's already in the circuit.

1001
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:49,320
You know, it's charged up either by you getting it off the grid

1002
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,340
or solar panel or a battery. Right.

1003
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,640
And then you short it. Right.

1004
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,700
With nuclear, it's producing the energy.

1005
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,540
It's discharging the energy and charging it

1006
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,060
and discharging it instantaneously all at once.

1007
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,460
Nuclear would be like you have a dead car battery.

1008
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,220
And you remember I gave the example of shorting the car battery.

1009
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:10,420
You see a big flash. Right.

1010
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,140
And your wrenches, half your wrenches melted and gone. Right. Right.

1011
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,180
OK, so nuclear would be analogous to that would be completely dead car battery.

1012
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,940
And in less than a thousandth of a second,

1013
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,380
the battery is fully charged and shorted out.

1014
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,900
That would be an analogy of nuclear.

1015
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,700
And everybody knows you can't charge a battery in a thousandth of a second.

1016
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,440
It'll explode. Right.

1017
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,840
And we're not saying exploding it when you're charging it.

1018
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,020
I'm saying you charge the battery completely full and fully shorted out

1019
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:44,180
is what a nuclear does, because it uses the elements that it does.

1020
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:48,040
Very large elements that are in a very lean state.

1021
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,760
And it's usually a very young reaction.

1022
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,480
So you have the exact polar opposites of energies of the universe acting on it.

1023
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,620
Yeah, it's basically messing up.

1024
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,240
Yeah, the simulation, the construct that we're in. Right.

1025
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:04,200
Nuclear is is a quick way to fuck it up.

1026
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,040
I mean, the entire reality. Yeah.

1027
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:11,220
So the detractors that went aired philosophically about bad,

1028
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,740
how bad nuclear is are. Yeah, they're there.

1029
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,940
I'm not wrong, but they they're not talking about what I'm talking about.
