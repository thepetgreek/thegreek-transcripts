1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
The Sonic entity known as S.H.O.N.I.C.K. is here to bring you the news.

2
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,120
over here and continue the conversation.

3
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,100
But yeah, that's a good thing to do over there.

4
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,360
And just want to get that piece of housekeeping

5
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,400
out of the way before we get to the main thing.

6
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,660
So, Greek, you want to talk to me

7
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,580
about a prototype you're working on?

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,300
There's so many things that were changed on it

9
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,980
that now I'm making a production on,

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,540
like I'm measuring the prototype and building one,

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,460
you know, I'm trying to make a blueprint

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,820
so I can build many of them like that, right?

13
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:02,460
And it's very critical because just when you think

14
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,360
what happens when you get used to things,

15
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,480
you allow changes, you give it loose tolerances,

16
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,400
and you drift.

17
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,940
So what I'm saying is I'm trying to do

18
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,620
a standardized version of something that's been prototyped.

19
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,100
And it's so critical because you catch yourself saying,

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,960
well, I know I want to copy this, right?

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,520
So how about, but this time, you know,

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,120
instead of this being in this position,

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,500
maybe we'll move it over a little bit over here.

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,460
Maybe it's a little better.

25
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,380
Ah, ah, ah, don't do that, don't do that

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,420
because now you're not making a copy of the prototype.

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,880
Now you're still prototyping, right?

28
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,500
You're still evolving the design.

29
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,600
Yeah, so it's not going to be a standardized version

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,440
of the prototype.

31
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,940
So it's really difficult to do that.

32
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,800
It's very, it's almost easier to have someone else do it

33
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,200
where you give them the prototype and say,

34
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,140
all you need is a caliper, you know, to measure.

35
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,280
And just build, just copy this, make a print.

36
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,240
So if someone wants to build it, you give them the print.

37
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,940
But it's so difficult because I keep catching myself

38
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,180
measuring and transferring measurements

39
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,300
because I'm doing it on paper and in real,

40
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,400
you know, on real material, right?

41
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,260
That's ready to be cut and formed.

42
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,460
And I'm like, oh man, you know, so what am I,

43
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,480
I spent two hours like, oh yeah, I'm going to go,

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,020
I'm going to make it look a little different.

45
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,260
Like, no, no, no, because if I make it look

46
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,780
a little different and it doesn't sound

47
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,400
like the prototype, I'm going to blame the prototype, right?

48
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,160
Because I didn't make an exact copy.

49
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,580
You see, this is very difficult to do.

50
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,620
What I'm trying to say is I have too much instilled bias

51
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,160
in me still that I can't just separate myself

52
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,980
from some things and say, well, what's the scope?

53
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,040
Just make a copy and do the copy.

54
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:45,620
I don't know.

55
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,160
It's very, I found it more difficult to make the copy

56
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,500
of the prototype, in other words, duplicate it.

57
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,900
And why I'm doing the duplication is because the prototype,

58
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,300
as I moved things around, I had to cut a new hole

59
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,260
and fill the old hole, so it's all patches.

60
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,940
Like, you ever see a piece of, or an old jeans

61
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,000
where there's more patches

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,660
than there are original jeans, right?

63
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,740
Or, you know, clothing like back,

64
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,980
it actually became fashionable.

65
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,820
We have so many patches and repairs on it

66
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,980
that there's more repair than there is of the original.

67
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,140
And that's what the prototype is.

68
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,740
And now I'm thinking, why is it so difficult

69
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,200
to just make a copy of it and stop just, you know,

70
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,060
trying to move things and thinking of making them better?

71
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,660
So what I'm trying to say is there's an instilled bias

72
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,300
that I feel like another person or another me

73
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,760
would go ahead and make these slight changes again, right?

74
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,560
And now you're not doing what you set out

75
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,420
to do yesterday, let's say, right?

76
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,640
So it's important.

77
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,040
But maybe you're working toward the proper prototype

78
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,680
because some part of you is telling you

79
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,000
this is not perfect yet.

80
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,860
Is that a possibility?

81
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,600
It's not perfect, but look, perfect is,

82
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,320
well, here's the thing.

83
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,860
They are very, very, very good.

84
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,560
As a matter of fact, I had someone

85
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,340
who is a trained pianist listen to these.

86
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,940
And he was like, are you kidding?

87
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,360
These little speakers here sound like that?

88
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,700
This is just YouTube with a laptop, no special processing.

89
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,040
No, no, it's got a Yima A07 max amp.

90
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,640
Get it on Amazon for 70 bucks.

91
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,560
Sounds like a class A amp and just a Lenovo laptop,

92
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,940
nothing special.

93
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,600
And he's like, I can't believe the sound

94
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,640
that's coming out of this.

95
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,120
I'm like, I know, it's credible, isn't it?

96
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,020
And it's got a standard sound card on it.

97
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,720
I mean, there's nothing enhanced about it.

98
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,200
No, there's nothing, there's nothing audio,

99
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,380
tweak, nothing at all.

100
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,340
So when you hook these up to something that is special,

101
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,240
which I have, they sound even better.

102
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,020
So, and it just behooves, like if you turn off the lights,

103
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,700
you don't know where the sound is coming from.

104
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,260
And it sounds, it doesn't quite have the weight

105
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,200
of a full piano.

106
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,400
It's very hard to do that, which I'm going to be doing

107
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,680
the next prototype to a small that does,

108
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,520
but it does have the full weight of a snare

109
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,360
as the full weight of chorus singers.

110
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,680
Anyway, very small and they sound just outstanding realism,

111
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,220
transient response.

112
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,000
Like when you're listening to Orange Colored Sky,

113
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,580
Nat King Cole is singing in the chorus of five people jumps,

114
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,020
you know, in at the chorus time,

115
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,040
it sounds like five people yelling in your ear, right?

116
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,460
And it's like, whoa, where'd that come from?

117
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,960
Right, so anyway, I'm trying to make a copy of this.

118
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,780
And why is it so freaking hard?

119
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,040
Because I've already invested myself emotionally

120
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,620
and all these other things in making the prototype.

121
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,760
So now I have to divest myself and act like a robot

122
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,420
because you could actually, there are computers now

123
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,120
with scanners that you could, they could scan something,

124
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,820
make a blueprint and actually send it over

125
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,040
to the 3D printer and make it exactly like what they scanned.

126
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,680
And that's what I'm set out to do, right?

127
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,860
But I can't do it.

128
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,800
It's so difficult.

129
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,400
It's really, really difficult to do.

130
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,940
And it's even more difficult

131
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,440
than actually making something from scratch.

132
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,020
Well, it's surprising the hell out of me.

133
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,760
Well, you're seeing it as a difficulty,

134
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,700
but I'm thinking to myself, it's just your natural urge

135
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,300
that you just have to improve it, you know?

136
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,840
Because I've so invested in it

137
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,760
and I'm thinking what I'm doing now is a carry over.

138
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,100
It's not, I have to cut it off.

139
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,020
It's kind of like, you know what this is like?

140
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,340
The young boy who gets hit by a car on his bicycle

141
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,840
and they bring him to the, he's in critical condition

142
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,900
in the emergency room.

143
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,040
And the ER trauma surgeon is his mother, right?

144
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,320
Should she operate or should she have it, right?

145
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,980
You see what I mean?

146
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,460
This is a common story, right?

147
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,340
They're better, yeah.

148
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,100
And it's almost always like, look,

149
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,960
you're better off handing that to somebody else

150
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,700
because they will dispassionately pay attention to things.

151
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,280
They won't get swayed by their emotion

152
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,360
and they'll just do the job.

153
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:40,820
That's right.

154
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,700
So that's what I'm going through right now.

155
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,720
And it's very, and you can, it's easy to, here's the thing.

156
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,880
A lot of the things that I've spoken of, I've gone through.

157
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,420
And this is a new thing because I, from what,

158
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,820
well, the sclerator is like that also,

159
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,660
but the sclerator is very, it's a different animal

160
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,060
because it's so simple.

161
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,260
But this is really hard to do, to actually make it.

162
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,660
The best analogy would be the surgeon mom

163
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,020
operating on her son.

164
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,760
It's really difficult to do.

165
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,360
So I had to bring that up.

166
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,200
But anyway, I just wanted to throw that in there

167
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,200
because I'm kind of wrecked mentally and emotionally

168
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,160
and because I'm trying to make a copy

169
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,420
and I can't find myself to just make a freaking copy.

170
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,240
So anyway.

171
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,520
Maybe it's good you're taking the breather to record this.

172
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,560
Because you get away from it for a minute.

173
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,100
Yeah, what I'm saying, it's just like

174
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,860
the woman operating on her son.

175
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,200
Maybe she shouldn't be doing it.

176
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:30,600
Right.

177
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,180
Oh, and look, what do they always tell you though?

178
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,400
Take a step back and think for a moment, you know?

179
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,020
No, no, no, because that's what I was doing.

180
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,280
Remember, thinking requires all the other functions

181
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,800
that we've spoken about on Greek speak stuff.

182
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,180
All right, let's go back to the question.

183
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,220
I just wanted to throw that in.

184
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,500
No, no problem at all.

185
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,820
Okay, so we got either a really ugly question in my mind

186
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,180
or we got the question that I know we've covered before.

187
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,160
That's fine, either one.

188
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,420
Okay, well, we'll bring out the one

189
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,240
that we've covered before.

190
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,200
They were asking about inspiration.

191
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,420
What inspires somebody to do something?

192
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,100
And where does that come from

193
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,400
and how does that tie to this thing

194
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,720
they call your will, right?

195
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,260
You know, like how are you inspired to do things

196
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,200
that are not necessarily immediately adjacent

197
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,340
to what it is you're doing?

198
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,360
Because I passed the question.

199
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,600
It's beyond, that's beyond it.

200
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,080
That's like what they usually call first principle stuff.

201
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,340
Where do ideas come from?

202
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,240
That's trying to objectify the ether.

203
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,299
We're trying to objectify something

204
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,620
that is in the substrate of this reality.

205
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,140
Once you do that, by the way,

206
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,860
that has been done with what's called nuclear technology.

207
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,360
It has nothing to do with splitting atoms.

208
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,460
It's shorting out the ether, shorting out the substrate.

209
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,240
Like just like the old,

210
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,740
I don't know if you remember the TV screens,

211
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,180
they had these metal grids in them,

212
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,200
the ones that they made early computers with

213
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,780
because they thought the little metal grid

214
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,020
would help with the radiations.

215
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,340
If you short out that grid

216
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,240
or let's say you short out the board

217
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,360
that carries the pixels,

218
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,760
you short out all the other pixels.

219
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,800
That's what nuclear is.

220
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,620
So to find out where it comes from and all that

221
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,920
is gonna be shorting out, not the purpose of being,

222
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,000
because there is no purpose here.

223
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,960
It's just passing time.

224
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,000
Well, according to you,

225
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,420
the purpose here is to waste other people's time.

226
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,960
Well, I'll tell you why.

227
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,760
Because if you, well, here's the thing.

228
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,580
Everyone's wasting each other's time and things do also.

229
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,880
And that doesn't have to be people that waste your time.

230
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,520
What I mean by that is, you know,

231
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,180
the reincarnation cycle,

232
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,140
you know, everyone's got their own soul trap

233
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,960
or it gets worse or it gets better or it's non-linear.

234
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,220
Like if you die, you know,

235
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,200
I'm one of the few people that said this.

236
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,000
If there is reincarnation,

237
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,200
you could actually die now

238
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,840
and be reincarnated in ancient Rome.

239
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,500
It's not linear.

240
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,800
You're not always reincarnated in the future, right?

241
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,020
Well, and I've always tried to say

242
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,360
that the other side of that

243
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,620
is you could already be reincarnated right now

244
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,720
as a five-year-old somewhere

245
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,160
and you don't know it just yet.

246
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,960
Well, part of it is, yeah,

247
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,780
and there's certain cultures

248
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,820
that don't consider you being a spirit.

249
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,460
We know that you don't have the spirit

250
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,900
you're supposed to have until you're 12.

251
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,960
But here's the thing.

252
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,100
If the reincarnation cycle does go a certain way,

253
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,960
we are in an afterlife right now

254
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,880
because right, you were alive before.

255
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,440
Now you're in a different reincarnation

256
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,040
and you're in a different incarnation.

257
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,180
So that means you're actually in an afterlife right now.

258
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,640
So that kind of kills the whole afterlife thing too.

259
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,140
But it goes either way.

260
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,140
So these are like primary things

261
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,120
that we're not supposed to get an answer to right now

262
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,660
because we're, it doesn't,

263
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,980
I shouldn't say help us right now

264
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,640
because how do you help someone waste your time, right?

265
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,420
Because whatever you do to help someone waste someone's time

266
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,600
is gonna be another waste of time.

267
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,900
It's not really helping the waste of time directly.

268
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,800
Right, and that's the other counter question

269
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,700
I've always got for people on stuff like this

270
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,920
where it's like, what good will this do you?

271
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,660
Let's just imagine for a moment

272
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,820
that I have the absolute answer.

273
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,220
What good is that gonna do you?

274
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,160
Is it going to help you in some way to know

275
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,700
if I know exactly where?

276
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,920
No, no, no, it does.

277
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,700
No, it does.

278
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,320
It does, okay.

279
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,020
Yeah, of course, of course it does.

280
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,420
Okay.

281
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,240
All that stuff does,

282
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,360
but then you won't be wasting time anymore

283
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,420
and you don't have to be here.

284
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:06,800
Ah.

285
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,120
Right, there's certain things

286
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,000
that if you really knew the truth,

287
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,660
you would just go poof and you disappear.

288
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,500
Have you ever, there was something Rick and Morty,

289
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,460
the Meseeks, right?

290
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,380
Oh yeah, right.

291
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,780
The Meseeks.

292
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,180
People think it's ridiculously stupid,

293
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,400
but I kind of enjoy it.

294
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,540
The Meseeks, yeah, I need something to do,

295
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,700
you know, and right, I'll get it done.

296
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,940
Don't give me something I can't be done.

297
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,100
You know, it's like a day is an eternity for a Meseeks,

298
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,400
right?

299
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:27,720
Right.

300
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,280
So it's like we're Meseeks, yeah.

301
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,880
Now, once you find out certain primary things,

302
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,640
the formative things like that,

303
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,920
you just disappear, just like a delete, you know, right?

304
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,040
But then what happens?

305
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,120
Then what happens?

306
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,540
Is it another, you see?

307
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,320
So all these things tie in together,

308
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,840
but I know that inspiration comes first,

309
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,580
then ideas, then thought, right?

310
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,620
And then the rest is, you know, physical, right?

311
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,300
Then you take action or you don't, right?

312
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,280
Yeah, right.

313
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,760
So the thing is there,

314
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,780
I've pondered these things

315
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,300
and there's two answers I could give.

316
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,600
It's not time to know yet personally for me,

317
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,420
or maybe someone else does

318
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,880
and they poofed out of here, right?

319
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,140
And, but what I do know for sure

320
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,560
is we're here to waste time

321
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,340
and waste other people's time

322
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,260
and have other people waste your time.

323
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,320
It's all a waste of time.

324
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,580
It's sort of like being at a threshold.

325
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,640
You're neither inside nor you're outside, right?

326
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,520
Standing at the threshold.

327
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,880
Are you in the house or out of the house?

328
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,960
It's a very, very strange thing.

329
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,300
And boy, I hope the rest of the reality is not like this.

330
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,720
So, yeah.

331
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,760
But I can't invest any more into thinking about that

332
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,800
because I've benefited so much from inspiration.

333
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,520
I'll just, some people call them downloads or ideas,

334
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,200
whatever, you know,

335
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,000
but the inspiration is the core thing.

336
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,600
You know, the inspiration is pure emo.

337
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,440
Like if you get inspiration to do something,

338
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,800
when you have enough formulated to do that thing,

339
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,940
it's no longer inspiration.

340
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,720
It's an idea and a thought now, right?

341
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,820
So the inspiration is a flicker.

342
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,760
It's so undefinable.

343
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,640
And yeah, it's from that primary.

344
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,420
It's like the ether.

345
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,820
It's like, yeah,

346
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,080
something that if you start understanding that

347
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,860
and can dabble with that source,

348
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,500
you're out of here.

349
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,040
You're done.

350
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,820
You're a big threat, you know?

351
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,160
Right.

352
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,400
I mean, the only thing I can think of

353
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,620
is that it must be a very natural process

354
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,660
because anything that is natural like that

355
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,260
does evolve and grow, right?

356
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,600
I don't think anything is natural.

357
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,520
But you don't think anything is natural?

358
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:26,940
Okay.

359
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,680
No, because if there's a creator,

360
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,400
he's an artificer and everything's artificial.

361
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:33,780
Really?

362
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,440
If there's a creator, he's an artificer.

363
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,040
Yeah, there's no such,

364
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,360
nature is a machine, there's archetypes.

365
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,220
Yeah, nothing is, okay, natural,

366
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,100
okay, when you say natural,

367
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,920
it's attributed to not man-made, usually.

368
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,040
It's like when you say anarchy,

369
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,780
that attributes to, oh,

370
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,140
there's gonna be a big mess and chaos, right?

371
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,500
No, actually, it doesn't mean that at all.

372
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,540
No, it just means I'm without a leader, but.

373
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:56,860
Yeah, you're right.

374
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,960
And it's castle doctrine, each man, right?

375
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,960
So when you say natural,

376
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,240
I think of, you know, there's random,

377
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,340
there's a time,

378
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,760
there's things that have been put in order.

379
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,120
Yes, those things exist, you know,

380
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,900
things are put in order

381
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,060
that keep cycling and processing,

382
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,940
but if there's a creator behind it,

383
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,760
he's an artificer, an artist,

384
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,200
and everything is artificial, right,

385
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,360
of his creation or her creation, their creation.

386
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,080
Even when some.

387
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,060
It's never a single person,

388
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,100
or a single entity.

389
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,880
Right, but even when there is a creator,

390
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,100
there are other things that occur along with the creation

391
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,780
that are not necessarily part of the creator's plan, right,

392
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,520
but just sort of occur, right?

393
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,640
If he's bound or she,

394
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,280
if the creator's bound to that as an environmental,

395
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,880
quote, unquote, steady state,

396
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,780
then that would be the real nature,

397
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,100
and that platonic philosophy discussed that, right?

398
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:47,780
Okay.

399
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,980
Platonists discussed that.

400
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,580
Okay, well, I'm just thinking to myself,

401
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,760
look, you know, the creator could create all the vegetables,

402
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,500
but not necessarily create every vegetable ever grown.

403
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,400
You know what I'm saying?

404
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,380
The order of things is put into place.

405
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,420
Because we're too confined to understand, you see?

406
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:02,820
Okay.

407
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,220
It's too confined of a, yeah.

408
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,400
There are things that pop in and out of this reality,

409
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,060
you know, that you could,

410
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,880
has anyone found a fossil or a really old giraffe skeleton?

411
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,060
Never.

412
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,400
Those are like, those things appeared recently, right?

413
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,720
Giraffes, you know what?

414
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,280
I cannot think of an old giraffe.

415
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,500
There are certain things that just did not exist

416
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,400
a short while ago that just keep popping in and out.

417
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,700
Yeah, so anyway, all right, what I can't,

418
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,560
that's something like the book of Daniel.

419
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,540
It's so weird to wrap your mind around it, you know?

420
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,420
You ever read the book of Daniel?

421
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,420
Like everyone says these things happen here,

422
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,500
and then you read it, and it's like,

423
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,740
no, it's not gonna happen that way.

424
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,220
But then if you try to find an explanation,

425
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,240
you're like, wait a second, this thing is so convoluted,

426
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,680
it takes you right back to where you started.

427
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,780
And you're like, oh boy,

428
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,780
maybe I'll just put this down till the time is right.

429
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,380
Inspiration, if you have it, and you do,

430
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,860
if you're a doer, like Greek speak

431
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,180
is for people that are doers, right?

432
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,280
And let me just put it this way.

433
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,420
If you're a keyboard, whatever, you're not a doer.

434
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,220
But I know some keyboard people that code

435
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,100
and work with all this other stuff,

436
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,920
and they build stuff, they make stuff,

437
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,640
they, you know, whatever.

438
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,960
Yeah, okay, good, but Greek speak is people

439
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,380
who do things, make things, right?

440
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,200
And I mean that in a simple sense, right?

441
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,700
Like third grade craft class.

442
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,440
You know, when you take craft in third grade,

443
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,120
they give you glue and popsicle sticks.

444
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,080
That kind of doing, like start from there, right?

445
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,880
You work with your hands and your mind,

446
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,620
and you build stuff, and people rely on you

447
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,640
for your expertise in doing things, right?

448
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,580
Fixing things, making things, helping out with things.

449
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,360
See, in the context of inspiration though, right?

450
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,540
If we are created by the creator

451
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,920
and then we create something,

452
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,360
is that not a secondary creation of the creator, right?

453
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,940
So, you know, like when people say,

454
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,900
oh, that was, you know, inspired, you know,

455
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,940
the old, that was inspired by God.

456
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,700
Well, isn't everything in a way, right?

457
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,800
Because if you created it and you were a creation,

458
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,579
doesn't it follow that?

459
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,880
Well, there's also cosmic censorship the other way,

460
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,079
where you, the inspirations are held back.

461
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:10,740
Right.

462
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,819
Right, it goes both ways.

463
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,160
I mean, it's very frustrating when you try to think

464
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,900
about these core principles.

465
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,420
You just have to go along with it.

466
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,859
It becomes difficult because, you know,

467
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,260
the absence of evidence, right?

468
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,540
Doesn't necessarily mean the thing doesn't exist.

469
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,700
You just haven't found it yet.

470
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,480
No, well, you try to define,

471
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,800
well, here's the thing, like the ether

472
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,200
is one of these primary things

473
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,360
because you cannot objectify it

474
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,240
because you're made of it.

475
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,940
Like the image on TV, if it was sentient,

476
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,160
it doesn't really know that it's made up of pixels

477
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,780
because once it starts getting into that,

478
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,960
then it could really screw up the scene, right?

479
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,940
So, well, there's an old cartoon,

480
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,860
which I really enjoyed where the cartoon characters

481
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,680
show them on the board.

482
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,560
He grabs an eraser and it's in reality, right?

483
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,260
And he starts erasing parts of the things

484
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,440
in the cartoon, right?

485
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:56,900
Oh yeah, I remember that.

486
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,420
We're kind of stuck.

487
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,200
It was like a Looney Tunes thing.

488
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,480
He turns around and starts erasing the other character

489
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,200
and knocks him down and just-

490
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,560
Yeah, and it's a realism.

491
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,220
It's an eraser.

492
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,780
They kind of use special effects.

493
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,520
It's a real pencil that he reaches out

494
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,480
and grabs kind of like Roger Rabbit, right?

495
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,720
Yeah, well, sort of like-

496
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,840
They mix the cartoon with the, yeah.

497
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,120
With the physical world, right.

498
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,240
And the photographic with the animated.

499
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,580
Yeah, but before the computer though, way before that,

500
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,580
which is interesting.

501
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,540
Well, yeah, when you watch stuff before this,

502
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,200
especially before the 60s,

503
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,920
and I tell people when they're watching a movie,

504
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,080
all this was done without CGI.

505
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,860
All this was painted by hand.

506
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,000
All this was made by hand, right?

507
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,700
Yeah, and then they came up with different ways

508
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,800
to photograph stuff.

509
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,760
If we cut this down and we use the light a certain way

510
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,160
or this simple idea of smudging Vaseline on a lens,

511
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,920
you know, whatever.

512
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,980
They came up with practical ways.

513
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,900
There's always a lot of fakery in the beginning.

514
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,060
If you go back to when there was medium format,

515
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,840
large format, film negative in the 19th century,

516
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,700
in the early 1800s, mid 1800s, early 1900s,

517
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,160
most of the photographs,

518
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,460
even though they're originals, they've been faked.

519
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,760
In other words, someone sat there with a razor knife,

520
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,240
started cutting negatives,

521
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,240
because they weren't small negatives.

522
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,660
Medium format's large, right?

523
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,700
Large format negatives.

524
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,120
You know, like the old cameras,

525
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,220
boom, the flashbulb goes.

526
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,300
Then you see that box camera.

527
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,240
Well, the negative's that big, right?

528
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:19,960
It's pretty large.

529
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,720
So it was very easy to manipulate.

530
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,900
You see a lot of these old photographs on there.

531
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,700
Like, wait a second.

532
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,580
Look at this city in the background.

533
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,620
It's kind of like the pictures they show you

534
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,980
of NASA when they were on the moon, the Apollo.

535
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,200
You could see, like, they're on this gray sand,

536
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,380
and in the background, you could see

537
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,480
it's all been cut in and put in later, right?

538
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,460
If you have a knack for how photography works.

539
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,960
But yeah, a lot of the early photographs that you see,

540
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,960
the historical reference ones, are fake.

541
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,840
So in other words, they've been doctored.

542
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,040
You know, someone sat there.

543
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,340
They're very meticulously done.

544
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,280
But yeah, it's very rare to find an actual photograph,

545
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,860
an old, old photograph that's in, you know,

546
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,660
considered part of the historical record.

547
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,840
Most of them have been faked.

548
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,520
It's interesting.

549
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,700
And that was the beginning of photography.

550
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,860
And so right now, we're in the beginning

551
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,780
of all this other technology.

552
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,260
And guess what?

553
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,640
You got deep fake, blah, blah, blah, AI fakes this,

554
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,760
they fake that, because it's a newer technology

555
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,420
for the public.

556
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,380
It seems like when a newer technology comes out,

557
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,720
there's a lot of fakery.

558
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,960
Like, you know, in China, when cell phones

559
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,620
started becoming popular in the late 90s and early 2000s,

560
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,380
they sold a billion fake vanity phones, cell phones.

561
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,460
Still, I think in the early 2000s,

562
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,020
you could find them in the dollar store.

563
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,140
It just looked like a cell phone, right,

564
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,220
with the antenna sticking out.

565
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,060
It was a vanity phone.

566
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,300
So if you couldn't afford one,

567
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,980
you just looked like you had one, right?

568
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,480
So just fakery on many, many levels.

569
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,520
But anyway, what's the other question?

570
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:50,760
Yeah, well, the other question was about what entity drives.

571
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,340
They started out with this by saying,

572
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,360
that seems like the Greek is a cat person

573
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,420
and you're a dog person.

574
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,000
That's what they said to me.

575
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,580
I said, yeah, that's true.

576
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,500
But the thing that they asked about is animal cruelty.

577
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,160
Is there a particular part of what's going on

578
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,780
with animal cruelty currently?

579
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,200
Is there something to that?

580
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,160
Is there an entity in charge of it?

581
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,860
They had a bunch of questions like that.

582
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,240
And I'm going, well, yeah.

583
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,960
And then they talked about how they felt

584
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,060
as though this is a lower,

585
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,960
this is definitely like a lower spiritual level.

586
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,920
Like this is even worse than people who are cruel to people.

587
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,420
And they wanted me to ask you about it.

588
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:29,840
So go ahead.

589
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,540
It's more helpless.

590
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,920
Well, the thing is, it's never a single thing.

591
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,720
And also the lower the entities are,

592
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,860
the more identity stricken they are,

593
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,440
the more they identify with a specific name,

594
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,540
the more they identify with a specific grimoire or whatever.

595
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,380
But by the way, all these sigils

596
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,980
and ways that you summon an entity and all that,

597
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,440
they don't need any of that.

598
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,020
They like to make humans believe that they need that, right?

599
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,240
They're always watching.

600
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,240
And the ones that do get the specific grimoires

601
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,140
and names and the way to direct, then they appear

602
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,340
because that's like a pact they have on their side.

603
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,200
But the people have to be, okay,

604
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,040
the people that do that kind of animal cruelty

605
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,540
usually have to be brought to that situation, right?

606
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,860
You know, like if you hear,

607
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,640
even though it's in popular culture,

608
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,660
a lot of these serial killers,

609
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,500
oh yeah, he killed the family dog.

610
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,640
And even before that, when he was young,

611
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,140
he was spending most of his time outside

612
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,240
in the day burning ants with a magnifying glass.

613
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,480
You know how they build that up, right?

614
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,500
Yeah, that kind of thing.

615
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:28,960
You've heard that.

616
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,740
Yeah, yeah.

617
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,580
So that kind of stuff is true to an extent,

618
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,560
but most of it is from that military system.

619
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,840
Because the school system from a young age

620
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,820
is military based.

621
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,900
You know, it's that Prussian kind of like,

622
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,580
you know, you're gonna be a worker or a soldier,

623
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,820
you know, kind of thing, right?

624
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,860
And there's a lot of cruelty.

625
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,660
Cruelty is allowed in school, you know,

626
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,700
because they expect you, you know,

627
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,820
to be also have that potential as you get older,

628
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,620
because it could be used by the state, right?

629
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,440
But there's a lot of sick stuff going on.

630
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,400
And it's hard to tell who is and who isn't,

631
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,200
but there are entities behind everything.

632
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,020
And it's never one.

633
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,540
Right.

634
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,620
Even for example, when you read scripture,

635
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,360
let's say you say Yahweh.

636
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,500
Well, he's part of a group.

637
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,220
It's very clear.

638
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,520
It's very clear.

639
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,900
It's an entire group.

640
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,620
And there are others that come down.

641
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,020
Let's say if you read scripture,

642
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,740
now we're not talking about the veracity of the scripture.

643
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,540
We're talking about what scripture actually says.

644
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:28,940
Right.

645
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,460
Right, you know?

646
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,700
So veracity in terms of is it,

647
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,100
should it be viewed as really came from God?

648
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,900
Or is it who wrote it?

649
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,520
None of that stuff.

650
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,000
That's going on with archaics right now.

651
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,320
I just don't watch it because very often

652
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,480
when you see that kind of stuff,

653
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,040
they don't even know what's in the scripture.

654
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,900
And then they talk about it in another way.

655
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,640
But if you just read the scripture,

656
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,060
there's cases where he says,

657
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,100
I'm going to send someone that's just like me, right?

658
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,900
Down into your camp, for example, in Exodus, right?

659
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,260
And the only difference between him and me

660
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,200
is he's not forgiving, right?

661
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,680
So don't, you know, whatever.

662
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,680
So you have these dupes,

663
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:13,540
these doppelganger spirits that occur.

664
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,320
That's very prevalent.

665
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,020
So to say that there's one, there isn't.

666
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,860
There could be an animal cruelty spirit for,

667
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,460
you know, let's say for the 5 billion

668
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,780
or actually 2 billion people,

669
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,180
let's say that they're on the earth, right?

670
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,880
There could be that many and they're just waiting there.

671
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,620
But I would say that we have enough.

672
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,860
If you take control of your thoughts

673
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,740
and you get the little voice in your head,

674
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,100
I've been doing another level of practice with that.

675
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,120
The voice in your head, I let it drift

676
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,620
and I acknowledge it and I'm like,

677
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,900
what the hell are you talking about?

678
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,980
And it stops, right?

679
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,540
And then it goes away for a while

680
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,220
and then you forget and it comes back, right?

681
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,880
So you always have to be in control of that.

682
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,240
And when you can control that voice in your head,

683
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,100
or just let, you know, you're going to hear it.

684
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,960
But when you acknowledge that it's, you know, a voice,

685
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,220
unknown like inspiration, where's it coming from, right?

686
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,580
When you acknowledge these things,

687
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,480
it becomes much more clear

688
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,520
what an influence is about to come on you.

689
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,340
Like most people think like, I've heard someone say,

690
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,120
oh yeah, most people are possessed, demonically possessed.

691
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,080
And the other person agrees.

692
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,520
I'm like, no, I wouldn't say that.

693
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,400
Because there's different levels of it.

694
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,140
Like there's the influence,

695
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,220
most people I would say are influenced.

696
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,980
And then you have the next level is oppression,

697
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,140
whether oppressed, you know,

698
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,020
where their health goes down and always whatever.

699
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,740
And then you have possession.

700
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,940
Possession is actually very, very rare.

701
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,920
That would be like in what they did to a little poor girl

702
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,200
in the movie, The Exorcist, that would be possession.

703
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,360
If you ask who you are,

704
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,800
I wouldn't say a little girl's name at all, right?

705
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,920
So the influence of people to be cruel to animals

706
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,440
is they're very broad, very broad.

707
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,740
And what I mean by that is like,

708
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,040
well, I don't know anyone who's cruel to animals.

709
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,040
Yeah, but you know, when you hear of a,

710
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,940
there's another 800 dogs were brought to the animal shelter

711
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,740
and they're gonna start euthanizing them, whatever.

712
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,220
Well, how do you, oh, that's just a news article to you,

713
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:08,540
isn't it?

714
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,340
Do you really feel what's happening there?

715
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,720
Are you gonna make a campaign to go save some dogs?

716
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,140
No, right?

717
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,120
Because you're influenced that that's okay, right?

718
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,120
To accept it, right?

719
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,080
And then there's, of course, the people that work there.

720
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,280
And one criticism I have on that is,

721
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,400
and I've spoken to people throughout,

722
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,020
actually since the 80s about this,

723
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,380
animal testing in the pharmaceutical industry.

724
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,600
It's completely unnecessary.

725
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,840
They have these cruel motherfuckers

726
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,300
that enjoy putting strong acid in animals' eyes.

727
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,460
You know that it's gonna,

728
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:43,400
look, if you drop that acid on the table

729
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,900
that has a paper on it, the paper will dissolve.

730
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,740
Why are you putting it in the rabbit's eyes, right?

731
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,060
Because they get a thrill from that.

732
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,120
They're sick fucks, you know,

733
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,780
people who do medical research, majority of them.

734
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,020
And I'm not saying this,

735
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,600
I'm saying this from people that did it in the inside.

736
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,460
I couldn't take it.

737
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,220
They're like, oh, what do you do?

738
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,940
I did medical research.

739
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,900
Not anymore, I don't do it anymore.

740
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,580
I said, what happened?

741
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,840
Oh, I was there three months.

742
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,740
These people are sick.

743
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,080
And I'm like, okay.

744
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,620
And then like a few years later,

745
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,180
I run into someone else.

746
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:07,980
Oh, I did medical research.

747
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,920
I couldn't do it anymore

748
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,040
because these people are crazy.

749
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,080
I'm like, so I'm starting to hear,

750
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,280
you know, the people, you know,

751
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,360
that used to work in that.

752
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,920
And I'm like, this is really fucked up.

753
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,240
Yeah, it is, big time.

754
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,380
See, so it's done on a professional level also.

755
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,400
Well, it seems like almost every profession

756
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,460
has a level where, you know what,

757
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,840
you can be on the outside,

758
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,080
but once they start bringing you

759
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,740
into how things actually work,

760
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,900
you learn that, you know,

761
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,340
the morality is shot.

762
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:35,840
I mean.

763
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:36,720
Yeah, it is.

764
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,180
Every field is like that, yeah.

765
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,380
Look at sports.

766
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,680
You can go as far as sports.

767
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,320
All the, you know, all the games are fixed, right?

768
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,780
All the major games, every sport.

769
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,480
Pretty much.

770
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,040
They're all fixed, pretty much, yeah.

771
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,120
And so, for example,

772
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,720
when you watch a baseball game

773
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,180
and you see the ball, you know,

774
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,020
a fly ball or it goes to left field

775
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,320
or right field or down the middle,

776
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,100
those guys are professional baseball players, right?

777
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,780
Yes, they are.

778
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,220
Well, they could hit that ball

779
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,520
exactly within a few yards

780
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,040
of where you want it every time.

781
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,500
Why are they hitting it here and there

782
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,780
and the game is proceeding, right?

783
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,840
How many of them retired from the sport?

784
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,280
1,000, maybe, right?

785
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,080
Since one of these,

786
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,200
let's say past 100 some odd years

787
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:14,960
of playing baseball,

788
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,100
how many have come forward and said this game,

789
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,020
all the games are fixed

790
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,540
or most of the major games are fixed,

791
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:19,880
you say?

792
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,380
None.

793
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,920
I've not seen any, yeah.

794
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,140
Pete Rose, they busted him for betting.

795
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,140
That's about it, right?

796
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,680
Judges, how many?

797
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,420
Actually, there have been a few federal judges

798
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:29,960
that have come forward

799
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,800
and said the whole system's fucked, right?

800
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,160
There have been maybe very few attorneys,

801
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,660
there's a bunch of doctors

802
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,560
that have come out and said

803
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,880
this whole system is screwed up,

804
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,300
but not enough when you take in consideration.

805
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,820
The same thing goes for the animal cruelty

806
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,340
and the human cruelty and whatever, you know?

807
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,340
Yeah, it's pretty, it's a pretty,

808
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,780
yeah, it's not good.

809
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,800
No, I've always found it extremely disturbing.

810
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,220
It's just, you know,

811
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,760
this weird principle that I got very young in life,

812
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,200
I think is a true and fine principle,

813
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,720
which is you don't prey upon anything

814
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,660
that's weaker than you.

815
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,660
You know, this is not something you're supposed to do.

816
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,540
That's the US military's thing.

817
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,540
They'll never fight anyone

818
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,460
that's as strong as they are stronger.

819
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,080
They only prey on civilian populations.

820
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,720
Do I sound like I'm anti-military?

821
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,920
No, but anyway.

822
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,320
Well, I'm saying the opposite thing.

823
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,380
I'm saying exactly the opposite thing,

824
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,780
which is that, you know, as an individual,

825
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:30,360
I don't want any part of preying upon

826
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,020
something that is weaker than me, you know?

827
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,100
It's just that-

828
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,200
Well, I mean, it happens on many levels.

829
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,620
It'll be with people, societies, animals, insects.

830
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,220
For example, okay, insects.

831
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,440
Okay, wasps, so let's just be specific.

832
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,380
Wasps are very psychic.

833
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,100
Like, there could be, bees are also.

834
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,220
If you go there with the intent of like,

835
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,400
you know, you're fine with them, just don't bite me.

836
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,120
They're okay, cool, right?

837
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,240
Kind of like dogs, you know?

838
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,760
Someone who's afraid of dogs.

839
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,560
Yeah, I've given the analogy many times, right?

840
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,160
Someone's a dog lover and someone's afraid of dogs.

841
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,440
Walk up to a dog they've never seen before,

842
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,460
the dog suddenly gets barking

843
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,080
at the person who's afraid of dogs, right?

844
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,500
In their mind, they pick up on that.

845
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,540
Well, with wasps, Linda said,

846
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,900
well, you know, there's some wasps for that.

847
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,580
Somebody asked, fine.

848
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,000
Well, I went into the shed and it's ventilated.

849
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,860
And I said, ooh, that's one hell of a wasp's nest.

850
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,340
It's a big one.

851
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,320
I let them go.

852
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,820
And I'm like, okay, guys, I think you're,

853
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,940
to the point where you smell the muskiness,

854
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,700
because if you have a lot of insects in the area,

855
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,240
they give off a smell like a pheromone.

856
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,320
It's very strong, actually.

857
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,380
You kind of smell that

858
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,220
when you go to a roach-infested apartment.

859
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,940
You can tell the roach is in there, right?

860
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:41,860
Oh, yeah, yeah.

861
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,500
Typical smell, it's like a metallic kind of wet smell.

862
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,880
But so I go up in the shed.

863
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,460
I'm like, oh, it's really musky in here.

864
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,600
Oh, wow, look at that wasp's nest, right?

865
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,000
It's a lot of wasps in there.

866
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,300
And I'm like, listen, guys,

867
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,840
you're kind of like over when you're welcome.

868
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,440
I could usually burn you out of here.

869
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,160
It would be actually quite a technical thing to stop them,

870
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,000
but I don't wanna do that.

871
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,200
So go ahead and make your wasps,

872
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,780
go out into the desert and have fun,

873
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,780
and deal with it that way.

874
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,640
Because I personally have an affinity

875
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,560
for certain bugs that are psychic like that, right?

876
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,140
You know about the little,

877
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,220
the young girl always happens,

878
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,680
she's walking around like there's butterflies

879
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,260
and they land on the one particular person, right?

880
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,260
And they don't land on everyone.

881
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,620
Now, animals like insects, but they're not insect spiders,

882
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,340
they have no psychic quality about them at all.

883
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,860
They are like psychically invisible.

884
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,660
In other words, you could be somewhere

885
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,340
and you have no sense that there's a spider around.

886
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,820
And even if it's crawling on you,

887
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,460
they don't give off any kind of a psychic vibe,

888
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:49,020
which makes them a very pretty good predator, right?

889
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:49,620
Right.

890
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,160
In that reality.

891
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,280
So there's that reality of it,

892
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,840
what kind of connection people have.

893
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,000
The people that I've even depicted in film,

894
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,720
let's just say that they're cruel to animals, right?

895
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,620
They get a high off of that, they get a thrill.

896
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,680
It's a very short thrill,

897
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,180
kind of like smoking crack, right?

898
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:07,640
Right.

899
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,780
And they keep doing it until, you know,

900
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,380
what was really heinous in the beginning isn't so bad now,

901
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,900
and they go to bigger and bigger things.

902
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,360
Ultimately, the people, you know.

903
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,060
And the U.S. military is an analogy of that, by the way.

904
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,900
So, because it's designed,

905
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,120
the U.S. military is designed to be a world, a police force.

906
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,420
And it's been dubbed that for many years now,

907
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,440
since the Vietnam War.

908
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,100
Yeah, they did talk about that,

909
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,200
the global police force or whatever they were calling it.

910
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,920
And what they do is they always go after the weak

911
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:45,020
or they never confront something like head on,

912
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,080
like you would see in a dualistic sense,

913
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,140
you know, like bad guy versus good guy,

914
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,600
or this guy, you know, black and white, orange and green.

915
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,580
It's always, let's prey on the weak.

916
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:01,280
So that seems to be a shitty thing about humans,

917
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,100
and they put up with it.

918
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,740
But, you know, we'll see how much time is left

919
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,300
to put up with that kind of stuff.

920
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,040
Right.

921
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,480
So ultimately, what are you gonna do

922
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,620
about this prototype issue that you started out

923
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,840
talking about at the beginning?

924
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,140
Oh, it's very, I'm actually challenging myself

925
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,140
to discipline and go ahead and measure off

926
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,860
what I wanna build and just ignore

927
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,580
how I would wanna move this over a quarter of an inch.

928
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,480
Right, and just go ahead and build it

929
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,640
and see if it could be replicated.

930
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,460
That's the purpose, because it's worth replicating.

931
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,000
I mean, to quite a degree.

932
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:32,580
So.
