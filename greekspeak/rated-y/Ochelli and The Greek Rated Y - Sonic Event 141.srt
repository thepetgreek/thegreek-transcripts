1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,070
Just do it cold. Let's get started unless you got any news. Well, I have a bunch of talk about it later

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,570
Okay, you have a bunch of questions. You want to just put those aside or you want me to just throw them at you?

3
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,510
Yeah for after uh the questions for the for the thing just you know, I do best just throw them at me

4
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:20,430
I cold. Okay. I came to this world hot. That's why I like it cold. So let's just get started. Okay

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,550
All right, and that's what we'll do

6
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:32,170
So

7
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,730
Another sonic event, I I think we're at 141 greek. Is that correct?

8
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:40,150
Oh, i'm not keeping count and I think it's less than that

9
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:48,270
Well, we'll find out it's okay to make a mess of things. It's not so bad. Okay, fair enough. But anyway, yeah, what's going on?

10
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:56,250
Well speaking of making a mess of things. Haha. Uh, I have someone we this is the first time we have a third person

11
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:57,630
uh

12
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,570
Uh here and he's going to give some testimony. He can stay anonymous if he wants

13
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,870
But i'll let him uh

14
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,430
I don't know. Um

15
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,950
Okay, fellow should I say what the subject is or would you like to introduce the subject?

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,600
No, great. Go ahead and uh introduce it. Oh, okay. All right, if you didn't have any okay

17
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,120
This is regarding uh, you know, you guys have always heard of me about doing weather work and showing other people

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,600
And uh, i've done it with many people maybe a dozen or two

19
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,460
And uh, this man was very eager and um

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,520
He got into it and he bothered me quite a bit on details

21
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,000
Which I actually like I told my wife I said he's just like me when he gets into something

22
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,280
uh

23
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,540
He doesn't let it go, but he's actually

24
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,180
What made him stand out more than other people who want to know about weather?

25
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,860
There's a few more also that he just was constantly building devices

26
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,440
and trying to improve them and he actually

27
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:02,460
It i'd say it took about maybe a month or two or thereabouts, uh to get the get

28
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,020
You know some pretty effective work going would you say?

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,380
Yeah, I would say that that's pretty accurate. Um, most of that was was uh more of my uh,

30
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,120
my error because uh

31
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,220
Just trying to understand the concepts and the principles and then on top of that trying to actually implement them

32
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,620
Yeah, it took it took some time and then build them yourself by hand as it takes time

33
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,500
So what's you know, what's an instruction now?

34
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,340
What sparked it?

35
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,740
We speak often and what sparked me asking you to come on and give some testimony is because I found what you were saying

36
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,660
To be almost exact with what i've experienced and it's actually quite dramatic

37
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,120
So do you want to maybe it was a few days ago?

38
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,840
We last spoke about what you're going to talk about the fires and changing the wind and doing this that and the other and speaking

39
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,900
To the firemen, I guess that would be something really good to get into because the weather seems um haphazard and random

40
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,700
But when you start applying it engineering wise to attack a forest fire or something

41
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,900
You get you got some feedback back and forth. So maybe take it from the top on that and i'll let you run with it go

42
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,120
yeah, so um

43
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,140
I'll just give them the location because it kind of helps the uh, the listener just understand like the position

44
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,220
So i'm based in southern california

45
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,320
Anyone can go look at a map and you'll see the map of california and it's burning in all kinds in the north and the south

46
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:17,700
everywhere

47
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:22,740
And uh the one fire that affected me was uh within 12 miles

48
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,700
Uh, it came over the mountain and the smoke plume was huge

49
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:33,380
There was no I mean in previous times. I would have just said, you know, I I just have to wait and

50
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,360
You know breathe the current air and just leave the condition as it is because I did not know what to do

51
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:44,760
In this situation since i've been building devices and and testing them and affecting clouds and things like that

52
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,660
I decided to basically

53
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:53,580
Take the opportunity to put them into action in a much more proactive way for myself in the in the area that i'm in

54
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,760
um

55
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,700
and so I began to take the

56
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,860
the the water gun specifically

57
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,100
uh and pointed at the clouds and and the plume and it began to create holes in the plume and

58
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:10,320
Clear the air out and that was basically the step one. Uh, but the fire is a 23 acre fire

59
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,640
Uh 23,000 acre fire forgive me

60
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,180
and that

61
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,420
That is something that was at zero percent containment

62
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,420
And it went like that for about four days at zero percent

63
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,960
Uh, there were already a couple homes burned and uh evacuations were already happening in the local area

64
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:35,260
Um at this point I reached out. I was like, you know, i'm i'm not proficient enough to the point where I can get rain

65
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,640
You know the the way you can greek, you know like that

66
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,600
But I I wanted to you know, try to do something and so that's kind of the mindset that I came in with

67
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,380
Um the

68
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,120
So I reached out to a friend of mine. Um

69
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,980
And I asked him he's a firefighter. He wasn't working that particular fire, but I asked him I said, you know, like

70
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,360
What what would you want if you had a wish list as a fireman? What would you want?

71
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,100
And greek as you know, the first answer is rain

72
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,480
And I said, okay, I can't can't try to help you with rain

73
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,420
But what about something else and he said the wind if you can stop the wind we can set you know

74
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,860
A control line and then from there begin to work the fire

75
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,280
So I said, okay, let me try let me uh, so

76
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,460
um

77
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,480
As you know, there's different layers of the strata and from there

78
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:25,620
It's it's kind of like you kind of kind of have to feel and even with the technology that we have in the the satellites

79
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,380
that can tell you

80
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,860
uh an idea of where the

81
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,960
The jet streams are flowing how the wind is moving

82
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,920
It still takes a little bit of effort to find that specific

83
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,580
Spot where the where the wind is coming from and then point the guns at it

84
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,140
And from there once I did that

85
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,060
um

86
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,100
the wind stopped within minutes

87
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,660
And overnight the fire went from zero percent containment to five percent

88
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,340
And the air quality massively improved the moment. I implemented what you call the worldly gig

89
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,640
As well, and it basically created a bubble around my area almost like a force field in a way

90
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,240
and uh

91
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,300
Yeah, i'll just stop there greek. Uh, I kind of threw a lot out there. Oh, yeah

92
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,660
Um good. That's great. I just want to say when you said water gun, you know, it comes to mind

93
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,280
It's not a water gun. It's a water

94
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:23,140
Powered gun, uh, like an electric motor would be powered. It's just plugged into a water, uh source probably something with misting

95
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,120
preferably a lake you

96
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:32,060
Discussed you probably doing that but I think it was misting a small chamber that powers a uh,

97
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,180
What looks like a metal tube that's about roughly eight feet long by six inches wide, right?

98
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,300
Yeah, I have two of them I have two I've got 10 10 footer and an eight footer

99
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:48,260
A lot of people hear water gun and think that water is coming from a tube or from a gun. Yeah

100
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,240
So yeah, we're spraying water out of fire naturally it would change right because you know, you got a really big water gun, right?

101
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,440
Right, but uh, no, no has nothing to do with um, the water itself

102
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,940
What we're looking to do is get the energy out of the water

103
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,720
Just like when you plug in an electric motor, right? You're looking for the energy, right?

104
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,760
Uh, you're not shooting electricity out of the motor. I just want to make that clear. Otherwise, yeah, right

105
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,220
Uh, so you got feedback

106
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,620
And also you were able to change it and you've experienced a lot of things that i've been talking about for years now

107
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,660
Yeah, the feedback I got was from neighbors. I you know, I just you know nonchalantly asked them, you know, like

108
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:27,400
Did you notice a change last night? How is it that because the air quality in my area was at 140

109
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,220
Uh, which on that scale for the air quality is is

110
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:36,040
Particles per particles per cubic foot or meter. Yeah, there's a scale. Uh-huh

111
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,740
And it went down to blue that was like brown or purple brown probably or tan and it went down to blue 50 or something

112
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,060
Yeah, it went down to 39 and it was green and if you looked at the sky

113
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,960
You would have never known there was a fire happening 12 miles away. That was 23 000 acres happening

114
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,580
Yeah, it was quite phenomenal and it was quite uh, yeah, it felt good too

115
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:03,480
So good because i've been speaking about the weather lately and if anyone wanted to get into it like you have recently

116
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,480
I thought it would be great to have you on and just kick it with us on what you experienced and of course other things

117
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,780
When when he says a whirly gig it's rotating cones

118
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,260
Nothing, very special. You just build it and it wrote you rotate them about

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,440
Uh

120
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,200
What would you say 30 revolutions per minute something like that? Yeah. Yeah

121
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,980
Yeah, and you actually create a bubble an etheric bubble

122
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,260
Around a given area based on the device

123
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,280
And i've always chased fires. We've had them here. Also. I've had exactly the same experience

124
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,240
so

125
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,880
yeah, um

126
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,000
So I wanted also because i've been speaking about weather

127
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,880
Maybe it's a little bit of encouragement to hear what you have to say give a testimony you have to give

128
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,500
You know anything else you think uh, you want to say I mean regarding the recent weather stuff

129
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:02,600
I think you did make rain. You did make rain though, didn't you? Yeah, I did two days ago. Yeah contrary to forecast. Yeah. Yeah

130
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,380
Yeah

131
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,460
Showed up in the forecast, but it showed up. Uh

132
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:13,460
As a result of what I was doing, right? Yeah, it was not in the previous forecast. Yeah. Yes. Can I ask a question here?

133
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,600
How how long did it take? Uh for you to get proficient enough with this to

134
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:25,220
uh, you know, did you did it take you a few months did it take you a few years did it take you a few days in

135
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,660
order to be able to uh

136
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,800
Have a such a large effect. It sounds to me like you affected a pretty large area

137
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,100
So, I mean were you able to do that right away? Uh with with the principles that you were applying or no

138
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,700
How long you've been working with it basically

139
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,480
From for me. It's been about two months

140
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,600
Yeah, exactly. That's why but but like rick was saying I I built these devices

141
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,900
Um, he's he's provided some guidance on how to build the devices and uh, they're they're basically, uh

142
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,400
I would say an evolution above what uh, some of what trevor james constable was was building as well. Um,

143
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,800
and uh

144
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,900
But I I don't sometimes I really don't know

145
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,520
like, uh

146
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,120
how

147
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,240
It's it's I would say it's almost there's an inspiration that comes when you start doing this type of stuff

148
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,480
I don't know how to explain it

149
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,280
I don't know greek. I don't know

150
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,880
Yeah, if a furniture if someone is making furniture or building guitars will have the same

151
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,200
Yeah, anyone that uh, really well, that's what it's about if you I think you when you were building it

152
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
You really wanted it to be to succeed

153
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,300
Right, so you did and most people do and actually it's uh, sometimes better

154
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,240
That when you build these things you don't succeed so, you know what not to do

155
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,960
But in your case that was about maybe 50 50

156
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,080
right

157
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,020
so

158
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:50,120
Uh, and it's worked out well, so oh i'm just saying a couple of months worth of investment to you know to

159
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:56,120
Experience this in order to create such a large effect. I mean that's next to nothing compared to

160
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,780
You know, yeah, uh, what what you would think would take? Yeah

161
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,180
Go ahead chuck ask. Are you next to nothing? What was what would you say?

162
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:09,220
Rough cost would be good for what you used. Yeah, that's right. Not not labor just materials. Let's say

163
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,560
Is

164
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,840
Is that directed to me? Oh, yes

165
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,680
Yeah, what would be the cost of the devices and what you put into it materials because you can't go to you know

166
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,540
Buy them off the shelf

167
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:25,140
So yeah, some of the things uh, like the like the spiral pipe you get at an hvac store or something like that a supply

168
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,260
Yeah, you over you overpaid for some things but roughly a few hundred bucks, right?

169
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,320
Yeah, I would say around between like three or four hundred but I mean i've built a lot of devices, right?

170
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,740
Right, well here's here's the other thing if you took your time, could you find all that stuff in in a junkyard?

171
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,260
Yeah, for sure. I've actually been looking at garage sales and like, uh, you know, like

172
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:47,600
uh

173
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,920
Metal recycling spots

174
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,480
Yeah, it's kind of like remember et phone home the movie he built his thing to communicate with this capital

175
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,980
Mothership with junk

176
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,280
It's very similar to that. Yeah

177
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,040
But you can go out to buy you can go out and buy stuff. Uh

178
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,900
Motors and things like that, but basically

179
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,160
When you're around your neighborhood and you see people put out certain things for the trash, you know

180
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,600
Like recycling or whatever you pick them up and use them

181
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:18,760
And if you're building it from scratch the materials i've scaled it down. My designs are very inexpensive

182
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,180
uh, if you went with like

183
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:25,800
What trevor if you could even understand what trevor james constant was doing it would cost a lot more

184
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,020
You would probably need a fabrication

185
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,180
shop

186
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,720
Okay

187
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,420
Right. So, uh, would you say you could probably build this in your backyard front porch or kitchen, right?

188
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,080
Oh, yeah backyard backyard and garage. Yeah. Yeah. So would you say if we had uh,

189
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:47,780
Someone like yourself and someone like myself spread out. Let's say a thousand miles apart around the entire world. We could pretty much control

190
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,540
The climate and weather to a certain degree

191
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,680
Yeah, for sure

192
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,800
And uh, you had if you just had whirly gigs out there

193
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,300
I think you would you would get rid of a lot of smog problems that yeah a lot of rotating cones. Yep

194
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,220
the rotating cones yes, okay

195
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,880
Yeah, cool. They would get into hurricanes

196
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,660
Eventually i've done maybe 50 hurricanes

197
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,640
Abatement and I don't do them anymore because people you know, they love disasters, right?

198
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,320
So when there's when the hurricane goes away, they're like, ah, okay. What else is going on? Right?

199
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,200
So you're taking away their tv greek, you know, if you take away the disasters, what are you doing?

200
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,380
Or if you're feeling really evil, you could wake up and turn a county into a federal disaster zone. It's up to you, you know, so

201
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,000
But you gotta you know be responsible, you know, um and take control

202
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,300
This is this entire realm was given to us to a certain degree if we could find out how to do it, right?

203
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,440
so

204
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,820
Excellent. Cool, man. Thanks. Thanks for sharing that because really I wanted to have you on again in case

205
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:54,580
I've been bringing up the weather a lot. And what if people want to get get going on it, you know, and here you go

206
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,320
You know two months or so. Thank you very much. Yeah anything else?

207
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,740
You want to I'll just say uh, if you start doing this work try to get

208
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,620
You know nonchalantly just feedback from people in your area so that you know

209
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,800
it's that the changes you're affecting are not just your imagination, you know outside of the

210
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,280
The tools and the apps and the things that you can see from satellite views

211
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:22,520
But I mean just so that you know that it's not just something you're manifesting in your mind. It's actually happening around you

212
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,520
So when you hear other people notice

213
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,680
some a change

214
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,380
You and you know that you were part you affected that change. It's it just helps

215
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:37,240
Build confidence in my opinion. I would advise against talking to people about it. They'll think you're crazy

216
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,360
But that's okay. Yeah, do it if you if there are people you're already speaking to. Yeah

217
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,700
Yeah, not about the details I meant more about like

218
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,760
Oh the conditions they notice the change in the conditions. Got it. Okay. Yes sort of survey the conditions

219
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,560
You don't have to bring up why you're asking exactly, you know, well i'm changing it

220
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,740
No, you don't have to say that you can just say have you noticed, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Gotcha

221
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:03,820
okay, I I almost gotten I set up once on the side of the road years ago and I said, you know where the uh,

222
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:09,660
Highway has these rest stops and there's 100 cars or so parked and uh the bathrooms sure

223
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,240
Oh i'm echoing here. Uh, anyway

224
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,620
Oh, I do am I do I hear myself doubling you're not echoing here, okay, and it's just me

225
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,580
Uh, and I told some people I was doing weather work and the sheriff one of the deputies came maybe a half hour later

226
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,720
and he was very upset and I

227
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,240
I had to tell him. Oh, come on weather. No, this is a

228
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,800
Daytime, um optical device. So come on the weather. Come on. Don't you know only god can do the weather. He's like, yeah

229
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Yeah, that's right. Right, right. It's just telescope. Don't worry about it

230
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,880
Yeah daylight optical because

231
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,220
You don't see any mirrors in there or anything

232
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,500
But yeah, yeah, but they they don't need to they they won't understand even how to look for that

233
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,040
You know, they see a tube and you say hey, you know what? It's a telescope. They won't even bother

234
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,400
Right, they won't even bother uh, because even if it was a telescope

235
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,380
They don't know how to see most people unless they're familiar with it

236
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,660
But I want to try to say is you have plausible deniability on your side, right?

237
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,480
I want to see if pluto looks any bigger in the daylight, you know

238
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,140
They won't under they won't even know that that's a silly thing. This is plausible. Yeah, right. Yeah

239
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,540
cool, excellent

240
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,280
All right any final words maybe and we'll continue with the rest of the sonic anything else

241
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,360
Well, unless you want me to throw one more question in there if you don't mind. Yeah, please go ahead. Okay. So, um

242
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,140
What do you have an idea of what inspired you?

243
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,100
Uh besides the fact that you know

244
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,720
Obviously there was a bunch of talk about this is affecting the area and you wanted to have a positive

245
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,460
change that you wanted to uh

246
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,640
Initiate I mean is there some reason why you chose to do this particular thing or

247
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,580
Was it just the first thing that came up once you felt good doing this work?

248
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,020
I I this is not the first

249
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:51,920
fire

250
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,740
So this would be I would say the fourth

251
00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,660
But this was the biggest and this fourth in recent in recent days in recent weeks. Okay

252
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,860
and um

253
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,060
Since it was the since it was uh, 23 000 acres, um

254
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,040
the conditions were

255
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,020
Massively impacted. That's why

256
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:17,680
I put a little more effort behind it because it was it turned the sky black. So

257
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:26,520
So because of a sense of urgency you decided to try and affect this particular because I mean, you know, california there's a fire

258
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,500
Uh, you know constantly right?

259
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:34,600
The way I see it it's like california is on fire and also it happens to be a nice day outside here

260
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,260
Uh, you know just could be any given day

261
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:43,780
But the fact that this was kind of large it was nearby and you that that then you said to yourself

262
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,480
Okay, this would be something I want to affect

263
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,800
And you uh targeted particularly because of that

264
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,080
And rain probably as well because you're looking for me to make rain

265
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,580
Rather than the wind the wind here's the thing it might be difficult to make rain, but uh

266
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,160
But the because it requires certain conditions that have to be met first

267
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,120
But the wind you can change regardless any time and usually what would you say about 30 seconds or to a minute?

268
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,580
You're gonna affect the wind every time

269
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,060
Yeah

270
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,980
I would say a couple minutes

271
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,980
Yeah in greek you would say that this is uh, this is the kind of results almost anyone can achieve if

272
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,180
They put in the effort

273
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,100
and uh, you know, it's in other words, it's not something that uh,

274
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,460
Should be too difficult to achieve if you can wrap your mind around the base concepts, right?

275
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,560
Well, it's just like you want to play guitar, you know what a guitar is and that's it

276
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,500
You go buy a guitar you pluck the strings and sounds terrible then you start learning

277
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,580
Right, right how to play and then you practice and then you play better

278
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:47,800
right

279
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,720
Okay, well, thank you. I um

280
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,360
I'm satisfied. I don't know, you know, there's probably a hundred questions

281
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:01,500
Here's some bragging points years ago where american freedom radio danny before we started speaking, right?

282
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,200
He says my brother, you know, he's in washington state. Do you remember that?

283
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,220
Is my brother's coming from florida we got rain all week. Can you do something about that?

284
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,780
I said like do what he says can you make it like sunny and not rain for about a week?

285
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,740
I said, yeah sure

286
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,000
And then the next week we showed up and danny's like thanks. There was no rain at all

287
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,220
It was clear skies sunny, right right even stranger is unprompted by you. Uh, I happen to be you know

288
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,060
Because I do other radio stuff

289
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,220
All that was from the the lake. Yeah, too

290
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:31,640
So I was talking to a guy about this and uh, he mentioned

291
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,440
Oh, you know you talked to uh, the greek recently and I just started speaking with you

292
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:41,500
And I said, yeah, and he said, you know, uh, he uh, he came up with this thing that uh

293
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,260
Was able to help me when I was out fishing

294
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,320
I said, what are you talking about?

295
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,360
And usually he talks to me about a lot of technical things and uh, he he does a lot of work

296
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,220
The coil guy. Yeah. Yeah, he does a lot of work with what they call free energy, right?

297
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:59,880
So, uh, so that's what I was talking to him about and you know magnetism and how it's missing, uh from a lot of equations

298
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,280
And etc. Anyways, uh, so he just added the blue goes. Well, yeah, you know that guy well, you know

299
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,320
maybe don't tell too many people but

300
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:13,800
he uh gave me some directions about a device and uh, I had great a great time fishing because I was able to

301
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,360
Affect the weather directly around and this and that I said wow

302
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,480
With what actually? Yeah, and then he showed me what it was. Yeah, and he showed me what it was

303
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,840
So yeah, very rigid more specifically. I wasn't myself. It was someone I was working with in australia

304
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,620
uh, and he was uh

305
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,400
On various skype groups with this guy and he says well if you can affect the weather

306
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,140
And this person that I was instructing in australia for a couple of years. He would say

307
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,900
I'm not keen on that. It's a bunch of bollocks, you know bullshit, you know

308
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:47,700
and he had a reason why he wanted to try it and it worked and he

309
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,580
Then I just told him build this tube this way and when he goes out on his boat

310
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:58,560
He could stop the wind and go fishing right? Yeah, and he got back to me on that and says yeah

311
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,580
That's what he takes out

312
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,600
So I I don't think i've ever spoken to him

313
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,600
But I think that it came from the greek was relayed. It was because it was relayed to me pretty

314
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,060
Heavily, uh while it was going on and a result and then eventually it came up with you in conversation. Yeah

315
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,320
He just passed it along to me and uh, and I said, well, what are we talking about?

316
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,420
and it's just you know, what i'm saying is it's not like you're building a a giant, uh,

317
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,340
Uh, you know like like peewee's big adventure machine that makes breakfast. Okay, you know with

318
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,580
Your fishing poles. Yeah, it's basically what we call a translator, right?

319
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:37,220
Uh, it's a tube built a certain way with a double mirror configuration certain materials, but he yeah

320
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:40,840
And it wasn't that large and I think the one he built was only two feet or something

321
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,080
Very small three inches

322
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,660
Like I said, he showed it to me and it wasn't even like anything that looked like a device of any kind

323
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,760
Like you said it could have been something that he was carrying

324
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,760
To uh hold his fishing pole. Maybe very innocuous looking right?

325
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,100
And uh, so that was something that came, you know completely on

326
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,840
you know on uh

327
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:05,240
Un-signaled by you or anything. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of people out there. There's a chemtrail harry. He's got

328
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,900
He got real excited. There's a whole bunch of people but the whole thing is to have more of an organization

329
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:16,300
Where we can communicate in real time be like, you know, very simply put like the ham radio guys, right?

330
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,680
So actually

331
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,820
That would be a good thing to do the weather devices and ham radio

332
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:26,400
So when if there's an interruption you can still communicate, but right

333
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,700
Yeah, okay

334
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,620
so, you know the reason i'm bringing this up is because I have a feeling it's going to be

335
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:37,560
in the near future something that uh should be taken in account for meaning doing

336
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,060
more weather control, so

337
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,460
Excellent and you know

338
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:42,900
look

339
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,700
a lot of people like to talk about chemtrails and all that stuff and they they uh,

340
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,980
You know tell you how to build devices to affect the chemtrails and this is not no

341
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,560
That's not what we're doing at all. I was just going to say this has zero

342
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:02,020
That's right zero but this is that's a good cover for it because those guys are viewed as uh breakfast cereal variety

343
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:08,160
You know fruit nuts and flakes. Yeah, and um, and yeah, so you can easily associate or disassociate

344
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,480
Uh, you got plausible deniability on your side, right? Oh, that's right

345
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,840
That's another thing you could do, you know

346
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,480
If somebody doesn't understand or doesn't want to go with the telescope idea you could say well

347
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,580
No, i'm i'm here to affect the chemtrails, you know, and you just and they're not yeah

348
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:27,280
I'm, just uh, we're not it's just i'm building an optical device. I want to see if the tube can line up and

349
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,320
Yeah, there you go. That's so that's what works too, you know depends on your audience so to speak. Yeah

350
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,320
Yeah, yeah, exactly. So in other words, it's about being empowered, you know

351
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:38,700
right

352
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,420
Instead of you know, mealy mouth sheep or goats or whatever

353
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,560
Okay

354
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,920
Cool. All right. So

355
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,960
Maybe we should just uh, call it a sonic if the

356
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,100
Weather guy's still here. I think we this was pretty good

357
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,900
Uh, we've never done this before with a third, uh having a third leg on the stand here

358
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,840
Well, not somebody who was going to come on to discuss something that was relevant to us

359
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,240
No one time a long time ago. We had a guest. Uh, we had jack blood come in actually when we did a live broadcast

360
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:07,640
Yeah

361
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:14,080
So fundraiser for the show. Yeah for american radio. That was that was funny. Yeah, that was yeah, that was kind of interesting

362
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,860
Yeah, I would say it was a disaster but yeah, it could yeah with jack blood you never know

363
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:25,500
Oh, no, it's entertaining like a car accident, you know, just just so you know, but it didn't produce anything but it was showtime, right?

364
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,780
All right, so fine

365
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:35,560
Maybe we'll just call it. Yeah. Well, this is we'll do a wrap. I think this was a good break and something different and

366
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,520
You've been on for a little while you got it a little something different for the people on uh on patreon

367
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:47,740
And so, uh, don't don't forget you can comment on each sonic if you like and therefore attach it to the sonic event and let

368
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,600
Us know what you think or questions you have for each one as we go along

369
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,080
And the chitango is a good place

370
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,600
You could crack a beer open and go hang out in front of the chitango and see whose shoulder you want to cry on or

371
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,960
Want to write something and I read it

372
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,820
The most I stay away from it is a day. So every 24 hours, I'll take a glance at it

373
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,780
Right, I drop in and on in on it a couple times a week as well, but uh, but that's about it

374
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,240
Yeah, cool. There you go
