1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,720
SonicEvent142, rated Y, and Greek, how are you?

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,440
Oh, you got the number right.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,620
Yeah, I did.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,840
I got it right last time, too.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,520
We were wondering about that, but yeah, I got it correct.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,740
So there it is.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,840
Well, even how I am is interesting.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,720
I don't take interest, I mean, well, how can I say it, not take interest in my own baby,

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,180
which is lawful timekeeping.

10
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,240
By the way, it's really, I'm really sad to pronounce I'm the only one that does it, right,

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,140
other than those have, you know, got it from me, let's say, lawful timekeeping.

12
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,920
Right, they have mentioned it in the Chatango, they were seeming to.

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,560
Well, it's an intercalary year, and last night, it's the first day of the seventh month, yesterday

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,220
the moon was at least 20 or 30 degrees more southeast.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,700
It was east, south, south, you know, the bearings on the compass.

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,480
Right now it's almost due east.

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,940
Now, how the hell does it move 30 degrees across the horizon?

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,740
It only does that on the seventh month, sometimes on the first month.

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,260
So even though it's an intercalary year, and you're not sure, should we really reckon a

20
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,380
13th month?

21
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,140
They're like, yeah, yeah, because the moon just showed you, I don't know if you know

22
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,860
how, people that don't really watch the sky, but these things take a certain position,

23
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:29,120
and they don't move 30 degrees north in one day, right, in terms of the track of the ecliptic,

24
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,200
and the moon just did that.

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,000
And I predicted yesterday, I said, I put it on the chat, just watch how it's going to

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,900
go from southeast to due east overnight, and it did that.

27
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,140
That's pretty big.

28
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,700
Oh no, we're not talking about, you know, during the different phases, we're talking about

29
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:49,180
overnight, same phase, it shouldn't, it doesn't, it doesn't make any sense, you know, you couldn't,

30
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:49,500
you know.

31
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,760
So from one to the next, it typically doesn't move that much.

32
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,080
Yeah.

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,340
I mean, that's across the equatorial, not the ecliptic, which is, it shouldn't, in other

34
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,660
words, it's not math, it doesn't work, there's no math to show that kind of a change, but

35
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,120
it happens every seventh month.

36
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,440
It's kind of exciting, the most exciting month is the first day of the seventh month, which

37
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,640
to show how far off it is now from September 11th, 2001, September 11th, 2001 was the 10th

38
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,380
day of the seventh month day of atonement.

39
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,100
By the way, the, I was on archaics recently, and I tried to talk about lawful timekeeping.

40
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,780
I thought Jason was falling asleep, but some people got it.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,460
And, um, yeah, I didn't think he was falling asleep.

42
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,900
I thought he was getting overwhelmed is what it was.

43
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,220
That's not my problem.

44
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,940
Yeah, true.

45
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,160
But yeah, just don't fall asleep.

46
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,020
The rest is fine.

47
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:48,260
But here's the thing, the lawful timekeeping, whenever, like 9-11 was on day of atonement.

48
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,860
The COVID announcement was on the Passover.

49
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,700
If you look at other major events like stock market crashes and the Murrow building, all

50
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,420
that in April, they're all on biblical holidays.

51
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,820
So when you read on the biblical day, like on the 10th day of the seventh month, you know,

52
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,860
most people don't know what that means at all, right?

53
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,700
Well, they do.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,980
I mean, a nine-year-old, if you say on the 10th day of the fifth month, they know what

55
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,540
that means, but they can't find it, right?

56
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,560
You know what I mean?

57
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,960
That would be July 10th, seventh month?

58
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,860
No, right?

59
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,920
So that's why I did the lawful timekeeping.

60
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,900
And then later on, I found out lawful timekeeping is that if you look up astronomy 101, they

61
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,900
teach that the full moon is the new moon and denotes the month.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,980
And the day starts at solar noon.

63
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,380
I mean, you could look that up right now.

64
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,540
Any astronomy college course 101, 102, they'll teach that.

65
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,280
But for five minutes, they'll just mention it.

66
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,080
They won't teach it.

67
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,100
So that's exciting.

68
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,000
I've got a bunch of stuff going on.

69
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,820
You got some questions.

70
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,200
I just want to mention, soon I'm going to be talking about the acoustical counter space.

71
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,700
And I think I mentioned to you, I sent some modules to a speaker company that has a YouTube

72
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,140
channel.

73
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,280
They're pretty high end, unusual products.

74
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,980
And they did a YouTube video on it.

75
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,060
And in the YouTube video, they said, we got these incredible things.

76
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,560
He called them quantum, which they're not.

77
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,220
And he says, well, we're not installing them properly as per instruction.

78
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,520
They didn't install them right.

79
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,620
And this is a YouTube video on this.

80
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,860
But they still said, but I did notice it did still do what he said.

81
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,660
And here are the graphs to prove it.

82
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,520
And he actually said he did not install them according to instructions more than once,

83
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,660
when he could have quite easily.

84
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,640
And they did a YouTube video.

85
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,360
Now, that video since has been taken down, not because of my comments.

86
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,900
The comments were fairly favorable.

87
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,560
And it's only a private video.

88
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,340
I did show it to some people.

89
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,340
And the responses that I got from my side was, why did he not install it right?

90
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,920
He actually says he's not installing it right.

91
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,780
Just my luck, as they say.

92
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,840
Could you imagine, Chuck, you come up with something and you send it to, I don't know,

93
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,720
a toothbrush company and a new toothbrush.

94
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,440
And the toothbrush company does a video on your new style of toothbrush.

95
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,540
And they said, we're not going to use it to brush teeth.

96
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,500
We're going to brush.

97
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,020
I don't know.

98
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,260
You pick what, right?

99
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,620
But it still works really well.

100
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,080
We're going to clean shoes with it.

101
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,900
But it works great.

102
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,200
Yeah.

103
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:15,920
Yeah.

104
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,940
Why would you do that?

105
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,340
Why would you do that?

106
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,380
That is so.

107
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,180
If you told me that's what was going to happen, I'd say there is no way in a moronic universe

108
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,720
that we even in a moronic universe, anyone would do that.

109
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,340
Right.

110
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:34,020
So anyway, this is the kind of stuff I've been living with and doing now for over two decades,

111
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,440
three decades coming up, you know.

112
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Whether it's water stuff, energy stuff, whatever, you know, it's like, yeah, we want to test

113
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,080
it out.

114
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,780
I remember going out to Houston, Texas and the Halliburton labs.

115
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah, we ran tests on it and it was great.

116
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,220
And I saw what tests they ran.

117
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,760
I'm like, that's not what I said should be.

118
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,820
What are you guys doing?

119
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,340
Oh, my gosh.

120
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,580
Do I have a right to bitch?

121
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,480
Not really.

122
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,460
I think I have more of a right to observe and report.

123
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,560
Oh, certainly.

124
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,860
I mean, and besides that, it's not as though this should be a shock or surprise to you

125
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,420
anyway, right?

126
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:05,780
No.

127
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,800
Now, what is interesting, though, is we do have people that are listening to some of

128
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,380
the sonics and giving them some thought and then spitting back questions or, you know,

129
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:20,780
really interrogatory statements in some cases about stuff that they heard.

130
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,940
Do you want to start with the most recent or you want to go back a ways?

131
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,300
No, it's up to you.

132
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,120
But most recent, as long as we don't lose the ones that are more back.

133
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,540
So you shoot up to you.

134
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,760
I like I like going cold.

135
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,840
OK, no problem.

136
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,160
Let's go with this because of the weather.

137
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,260
Cold, but not dry.

138
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,700
Not dry before penetration.

139
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,300
Always cold, but not dry.

140
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:41,680
Gotcha.

141
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,000
At least at least a little little spit.

142
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,320
Gotcha.

143
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,580
There you go.

144
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,800
Anyway, to the Greek greetings.

145
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,560
Have you experimented with this dissipating clouds and then in parentheses naturally

146
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:03,340
formed in the sky purely through a focused stare with a small amount of question?

147
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,100
Well, this is a weather question, but they're asking, you know, basically without equipment

148
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,500
in a long sort of way.

149
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,820
Yeah, it's called the IRA.

150
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,880
There's a guy, Peter, or something that during the time of Freud and all that there was, you

151
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,040
know, we hear about Freud during that time in the early part of the 20th century.

152
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,080
But you don't know that Freud was part of a an entire movement.

153
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,720
Like a woke movement in the psychology, there was no psychology industry.

154
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,500
Then anyway, I was sort of, you know, what they called people, you know, the loot.

155
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,220
It was lunatic, lunatic, lunacism.

156
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,640
It was called before that.

157
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,660
And there was the master lunacist in the court.

158
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,220
You know how you go to court and they they have a psychos psych eval.

159
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,040
They call it right.

160
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,700
Well, before the Freud, you know, that's a new system of psychology.

161
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,000
The court brought in what was called a master of lunacy.

162
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:52,540
Look it up.

163
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,540
And they would judge whether the person should be, you know, his fit.

164
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:56,820
Right.

165
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,580
Just like today was called master of lunacy.

166
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,260
But anyway, during the time of that, there was a lot of interesting research on the power of

167
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,780
the mind and its extensions, meaning sight, hearing, touch, feeling, telepathy, PK, you

168
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,680
know, psychokinesis and all that stuff.

169
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,940
You know, we don't we get little drips and drabs.

170
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,520
I'm talking about mainstream textbooks.

171
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,420
We're talking about this stuff anymore.

172
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,180
They don't use the word lunatic anymore, either, which was.

173
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:19,700
Yeah.

174
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,160
If you go to a master of lunacy is in law, the courts had a master of lunacy anyway.

175
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,120
Yeah.

176
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:27,740
Yeah.

177
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,980
By the way, most 99 percent of my education is not from the Internet.

178
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,140
Of course, you know.

179
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,500
So yeah.

180
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,580
Anyway, so it's old books.

181
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,799
And Jason, OK, it's the same thing.

182
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,400
It's kind of kindred in that way.

183
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:45,200
Now, during that time, they found this called the visual ray.

184
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,200
And there's some stuff on it online.

185
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,980
I think I haven't seen it in a long time.

186
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,100
Maybe, maybe not what you can do.

187
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,180
And we all feel in certain language.

188
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,400
It's called putting light on you.

189
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,980
You know, when you're in a crowd, suddenly you want to turn around.

190
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,560
It's almost as if someone tapped you on the shoulder, but they didn't.

191
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,580
Someone staring at you from the back.

192
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,480
You could feel it.

193
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:02,760
Right.

194
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,580
They were able to put make these literal black boxes.

195
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,520
There were black velvet boxes in another room.

196
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,900
And people were able to trigger solenoids by just giving them where to look on the wall.

197
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:13,820
Right.

198
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,740
OK, they could trigger things.

199
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,260
Right.

200
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,500
So that research right away was put down.

201
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,660
So in other words, I'm shown that on a local level with certain amount of research,

202
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,380
you can trigger a magnetic solenoid with your eye.

203
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,520
Right.

204
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,520
By looking at it through a wall, through a box.

205
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,560
Why not make a hole in a cloud?

206
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,460
I gave the long winded version of that because it's not about going around and saying,

207
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,660
well, I made a hole in the cloud with my eye.

208
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,520
Fuck that.

209
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,960
Oh, excuse the medical term.

210
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,040
All you got to say is you got a lot of power coming out of your eye, period.

211
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,770
Mm hmm.

212
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,700
They also ask, does the device discussed in the sonic work on a similar principle?

213
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,300
They're asking.

214
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,420
I don't think so.

215
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,160
But I'll tell you how the device works.

216
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:58,660
Very simple.

217
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,440
We don't know what the ether is because it's one of these first principle substrates.

218
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,100
You're not allowed.

219
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,940
It's like if you're a cartoon character on the TV, you're not allowed to question the pixels.

220
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,860
That's outside of your right.

221
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,240
It's outside of your reality.

222
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,040
But actually, that's what makes you look real is the pixel on the if you're a video character.

223
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:16,340
Right.

224
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,660
You know, I don't know how we like fish.

225
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,720
Fish are always arguing, you know, like we put this fish in jail in the psych ward.

226
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,060
Why?

227
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,160
Because he says we're all underwater.

228
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,760
He's crazy.

229
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,260
But I'll tell you.

230
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,580
Yeah.

231
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,060
Right.

232
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,840
Because they're used to it.

233
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,060
Right.

234
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,840
So but, you know, could it be that when a fish dies, the last thing he entertains is that

235
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,660
he's underwater.

236
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:36,500
Right.

237
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,480
So yeah.

238
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,380
And by the way, you know, when a lake is poisoned and the fish die and some don't,

239
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,100
the ones that die first are the ones that drank the water first.

240
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,620
That doesn't sound like it makes sense, but they do actually intake water through their

241
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,840
gills, through osmosis.

242
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:51,660
OK.

243
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,260
And then it goes to a separate area where it works just like the human body, where there's

244
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,600
no penetration at all.

245
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,660
You know, induction.

246
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,080
So it's the thirsty fish that die first when the water is poisoned.

247
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,580
That does make some sense.

248
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:04,880
Right.

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,320
Gotcha.

250
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:05,740
Yeah.

251
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,180
So this.

252
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,480
OK.

253
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,700
The ether is what we're in is our water.

254
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,260
We cannot question it, just like fish cannot question water.

255
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,240
So how do you work with it?

256
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,180
Well, we through the works of Wilhelm Reich, which you have to give him the Paramount credit

257
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,480
on this because he simplified it, is that we know that the potential goes from low to

258
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,400
high versus the potentials were taught where everything goes high to low.

259
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,540
We've discussed this before.

260
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,140
Yes.

261
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,160
So we know that and we know that a low potential feeds the high.

262
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,200
So we need to create a low potential somehow.

263
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,460
So what we do is we make a device which is exactly an unbalanced capacitor and it's a

264
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,460
conical device or tubular device.

265
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,120
It has a double mirror on the ends, layers of metal and nonmetal.

266
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:53,660
So we know that when the ether sees that device, it's going to slow it down a little

267
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,040
bit and theory.

268
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,700
And when it slows down a little bit, it acts like a low potential.

269
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,460
Ah, whammo.

270
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:06,560
So within the geometric matrix of that device, because it slowed it down a little bit, it

271
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,380
actually represents a slightly lower potential.

272
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,120
Guess what that's going to do to the high potential?

273
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,980
It's going to feed it because it goes from low to high.

274
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,100
Right.

275
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,760
By the way, this is how the phaser weapons work on Star Trek.

276
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,580
Yeah.

277
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,440
There's a book.

278
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,380
I don't know if you could find him on how the Star Trek devices work.

279
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,740
It was written right around that time.

280
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,860
I remember perusing through it.

281
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,020
There's a handful of technical manuals now.

282
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,160
They've actually expanded that.

283
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:32,580
But yeah, yeah, yeah.

284
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,660
If you could find how it works, not just a blueprint.

285
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,300
Oh, yeah.

286
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,960
So yeah, yeah, right.

287
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,040
So we know that.

288
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,300
The water gun, it's not a water gun.

289
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,800
It's a water-powered gun, just like you have an electric motor.

290
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,500
It's not, right?

291
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,560
So it's plugged into a water source, literally.

292
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,120
Just like you would plug an electric motor with a short cord or a long cord, you could

293
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,840
plug in the big water gun with a long cord or a short cord.

294
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,800
In other words, your water source could be 100 feet away, and you could have a 100-foot,

295
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
let's say, tube going to the gun that you're going to be working the atmosphere, right?

296
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,700
There's no water in the gun, right?

297
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,120
I just call it water gun for short.

298
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,960
You could call it, Wilhelm Wright called them cloud busters.

299
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,380
We've evolved them, made them very efficient since then.

300
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,780
That works on both of these principles, because the water with the gun directs out.

301
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,020
Now, for example, the first device I mentioned goes from low to high potential.

302
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,700
This one can create a high potential, which will drain the atmosphere.

303
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,500
That's what makes a hole in the cloud.

304
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,260
So if you can make a hole in a cloud with your eyeball, that means your eyeball has

305
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,220
a higher potential than the ether, right?

306
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:46,620
So when you subject the ether to a high potential device, it will drain it.

307
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,180
It will go to your gun, which could eventually make the gun dangerous, because if you touch

308
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,040
it with bare hands, it could shut down your nervous system, right?

309
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,440
It's just like touching a...

310
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,780
If it's worked enough and charged enough, it would be touching no different than touching

311
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,000
a power line, but the results would be different, right?

312
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,360
There are many people whose hearts have stopped that did weather work, especially in the desert

313
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:15,060
at night with a water source in the desert's extreme environment, and they touched the

314
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,620
water gun and got a heart attack, what's considered a heart attack.

315
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:23,060
The heart attack feeling is numbness in the legs or arms, can't breathe, or you can't

316
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,860
control your breathing.

317
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,600
It feels like an elephant sitting on your chest.

318
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,800
You get dizzy, lightheaded, and you start going into a panic, because you're wondering

319
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,120
what the hell's happening to you, right?

320
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,380
Those are the male symptoms.

321
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,020
Actually, female symptoms differ a bit, but go ahead.

322
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:35,360
Yeah.

323
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:35,900
Yeah, they do.

324
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,280
They actually go more into the fainting a little bit quicker, don't they?

325
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,640
Well, they also have other visual cues and a few other things that occur that don't

326
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,360
occur typically in the male, but yeah.

327
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,180
Right, like gray, they can't see through one of the eyes or something.

328
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,100
Yeah, exactly.

329
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,120
Yeah.

330
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,180
Yeah, there's big differences, of course.

331
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,580
But yeah, because male and female is not just two genders.

332
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,440
It's actually a separate species altogether, by the way.

333
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:01,960
Right.

334
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,940
That's why, yeah.

335
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,920
You know, men are for Mars and women are for Venus.

336
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,420
Remember that?

337
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,120
Oh, yeah.

338
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
I remember that whole trend.

339
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,420
Yeah, okay.

340
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,100
So well, anyway, there's a little bit, by the way, I'm outside.

341
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,980
There's a little bit of an eclipse happening.

342
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,120
Oh, I wasn't aware of that.

343
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,680
On the top between, I'm southwest USA looking east.

344
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,180
Moon is about 20 degrees above horizon.

345
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,760
The sun had barely some light left.

346
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:33,200
The between 9 o'clock and 11 o'clock, it looks like you put a ruler or something flattened

347
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,940
it out on the top.

348
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,140
So it's a partial eclipse.

349
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,060
Interesting.

350
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:43,400
So look, speaking about potential and low and high, somebody asked on here, is there a place

351
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:51,340
that I can get more material on the yin and yang, you know, blood, heart, etc.

352
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,420
Uh, that name is Creek, by the way, that that asked that question.

353
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,000
Right.

354
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,200
I think I got some similar questions of that.

355
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,900
Now, here's the thing that's so sad.

356
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,940
You go online, look up yin and yang, you can get this rudimentary stuff that if you think

357
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,300
it's that it's better than if you never looked at all, because I have spoken to people many

358
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,680
times.

359
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,640
Well, not at all.

360
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,980
But it's not just that, right?

361
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,340
It's like saying a Ferrari is a cart.

362
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,200
Yeah.

363
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:18,660
Okay.

364
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,080
Yeah.

365
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:24,380
So what I've said to people and when I say, oh, yeah, I know Taoism, you know, I said,

366
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:24,640
oh, yeah.

367
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,520
So you know that the young projects the yin.

368
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,220
And they're like, huh?

369
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,300
You have a cat that does that, by the way.

370
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,200
But I call them.

371
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,200
They go, huh?

372
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,460
I'm like, oh, I'm going to use that.

373
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,760
So, yeah.

374
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,260
So it's like, oh, my gosh, you know, so they just think like when you say young, right?

375
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,020
You know, the definition is hard, pointy, bright, right?

376
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,720
Yin, soft, dull, spread out, right?

377
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,180
Okay.

378
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,280
That's fine.

379
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,760
That's fine.

380
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,900
Crayons away.

381
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,780
You know, that's fine.

382
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,480
But there's many levels to it.

383
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,040
So until you understand that the young protects the yin, you don't have a working relationship

384
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,240
with those concepts.

385
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,200
So is there a place to go?

386
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:02,420
No.

387
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,660
The place is called your mind.

388
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,180
And if you don't have it in your mind, you're going to have to get it out of somebody else's

389
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,440
mind.

390
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,380
And that's why we've been trying to do the sonics here.

391
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:10,800
I think I might.

392
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,980
I was thinking, you know how we did the scalarator seminar, and I'm going to probably do one on

393
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,440
acoustic counter space, right?

394
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,619
So you're doing one on yin and yang, but that would actually be a disservice because

395
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:23,980
it's one of those things like martial arts where you have to practice for your whole

396
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,180
life, right?

397
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,560
And but you practice in your mind and with predictions, the beautiful thing about understanding

398
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,380
yin and yang, you could pretty much predict anything.

399
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,560
So if someone shows you, let's say you're in a lab and you see one chemical and another

400
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,160
chemical, if you study them and see where they are in the yin and yang scope, you can

401
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,440
actually predict what's going to happen.

402
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,660
You put them together, even though you don't even know what they are.

403
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,840
I've never seen them before, right?

404
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,220
It's about predictability, right?

405
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,880
Like, for example, you know, they say, oh, that kid's eating too much candy, his teeth

406
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,440
are going to rot.

407
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
It's kind of like that, right?

408
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:53,620
Right.

409
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,620
But it doesn't always happen, right?

410
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,880
No, it doesn't always happen, but it's a fairly predictable thing, given that, yeah,

411
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,660
given the circumstances of culture.

412
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,880
But this transcends that.

413
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,820
So we've gotten to some yin and yang on the earlier sonics when we were addressing, quote

414
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,820
unquote, health problems.

415
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,240
And I don't like to call them health problems.

416
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,700
As you know, they're fitness issues.

417
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,080
There's no such thing as health, right?

418
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,660
It's what fitness level you need for whatever you want to keep your teeth.

419
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,240
Right.

420
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,300
That's a fitness level.

421
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,280
Like, I want to eat healthy so I don't get sick.

422
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,780
Well, that's a level of fitness.

423
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,120
In other words, what one person considers sick is another person's healthy, right?

424
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:33,600
The reason why I'm saying that when I travel cross country and I stayed with Americans

425
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,300
and I ate their food, I felt sick.

426
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,080
I just ate what they normally feel.

427
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:42,340
So then I questioned, do they feel maybe I'm getting sick because I'm not used to it?

428
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,060
Or is this how they always feel?

429
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,220
And it turned out that's how they always feel.

430
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,560
It's normal for them to feel that way.

431
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,880
You know that, you know, when you eat food with no nutrition or overcooked or whatever,

432
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,880
you feel like low, heavy, no energy.

433
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,100
You don't feel good.

434
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,120
That and you're still hungry, too.

435
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,120
That's the other thing.

436
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,640
And you can be.

437
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,840
You can be more often.

438
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,400
You feel like you need to eat more often.

439
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:02,600
Right.

440
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,420
Right.

441
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,320
So it's kind of like when you start using alcohol, you run out of gas.

442
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,700
I remember a place where the small town of Grants, New Mexico, the gas tanks were all

443
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,220
polluted.

444
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,000
So they just got alcohol.

445
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,960
So I bring alcohol in the car.

446
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,560
You can run a gasoline engine on alcohol, but it has no power.

447
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,440
You could floor it.

448
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,760
You're barely going 30 miles an hour with the alcohol.

449
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,500
Right.

450
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,740
It does it, but it doesn't do it.

451
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,780
Well, yeah, it has to be adjusted.

452
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,540
So this is how.

453
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,300
Anyway, I would say there's if we did, you know, Mr.

454
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,460
Rogers, every time he opened, he changed his shirt.

455
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,680
Beautiful day in the neighborhood.

456
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,700
This neighborhood, the Mandela effect, whatever changes issues every day.

457
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,540
You do food.

458
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,260
I wanted to do maybe every time we do a sonic, not every day, every day.

459
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:40,860
I do it anyway.

460
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:46,660
But when we do a sonic, bring up a health thing, a diet, a food thing or something, a

461
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,500
yin and yang thing.

462
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,460
Right.

463
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,660
That's the only way to do it.

464
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,480
A little bit of time.

465
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
How do you learn a language?

466
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,620
You got to learn a language.

467
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,880
You sit and do Rosetta Stone.

468
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,200
Think you're going to get it in a week?

469
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,720
Or what if you are immersed in a Spanish speaking neighborhood like it or not?

470
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,500
You're going to learn Spanish, right?

471
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,020
Oh, yeah.

472
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,580
One way or another, you're going to have to communicate.

473
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,560
That's right.

474
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,240
So when you put yourself in a situation where you want to communicate with your environment,

475
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,160
you have to learn yin and yang because it is a superior way.

476
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,400
I'm just saying that in a modified way.

477
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,620
I remember since we started discussing this, I don't want to call it yin and yang because

478
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,840
it sounds like I'm modifying some Asian philosophy.

479
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:21,420
Right.

480
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,460
It has nothing to do with it just because it was preserved by them.

481
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:24,720
Right.

482
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,260
Right.

483
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,500
And you don't have a better descriptor for it.

484
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,580
That'll that'll just, you know, that'll wrap it around and give give people a reference.

485
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,120
I got you.

486
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:32,640
Not yet.

487
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:33,180
Not yet.

488
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,700
We have a lot of descriptors for other things, but not we haven't come up with anything for

489
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,200
that yet.

490
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:43,940
What I suggest, though, is just constantly looking and thinking about it until you make

491
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:44,600
it normal.

492
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,680
You know, it's kind of like, again, the cliche of tying your shoelaces.

493
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,400
I remember it was so difficult to tie my shoelaces the first maybe 10 times.

494
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,260
Right.

495
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,400
I was like, did I do it right?

496
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:00,580
You know, but after like 10 times or a month of learning how to tie my shoelaces, I don't

497
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,780
even think about it anymore.

498
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,100
Right.

499
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,720
So that's how I'm functioning with the yin and yang.

500
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,560
Like I'll run it.

501
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,160
Just recently, someone was doing something.

502
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,940
They said, if you do this, that's going to this is this.

503
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,860
And this is going to happen.

504
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,500
They're like, really?

505
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,780
They're like, oh, yeah, because that's yin and this is yang.

506
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,700
And this one is going to do this yin reaction.

507
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,680
Oh, my gosh.

508
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,340
It's yin and yang.

509
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,560
Well, I don't know how else to communicate it.

510
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,460
I don't know how else.

511
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:22,700
Right.

512
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,320
So there's got to be a better way.

513
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,860
I think if we come up with another way, other than it's calling yin and yang, it'll be more

514
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,460
universal and easier to accept.

515
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,120
But in the meantime, go study on the Internet.

516
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,860
There is no place for any of these things.

517
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,820
I want to get into places also tonight.

518
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,220
But what else have you got?

519
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,800
I'm not sidestepping the yin and yang.

520
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:41,460
No problem.

521
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,740
I'm just saying this is it's one of these things like, how do I learn French?

522
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,160
Oh, my gosh.

523
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,940
I mean, so many people could tell you so many different ways.

524
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,100
But the only way to learn any language is by immersion.

525
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,060
True, true.

526
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,120
Immersion and make things that are commonly useful right away.

527
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,060
Easily useful.

528
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,920
Like, you know, you're in that Spanish neighborhood.

529
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You're going to want to learn how to ask for food.

530
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,340
Ask where something is.

531
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,200
So asking where directions are or something is going to be something you're going to need

532
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,740
to not only be able to ask, but understand when it's told back to you.

533
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:11,960
Right.

534
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,980
So she's really cute.

535
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:14,620
Her phone number.

536
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,720
Yeah, that helps, too.

537
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:16,960
All right.

538
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,680
So a couple of things that are more modern question wise, and then we'll go back in time

539
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,000
on the on the timeline, if you will.

540
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,300
Let's see.

541
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:27,000
Have you come across the Matrix?

542
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,240
I guess five Roman numeral five or V quest of the spirit volume of works by Val Valoran

543
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,000
Valerian.

544
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,240
No, no, no.

545
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,240
OK, fair enough.

546
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,980
And I don't read much stuff that's after like 1920, 1929.

547
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:43,820
Right.

548
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,660
It's suspect.

549
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,100
I just it's fine.

550
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,680
OK, anything past and if it's less than 100 years old, I would rather get the cliff notes

551
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,740
from someone who read it.

552
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,260
Tell me about it.

553
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,400
You know, I'm not familiar with that book.

554
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,080
Otherwise, I would try and give you a cliff notes on it and see what you thought.

555
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,980
But I don't have it.

556
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:05,080
So anyway, if that person wants to give us a cliff notes, go right ahead and maybe we

557
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,780
can work from there.

558
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,700
The Greeks thoughts on a tech billionaire taking a spacewalk this week.

559
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,060
So that was in the news.

560
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,320
You know, the whole no, no comment.

561
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:13,960
No comment.

562
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,600
Fair enough.

563
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,980
OK, so now we go to the biblical.

564
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,980
Do you think we will see the return of the Christ in our lifetime?

565
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,480
No, no.

566
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,320
OK, fair enough.

567
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,560
Because for many two points, whether you have the timeline or not.

568
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,040
Correct.

569
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,880
Is it the Christ that comes back or is it his crew that comes back in his name, in his

570
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,440
full power?

571
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,000
But what we see there is crew in our life.

572
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,520
Exactly.

573
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,020
OK, fair enough.

574
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:50,160
Last thing along those lines is, does the queen of heaven sit on the left side of why

575
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,800
h w h?

576
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,660
I don't have any information on that.

577
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,480
I really don't.

578
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,600
I have never come across anything, but it is.

579
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:04,660
But that's good that they asked left or right, because that kingdom is a lateral kingdom.

580
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:12,720
You know, we keep saying for the people that are outside of the knowledge, it's always

581
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,500
higher and lower.

582
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,440
But once you gain the knowledge, you understand how things really work and you're invited

583
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:17,740
in.

584
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,060
Everything is lateral.

585
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,340
You're either on the front, the back, the left or the right.

586
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,200
Right.

587
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,580
The left hand path, the right hand path, so to speak.

588
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,100
Yeah.

589
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,800
But for the profane, it's always high or low, high or low.

590
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,120
Right.

591
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,480
Fair enough.

592
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,340
So that was the grouping of coherent questions I got so far.

593
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,480
And if you guys drop them over on the Patreon, I will collect them and bring them to each

594
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,980
sonic, as I told you, especially for new people who don't know that.

595
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:49,320
Also, we bring up things that are going on in the chat over on the Chatango, which over

596
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,220
there has just been about the lawful timekeeping, which is where we started.

597
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,180
Yeah, it's a big deal because it's an intercalary year.

598
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,160
And it's the seventh month, which is the most exciting.

599
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,940
You know, there's like nobody, nobody.

600
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,460
This this is like these are like major events, stellar events happening every year.

601
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,740
And nobody's paying attention.

602
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,080
Right.

603
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,140
And they're major.

604
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:11,500
You know, it's just what they're told is major is major versus what really can be witnessed.

605
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,500
I'm looking at the moon right now, and it's dead east.

606
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,620
And last night it was more than 30 degrees towards the south.

607
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:22,100
We're talking about lateral movement, not across the ecliptic, you know, where things can move,

608
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,680
take different paths, which I mean, you know, diagonally across the sky normally.

609
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:26,960
Right.

610
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,760
We're talking because where we are, this is pretty amazing.

611
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,620
And yesterday I was looking at it with someone.

612
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,980
I said, you see where it is all the way down there?

613
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,180
It's going to be all the way up here overnight.

614
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:36,500
Amazing.

615
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,360
So yeah, lawful timekeeping.

616
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,520
That's cool.

617
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:40,900
Yeah.

618
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,840
So last thing, last thing I want to push on that, though, is that we do have some people

619
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,060
that are brand new and are just getting familiarized with Greek speak.

620
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:55,160
As a matter of fact, I referred them back to some of the original OG stuff where, you know,

621
00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:00,340
we went for two hours and focused on a couple of things on a cat per category versus loose

622
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,040
conversation.

623
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,560
Right.

624
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,540
And, you know, so they're just getting accustomed to this.

625
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,420
What what let's just say I'm brand new and I say, well, what what is the difference?

626
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:14,720
Why is lawful timekeeping useful, even considering I have this thing called a clock?

627
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,940
And that's well, that's well, it's because it's based knowledge.

628
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,020
It's based knowledge.

629
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,400
And I think I always said you don't have to buy anything.

630
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,580
You're not dependent.

631
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,380
It's like a slave has to do.

632
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:35,340
OK, when you're a slave, illegals law permits slavery and the legal people tell, you know,

633
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,060
there's no slavery because they can't see it like the fish in the water.

634
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,360
Right.

635
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,940
They do you know that the slave automatically takes on the religion of the master automatically?

636
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,260
I have read that.

637
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,640
Yeah.

638
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,160
Yeah.

639
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:47,800
It's automatic.

640
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,120
Yeah.

641
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:54,060
So that's why when you look at the the quote unquote black slavery in America, they all

642
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,540
took on whatever religion.

643
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:55,840
Right.

644
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,220
Even though they had long traditions prior to that.

645
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:58,480
Right.

646
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,240
Exactly.

647
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:03,300
That's why the only thing that they were allowed to do was listen to someone read from the Bible.

648
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:03,940
Right.

649
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,820
Mm hmm.

650
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,760
Because it was the Bible of the master.

651
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,460
Therefore.

652
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,700
Right.

653
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,920
So the lawful.

654
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,240
Yes.

655
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,680
If you ask us, let's just use the term.

656
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,500
Let's be more candid slave.

657
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,580
What day it is, not only what they normally tell you, January through December, Monday

658
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:27,300
through Friday, whatever, you know, Sunday through Monday or whatever, or the time by

659
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:27,820
the clock.

660
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:34,600
That is a system that if everything just went away and they were put in a place, you know,

661
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,060
they couldn't tell time without that subscribing to that commercial calendar or commercial

662
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,440
clock.

663
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:39,700
Right.

664
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,160
For navigation.

665
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,100
Mm hmm.

666
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,420
So they don't know.

667
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,040
I mean, in other words, they're depending on their what their master gives them.

668
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,420
Right.

669
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,020
Yeah.

670
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,420
So that's what that's all it is.

671
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,580
So the lawful timekeeping, you're going by another master.

672
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,420
You know, the ones have who have wound up the clocks of the sky, the ones who put everything

673
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,980
in place in this physical and nonphysical reality is more who you're subscribing to.

674
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:02,740
Right.

675
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,860
I mean, if you I've been practicing now for about a month because I'm doing most of my

676
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:12,780
a lot of projects outdoors and every day I get up and I look no matter what time of day

677
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,240
it is, I can tell you what time of day it is and what day of the month it is just by

678
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,000
looking at the sky.

679
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,320
Right.

680
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:25,720
A very simple way you'll notice between dawn and noon for the first 10 days of the month,

681
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,640
you can see the moon in the sky during the day during the day.

682
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:29,960
Right.

683
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:30,660
Yeah.

684
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,500
And then it changes and there's times where you can't see it during the day.

685
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,980
You know, it has to be those days.

686
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:35,820
Right.

687
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,060
I could go on and on and on, but there's no reason for that because there's no reason

688
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,660
to elaborate on these fine details.

689
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,260
It's kind of like, you know, how do you make a peanut butter jelly and sandwich or where

690
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,720
do you put the knife and the fork and what you know what I mean?

691
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,920
All this stuff is gets too much into detail.

692
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,900
But you'll notice that if you go outside and observe every day and just mark what you see

693
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,700
and go back and look at your notes after a month, you'll know what month it was, what

694
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,980
day it was just by looking at the sky.

695
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,940
Now, that's priceless.

696
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:09,200
Now, if you ask a slave that they're going to be looking down and scrambling for a device,

697
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:09,480
right?

698
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,140
For a device or a calendar or yeah.

699
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,040
Yeah.

700
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,000
Printed or whatever.

701
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,320
Yeah.

702
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,900
So even the free calendars are, you know, the reason they were given away free.

703
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,340
Someone said, well, the calendars were free.

704
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,360
I'm like, well, there were there were promotions.

705
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,260
There were promotions.

706
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:24,620
Remember?

707
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,700
They were always part of some sort of business.

708
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,380
You had to open a bank account to get a free calendar.

709
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,340
You had to sign up for something.

710
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,980
Yeah, it was a promotion.

711
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,600
But typically calendars are for sale.

712
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,560
Clocks are for sale.

713
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,640
Right, right.

714
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,180
All these things.

715
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,740
So yeah, what it does is it lets you operate.

716
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,400
Also, like I mentioned earlier, if you know the biblical days, you'll see what they're

717
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:44,760
using.

718
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,860
The globalists are using these days.

719
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,800
So I say globalists.

720
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,860
That's what it's called, you know.

721
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,940
By the way, you know how we had someone talk about the weather.

722
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,160
People like having a third leg on in a good way.

723
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,080
You know how we had someone for the first time.

724
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,700
Right on.

725
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,200
Come on.

726
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:07,580
And there was someone that I asked a long time ago who was a frequent emailer.

727
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,620
If you would like to come on also, we might.

728
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,460
He does some pretty.

729
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,500
He regularly keeps me up on things that I don't normally keep up on.

730
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,940
He sent me a video.

731
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,500
I mean, an audio about what he sounded like.

732
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:19,880
It wasn't.

733
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,520
I said, just let me see what you sound like.

734
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:21,960
And he did.

735
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,520
We might invite him on.

736
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,760
And there's another person.

737
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,760
I'm not going to mention his name.

738
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Dimitri Kalasoff.

739
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,920
But we have him come on, you know.

740
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,100
Right.

741
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:37,580
So if that's OK with you guys, we'll maybe do that a little more often just to spice

742
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,180
things up.

743
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,480
But the lawful timekeeping, I don't know what else to say.

744
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,980
You know, I mean, here's the thing.

745
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,900
Uh, if you know lawfully, a triangle has three sides.

746
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,480
Do you need to how many once you learn that, how many times you need to reference a geometry

747
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:51,920
book?

748
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:57,380
And if you did see a book on geometry and it said a triangle had four sides, well, you

749
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,940
could call that bullshit right away.

750
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,340
Right.

751
00:30:59,480 --> 00:30:59,980
That's true.

752
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,180
Yeah.

753
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,040
So, yeah.

754
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,400
But the biblical, you need some kind of reference.

755
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,100
Doesn't have to be biblical, you know.

756
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,520
But if you understand timekeeping, I remember looking through early American history documents

757
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,240
and it said on this seventh day of the fourth month, June, whatever.

758
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,420
Oh, wait a second.

759
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,040
Wait a second.

760
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,460
June is the sixth month, isn't it?

761
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,300
On the calendar on that.

762
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,020
Yeah, but why did you call it on this fourth month?

763
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,000
Yeah, right.

764
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,560
So they're running.

765
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,740
They were still run 1700.

766
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,680
They were still running two systems, right?

767
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,080
So you both or they're awful.

768
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:36,480
Yeah.

769
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:42,380
The other thing about that is anything has a lawful side, like lawful money, right?

770
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,080
You know, no matter how many times you pass a $20 gold piece, that's when you hear I got

771
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,900
a score to settle.

772
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:48,700
Score is 20.

773
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,640
Someone's owing someone a gold piece.

774
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,200
Right.

775
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,080
Right.

776
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:55,160
It's a 20 gold piece, no matter how many times it gets passed.

777
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:55,480
Right.

778
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:55,980
True.

779
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,980
Where with other things, it's, you know.

780
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:01,620
So, yeah, lawfulness is very important.

781
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,100
You know, this is the maybe 10th time in a month.

782
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,320
Someone I ran into said this and I have to say it.

783
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,440
Greek, you're the only one who says the body works by induction.

784
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,860
You know, they brought up all these guys talking about this, this person.

785
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:17,760
But you're the only one.

786
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,280
There's 10 times this happened in the past month.

787
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,200
I have to mention, you know, I said I have to mention if I get repeat synchronicities like that.

788
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:23,520
Right.

789
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,680
He said, but you're the only one talking about induction.

790
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,420
I'm like, now I'm trying to get all those comments and say I'm the only one talking about

791
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:29,700
induction.

792
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,000
What am I supposed to do with that?

793
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,380
Right.

794
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,180
What am I supposed to do with that?

795
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:33,440
Right.

796
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,600
And, you know, it's like, OK, I'm the only one.

797
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,700
Do I need to start, like, you know, yelling about it, doing more research on it or whatever?

798
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,920
What do I need to promote?

799
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,300
What?

800
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,340
I don't get it.

801
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:48,800
I mean, these are things that are, in other words, when you look at the medical stuff

802
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:54,420
and they tell you, by the way, if you do a search, I'll show you how what lawful means

803
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,600
and unlawful.

804
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,160
You know, they say if you can't dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bullshit.

805
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,920
I'm outside right now.

806
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,480
I've heard that.

807
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,300
I got the stupid rectangle in my pocket.

808
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,860
I'm having a smoke.

809
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,380
I'm going to go in for some coffee.

810
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,480
If you're in front of a terminal, a lot of sci fives, they call them computer terminals,

811
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:11,980
right?

812
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,120
Sci fi books and movies.

813
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,180
So if you're in front of a terminal, do this.

814
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,060
Type in how.

815
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,440
Let me see what I did the other day.

816
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,800
And I said, I got to do this on a sonic.

817
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,300
How does absorption occur in the small intestine?

818
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,800
Question mark.

819
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,320
And when you put pronunciation like that, the A.I.

820
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,000
kicks in, too.

821
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,760
So we want that.

822
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,000
Now, how does absorption occur in the small intestine?

823
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,300
Question mark.

824
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,660
Now you start reading all that stuff from the A.I.

825
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:49,540
and from websites all the way down because they give you a capture of the website.

826
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,480
You're going to see what a bullshit story looks like.

827
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,620
Can you do that?

828
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,960
Would you look that up, Chuck?

829
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,060
Oh, I'm doing it.

830
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,420
Yeah, I just I type slow.

831
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:58,740
Sorry.

832
00:33:59,240 --> 00:33:59,740
No, that's fine.

833
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,660
OK, let me know when you start reading off.

834
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,860
I might ask you to pause.

835
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,300
I want to show you what's going on and how to wreck it, because I've never done this before.

836
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,239
In other words, an analysis of, you know, conventional bullshit.

837
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,880
Small intestine.

838
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,860
OK, how how does absorption work in small intestines?

839
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,460
Right now?

840
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,600
No, no, no.

841
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,480
What I put in was how does absorption occur?

842
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,219
Occur.

843
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:28,480
OK, OCC, you are in the small intestine.

844
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:30,880
Question mark.

845
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,199
How does absorption occur in the small intestine?

846
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,239
Question mark.

847
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,560
This is also an experiment to see how different the result you get, but that's

848
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:45,460
you want to sound more academic when you ask these things, and it will shift the response.

849
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,260
OK, more towards the academic side.

850
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,960
So I get an initial answer sort of put together at the top absorption

851
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:59,680
through the Vili and across the intestinal wall can occur by several mechanisms,

852
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:07,180
diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis and active transport.

853
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:08,960
OK.

854
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,920
Figure 212 it references and then the duodenum

855
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:21,640
ileum and terminal ileum contribute differently to the function of the small intestine.

856
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,420
OK, so far they haven't answered anything.

857
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,100
But go ahead.

858
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,940
No, they're telling me the different pieces of different types of intestine contribute

859
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,460
differently, which I already know that the ileum is the initial small one.

860
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,460
And then you go into the other part.

861
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,380
Yeah, duodenum is the drain in the stomach.

862
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,440
Yeah, I try to avoid those terms because people shut down.

863
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,220
OK, you know, you know, when the stomach transits through the small intestine,

864
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,460
duodenum, I call it duodenum.

865
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,980
OK, and then you keep reading.

866
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,340
Yeah, the first reference, the first thing they give me to click on is small intestine

867
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,580
absorption and overview on ScienceDirect.com.

868
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,420
All right.

869
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,180
Either one.

870
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,780
When you start going down to some sites, it'll give you those way,

871
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,520
all these different ways, diffusion, osmosis, whatever.

872
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:03,640
Right.

873
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,940
And then it'll say this.

874
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,280
Well, how does it do it?

875
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,860
You know, it says that these cells do it.

876
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,000
And there's some special cells that do the absorption.

877
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,980
In other words, you start looking.

878
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,300
Well, how does it still hasn't answered how it happens?

879
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,720
And then when you get into the special cells, they don't want to tell you what

880
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,720
those special cells are, because guess what?

881
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,480
Those special cells don't exist.

882
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,380
Phosphorus and homeostasis, magnesium.

883
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,240
Yeah, it's like five different ways, right?

884
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,660
Yeah, all these different things, right.

885
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:32,900
Yeah.

886
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,380
So but none of them, they can't tell you really.

887
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,160
They're just giving you these distract.

888
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,360
These are all distractive terms.

889
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:38,900
All of it.

890
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:42,620
So if you ask a professor, let's say, oh, no, it's by osmosis.

891
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,160
Then if it's not by this, it's by that.

892
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,560
If it's not by this, it's by that.

893
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,380
If it's not by this.

894
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,740
Oh, my goodness.

895
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,220
Oh, my goodness.

896
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:54,520
What you will see eventually when you start going, there are special cells that contribute

897
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,440
to absorption.

898
00:36:56,120 --> 00:37:00,980
OK, show me which cells I once I brought this up.

899
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,120
I bring this up again because I brought it up two decades ago.

900
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,960
And then they go down and you can't see that you need a special equipment.

901
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,080
It's so special.

902
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,060
It doesn't exist.

903
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:11,880
Yeah.

904
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,220
Then they're trying to bring you down to, OK, then it transports things to the gut.

905
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,600
And here's how gut works.

906
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,020
And here's no, no, no, no.

907
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,880
Go back to the read the original question again.

908
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,220
How does absorption occur in the small intestine?

909
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,060
You can be specific.

910
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,200
That's why I said small intestine.

911
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,840
And if you said the GI tract, it's all over the place.

912
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,480
Yeah, no, it took me all the way from that by going into the here's where it goes next.

913
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,140
And then absorption, salvage, absorption slash salvage.

914
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,240
But how does it occur?

915
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:37,480
Yeah.

916
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:37,880
How?

917
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:38,820
It doesn't say.

918
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:44,840
OK, if you keep slamming on the how, it'll eventually end up telling you there are special

919
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,500
cells that do that, period.

920
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,000
That's it.

921
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,120
That's all you need to know if you want to pass the test.

922
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,000
Total bullshit.

923
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:00,620
Now, any reasonable, normal person, space heater, NPC will look at that and be totally

924
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:04,720
satisfied with that response that you've just pulled up, whether you're clicking on sites

925
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,860
or looking at the top caption that Google provides is overview.

926
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,240
Right.

927
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,640
They're all going to be satisfied.

928
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,920
But I'm telling you, it's bullshit.

929
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,200
All of it, because when you start narrowing it down, they have no explanation or description

930
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,460
at all, at all, at all.

931
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,440
It's such bullshit.

932
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:24,460
I remember reading from a nurse, someone who's been working for a long time.

933
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,940
They personally examined everything.

934
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,260
And not only does it all absorption, it's hydrophobic.

935
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,960
Just like I said, hydrophobic means it repels, repels water, repels anything that's on it.

936
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,300
So this in other words, they're able to tell you why is the rain yellow?

937
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,420
And they're giving you all these different reasons, except all they have to say is because

938
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,060
you're getting pissed off, right?

939
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:43,780
Yeah.

940
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,940
Well, it's not yellow rain, you know.

941
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,240
Yeah.

942
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,600
So what I'm trying to say is when you look, this is what I mean by lawful and unlawful.

943
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:57,720
It's not lawful what they're saying, but it's so not lawful that they can't even, you cannot

944
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,740
glean what lawful is by reading that.

945
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:05,020
In other words, let's say you had your bullshit detector on and the needle hit the red and

946
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,640
busted because you're reading that.

947
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,240
You still don't know how it works, do you?

948
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:08,640
No.

949
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:09,640
Yeah.

950
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:14,860
So that's what I mean, why am I been getting for the past month, almost 10 people saying,

951
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,900
Greg, you're the only one that talks about the body working by induction.

952
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,340
This has been coming up.

953
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,360
I'm not taking it like it's a bad thing, like I'm the odd man out, I'm crazy.

954
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:28,920
They're like almost saying like, okay, now tell us more or what am I supposed to do with

955
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,360
that, right?

956
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,740
So I'm been thinking about it as I've been doing my chores and all the things that I'm

957
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,620
trying to get out and finish projects.

958
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,580
I'm trying to finish in several different fields right now and trying to see in my everyday

959
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:46,280
life, how can I see it expand the knowledge or expand use of it, right?

960
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,540
Because once you understand that it doesn't work the way we're being told and it works

961
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,840
this way, you're better off.

962
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:55,040
Even if you don't know exactly how it works, at least you know it's not that, right?

963
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:59,580
And I wanted to bring that up as an example because you'll see the type of explanation

964
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,120
looks fairly academic.

965
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,540
It's all bullshit, by the way.

966
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:07,240
And you see, you can see again, I'm repeating myself here, how the normies would think that's

967
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,220
adequate, right?

968
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,340
But it's not.

969
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,700
It's all deflection, bullshit, and all of it.

970
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,260
All of it.

971
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,180
So what do you do with it, right?

972
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,080
How do you progress, you know?

973
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,240
And that's where it takes the counsel of multitude, right?

974
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:20,740
You need more.

975
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,820
You can't just do it alone.

976
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,440
You can, but you have to narrow it down to one thing, you know?
