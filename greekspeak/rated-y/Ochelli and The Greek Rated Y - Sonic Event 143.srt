1
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:15,219
The Sonic Event 143 Rated Y, Ocelli in the Greek, yeah, here we are, Greek, it's been

2
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:21,600
an interesting week, I gotta tell you I feel like crap today though, I really do, I've

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,260
been reading a lot of messages from people, I guess they're emailing you and checking

4
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,740
in with you and all that good stuff, what do you got?

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,820
Yeah, making new friends, I haven't had this much of an influx of people that seem interesting

6
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:44,220
since the Freeman interviews, so yeah, I've got new friends in Czech Republic, Russia,

7
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:52,280
Brazil, Israel, yeah, yeah, and you know, when I say friends, I mean, you know, people

8
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,560
that you'd want to meet, right?

9
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,460
Right, it seems though Archaic's had a lot of people like worldwide, you know, there's

10
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,220
definitely a diverse, you know, it's not just all in America or anything.

11
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,180
Yeah, exactly, and I want to get into that a little bit because I want to preface, I

12
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,980
want to preface something, there might be questions or so, and there's some emails I

13
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,140
might answer publicly, anonymously, of course.

14
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,080
The point where we've been for the past so and so years, you can either take it within

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,160
your lifetime recently, or if you study enough history, you'll notice that it's always been

16
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,620
this way.

17
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,960
Like, for example, you know, I love doing tangents, drug use is on the rise, right?

18
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,300
When?

19
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,080
Okay, starting in the 70s, 60s, whatever, okay, sure, go study the 19th century, they

20
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,620
had a big problem with drug use.

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,140
How about the early part of the 20th century, like World War One time, there was a lot of

22
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,180
heroin around.

23
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,420
That's when it came, yeah, the new stuff, yeah, before that it was morphine, and before

24
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,540
that it was just opium.

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,060
You got it.

26
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,520
Go back to the 18th century, a lot of drug use.

27
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,680
Go back to the 16th century, go 9th century, a lot of drug use, 1st century AD, 3rd century

28
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:58,960
BC.

29
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,680
What are you talking about?

30
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,260
It's always been this way.

31
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,139
But within your own lifetime, you have your lifetime is like your own little universe.

32
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,060
You can only see things from yourself, usually.

33
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,400
That's why it's important to read what other people write, or listen to other people, because

34
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,340
then you see their point of view.

35
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:22,500
But what I want to be emphatic about is, from this point on, like years now, all the stuff

36
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,460
that you've been taught will not help you, if that makes any sense.

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,120
So everything that you've been taught, oh, go to the doctor, oh, that looks real bad,

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,080
go to the emergency room, that will not help you.

39
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,080
That is the bottom, bottom, bottom, bottom of the barrel scraping, right?

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,660
In other words, financial stuff, go talk to a financial advisor, that will not help you.

41
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,420
You will be in the same boat as everyone else, and they will take your money, the chances

42
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,200
of making money.

43
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,220
And if you do make money, by the way, it'll be very small to what you could have done,

44
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,540
right?

45
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,180
On and on, on health stuff, go see this alternate practitioner, bottom of the barrel.

46
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:03,120
So what I'm saying is, if you have information that you've been living with, and you're relying

47
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,360
on that still, it's all bottom of the barrel, scraping bottom of the barrel.

48
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,820
The only thing that you will be able to work with that will create new things for you is

49
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,380
new information, completely new points of looking at it.

50
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,500
But the problem with that is, you have to understand that your mind is a human mind,

51
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,960
and just like all human minds, whenever they hear something that is too different, and

52
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,280
it's not in accord with what they heard before, it automatically, the mind automatically rejects

53
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,180
that new information, automatically, before you even think about it, right?

54
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,600
So that's the problem.

55
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,920
Well, we kind of collect, well, humans kind of collect things together in patterns, right?

56
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,040
So if we see patterns emerging, we trust that as reliable.

57
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,300
So if you hear it over and over again, it seems like, well, that must be true, right?

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,080
So repetition.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,440
So whenever you hear something like a pattern, you always say, that's bullshit, right away,

60
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,380
you'll be safe, or at least you're guarding yourself.

61
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:52,920
Right.

62
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,480
If you turn it the other way, but, because that's why we're not making progress, but-

63
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,920
No, you're not here to make progress.

64
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,860
You're not here to make progress.

65
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:07,240
It's kind of like when you're a paratrooper and you jump out of the airplane, you're

66
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:13,440
not there to make progress, you're there to safely engage, you know, get the shoot going

67
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,260
and land.

68
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,740
That's what this place is not, for the new people, it takes about 50 years to master

69
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,200
something.

70
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,520
So if you start at 20, you'll be 70, and then it doesn't matter what it is, even making

71
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,940
the best blue jeans in the world, chefing, anything, any craft by hand or study, one

72
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,100
of these big corporate guys, the richest guy from the stock market, Buffett, his partner

73
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,320
said that a real company that does investing, they have an office off to the side where

74
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,480
an 80 year old sits by himself and does all the decision making, right?

75
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,180
So you don't have that kind of time.

76
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,760
Like in a society where you live two, three, four, 500 years, it's way different.

77
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,480
Let's say you were to go to an open air market, like a flea market or what it's called, bazaars,

78
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,160
you know, people bring their wares to sell.

79
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,780
Yeah.

80
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,060
Okay.

81
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,220
Swap flea market.

82
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:03,700
Yeah.

83
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,940
So you're looking at a rug and it'll be nothing, a small area rug, and it won't be anything

84
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,200
like, or let's say handcrafted chair or handcrafted knife.

85
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,480
It won't be anything like you see now.

86
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,420
So for example, when people live multiple centuries, you go to one of these markets

87
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,100
and you see this rug and you like it.

88
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,360
And it does, if you were from this world, it would, wouldn't resemble any quality from

89
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,560
here and you'll see why.

90
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:28,660
Right.

91
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,160
So you want to knock the price down on the guy and the guy says, come on, it took me

92
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,140
30 years to weed that, right?

93
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,940
It took me 50 years to weave them because remember they live two, three, four, 500 years,

94
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,200
right?

95
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:39,760
Okay.

96
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,360
You cannot imagine that kind of workmanship or quality of craftsmanship.

97
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,060
You see what I mean?

98
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,360
This is the, the, the, the, the, the whole thing takes on a different meaning when you

99
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,980
live that long.

100
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,680
There's no reason why you cannot enjoy that with a short life that we have now.

101
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,000
And that's why, you know, we're blocked from education and all that.

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,140
So anybody listening to, so what I've, what I've been doing, uh, listening now has also

103
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,520
no and is new has what gets the flavor of what Greek speak is.

104
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,940
But I'd say the past 10 episodes, we've got into a lot of the legal stuff, the bankruptcy,

105
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,380
the bonding process, how money works, right?

106
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,720
So I was on an archaic interview recently, and you could send this audio to Jason, anyone

107
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,900
that's listening that can contact, or I can send it to big John.

108
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,660
But today he, I got up, I was doing gardening and I put it on and it says archaics was live.

109
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,140
So cool.

110
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,600
Put it on.

111
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,380
Let's see what he's saying.

112
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:30,620
Right.

113
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,080
He ain't no dummy.

114
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:32,680
Right.

115
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,800
So it's worth listening to.

116
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,120
Anyway.

117
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,980
Uh, he's talking about a guy in part was crying the blues about his arrest to get to pay all

118
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,920
this money to these attorneys.

119
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,620
And right away in my mind, I said, Oh, what a move, Jason, you pay you hiring attorneys.

120
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,840
That's a move.

121
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,360
It doesn't mean you're a, it just means it's a move.

122
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,660
So you don't know what's going on.

123
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,620
I mean, that's like bottom of the barrel dungeon programming way down there, you know, with

124
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,380
everybody else.

125
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,220
And uh, uh, based on his character and his demeanor, he won't understand what I'm saying

126
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,380
fully to implement it.

127
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,660
And it's so easy to implement.

128
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,320
It's amazing.

129
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,440
Uh, but it's scary because you're, you know, it's kind of like, uh, let's say you see a

130
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,080
new dungeons and dragons video game.

131
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,740
You've never played it before, even though you're just a video game player, it's kind

132
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,020
of easy.

133
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,340
Scary things jump in front of you.

134
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,060
You get scared, right?

135
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,780
But you got to remind yourself, it's just a video game, right?

136
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,340
Uh, to make a long story short, I want to just cover what's going on because it's in

137
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,100
every country, Czech Republic, China, Russia, all this, and the brainwashing that's going

138
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,320
on with the legal system.

139
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,980
I just want to recover that because I've been recently explaining it to someone in a way

140
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,060
that is very short in Greek speak style.

141
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,100
So what I want to just, the attorneys, by the way, don't know anything like, just like

142
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,580
doctors don't know anything at all.

143
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,200
They doctors a little bit better because it's physical.

144
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,300
So the attorneys don't know anything and it's all paperwork, right?

145
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:03,360
So for doctor, let's say has to do a C-section, he has to do something more than an attorney

146
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,340
will ever do.

147
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,840
Oh, he's got to get some results here and there.

148
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,460
Yeah.

149
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,000
It's messy.

150
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,120
The attorneys get results.

151
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,560
All right.

152
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,620
Uh, they get results.

153
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,060
All right.

154
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:11,580
Yeah.

155
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,220
Yeah.

156
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,860
But it's physical, meaning it's not just dealing with paperwork and, and, uh, wearing a three

157
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,700
piece suit.

158
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:17,980
Right.

159
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,240
Right.

160
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,360
Uh, but you know, it's funny.

161
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,460
People think they're so advanced.

162
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,480
I had a conversation with a medical person recently and they started bringing up these

163
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:30,560
procedures and everything that they brought up was either, uh, from the 19th century or

164
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,460
before, like, you know, like doing a C-section, right?

165
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,200
Why do they call it a C-section?

166
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,179
Oh, cesarean, Caesar.

167
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:37,580
Right.

168
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,380
Because, right.

169
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,480
And how long ago was that?

170
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,640
Like one 30 BC.

171
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,100
Yeah.

172
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:41,780
Right.

173
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,100
Okay.

174
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,680
So you're really primitive.

175
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,140
Uh, actually you're going the other way.

176
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:51,020
So all these people at the, the whole society is scrubbing the bottom of the barrel, uh,

177
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,220
and everything that they're doing.

178
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,380
So in order to jump to the next level, by the way, these types of things that I discuss,

179
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,800
we have, uh, people have heard me say this, but it's not for this society.

180
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,140
It's for the next society.

181
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:08,160
But if you start operating like it now, it could make your life here a little better.

182
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,300
Not only not easier, uh, simplify it, make it better.

183
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,000
You'll definitely be more advanced than all the other quote unquote, hairless monkeys.

184
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,740
Not that they evolved from monkeys, but that's just exactly what they look and act like when

185
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,460
they follow the norm.

186
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,920
But going back to Jason's situation, he put this out publicly, so I'll put it out publicly.

187
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,640
What's going on in reality is all the countries now, I can only mention specifics on the,

188
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,540
on the U S which by the way, the U S is sort of a capital of the financial world.

189
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,340
People talked about, you know, Reagan bankrupted the U S S R with the arms race.

190
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,840
Um, well that's crock of bullshit.

191
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,440
You know why?

192
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,940
Because the U S S R is money.

193
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:54,060
The Rupal at the time was coming out of the world economic forum, which was also the world

194
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,340
economic Federation and all these other things, the world economic fund or whatever.

195
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,300
And guess where that's based Washington, DC.

196
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,180
Yeah.

197
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,900
So it doesn't make any sense.

198
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,900
So all the world is the same.

199
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:11,240
So what's been going on with all the world and specifically the U S is the government's

200
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,200
got coaxed into playing a card game with the banking cartel and they lost their country

201
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,280
in that card game.

202
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:25,440
Some places like what happened in the U S between 1913, 1933 happened in Canada in the

203
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,000
1870s to 1890s.

204
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,620
They experimented on Canada, just like now they experiment on New Zealand and Australia.

205
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,000
Right.

206
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:31,520
Okay.

207
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:32,720
All right.

208
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,400
So when they lost the government, lost the, the, uh, country and everything in the country,

209
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:45,160
the people, the labor, all the patents, the deeds to the banks by contract, they said,

210
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,460
well, if we need to put something in place, a remedy.

211
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,060
So if people find out there's no revolution, by the way, no one ever finds out what I'm

212
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,360
saying.

213
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,420
That's why there's no revolution.

214
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,420
There'll still be a revolution.

215
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,420
It's a dead man's switch.

216
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,420
Once people find this out, regardless of what remedies put in place, that's it.

217
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,820
It's over, you know?

218
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,440
Um, so basically a coroner's report is written for every, all the 196 countries in the world

219
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,300
right now, they just haven't been buried yet.

220
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:16,620
And for example, when someone dies, like I know someone who had a, uh, was a cop and

221
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,680
he had someone die in their back seat while they were taking them to the jail house and

222
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,860
they put them in the morgue, city morgue.

223
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,280
And they were on ice for like five years.

224
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:29,700
No, you know, unclaimed, you know, because if they're, it depends on who's running the

225
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,960
morgue too, you know, might say, let's just put them in Potter's field.

226
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:32,220
Right.

227
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:32,860
Yeah.

228
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,560
But this guy was on ice for five years.

229
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,240
So yeah, they'll put you on ice.

230
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,060
So right now the whole, all the whole world's on ice.

231
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,880
But so what's going on?

232
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,860
So what the remedy was for every country is we're going to create a, uh, put everything

233
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:50,140
in a trust and, uh, everybody's a trustee except for the people or the beneficiaries.

234
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,040
And you get a number, uh, social security, social insurance number, whatever.

235
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,440
Everyone has it.

236
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,020
And that is really like your credit card.

237
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,800
In other words, every government, uh, all debt belongs to the government.

238
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,680
Let's say the U S for example, in other countries, you'll find it to the United

239
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,520
States, for example, in the uniform commercial code, there's only one debtor

240
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,860
and it's the United States government or the Czech Republic or the Russian

241
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,580
Federation or the ministry of Iraq or the ministry of Australia.

242
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,120
Each country has one debtor only.

243
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,180
And that one debtor is the government.

244
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,100
And like, for example, for the U S it's, I think UCC nine three Oh seven

245
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,580
section eight section H or Y I there's a few sections and it tells you the

246
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,380
location of the debtor, right?

247
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,420
District of Columbia.

248
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,920
So anyway, all the countries have similar codes in some countries.

249
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,880
They put these codes inside of another obscure treaty.

250
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,500
So you can't find it on basic research, but generally with the AI searches,

251
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,620
you'll find it, AI will lie to you by the way.

252
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,100
So, but it'll get you in the general direction.

253
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,240
All right.

254
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,400
So what's been going on is, uh, all the professional classes, the banking

255
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,360
people, credit card, people, doctors, lawyers, people who run them are, they

256
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,320
make it seem like everything's normal and you have to pay for things.

257
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,440
Uh, and what they do is they make you a trustee instead of a beneficiary

258
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,180
beneficiary when there's a trust, let's say, and you're the beneficiary

259
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,200
and you're going to use that trust.

260
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,640
You don't need to know how much is in the trust.

261
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,720
Actually, it's better that you don't know.

262
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,420
And when you need to buy something, you don't even need to know how much it costs.

263
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,680
That's the trustees job.

264
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,400
So when you're the beneficiary, you're like, Oh, I need a new car.

265
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,340
You call the trustee.

266
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:37,980
I need a new car.

267
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,300
Okay.

268
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,620
Which car.

269
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,860
And that's it.

270
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,360
That's all you.

271
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,080
And the next thing, you know, you get the car, but if there's, let's say

272
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,500
the, you don't have enough money in the trust, the trustee says, we don't

273
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,680
have that kind of funds to get that.

274
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,320
Pick another one.

275
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,120
You see, but the moment you start saying I'm the beneficiary and I want

276
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,380
to know how much is in the trust and I'm going to spend this and that.

277
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,880
Now you're acting like a trustee.

278
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,420
And in trust law, the trustee always takes the hit when there's a problem

279
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,620
with the trust, the trustees that go to jail, right?

280
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,220
Not the beneficiary.

281
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,880
So what they try to do is they always make you the one of the

282
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,340
trustees, like what they're doing.

283
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,400
So you take the hit.

284
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,400
All right.

285
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,000
So what's going on, let's say you've been in jail 26 years, let's

286
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,440
say, or 10 years or whatever.

287
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:22,040
That court is not part of the judicial part of government in any

288
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,120
country, especially the U S how do you know?

289
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,600
Well, everything on the functioning court side, whether it's the police,

290
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,920
the prosecutor, the judge, the bailiff, the bill, all of that is

291
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,720
under the attorney general office.

292
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,700
The attorney general office is executive branch of government.

293
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,940
They do what they want to do.

294
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,240
They say based because they were conferred and confirmed by the

295
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,840
legislative, right?

296
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,880
Legislative.

297
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,260
Right.

298
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,240
So where's the judicial?

299
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,420
There is nothing judicial.

300
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,240
It's all general order 100, basically military court.

301
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,620
That's why they have the army flag, according to title four, title five

302
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,200
with the French flag and the Phoenix on top.

303
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:04,500
Yeah.

304
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,160
It's not an Eagle.

305
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:05,880
It's a Phoenix.

306
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:06,580
And they, yeah.

307
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,720
Yeah.

308
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,460
So anyway it's a military court.

309
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:16,040
So what they're doing is the negotiating.

310
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,460
They, they will, you will not have a case until a penal bond is drawn up.

311
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,240
Three of them gotten into this before I'll do it again.

312
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:22,900
This is short.

313
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,280
So the whole interaction proceedings is getting you to agree to every, all

314
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,520
the requirements to have the requirements of the penal bond completed.

315
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,520
And once it's completed, they have your social security number.

316
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,100
Uh, you are a beneficiary, but they're making you act like a trustee.

317
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:46,080
So if they were making you act like the beneficiary in court, all the, all

318
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,340
you would know is come in and we just need you to sign something.

319
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:48,920
That's all.

320
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,140
No, you wouldn't know that you don't need to know the charges.

321
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,120
Right.

322
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,420
Remember like the car, buying the car, right?

323
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,440
Well, the moment you start looking at how much is in there and what they want to

324
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,000
do and what you're now, you're one of the trustees and you're reliable.

325
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,460
So what they're doing is they're taking you out of your position as being a

326
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,920
beneficiary by law, because remember the government set up that number for you to

327
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,500
take care of, to pay all of your debt because you can't pay for anything anymore.

328
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,600
So the moment you go into that court and you start pleading and talking

329
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,000
about that, now you're one of them.

330
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,960
And right.

331
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,360
But the penal bond that they've drawn up, there's three of them.

332
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,240
He's got your name on it and only your name on it.

333
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,260
And you're promising to pay whatever authority, usually the executive.

334
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,700
And they're not telling you that.

335
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,680
So once they satisfy, they check all the boxes.

336
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,320
The clerk is doing that basically.

337
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,820
Now it's a military tribunal because you need three, the judge, the prosecutor

338
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,240
and the clerk all work together.

339
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,700
Neither one of them has any higher or lower position than the other.

340
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,740
One guy plays the judge who is a failed attorney.

341
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,960
I think I've gotten to all judges are failed attorneys quickly because no one

342
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,840
goes to law school, says, I want to be a judge.

343
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,760
You want to go to law school to become a partner in a wealthy law firm.

344
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,839
If you suck at that, then you become a judge.

345
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:07,839
Sorry.

346
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,099
You know, it's the truth.

347
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:18,099
Um, then you have, um, the prosecutor who's a stage player, doesn't know any

348
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:20,880
law, the less state that he represents the district attorney's office.

349
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,720
And then you have the clerk.

350
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,859
Now the clerk is just as important because they're the ones that in real

351
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:31,360
time is checking off all the boxes on what's required for that bond to be issued.

352
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,960
Now, once all the requirements are there, all you need to do is go and sign it,

353
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,520
all three of them, and you're, you're done.

354
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:38,960
They're paid.

355
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,780
Whatever it is now under the CFR code of federal regulations, you'll find tucked

356
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,460
in there, all crimes are commercial crimes.

357
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,500
All right.

358
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,260
So let me just finish up with Jason's case.

359
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:58,020
So the first thing you should do is ask you, you know, well, you did another

360
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,740
thing you can do is use religious oppression, but this is later.

361
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,420
I'm talking about the beginning, but what you can do now that you're out

362
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,760
that bond that's been run 26 years would be about minimum of 30 to 40 million.

363
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,560
Now remember there's no money.

364
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,440
So it's just a credit value that later on gets given to the judges

365
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,720
and attorneys and all that.

366
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:16,960
Right.

367
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,280
When you're after retirement, you know, it's just a piled up there.

368
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:20,520
Right.

369
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,840
Cause you don't want all the money.

370
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,040
You just want the interest on it, right?

371
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,800
The interest on 40 million times a million times a million.

372
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,220
Cause that's how many people have gone through there anyway.

373
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,620
So the thing now to do is you call up the court and you say, I need

374
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,540
the bond, I need the court case number.

375
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:41,260
And the bond, the bond bond is long, just like anything, a surety bond

376
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,020
actually is a performance bond, surety bond.

377
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,420
And the, is it before a bid bond, which is what the charges are put on the

378
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,920
surety bond is you and the performance is the number of years, right?

379
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,840
That's how you're going to perform on it.

380
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,860
So you just want that bond number.

381
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,020
Now they're not going to give it to you.

382
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
Cause you asked that much.

383
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,240
They like they're busted.

384
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:02,520
Right.

385
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,400
And they're all, they'll everything I'm telling you is illegal as hell, what

386
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,160
they're doing, it's illegal and unlawful.

387
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:12,780
So if they don't give you the bond number, well, where do all the bonds

388
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,060
get registered in order to go through the federal reserve and let they go

389
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:22,840
through the DTC or the DTC DTTC, which is the, it for sure, just look up what's

390
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,980
called a deposit trust corporation.

391
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:30,100
Look up the deposit trust corporation and they will tell you they do.

392
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,220
24 quadrillion in business a year, which is a thousand trillion.

393
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,520
It's it's, it just doesn't make, you know, or 2.4 quadrillion, right?

394
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,780
Cause it, what you have billion and then trillion and then quadrillion, right?

395
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,240
Which is a thousand trillion.

396
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,120
That's what they do.

397
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,980
So those guys are really slow.

398
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,400
They don't care about anything.

399
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,440
You just put the request, you will get the bond number from them.

400
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:59,020
Or if you want to speed up the process, instead of being 180 days down to like 60

401
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,640
days, you go to Charles Schwab, you pay them.

402
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,300
They have a computer that networks right in there.

403
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,040
Right.

404
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,360
But I don't know what I heard like years ago when I first started looking into

405
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,860
this stuff, it was 70 or $80.

406
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,360
Now it's like 1200 to pay, you know, because it's catching on.

407
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:13,560
Right.

408
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:13,980
Wow.

409
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,440
Okay.

410
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,360
I'm talking about a private brokerage house, Charles Schwab, Fidelity,

411
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,180
you know, one of these guys.

412
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:19,420
Right.

413
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,140
But anyway, the DTCC has a request forms and all that, you can look all that up

414
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:27,900
and you get, once you get the bond number, that's all you need.

415
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,080
Then you go to the treasury, find the bond.

416
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:35,320
And what you're going to be asking for is the royalties on that.

417
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,360
And who are you to ask for the royalties?

418
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,400
Well, it doesn't, it doesn't every, whoever is on the bond, if it hasn't

419
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,980
been fully cashed out, which they don't, it should, they have it in their

420
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,760
collateral, just like you used to have stocks and bonds.

421
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,340
Well, who are you to ask for royalties on that?

422
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,400
Well, whose name is on it?

423
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,060
Well, they'll say Jason Breshears and, and only your name is on it.

424
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,040
Only your name.

425
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,840
It's your bond.

426
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,100
Right.

427
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,900
So all you're asking for is 5% of the 40 million or whatever.

428
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,920
Right.

429
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,640
It's, it could be more, it could be less.

430
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,580
Let's say conservatively, conservatively, 26 years would be no less than 26 million.

431
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,980
No less than that.

432
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,400
That's like heavily discounted.

433
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,920
It could be as high as a hundred million.

434
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:27,840
So once you start putting all the paperwork for this, Oh, you might go back

435
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,620
to the courthouse and find that everything has been scrubbed off the record.

436
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,500
You were never there.

437
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,060
You were never in jail.

438
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,000
You were never right.

439
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,040
Do you know what I mean?

440
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,240
This cause they're very corrupt.

441
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,300
Right.

442
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,160
Okay.

443
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:44,220
So if you tell this, what I just told to any attorney, other than like a

444
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,040
senior DA or whatever, they don't know what you're talking about.

445
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,600
If the attorney is younger than 65 or 70, they have no idea.

446
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:58,260
And the reason why is in the past 20 years, since nine 11, they made sure who's

447
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,800
they, uh, that anyone dealing with the public doesn't know what's going on,

448
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:09,340
whether it's medical, political scientific, because there were too many, too many

449
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,200
people involved in nine 11 with the public.

450
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,580
And they're all like having these Freudian slips constantly.

451
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:13,920
Right.

452
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,840
And it had no more of this.

453
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:22,140
So the, the, the level of separation now, well, let's say you have all these other

454
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,320
situations now where, you know, you've got to go to these parole officers or

455
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,640
you've got to do all this other stuff.

456
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:27,940
Okay.

457
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,800
That's where I've been talking about the Brandon, Joe Williams,

458
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,220
and maybe Christopher Hauser.

459
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,560
When you define what's been going on since the bankruptcy, since the civil

460
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,760
war state of Arizona state of California state of Texas state of New York state

461
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,900
of Georgia, those are all corporations out of the district of Columbia.

462
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,140
You could look all that up.

463
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,160
Right.

464
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,960
People have even attorneys think it's geographic.

465
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,360
Like they, I was talking to attorney once says, Oh, that's not true.

466
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,660
Cause the guy that was a warrant for a guy is flying from Texas to Arizona.

467
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,960
And when the plane crossed the border of Arizona, the marshals arrested him.

468
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,200
So they had no right to do that, but he agreed with it.

469
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,460
Right.

470
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,600
He agreed with it.

471
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:07,800
Right.

472
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:12,600
So like when you go pick up a ham sandwich for lunch and why I picked up

473
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,760
the ham sandwich and I ate it, it's because the ham sandwich agreed to it.

474
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,040
Right.

475
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,000
If the ham sandwich jumped out of your hand and protested the chances of you

476
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,840
eating it would be zero, right?

477
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,620
I would say so.

478
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:24,360
Yeah.

479
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,620
So that's, what's going on, but the brainwashing, but the, what, the way

480
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,740
you get around that properly without falling into their trustee is to

481
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,940
give you an example, like with me.

482
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,160
So riding a bike or something and actually let's tell it and cops from

483
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,520
me over, uh, you ran that red light.

484
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,300
Yeah.

485
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:45,980
Yep.

486
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,480
That's right.

487
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,820
You know, I'm not gonna, I knew I did it.

488
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,180
I said, who's the red light?

489
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:50,800
I'm going to run it.

490
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,620
So I was like, well, the first thing they do is they confer nationality on you.

491
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:00,580
Title eight, you know, in the state of Arizona, it's illegal to run a red light.

492
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,120
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

493
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,800
I'm like, oh yeah, that red light.

494
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,260
I just ran.

495
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,040
I did it without the state of Arizona.

496
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,920
Oh shit.

497
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,480
Now they don't know what the hell you're talking about.

498
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,840
Cause they think it's geographic, right?

499
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,260
So let's say you're California.

500
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,940
You get a tax letter from them.

501
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,820
Cause that's what they're doing now.

502
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,220
They're just sending anybody tax letters.

503
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,480
You know, California reputation.

504
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:23,800
Oh yeah.

505
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,800
I have this business and I do all this, but all the money I made was

506
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,240
without the state of California.

507
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,620
Or if you have anything with the quote unquote federal, oh yeah.

508
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:34,980
Yeah.

509
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,780
All that stuff.

510
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,300
All that, uh, uh, yeah.

511
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,000
All that, all the boxes of drugs and stuff that I brought in.

512
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,140
Yeah.

513
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,680
I did that without the United States.

514
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,060
What they require is for you to do it within their jurisdiction,

515
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,660
which is a fictional jurisdiction.

516
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:55,280
Actually, Chuck, if you're in front of the computer, type this in on a browser.

517
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,240
Uh, what is legal fiction?

518
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:02,460
Question mark, put the question there because the queries now are

519
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,800
getting more sensitive to grammar.

520
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,820
And I noticed if you put in what is legal fiction and what is legal fiction

521
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,320
question mark, you get different results.

522
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,080
Okay.

523
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:10,900
And read that.

524
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:11,900
It should have a caption.

525
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:16,480
It should tell you something like all legal, anything legal is a fiction.

526
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,660
All of it's a fiction.

527
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,500
You can't distinguish legal fiction from it's all, all

528
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,780
legal, anything legal is a fiction.

529
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,520
Well, I got a AI overview.

530
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,140
A legal fiction is a statement that is accepted as true for legal purposes,

531
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,520
even though it may be untrue.

532
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:37,520
Legal fictions are used to apply a rule in a way that is different

533
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,140
from its original purpose.

534
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,360
While leaving the letter of the law unchanged, the purpose of legal

535
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,160
fictions is to achieve fairness, consistency, or justice.

536
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,160
Right.

537
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,020
So let's say, say, well, you know, you went outside of your parole.

538
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,800
First of all, they're going to look at all your contracts.

539
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,560
I spoke to someone who worked for the district attorney in Texas.

540
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,800
So we're kind of talking about administrators.

541
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,400
Oh yeah.

542
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,040
He's like, yeah, when we charge someone with everything, we go pull up all

543
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,640
their personal records, see how much they have in bank accounts and property

544
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,780
they own, and the more they have, the more aggressive we are to admit that.

545
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,180
Right.

546
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,560
I also knew someone who worked in the district attorney's office in Hawaii.

547
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,580
Oh my gosh, that stuff.

548
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:23,280
I don't even know if I want to say on the Sonic, but I will.

549
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,840
So, okay.

550
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:30,800
So what's going on there is it's all fiction and they, you can make

551
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,880
people believe that the state, like right there, what you just read in

552
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,720
definition, you can have people believe state of Texas, state of Arizona, state

553
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,460
of California is geographic for that case, but you really can't be proven

554
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,780
that it is at all, right?

555
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,400
You see what I mean?

556
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,800
Although I'll tell you, Oh, the state of Arizona is the geography.

557
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,920
You're on it just for you, but they can't, it's not in the law at all.

558
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,220
Right.

559
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:53,680
You know what I mean?

560
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,140
They'll, they'll insist on that.

561
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,040
So you're doing stuff like I'm doing it without the Czech Republic or whatever,

562
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,500
you know, the Federation of Russia.

563
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,180
I did that.

564
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,680
Oh yeah, I did that.

565
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,440
Just ran the red light.

566
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,960
I just killed that guy, you know, who asked my sister, but I did it without.

567
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,580
The Federation of Russia, Russian Federation or whatever.

568
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,040
Okay.

569
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:14,420
Yeah.

570
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,760
There's no reason to argue because the music denying is right.

571
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,260
Okay.

572
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,620
So at that point, then they're going to look at your contracts.

573
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,580
Now, if you, most people go ahead, they get contracts, credit cards, bank

574
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,860
accounts, driver's license, all that stuff.

575
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:30,180
Right.

576
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,240
But at that point, if you're going to get into all these contracts, remember

577
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,940
these contracts and things are usually some kind of remuneration exchange of

578
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,160
money or something, right?

579
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,900
When you sign your name.

580
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,760
Now, personally, what I haven't signed my name in 20 years or so, because

581
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,600
every time I asked, they asked me to sign, I signed void and it looks like

582
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,640
a doctor's signature, a VO ID.

583
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,780
When I put a dot over the eye, but it looks like a signature.

584
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,020
I spread it out, you know,

585
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,980
and some people say, what kind of signature is that?

586
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,980
I said, I used to be a doctor, you know, whatever.

587
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,420
It's like, I said, Oh Lord, it looks like a doctor's signature.

588
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:04,760
Right.

589
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,000
Yeah.

590
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,640
But if I tell you, it says void, you look at it and you see the dot.

591
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,340
You're like, Oh yeah, I could see that.

592
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,360
Right.

593
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,660
Why would you sign it void?

594
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:13,960
Right.

595
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,120
Because everything on that, the paperwork that you're signing is

596
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,000
completely fictional and illegal.

597
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,380
Right.

598
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,400
But if you are going to sign the name, I, by the way, I had a lot of people

599
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,740
doing that and people going into courts and stuff and they said, Oh, I need

600
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:29,840
to see your signature because some people are signing that, but they shouldn't be

601
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,220
signing.

602
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,720
It's very powerful, by the way.

603
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:31,920
Right.

604
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:32,560
Yeah.

605
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:38,280
But you can sign your name and then put B E N E dot after that, which makes

606
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,280
you beneficiary.

607
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,240
Hmm.

608
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,220
Right.

609
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,620
So that means that if you're dealing with anyone who has your social security

610
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,020
number, by the way, in America, if you get a ticket of any kind of put social

611
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,740
security number right on top, that means they're the trustees, right?

612
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,740
I don't know if you've seen tickets, they do that.

613
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,460
Uh, and you're the beneficiary.

614
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,980
So let's say you run a red light and, uh, whatever, and they give you a ticket

615
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,480
for that.

616
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,840
You don't even need to know what the tickets for.

617
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,800
If they, in other words, if they have your social security number, you don't

618
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,880
have no right as a beneficiary or even care.

619
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,300
You shouldn't care what it's for at all.

620
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,600
Cause they already have your social security.

621
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,440
All you just need.

622
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,140
You said you need for me to approve this so you could get paid basically.

623
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,420
But you say it like that.

624
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,540
And they don't know what you're talking about.

625
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:20,780
Right.

626
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:21,320
Right.

627
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,980
So everything they do has to be for your benefit.

628
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,140
And I've seen this.

629
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,900
There was a guy a while back.

630
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,880
I was talking to legal stuff and, uh, driving without a license DUI, uh, back

631
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,360
on child support, blah, blah, blah, blah.

632
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,440
Finally, they got him.

633
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,220
He was in jail.

634
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,820
He's talking to me for years.

635
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,660
I was like, no, it's almost a year, six months out at the mining projects.

636
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,660
And, uh, judge reads out.

637
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,820
Well, I'm going to sentence you to this for this and this, for that, you know?

638
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,100
And he says, no, he said something like no or no.

639
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,620
I disagree.

640
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,300
And he goes, why?

641
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,620
He says, because I don't see how any of that will benefit me.

642
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,620
And the judge says, okay, let's dismiss it.

643
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,380
Then crazy, crazy.

644
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:00,780
Right.

645
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,880
So I'm not saying that'll work every time, but there's many other things.

646
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,620
So if you're the beneficiary and they're coming after your harm to harm you, and

647
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,400
you want it, you want to be, if you're sadomasochist, go ahead, take it, take

648
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,860
it, you know, some people like it.

649
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,100
So it was like Brendan, Joe Williams getting a giant cucumber up their ass.

650
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:19,340
Right.

651
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,140
So, uh, he's Mr.

652
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,580
Pickle or whatever, Mr.

653
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,060
Cucumber.

654
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,320
That's who's always saying, if you want a big cucumber jammed up your ass and

655
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,880
you're asking for it, who am I to tell you?

656
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,320
No, you shouldn't do that.

657
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,600
Right.

658
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,600
It's a free world, right?

659
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,200
Free country.

660
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,640
You're free human to do that.

661
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,020
Believe it or not.

662
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,180
Some people want to do that.

663
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,900
I've spoken to people with legals and no, I have to do what they say.

664
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,400
Okay.

665
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,480
All right.

666
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:46,060
Now it gets a little scary because if you read the Bible and one of the things in

667
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,680
Jeremiah, it says, when you look at their faces, you know, and they have these

668
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,960
horrible faces when you're talking to them, don't be afraid of them, you know?

669
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:53,840
Right.

670
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,780
So, um, just like the lady that was put in, she used to work for the IRS, the

671
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,360
black lady forgot her name, very famous case.

672
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,020
And before the jury went in, the bailiff stuck his door for deliberation.

673
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,320
Final says, well, I have to pay.

674
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,320
She has to pay.

675
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,280
So that's slave mentality, right?

676
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:16,280
It's over the IRS stuff, but she, again, hence she started becoming the moment

677
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,620
you are brought, if there's a social security number involved, it's your

678
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,780
number, let's say the number you were given to use and they, uh, they have it.

679
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,900
And they're asking you to make decisions.

680
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:33,300
Now you become like them, a trustee and that all caps name is, uh, is abandoned.

681
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,160
So let's say, for example, you've get dragged into court for anything.

682
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,700
And, um, they have a social security number.

683
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,100
How do you know?

684
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,720
Cause it's a ticket.

685
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,740
You see your name, they put it right on top hospitals, whatever.

686
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,140
They could just punch your name and address and they get it right.

687
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,460
It's access.

688
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,720
It's, it's not the NC, uh, uh, there's, this is another computer.

689
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,980
It's tied in with the NCIS or something.

690
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,700
Um, that the, what's the national criminal investigation

691
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,960
database or something?

692
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,160
Uh, everything's criminal too.

693
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,540
I mean, there's no criminal, everything's commercial, but they consider you to be a

694
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,060
criminal, uh, presumed presumably.

695
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,100
Um, but okay.

696
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:12,620
Where was I?

697
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:16,360
Oh, so they have the social security number when you're dealing with anyone

698
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:22,080
who has that, and you're asked to make a decision or abort fourth, any material

699
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,400
subject matter, and you start acting on that.

700
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,680
Now you become the trustee.

701
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,540
So where's the beneficiary?

702
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,240
Well, you're the only one who could be the beneficiary and they know that.

703
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,620
So now the funds and the bonds and all the stuff they draw drop

704
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,080
is registered as abandoned.

705
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,300
Because let's say, for example, you got Chuck Coachelli, you go into court and

706
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,620
you start, you have signed a B E N E.

707
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,640
So your benefits, you say you're a beneficiary, but then you start, but

708
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,240
how do you plead?

709
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,500
And you stop, you say, oh, I don't plead or plead or I did this.

710
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,160
I wasn't here.

711
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,440
Now you're acting like a trustee and they're going to treat you like a

712
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,200
trustee and that Chuck Coachelli with their social security number, the

713
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,800
beneficiary, when is he going to come in?

714
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:02,680
Never.

715
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,520
Because you, you already forfeited your position as a beneficiary, didn't

716
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:12,240
you, by arguing or defending or discussing any material matter.

717
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,960
Now you're your trustee.

718
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,560
Cause trustees supposed to the member of the car.

719
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,400
If you're a beneficiary, just get great me a car.

720
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,260
You don't need to know how much is in the trust or how much it costs.

721
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,100
Trustee does all that, right?

722
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,680
Of course you see.

723
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,060
So now you're acting like a trustee.

724
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,480
Where's the beneficiary, the Chuck Coachelli beneficiary.

725
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,500
What are the chances of the, another Chuck Coachelli showing

726
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,980
up as a beneficiary now?

727
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,140
Zero.

728
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:39,800
So all those bonds that were created, they put a 10 99 a on it, which is

729
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,440
abandonment acquisition of property.

730
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,940
And those are researchable too.

731
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,900
So the whole thing, what I would say is all this stuff that's put out all the

732
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,420
state of Texas, state of Arizona, state of Georgia, anything you do.

733
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,300
Okay.

734
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,180
So you violated this parole agreement.

735
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,380
So that's a different agreement.

736
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,560
You can go back, you can go back on that and say that you didn't know.

737
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,740
Now, you know, here's the law.

738
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,460
Um, you know what I mean?

739
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:10,860
That's a whole other discussion, how to undo those things, but you don't even

740
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,560
have to, now you're acting as a trustee if you do that, right?

741
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,219
Right.

742
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:19,000
So all you have to do is go find out the bond number.

743
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,540
It's going to take 180 days.

744
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,739
Now, 180 days to tell people they're like, Ooh, some people

745
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:23,699
don't know what that means.

746
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,960
What is 180 days, Chuck?

747
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,560
What does that mean?

748
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,219
Well, it's six months on the calendar.

749
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:28,540
Yeah.

750
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,560
Half a year.

751
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:29,840
Yeah.

752
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,340
It's a long time for some things, right?

753
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:31,600
Right.

754
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,960
But it comes quick.

755
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,719
So once you have that bond number and you say, uh, I need, now I need the

756
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:41,360
clerk's signature to release the royalties because you know, you have a hold on it.

757
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:43,380
Holy crap.

758
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,060
Have you heard of cases disappearing?

759
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:48,800
By the way, I, you know, I haven't seen it myself.

760
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,460
I I've heard you talk about it, but I haven't.

761
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:51,700
Yeah.

762
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,880
Well, someone says, well, I want to look it up.

763
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,260
I said, it's disappeared.

764
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,080
How are you going to look it up?

765
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,800
You go look it up.

766
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,940
And there's other people that brought this up too.

767
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,980
And he says, I remember that case and look it up and it's gone.

768
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,000
Nothing at all.

769
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,060
I mean, it gets wiped like men in black, you know, and they said, we're going to

770
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:10,620
wipe your, remember the movie and he's on a computer and you're deleting the.

771
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:11,680
Right.

772
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:11,940
Oh yeah.

773
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:12,920
Well, that's up.

774
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,400
They do that.

775
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,720
Rodney Dale class, a guy that I studied with years ago on this stuff.

776
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,920
He took it all the way to Supreme court and one, but the Supreme, when he was in

777
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,920
the federal court, the Supreme court sealed the case.

778
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,940
This is back in 2016, 2017.

779
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,240
It was over a gun carry.

780
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,980
Um, and you can look up Rodney Dale class Supreme court.

781
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,240
He won actually, uh, because in the attorneys, it's funny because the

782
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,160
attorneys didn't know any law.

783
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,160
They said, well, it's contract.

784
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:40,860
It's contract.

785
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:45,320
You got, you can vitiate the contract because it was thrown in jail to sign.

786
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:46,720
Right.

787
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,260
So when you show them that they're not following those things, we have a

788
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,740
contract, we have a contract, we have a contract.

789
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,420
If you say, uh, there's no contract to say, well, you have to follow the law.

790
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,760
You have to follow the law, follow the law.

791
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,660
They're really scumbags.

792
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,420
They're all of them.

793
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,460
Right.

794
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,520
So it's kind of like, well, they don't know.

795
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,400
Like, I know some of my sister's an attorney.

796
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,560
I told her she doesn't know any of this.

797
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,240
I said, it's perfect.

798
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,360
She's a perfect attorney.

799
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:06,500
Right.

800
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:06,980
Right.

801
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,560
It doesn't, you know, especially now.

802
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:14,920
Uh, also if you don't understand what I'm talking about, uh, there was a, uh,

803
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,800
okay, when you become a federal district judge, you kind of get spirited away and

804
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,480
they show you video, you know, like Starbucks, you or McDonald's, you, when

805
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,860
you're going to go work at McDonald's or Starbucks, they pay you and you sit for

806
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,140
a couple of days or one or two days.

807
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,660
I think, you know, when you watch videos on how to flip burgers or be a barista,

808
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,280
same with the federal judges.

809
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,980
They tell you when a case comes in, this is how you direct the case.

810
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,980
And if you, there was a video put on YouTube, uh, it's supposed to be private

811
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:46,300
for training federal judges, but someone put it up on YouTube quite a while ago

812
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,560
now, and I guess there's enough benefactors or white hats around the

813
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,460
state, leave it up there.

814
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,160
So people know what's going on, but most people won't understand

815
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,320
what they're talking about.

816
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:01,420
Um, when you're watching the video, the judge says, when you have a case like

817
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,440
this, this is how you use part of the law, right?

818
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,420
Cause you use part of the law.

819
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,340
Then you have to redefine the law to work for you.

820
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:08,520
Right.

821
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,480
Or it's Erie bound.

822
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,820
And then they'll say, well, this circumstances Erie bound.

823
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,700
And it's like, what the hell is Erie bound?

824
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,980
Well, in 1938, there was a famous case, this set of precedent

825
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,440
for what's called case law.

826
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,940
It was a famous case in 1938, and it was Tompkins versus Erie railroad.

827
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,620
And what happened was Mr.

828
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,120
Tompkins, when he was working as a supplier, he went on the

829
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,080
Erie railroad grounds and he got injured on the train grounds.

830
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,100
So he sued the company for being injured, but he lost the case because, uh, he

831
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,620
didn't have a contract to be there.

832
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,220
The attorneys for the Erie railroad said, well, we had no contract with him.

833
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,260
So, right.

834
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,200
We have no liability.

835
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,580
So everything that's when everything became, that's the

836
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,860
precedent for contract law.

837
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,100
So when you watch the, the, uh, tutoring for the federal judges and he says

838
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:06,480
that case is Erie bound, that means purely contract law and Erie bound means

839
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,020
referred to Tompkins versus Erie railroad.

840
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:13,880
I can give more, uh, other, but that's the most famous one that's cited.

841
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,620
So it makes sense.

842
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,700
If you find that video and you hear this old fart, uh, from Alabama

843
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,440
talking about Erie bound Tompkins versus Erie railroad, 1938.

844
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:30,540
So, so anyway, that's basically just to sum it up, cause it sounded like,

845
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,760
you know, in Greek speak fashion, I've went all over the place.

846
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,780
You're the beneficiary.

847
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,360
Anyone who has the source security number as a trustee and you're the

848
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,520
beneficiary, meaning no matter who they are, you have to agree that

849
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,980
anything they do is for your benefit.

850
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,100
Right.

851
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,360
Uh, the other thing is you're doing whatever you're doing without the

852
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,060
state of, or United States, whenever you see that, right.

853
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,560
State of Alaska, state of New York, all 50 of them or 55 of them.

854
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:55,800
Right.

855
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,520
Cause you got territories, right?

856
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,000
Right.

857
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,400
Uh, you're yeah.

858
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,840
I ran that red light, but I did it without the state of Texas.

859
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,280
Oh, he did.

860
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:07,600
The cop doesn't know the reason he's a cop is because he's dumb.

861
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:08,820
Right.

862
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,100
To these things.

863
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,520
Uh, there's a lot of cops, by the way, waking up to this stuff

864
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,480
and they're in a quandary, you know, they're like, Oh shit, what do I do?

865
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:17,960
Right.

866
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,180
So they're not so dumb, but they are dumb as a general group.

867
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,220
And I'm not saying this, uh, this comes from their own people.

868
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:27,140
They're their own, the heads of police say they're dumb.

869
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,620
You know, you know that.

870
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,440
I hope you know that.

871
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:29,620
Yeah.

872
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,060
They call them dumb.

873
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,540
The attorney generals call them dumb.

874
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,980
So this is not my opinion.

875
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,440
This is based on knowledge of what I've been observing within

876
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,580
their own internal structure fraternity.

877
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,780
He doesn't know, but eventually you get bumped around.

878
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,920
And also when you do this kind of stuff, you ever go to court or whatever, you

879
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,240
notice you, they always call you last, but I've gone in a couple of times

880
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,300
with people and myself that last actually they'll have the judge leave

881
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,540
the court and then come back in.

882
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,940
And so he signs when every time they leave, they have to come back in like a

883
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,180
ship, you sign in again, right?

884
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:01,660
Okay.

885
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,760
Uh, as if the court is not an order and stuff like that, really funky stuff.

886
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,940
And they never look at me or anyone I'm with.

887
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,160
They always look down at the bench.

888
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,240
They, and they start reading things off before you even approach the bar.

889
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,360
They start reading things up and they look down the whole time.

890
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:20,460
Like, like, uh, uh, eight year old, uh, for cookies, uh, it's got the cookies,

891
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:20,680
right?

892
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,160
He ate the cookies where the wizard, the cat that ate the bird.

893
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:23,700
Right.

894
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,060
Right.

895
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,700
Always an area.

896
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,660
So just mind that stuff.

897
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,840
But the whole thing about the court thing, you shouldn't even have to be there.

898
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,480
Um, but everything you're doing is without the state of it's all corporate

899
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:39,260
contract government, and they got the whole world believing that it's

900
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:43,880
geographic and it's not, you could find that out basically by looking at, uh,

901
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:47,280
UCC uniform commercial code, start searching their searches.

902
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,140
You can do, um, state of whatever, all of the revised constitutions of the

903
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:59,360
states, uh, are, they are revised and separate from the original

904
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,760
constitutions of the states.

905
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,260
Now, some of the original constitutions of the state, they do give

906
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,580
meets and bounds geographic.

907
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:05,920
Right.

908
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,540
But when you get to the revised section, you'll notice, then they talk about,

909
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,860
you know, it's, it's on top of that, right?

910
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,100
So you can use both.

911
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:18,960
So for example, in Arizona, it's Arizona territory or Arizona state.

912
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,780
And I think it was 1928 or 32.

913
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,500
They put in state of Arizona, which is the corporation, right?

914
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,600
Same with Georgia, same California.

915
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,640
Uh, I said, uh, you know, what's on the flag of California, the state of

916
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,360
California is the corporation, but what's on the flag, what does it say?

917
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,200
California Republic.

918
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,460
There is a, there is right.

919
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,880
If you pull up the flag of California, it's the bear.

920
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,640
It says California Republic, right?

921
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,740
They say, no, you're a 14th amendment citizen, which is another thing, but the

922
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:55,280
whole thing is to know who you are and who you are is this, you're a peaceful

923
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,520
inhabitant that just so happens to be stuck in a country and a world where

924
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,060
nothing can be paid for.

925
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,940
The only debtor in the whole country is the United States, meaning it's a

926
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,180
corporation, federal corporation in the district of Columbia.

927
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,020
So you can go to the district Columbia and walk around all day and ask people,

928
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,040
where's the United States?

929
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,920
Cause the code says it's in here.

930
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,700
No one knows.

931
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:20,900
There is one code that the only rights that United States citizen has is to

932
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:25,540
visit the district of Columbia by permission or from, by, by and from

933
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:30,640
permission of the boards of the board of directors, not Congress or the

934
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,000
president.

935
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,160
Or so I never heard of a board of directors.

936
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:33,880
The United States, have you?

937
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:34,940
I don't know where they are.

938
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:35,700
Yeah.

939
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,240
Nobody.

940
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:36,600
Yeah.

941
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:36,820
Right.

942
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,140
Okay.

943
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,220
It's like the mobsters, right?

944
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,040
The only reason we know where the mobsters are is from watching the

945
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,020
godfather, right?

946
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:43,720
Yeah.

947
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,880
So, uh, oh, you know what I mean?

948
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,300
It's the same racket, but this is really horrible.

949
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,040
So that every country has one debtor.

950
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,140
It's your federal government.

951
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,660
So, right.

952
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,800
So all, everything going on outside is all based on misunderstanding.

953
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:02,540
Uh, and the part, by the way, again, you're in Georgia, you J walking and

954
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:04,000
the cop wants to give you a ticket.

955
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:07,640
He will tell you in the state of Georgia, he will confer nationality of

956
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,200
the state of Georgia on you right there.

957
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,500
He'll tell you state of Georgia.

958
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,380
You notice that when they read the chart, they read, they have to say

959
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:17,140
state of Georgia, state of Alaska, state of New York, always do that.

960
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:17,420
Right.

961
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:21,620
And at that point, I said, yeah, I ran over that woman with the

962
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:26,700
stroller and I J walked, but I did it without the state of Georgia when I did

963
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,720
that and they don't know, but when you get into the higher part, they're

964
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,880
gonna say, oh shit, we're busted.

965
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,900
Just ignore him, but you're also the beneficiary.

966
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,400
So right.

967
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,240
Anything they do has to be to your benefit.

968
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,900
Now, if they say we're going to stick 14 cucumbers up your ass and say, yeah,

969
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,740
I like that, well, go for it then.

970
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,220
I can't tell you, you shouldn't do that.

971
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:47,460
Right.

972
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,160
Right.

973
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,280
But that's really like, well, I was just saying to Jason, basically, that's what

974
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,700
he said, they gave me a big cut.

975
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,240
Told me how to stick cucumber up my ass.

976
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,380
I did it.

977
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:56,340
Right.

978
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,100
And I said, fine, I'm not going to say, you know, uh, but he doesn't know what I

979
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:06,980
said, and I don't think he he's in a different direction, but this stuff that

980
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,860
I just talked about tonight is very important because if it just from a

981
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,920
matter of principle, there's over 6 million people in jail or in parole in

982
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,740
the United States.

983
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:22,420
And, um, there's fewer than 10 million people in prison and jail in the whole

984
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:22,840
world.

985
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,680
So that means that if you took whoever's in prison in the whole world, added it

986
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,060
up, it's about just what's in the United States.

987
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,840
We have, in other words, 50% of the prisoners and people in the quote unquote

988
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,440
justice system in the world are in the U.S.

989
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:37,780
Right.

990
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:42,060
That's disproportionate because there were not even 5% of the world's

991
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:42,680
population.

992
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:43,260
Yeah.

993
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:44,280
Right.

994
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:49,780
So you have 10 times more, 10 to 15 times more chances if you're in the U.S.

995
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,880
So that's why it's important.

996
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:52,700
It's no longer personal preference because.

997
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:53,620
Right.

998
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,080
So that's how I see it.

999
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,080
But there's so many ways to go around it.

1000
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,700
Uh, you're not going around it.

1001
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,520
You're dealing with it head on and you're dealing with a level of ignorance that

1002
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,860
is so high, but that it's just, it's cosmic.

1003
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,960
You can't imagine that no one knows this.

1004
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:10,700
It's so simple.

1005
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:16,580
The other thing that you can do that works, which is interesting is they, you

1006
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,380
go into court.

1007
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,000
I'm just as sure.

1008
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:21,480
There's 10 ways to do this, but the easiest way, if you go into a court or

1009
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,400
deal with them, you ask the prosecutor, do you serve justice?

1010
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:25,640
Oh yeah.

1011
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:30,240
You know, I try to, um, the judge, do you serve justice?

1012
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:30,520
Yes.

1013
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,020
We're here to serve justice, son.

1014
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,280
Ask the clerk, do you serve justice?

1015
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,640
Yeah, I think so.

1016
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,520
How dare you bring me into a pagan temple?

1017
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,500
I'm Jewish or I'm Muslim or I'm Christian.

1018
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,540
How dare you bring me into a, you know what I mean?

1019
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,760
Into a pagan temple.

1020
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,820
Because when you serve, you know, that's a, that's a religious term, by the way.

1021
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:54,420
Right.

1022
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:58,180
This is, you know, you know, I think title 42 has got a whole bunch of stuff about

1023
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,480
religious oppression, right?

1024
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,040
I think it's title 42.

1025
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:06,080
That has that, you know, it's like, uh, uh, uh, obfuscation of rights under the

1026
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:11,840
color of law, you know, is it, uh, 1940 title it's title 42 stuff.

1027
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,500
You know, in other words, there's a whole slew of codes that, um, if you are

1028
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,380
forced to practice a religion, it's a, it's a quote unquote against their law.

1029
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:20,960
Right.

1030
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,080
You could find them.

1031
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,040
The title 42 is most likely where you'll find that.

1032
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,400
Um, so that is the, that is another thing, right?

1033
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,360
There's so many ways, but the whole, the only thing you're not going to escape is

1034
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,400
that it's all legal fiction.

1035
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:40,740
It's all bullshit done by people of poor character, attorneys, doctors, accountants.

1036
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:45,420
These are people of poor character, you know, because anyone of good character

1037
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:49,620
will have a, uh, itching feeling inside of them that something is wrong with what

1038
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:50,140
I'm doing.

1039
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,240
Right.

1040
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,680
And they start to re-examine it.

1041
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:52,960
Right.

1042
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:53,460
Right.

1043
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:59,940
So, uh, yeah, the attorney doctors, you only need 10% of the population that are

1044
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:02,220
doctors to do emergency stuff.

1045
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,700
And even that they don't know what they're doing.

1046
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,460
They just do it.

1047
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,280
Right.

1048
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:09,100
Uh, it's so funny how the people sit in the emergency room for three, four hours

1049
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:12,060
where you could have done compression and a few other things.

1050
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:14,900
And actually within that time, have it 60% healed.

1051
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,220
Right.

1052
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:17,220
It doesn't matter what it is.

1053
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:22,840
Um, uh, but if you need parts, like, you know, if you have a, you know, like blood

1054
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,640
transfusion or an organ or something, it's a little more difficult to do on

1055
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,860
yourself, but with attorneys, you don't need any attorneys at all.

1056
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,360
Just some for some corporate stuff.

1057
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,020
If everybody knew what's going on.

1058
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:32,300
Right.

1059
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:36,340
So there's so many, this is the level of redundancy that is horrific.

1060
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:36,920
Horrific.

1061
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,100
Um, yeah, I don't know.

1062
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:43,700
I don't know how else to put it, but, uh, that was the, that was a pretty long

1063
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:49,880
explanation, but then that's the simple part because you see, everyone is, is

1064
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,820
wondering, um, whatever happened to the, you know, the sitcom, what a sitcom is

1065
00:47:54,820 --> 00:48:00,540
usually 30 minutes or the star Trek situational dramas, or let's say one hour.

1066
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,780
Uh, they go through a whole situation.

1067
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,220
It's the show's going to be over in five minutes.

1068
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,460
And then in the last five minutes, they fix everything.

1069
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:07,680
Right.

1070
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:08,260
And then it's over.

1071
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:08,540
Right.

1072
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,320
That they got that sitcom mentality.

1073
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,360
And, uh, that doesn't work that way.

1074
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:16,580
You're going to have to spend to learn more about what I'm saying.

1075
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,120
You're gonna have to spend anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour a day

1076
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,300
for a good part of a year.

1077
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,180
You have that time.

1078
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,560
It's just a matter of making it.
