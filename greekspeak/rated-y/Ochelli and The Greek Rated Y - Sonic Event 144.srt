1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:18,240
Rated Y, Sonic Event 144, and here we are in that month that they allegedly call September

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,520
on the Pope's work schedule, but that is not the topic of tonight's discussion.

3
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,790
Greek, what is the topic and what is the really special surprise we have

4
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:34,440
on this particular event, I should say? Yeah, it's always a surprise, but we,

5
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,720
as we mentioned in the chat about a week ago, we have Dmitry Kholosov with us tonight,

6
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:48,800
and it's early morning for him. And if people are, I think most people already listening to

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:56,420
Greek-speak are very familiar with Dmitry's disclosures from myself promoting his work.

8
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:04,640
And maybe when we start, Dmitry, let us know, Dmitry, for someone who's listening for the

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,300
first time, where can they quickly go, so while they're listening, if they're not in a car driving

10
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:16,800
or something, to find you, where would you like them to go? What do you mean? Like on the internet.

11
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:27,500
I have a YouTube channel and I have a website where all my other links are published, so you

12
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:34,760
just can give them my website. Yes, if you like, I can read them. Say hello to everyone. Yes,

13
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,440
hello, Dmitry. Yeah, you just did. So because it may be if someone is listening that they don't

14
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:46,440
know who you are, they can go immediately before we start speaking. But I think you're

15
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:53,940
pretty famous in this circle here. So hello, and how are you? Give us a brief, whatever you want

16
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:59,320
to say before we dig into things. No, I'm okay. Thank you so much. I live in Bangkok, Thailand,

17
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:10,080
and now it's nine o'clock in the morning, so it's not too early. Okay, great. We always wanted to,

18
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,260
we have some shared contacts from back in the days with the Veterans Today people,

19
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:21,460
and that's when I found out about you around 2011 or so. And ever since then,

20
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:28,040
I try to recollect on my end what the disclosure of the nuclear demolition, because I was in New

21
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:36,340
York City all my life, but I was not in Tucson, Arizona since 1999. But I have a lot of context

22
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:43,340
there. So I kept digging into just people who witnessed it and other things from being in the

23
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:49,960
building trade, like white-collar construction, and piecing things together to validate

24
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,460
all of the things that you brought up. But we had some questions, by the way. Again,

25
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,360
there's no reason to go over from the beginning all of your things, but some people were asking,

26
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:09,760
you might have addressed it in a recent video, Dimitri. These devices are placed as fixtures for

27
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,660
nuclear demolition and skyscrapers, not just posthumously in the World Trade Center, but also

28
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:23,120
many other structures throughout the world, also, if they're crazy enough to do it in a civilian

29
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,400
environment. And do you think they've been taken down since 9-11? Because maybe the people working

30
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,180
there are saying, oh, maybe they're really going to do it? Do you have any information you could

31
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:41,000
share on that? Okay, from the beginning, when I was still in the Soviet military,

32
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:51,040
that was at the end of the 80s, I heard, or I learned, I mean, that under the World Trade Center

33
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:59,740
twin towers, there was such a nuclear demolition scheme. But I have never heard about any other

34
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,980
building, only about these two towers. And the building 7, by that time, was not even built yet.

35
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:13,960
But when I published my first version of research on that, it was, I think, in 2007,

36
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:24,360
or maybe earlier, 2008, a lot of people began to contact me, and they want to disclose some

37
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:31,800
information that they knew. And from these people, I learned a lot of new things.

38
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,940
So first of all, I learned from them, why actually that thing was there in the first place,

39
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:43,060
because before I had no explanation why that kind of thing should be under the buildings.

40
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:50,220
So from some people who contacted me from America, I learned that it was because of the

41
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,880
requirements of the building code of New York, and some other cities,

42
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,520
that the Department of Building cannot issue permission to build a skyscraper,

43
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:10,680
unless the developer provides an explanation, a workable explanation, how it's going to be

44
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:19,520
demolished in the future. Because the twin towers were the first

45
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,080
steel buildings in the world. Because prior to that, the buildings were made from bricks

46
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:32,760
and concrete, so they could be demolished by ordinary explosives. But the twin towers were

47
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,980
first steel buildings in the world, so they didn't know how to demolish them. And because

48
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,360
in the mid-60s, the nuclear explosions were fashionable, not evil yet, like now.

49
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,360
And also I learned from some people who contacted me then,

50
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:05,400
that there were similar nuclear demolition devices under the Sears Tower in Chicago,

51
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:13,380
and under the United Nations building in New York. That is for sure. And also I heard

52
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:23,020
that there were some other skyscrapers in America, but not many of them, maybe two or three more.

53
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,520
And what is most interesting, I also learned from people who contacted me from Japan,

54
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,960
that in Japan, under some buildings, there were also nuclear demolition devices

55
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,920
that were managed by the Americans. And in some buildings in the United Arab Emirates,

56
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,900
and in the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. That's what I learned.

57
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:55,680
And what I learned also, that after the disaster on 9-11, because that nuclear demolition turned

58
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,320
to be a real disaster, all these kinds of things were removed from everywhere, and

59
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,320
the information of that was completely classified. That's what I know. So I

60
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,480
believe now that there are no more such things under any building in the world.

61
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:22,600
I see. Dmitry, at the beginning, I took note that you stated you were in the Soviet military,

62
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,320
and then you started talking about where you heard things. So what I didn't understand at

63
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:33,860
beginning is, do you mean that you learned some of this through your military experience,

64
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,760
or is it just coincidental that you were in the military? In other words, was this information

65
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:44,480
available to the Soviet military as far as you knew, or did you learn this in a civilian capacity?

66
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:52,000
No, I learned that in the military capacity, because I used to serve in the Soviet Special

67
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,500
Control Service, which is the organization that detects nuclear explosions.

68
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:05,480
Right. He goes through this in his video. Yeah, I just wanted to get a little snapshot.

69
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:11,380
And while serving there, I just knew about the nuclear demolition scheme of the Twin Towers

70
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:19,920
in New York only. You were in a control service, Director, at 12. I think when you do the

71
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,640
long first video that you then modified later, you give a good background on that. That's why,

72
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,300
again, I started off with whoever hears from you for the first time, they should invest the four

73
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:36,360
hours at least. It seems like a long time for Americans. They're used to sitcoms half hour,

74
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:43,220
right? No, they're not used to four hour. So I recommend they go and listen to that before here.

75
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:49,460
True. But I just want a snapshot of the of the initial contact, because I heard from I heard

76
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,420
from various things there and I wanted to get the initial idea. Then how did those other contacts

77
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,940
occur where you were contacted from other places? Was that in the military capacity as well?

78
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:07,200
Or did that emerge after you started making these statements? And therefore, people started

79
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:14,220
to contact you to snowball your your sort of discussion and make it grow. I was wondering

80
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,040
about that, if that's the way that that occurred or if it was still military. He answered that.

81
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:24,200
Yeah, he answered. Yes, it was much later because because I learned about the nuclear demolition

82
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:32,860
devices under the Twin Towers in New York in like in the end of the 80s. So a long time ago,

83
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:39,840
there was like 12 years before 9-11. But my first research on that was published in 2007.

84
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:47,660
And I discharged from the military in 1991. So it has nothing to do with my military service anymore.

85
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,120
Yes. I just wanted to see where the separation was, because I wasn't clear on that. My apologies,

86
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,800
Greek. I just want to be clear. And I think this should be with with clarity, because this is

87
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,340
fascinating. We're talking about and if you don't understand the different directorates,

88
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:06,520
the listener that is, you should also take a little bit of background study and understand

89
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:12,300
what he is talking about as far as who he's working for at that time, because it is it is

90
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:18,020
something that not every American is certainly read in on regarding this. So I wanted to point

91
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:24,480
that out as well. So, Dimitri, this is fascinating. Please continue about the nuclear devices. And you

92
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,260
said that as of today, you would say that they do not currently exist. But but what do you have

93
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:40,860
any idea about the initiation of that program? Is there a difference in its true origin? And say,

94
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,100
when the Soviets learned about it, were they behind the curve, so to speak? Or was it something

95
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:54,840
newly discovered? Are you aware of that? No, it was not newly discovered, because I believe that

96
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:03,540
in the 70s, it was not even a secret knowledge. I think many people knew about that in the 70s.

97
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:10,460
So they just try to hide this now. But I think if we if we have a time back machine, and we

98
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,400
appear today in the 70s, I think we will find this information easily. And it was not even

99
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,240
classified. I mean, about the nuclear demolition of the buildings. See, Americans? Yes.

100
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,620
I don't know the big deal, though. Americans would certainly find it fascinating that this

101
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:32,220
was an open secret is what you're basically saying. And as far as most Americans are concerned,

102
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,100
no, it wasn't because this is, you know, way out there. There was nuclear devices literally

103
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,340
in the buildings. That's it. You know, that is something, you know, I'm just saying it's one of

104
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:48,860
the things that stem from Project Plowshare. If you study that, yeah, there's plenty of released

105
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:54,020
videos right now. And one thing, Dimitri, there's some people that don't understand,

106
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,740
again, if they watch your videos, they'll understand about how the mechanism works.

107
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:04,820
You know, it's not that we've been brainwashed only with atmospheric nuclear detonation,

108
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,740
never what happens when it's underground or underwater. But I would suggest people look

109
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:15,960
at there's a video been released, military video, declassified, where they blow,

110
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:24,140
I think it was thermonuclear underwater in the early 60s. And you can see as the wave passes

111
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:29,060
over the water, the battleship actually disintegrates, turns to dust and collapses

112
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,960
also. So that effect also happens on the water. So there's a lot of information. And Project

113
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:41,020
Plowshare was promoted for mining and many other things as a good thing, because it was very cheap

114
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:47,700
and very fast to do. So it wasn't much of a secret. And really, but I want to share a few

115
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,240
things with you, Dimitri, and maybe get your response, if that's okay, things that I found

116
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:59,360
on my research. So, everybody's still here, I hope. Yeah. Yes, I am. Okay, Dimitri. I believe

117
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,500
so. Yeah. All right. I don't hear Dimitri, but that's fine. Yeah, I'm here. Okay.

118
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,620
I was waiting. Okay. Well, the statement is like, when let's go.

119
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,840
Let's say from this point of view, in the 1980s, in the middle of the 1980s, I worked as a draftsman

120
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:24,040
internship, engineering company, Amman and Whitney. And that was the time where they had

121
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,540
draftsmen going there 24 hours a day, because they had to update drawings on the Statue of

122
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:34,260
Liberty restoration, right. So we had going in at one in the morning working till five drawing,

123
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,840
this is before computers. So one of the old engineers in a wheelchair asked me,

124
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:45,280
this is around 1985 86, I believe. He asked me what I did when I'm not drafting, you know,

125
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,640
guy so young, what are you doing here in the middle of the night, you know, I said, Well,

126
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,040
if I'm not here, I'm riding my bicycle down by the World Trade Center, you know, and he says,

127
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,440
don't don't go there. They have nukes in those buildings, he said to me. So at that point,

128
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,260
that stuck in my head. And I was like, Oh, this guy is like a crazy senile old man, right.

129
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:08,200
And at the time, I was propaganda is I didn't understand because we were told about the

130
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,220
nuclear core being a ball. And I thought it was in that bronze sculpture that they had in the

131
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:19,180
courtyard or something hiding something like James Bond movie or something. I had no idea of that.

132
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:27,000
And then later on in life, I had experience working with what's called the Port Authority,

133
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,260
which those buildings were under. And I found out that the Port Authority has its own authority,

134
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:40,040
its own jurisdiction separate from the rest of the country. So even a federal, let's say agency

135
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,800
comes in there, they have to get permission to do anything with the Port Authority. And the other

136
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:52,460
thing I found out from being around nuclear engineers, when you say what is the biggest,

137
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:58,920
baddest agency, American agency, they usually people say, some kind of intelligence agency,

138
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,380
like CIA or something like that. But I found out from speaking with nuclear engineers,

139
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,080
it's the Department of Energy is the most powerful agency in the United States regarding these things.

140
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,860
Also from a commander, someone who worked as a nuclear engineer, a nuclear submarine that was

141
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:22,280
armed with nuclear warheads. When the anyone a low ranking person from the Department of Energy came

142
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,480
in, even the commander of the submarine was at attention, they were very much afraid of these

143
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,300
guys. So I started piecing all of this information together to see how it all you know, in other

144
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:38,080
words, you can get information from many areas. But if you don't know, specifically that they

145
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:45,260
were brought down and basically vaporized, because the there were also videos that I found where they

146
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:51,100
interviewed some doctors about survivors. And back then, and one of the interviews, the doctor

147
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,080
says, imagine being near a nuclear bomb. That's what happened to the people in the building. So

148
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,680
they actually knew there were many, many, I would say 1000s of people that knew about this, if not

149
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:07,100
many hundreds, and it's still quiet. No one has pieced it together like you have. So it's more of

150
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:13,900
a statement I want to make than a question. Because what you did you especially with your

151
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:19,500
anthology, the four hour video, you pieced it all together. So if you watch that, there's really very

152
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,860
few questions, right? Because of all the information you provided. But if anyone has experiences, let's

153
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,120
say, like the ones I mentioned, if you were paying attention, you can see how plausible it is, you

154
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,320
know, you can we see the signs, but we don't know all the specifics. So there was not a question,

155
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:42,520
it was a statement. And one more statement, Dimitri was speaking to people that lived in New Jersey,

156
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:50,180
downwind, where the wind was across the Hudson River, weeks and weeks after the catastrophe,

157
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,840
the people living there were calling the environmental agencies saying that smell,

158
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,940
we have a very bad smell. And the environmental agency would ask like smells like what and they

159
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:05,079
said, like electrical fire. And they say, well, there was a lot of electrical wires in the

160
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:09,780
building. That's why it smells that way. But from speaking to people that were in that area at the

161
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:16,260
same time, they said the smell was very acrid, like very high smell of ionization, like ozone,

162
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:23,160
like burning electrical wires. And I also researched that. And I found that the military

163
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,180
that went to Hiroshima to clean up if you read a lot of their books and letters that they wrote

164
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:34,780
in Japan, even though it was a surface device, they also had the same thing, they couldn't stand

165
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:40,560
the smell. So all of these things put together with your work, for me, makes me feel like,

166
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:46,940
you know, this is a complete almost story, you know, people I knew in Jersey City, in fact,

167
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:53,920
because I was in New Jersey, as I stated before, did report the most common word used was ozone,

168
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,960
burning ozone is what they would say. And that's what they described it as. And we also experienced

169
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:08,760
that dust that really caked windows and cars and all kinds of things just across the river in

170
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:16,080
Jersey City, Bayonne, various parts there that are just across the Hudson Creek. So I was one of those

171
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:23,870
people. Yeah, also for Dimitri, we want him to speak more. But who was that stewardess that you

172
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:32,250
spoke to? What was her name? She used an alias, but whatever. Rebecca. Yeah. Have you ever heard

173
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:41,110
of Rebecca Roth? Dimitri? Yes, I could. But without any details. Okay, her details was that

174
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:47,010
her main platform was, there's no way that an airplane can go through a building like a hot

175
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:53,030
knife and butter. There's no air. There's no way there were airplanes. Yeah. And she was a stewardess.

176
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:58,090
Yeah, she had many new people internally in the airplane companies and had access to some data

177
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:05,810
that was collected. That's most likely classified after she got it. And one of the things was two of

178
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:10,750
the things was many people wrote affidavits, or were calling the authority saying there's going

179
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:16,450
to be an error that morning, an airplane crash because they saw American Airlines planes flying

180
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:23,190
at treetop level. And so those she suggests that those planes were flown and landed,

181
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:29,530
at least some of them at Westover Air Force Base in Massachusetts, because it has a 10,000 foot

182
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:35,030
runway, and it's less than 20 minutes away from New York City. So more than one plane was seen

183
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:39,690
on that route. The interesting thing that she found out also by investigating this,

184
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:46,430
on September 10, everyone on the military base was ordered to stay in hotels.

185
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:53,770
Right. So very interesting, right? Correlation. That's basically the crux of her work. And

186
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:59,830
there's no way that airplanes could have gone through what the no airplanes basically was the

187
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:05,190
idea from her. A few other details about her just just for the record is that she was also a what

188
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:10,230
they call a purser. And she had other responsibilities outside of being a stewardess.

189
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:16,110
And she familiarized many people with various things like the procedures that would have

190
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:21,550
occurred under certain circumstances, if there was a hijacking, etc, and all that.

191
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,450
And she revealed a whole bunch of interesting details there that,

192
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:31,170
quite frankly, you never heard, despite the fact you had heard from stewardesses and things,

193
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:38,350
she gave a different level of information. And it's really fascinating. I spoke to her

194
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:43,330
several times about it. She wrote three books that I recall about it. Yeah. Plus,

195
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:49,470
very little left online, I think from her. But yeah, in other words, her work,

196
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,530
combined with Dimitri's work, she doesn't understand she has a very slave mentality.

197
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,070
She doesn't understand the money system or the oligarchy and things like that. So

198
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:02,950
she might make statements that seem like, you know, you can change the world, right?

199
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:10,470
Which is not possible. So. Right. So if you don't mind, I can maybe correct something.

200
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:17,650
Please do. What I what I understood from your explanation that she she suggests that the

201
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:24,410
two passenger planes that supported to penetrate the steel twin towers were in fact,

202
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:31,310
diverted to some military base. Yes, that's correct. Yes. Okay. But in my in my opinion,

203
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:39,190
according to my research, it was not so. Because if they really did this, that will be too many

204
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:46,290
people involved. And after that, they have to get dispose of the huge planes and there will be a lot

205
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:53,270
of witnesses in the military. I think it's not it's not the proper way to do. So what I found,

206
00:21:53,270 --> 00:22:00,050
according to my research, is that the both planes that were supposedly hijacked were diverted to the

207
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:11,230
Atlantic Ocean and they fell into water and they sunk at great depth. That is that is almost certain

208
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:21,190
because the first the first American fighter jets that were sent to intercept the hijacked planes

209
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:28,670
were didn't fly towards the New York. They flew towards the Atlantic Ocean. And this one is very

210
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:34,250
obvious because that is recorded in all official documents. And there was a lot of critics at the

211
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:39,770
initial stage. You remember, maybe they criticized the US military for just stupidity, why they send

212
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:45,570
the aircraft over Atlantic Ocean. But in fact, they were planes that were flying towards the

213
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:52,670
Atlantic Ocean. So that's everything. And there was information that transponders of the two

214
00:22:52,670 --> 00:23:00,490
planes that were supposedly penetrating the Twin Towers were still transmitting signals from

215
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:08,510
underwater in the Atlantic for some time before the batteries died out. So that's what I know.

216
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:12,550
Well, from the standing, I didn't know about the transponder. That's great. Also,

217
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:16,630
they cannot use missiles because of the transponder, they have to use cannon fire.

218
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:25,090
From the standpoint of, you know, intelligence and the control of the after, you know, the after

219
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:31,370
action. This makes a whole lot more sense, actually, because you have the ability for containment,

220
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,890
you know, it's a generalized term, but you're able to contain a great many more aspects doing

221
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:42,170
it the way that Dimitri describes it here. Which just, you know, simple logic should tell you that

222
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:48,170
but that's what the military does. They like blowing things up. And yeah, being very terminated

223
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:53,250
was called termination with extreme prejudice. Yeah. Right. And it also there's nothing else.

224
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:58,790
Also, if you can simultaneously remove things from the scene, so they're taken out of sight,

225
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:05,970
and also completely remove them from any discovery afterwards, you know, that would

226
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:11,470
sink to the ocean, you're never going to see it again. It very simple. That's just the more

227
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:19,850
efficient way to dispose of evidence. I mean, also, I want to get with Dimitri, it's not just

228
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:27,730
Dimitri's research and expose on the on the 911 catastrophe disaster, but how they're using,

229
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:34,770
let's say, micro and mini nukes through these supposedly terror events that they called a car

230
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:42,750
bomb, like Volgodonsk in Russia, right? The Chechen rebels, right? And also in Arabia, Saudi Arabia,

231
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:49,170
the Lebanon and places like that. So any more information about that, Dimitri?

232
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:59,010
Yes. There were quite a few so called car bombings. I mean, that they were reported to public as a car

233
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:05,970
bombing, some of them suicidal. But in reality, this was just a cover up for the explosions of

234
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:12,170
the mini nukes that were hidden somewhere underground, probably in some pipeline.

235
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:24,450
The well known ones are bombing of the US Marines in Beirut, Lebanon.

236
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,550
Ah, the Marine Barracks.

237
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:31,950
That was one of the well known ones. And the place, by the way, was called Ground Zero

238
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,930
also by that time.

239
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,070
Yeah, I actually want to ask you about that term, Dimitri.

240
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:43,630
I was going to ask you about that term, actually, right there, Ground Zero,

241
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:50,570
because this became the commonplace term with the media. And indeed, the site in New York City

242
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:57,410
was then named Ground Zero. And many people have said that is the most obvious revelation that

243
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:03,950
comes from this construct, because they are showing you that that is the term used for the

244
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:10,450
position where nuclear detonation occurs. Ground Zero. Very simple. They're telling you this

245
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,390
directly, in fact, in public, right?

246
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:19,050
If it's used in a technical in a technical way, but the culture has adopted that term now for

247
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,170
many things.

248
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:32,170
Yes, but let me correct it, because before 1991, before 2001, before the end of the year 2001,

249
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:38,650
all American dictionaries, big or small, actually small dictionaries usually do not include Ground

250
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:43,950
Zero, but some of them, but the big ones, like an abridged dictionary, all of them

251
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:52,510
have a definition of Ground Zero as a place of the nuclear explosion, or its projection onto

252
00:26:52,510 --> 00:27:00,990
the Earth's surface. No other meaning, absolutely not. So all additional meanings, like figurative

253
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:08,270
or colloquial or extra meanings, were ascribed to the Ground Zero term only after 2002.

254
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:16,650
And this was a great effort by the US government, which ordered all dictionaries to be reprinted

255
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:23,170
with updated definition of Ground Zero. So now, because they were caught red-handed with that

256
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:28,010
single definition, and if you imagine what can happen if someone complains about the nuclear

257
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:33,730
demolition in the court, and they bring some English on abridged dictionary, which is admissible

258
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:41,150
evidence in the court, and say, look, if they call a spot of World Trade Center a place for

259
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:47,110
nuclear explosion, then it is. So they had to modify the definition of Ground Zero since then.

260
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:54,130
So from 2002, and mostly from 2003, they began to reprint all English dictionaries

261
00:27:54,790 --> 00:28:02,410
with expanded definition of Ground Zero. So they ascribed from 2 to 7 different new meanings to

262
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:06,950
this Ground Zero term, trying just to dissolve the original meaning.

263
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:15,950
Interesting. I want to make a correction. One thing we speak here for many, many episodes here,

264
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:22,070
Dmitry, is I can tell you specifically for the United States, we were supposed to have

265
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:27,030
three branches of government when you said court, you know, the legislative, the executive,

266
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:32,570
and the judicial with the courts. And the whole world has followed this, but in 1938,

267
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:38,230
they dissolved. There's no more judicial courts, even in the rest of the world. If you look at

268
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:44,950
what they call the judicial system, whether Russia, Iraq, anywhere, it's run by the attorney

269
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:50,250
generals, which is part of the executive branch, and it's confirmed by the legislative, and very

270
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:57,850
little court is left. Everything is basically military tribunal now. So no court will take

271
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:03,830
anything unless it's to benefit them. It's all biased. So what we're doing here, we can say

272
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:08,650
we're a judicial court, and we're having court right now is better than anything that we can get

273
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:14,910
from the authorities, because they have eliminated the judicial branch, except for some Supreme

274
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:21,090
Court justices that sit there, which is not even really a court. It's an appellate court. And you

275
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:26,430
see, it's not a court of record again. So one of the things that most people are under the illusion

276
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:33,310
that we have a judiciary in the world, no more, it's all executive. That's why you cannot go,

277
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:39,350
there's many people that have tried to do things like that, in minor, and they always get kicked

278
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:45,070
out. There's no more of that system. So that's part of that, you want to call it new world order

279
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:50,650
or whatever. It's very surreptitious. They've done most of the biggest changes in our society in front

280
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:55,910
of us, and we still call it what it used to be, almost like the way they changed ground zero

281
00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:03,070
definition. I just wanted to bring that, because I know you also helped out Victor Boot

282
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:09,190
in legal proceedings. Let's just call them legal proceedings, and you see what they do.

283
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:22,470
Yes. But to correct this, I would say that even before that time, the courts used to look like

284
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:28,690
more neutral, but they were not completely neutral even before, because all judiciary in

285
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:36,270
a sovereign state delivers judgment in the name of the sovereign. For example, the US courts

286
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:43,250
deliver judgments in the name of the United States, obviously. The courts in Russia, they deliver

287
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:51,050
judgments under the name of the Russian Federation. The courts in some kingdoms deliver judgments

288
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:58,410
under the name of His Majesty the King. So from this point of view, the judiciary is always under

289
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:06,930
the sovereign. So they cannot deliver judgments that are against sovereign, and you also cannot

290
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:13,890
bring to the court illegal suits that are against sovereign, because they judge in the name of the

291
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:21,150
sovereign anyway. Yes. We have certain procedures here to do that, but they never make it through,

292
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,630
because ultimately it's about contract law. The evidence doesn't matter. It's what contract is

293
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:34,150
being argued, which is initially the charges of the plaintiff, and it always works in favor

294
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:40,330
of the plaintiff, which in the case you mentioned is the sovereign. So again, it ends up being very

295
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:47,170
similar. But if you look back in history, there are some, let's say, judicial cases that were

296
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:51,390
against the sovereign that made changes in laws, where that doesn't happen anymore.

297
00:31:54,250 --> 00:32:01,590
Yeah, maybe in the past, but surely not now. Yes. No, not after 1938 here, or anything. That's why

298
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:07,750
people, when you go to court, it's not what you think. Just like anything, you know, the media is

299
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:12,510
not what you think. You know, the doctor, the lawyer, none of that is operating the way they

300
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:19,370
tell us. Again, which goes back to the work that you've done, because if you look at, would you

301
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:25,410
call it brainwashing, the 9-11 official version, or just give the people, like pigs, throw anything

302
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:29,990
and they eat it? Which one do you think it is? Because it doesn't look like it was a big brainwashing effort.

303
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:40,170
It's very difficult to say. Depends on how you think. I think they simply not respect the people

304
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:46,870
anymore. So before, like let's say 70 years ago, they still think that the people are people. But

305
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:51,630
now they think that people are just slaves, so they don't even bother to explain them anything.

306
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:58,490
A very poor quality effort. I think it's dependent on how you judge that scale, Dimitri,

307
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:08,390
right? I mean, if there is a certain level to which you decide that information can be disseminated,

308
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,450
then who do you disseminate it to? Do you control the direction it goes?

309
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:17,630
And also do you control, because the official explanation and all that,

310
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:21,530
sure, they gave you pretty pictures and even a comic book version of it.

311
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:27,910
Sure, here's your 9-11 explanation. I don't know if you're aware of that, but they actually

312
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:40,370
produced a graphic novel, if you will, of the official report. So this is a mark of exactly

313
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:46,450
what they are imparting to people, right? What quality are they giving? You know by the quality

314
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:50,410
of what they're giving. What's the phrase I'm looking for here, Greg? You know them by their

315
00:33:50,410 --> 00:34:00,110
works, right? The public is very ridiculous. I mean, I don't know how it is in Bangkok,

316
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:04,770
the public mindset, but I don't think it's any different anywhere you go in the world.

317
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:10,290
The majority is very gullible, let's say. It doesn't matter where you are right now in the

318
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:19,929
world, unless you're going to some tribesmen live in the mountains, you know. Yeah, I think so.

319
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:26,870
No, but if we talk about Thailand, Thailand is still, they have some, I mean, many citizens,

320
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:33,909
they still have some active position, I would say this. Oh, yeah, okay. So it's not so bad,

321
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:42,370
but it's going the same way anyway. Yeah, yeah, pretty much. So, Dmitry, in terms of your work,

322
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:48,190
I know you have the YouTube channel in Russian, and you have one in English. You work more on

323
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:53,610
the Russian one, because that's your first language. Yeah, and I do try to watch those,

324
00:34:53,750 --> 00:35:00,090
but I don't speak any Russian, so it would be great if you did some more on the English.

325
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:06,550
I will try to do, because actually, you know, because firstly, English is really not my native

326
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:14,570
language, and in fact, I never learned it, I just speak like this. But if I continuously do English

327
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:21,850
things, I mean, things in English, that will be easy. But when I do often things in Russian,

328
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:28,110
it's very difficult for me just to switch the mind to speak in English, but I will try my best.

329
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:34,030
I mean, from now on, I will try to record more videos in English and put them there.

330
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:44,050
But the problem is that to have a good video, I need someone, some people to talk with,

331
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:50,210
or at least I need a list of questions, because even in Russian, most of my Russian videos are

332
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:55,470
not monologues. I just obtain a list of questions from people who are interested

333
00:35:55,470 --> 00:36:03,990
in my opinion on certain things. And then by answering these questions, I have an effect

334
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:09,990
that I have someone to talk with, because when I'm completely alone, like a monologue,

335
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:19,550
I just don't like it. So if, for example, you want to record a video with me, I mean,

336
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:25,830
the video conversation or something like that, and I can place it on my YouTube channel,

337
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:32,290
I will be very pleased with that. So you would be amenable to, I happen to do other

338
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:37,030
radio interviews of sorts, you would be amenable to doing, say, a series of interviews with me

339
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:42,170
that we could turn into a video for you. Okay, that would be great. I will make that arrangement

340
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:46,890
with you after we're done speaking today, if you don't mind. Yeah, yeah, I think I think that's

341
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,990
pretty much it. I wanted to just really, like I said, to have Dimitri to honor his work.

342
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:55,530
But we don't do that anymore. Only the Freemasons have honorary dinners, right,

343
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:01,710
Dimitri? They honor somebody. So the best we can do is maybe bring you on our podcast and

344
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:07,330
hear your voice just to honor the work that you did. I personally honor you very much.

345
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:14,070
Right. And I'd like to... Sorry to interrupt you, but the recording that we do now,

346
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:18,250
I also can put in my YouTube channel. So that will be one of the things.

347
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:25,050
Okay, that's up to you. Or we can do another one with Chuck that would be more,

348
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:31,050
more whatever. Yeah, we'll see. We'll talk about it. We'll talk about it after we're done with this.

349
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:37,170
I'd like to point out to longtime Greek listeners, you should absolutely recognize Dimitri's name,

350
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:43,810
because he has been mentioned several times, often, as a matter of fact, anytime 9-11 is mentioned

351
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:49,890
any of the Ocelli and the Greek shows. I absolutely know that his name will come up.

352
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:58,370
And there will be show notes posted with this Rated Y Sonic event that will give you his website

353
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:03,450
and YouTube channels so that you can go and take a look at the four hour video

354
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:09,350
and other work by Dimitri all on your own. I wanted to let the listener know that,

355
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:14,430
and again, I know that you've been... I don't know if you're aware of how many times you've

356
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:20,190
been mentioned, Dimitri, during discussions between myself and the Greek, but a couple

357
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:27,850
hundred episodes ago, seems like and is, you know, even way, way back, I believe you were

358
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:32,670
mentioning Dimitri's work, even in the American Freedom Radio days, Greek, weren't you?

359
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:38,470
Mm-hmm, yeah, pretty much, yeah. Again, thank you for coming, Dimitri, and

360
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:44,970
maybe do some more things with Chuck. Yeah, absolutely. Okay, thank you for inviting me.
