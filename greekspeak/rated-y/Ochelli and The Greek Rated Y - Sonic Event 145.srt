1
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,820
Sonic Event 145 of Rated Y. Greek, how's things?

2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,960
Oh, things. What things?

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,760
No, I don't know. That's why I figured I'd ask you an open question. How's things?

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,860
Well, here's the thing. Before we got started, you were like, you know, I've got some questions.

5
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:29,980
Do you want me to talk? No, no, no. I work best cold. Just drop me in there.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,940
And kind of like those commandos, you just drop them in a dark hole, you know, when they test you for special forces.

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,760
They used to. They drop you in a hole. It's black. And then, you know, you have to no warning.

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,560
Nothing. I'm fine with that. And also just want to preface for there's a bunch of new people.

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,020
And I'm getting responses and trying to respond as best I can in time.

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,800
I want to let people know what the purpose of doing this is initially.

11
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:04,200
Initially, it was just to get the word out because I found that locally in my environment, speaking to people,

12
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,680
they didn't know any of it and they didn't want to know any of it.

13
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:15,280
And I figured that, you know, years ago, you would do newsletters and may put ads and try to get an article written.

14
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,780
Now we have the Internet. Right. No more print. Right. It's going audio visual.

15
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:25,060
So I used to call in on radio starting 14 years ago, wherever I could.

16
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:32,300
People had questions. And I was kind of embarrassed and actually disgusted to call in and discuss these topics

17
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:39,240
because you hear like, for example, if you talk about the human body or economics or government or history,

18
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,720
the stuff that they're talking about is completely false. They had all these experts.

19
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,000
And I said, you know, this is all propaganda. You've got your guest right now is he's an idiot.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,520
Basically, I didn't say that. But and this is where you should look and this is what you need to start with.

21
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,440
And that's basically my whole thing. I was kind of embarrassed to be saying things that I'm saying,

22
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,140
because the way I found them, they came very easy.

23
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,380
And I never tell people to go out and look for things that are hidden underneath a stone.

24
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,560
You know, in Tibet, it's always stuff that's right in front of you.

25
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,360
So I figured starting to do Sonics with you and others.

26
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,620
Sam, the Archon a while back was not to do like, what's his name?

27
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,680
Freeman called me the renegade journalist or something like that.

28
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,080
I was like, No, I'm not a journalist.

29
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:29,840
What I'm doing, what I'm doing is I'm trying to find other people to work with, not do Sonic events with.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,500
I don't you know, I think by now, you know, we don't call them shows.

31
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,940
You can do shows, but I don't I don't do shows.

32
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,040
I do shows. I do Sonic events. I do a lot of things in the audio field.

33
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,300
I'm not you, but I mean, anybody else, they do shows, right?

34
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,960
I mean, I don't want to do a show of Sonic. I mean, it's because we don't do video.

35
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,240
So what I mean, I was looking, trying to find other people to do who are, let's say,

36
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:57,660
OK, let's be more specific in the research class, but not the way either a class of people, inventors.

37
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,720
I'm constantly making new devices, bringing them from another universe into this universe.

38
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,860
Right. Because they're not your ideas. You know what I mean?

39
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,400
Right. They're given to you. Right.

40
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:15,980
And just to progress human communication in general, because recently I've been speaking mostly about the meaning of life.

41
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,240
And I'm very happy to have discovered it for sure.

42
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:26,900
There are other meanings, but the main reason the meaning of it's having a discussion with someone in Romania recently as well.

43
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,560
It's a prison. I was like, no, it's not a prison. It's a university.

44
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,920
Oh, no, it's not a university. So what is it? It's an obstacle course.

45
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,860
You're here to have your time wasted. Not being here is a waste of time.

46
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,780
I think it is. But that's too much to bite off and chew.

47
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,020
But what the meaning of life here is for others to waste your time.

48
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:54,140
If you look at it, the level of inefficiency, lack of communication, the way things are, the deception.

49
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,680
Just look at it for what it is. It's wasting your time.

50
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,820
And that's what the meaning of this life is, whatever it is.

51
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:08,180
And here's the part. In the beginning, when you first find out you're here to have your time wasted by others.

52
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:13,440
I'm talking about others like your parents, your wife, your husband, your friends, coworkers, all the way up.

53
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,860
Everybody's wasting each other's time.

54
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:23,940
If you look at that as being the meaning itself, and there is no other life other than this, it's kind of scary.

55
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,980
So that, in fact, lends itself to that there is more than this.

56
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,200
It's not a school. It's not a prison. It's an obstacle course.

57
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,260
When you're at an obstacle course, what's the lesson?

58
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,920
There's no lesson. How is it a prison? It's not a prison.

59
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,680
You're performing whatever skills you have to negotiate the obstacle course.

60
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,940
That's all it is. There's nothing more.

61
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:55,400
Also, I've discussed it takes 50 to 100 years, really, to master a skill, any skill.

62
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:00,440
So how are you going to do that if you only live to 70, 80, 90? How?

63
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,400
You see, there's not enough time.

64
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,940
And this is by the way that skills…

65
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,280
You can become a master in 5 or 10 years, but not in this situation.

66
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,540
Not in this situation where everybody's wasting each other's time.

67
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,000
The main thing, if you really want to see this proved out,

68
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,700
look at how communication works between people you know.

69
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,160
The media, schools, wherever you get your information.

70
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,880
Look how inefficient it is. Look how unsubstantial it is.

71
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,360
I always give you an excuse.

72
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,880
People ask me, for example, what books should I read?

73
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,480
I say, read everything, everything, but you've got to know how to read it.

74
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,640
Yeah, everything. I've been getting a lot of those questions.

75
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,260
What should I read? Not everything. Why?

76
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,420
Well, you don't want to read everything because you want to read the stuff that matters.

77
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,200
That's good, right?

78
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:56,380
You want to eliminate your complete, absolute, pointless waste of time.

79
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,280
Yeah, well, they're still going to waste your time because humans aren't good at communicating.

80
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,500
But here's the point.

81
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,280
Let's say I give a recommendation and it's usually when I recommend stuff, no one's ever heard of it.

82
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,280
For the most part, yeah.

83
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,360
So let's say you do that.

84
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,560
You won't be able to communicate with other people,

85
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:21,540
but if you read the stuff that they read also and watch what they watch,

86
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,680
if it comes up in conversation, you see how well they organized it.

87
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,760
Did they get the wrong message?

88
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,520
Kind of like when I was in archaics with Jason talking about the Bible part.

89
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,500
I was like, there's no one on the Internet discussing what's in the Bible.

90
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,220
No one seemingly knows because there's like a billion copies of it.

91
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,320
No one knows what's in it.

92
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,620
What's going on is when you read the Bible, you've seen, oh, this is the scene we saw in the movie.

93
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,460
This is the part where this happened. Remember the movie? Yeah, yeah.

94
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,620
Okay, and you read it and you gloss over it and you're reading into it what you saw in the movie,

95
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,740
which is completely false.

96
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,360
It's not even in the pages at all.

97
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,180
Like the flood, for instance, is depicted in various ways.

98
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,560
But what does it actually tell you?

99
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,220
Not even the flood.

100
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,120
We're talking about simple stuff.

101
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,080
That's too big of a picture, let's say.

102
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,180
Too big of a flood, too.

103
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,760
Okay, so for example, are you thinking, when you read something, can you visualize it?

104
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:26,040
For example, the ark had one floor below and two floors above.

105
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,360
How many floors is that in total?

106
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,920
One floor below and two floors above.

107
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,320
If you count the floor, you're standing on four.

108
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,340
Sorry.

109
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,220
It's four.

110
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,460
It's four because you're standing on one.

111
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,240
There's one below you, that's two, and there's two above, it's four.

112
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,040
If you ask most people, they'll say three.

113
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,280
Oh, sorry.

114
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,560
So when you're reading this stuff, you have to...

115
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:46,840
Go ahead.

116
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,760
Oh, I was just saying, I observed four.

117
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,620
Because you have to be standing on one to have one below you.

118
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,880
Yeah, exactly.

119
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,480
Let me just explain.

120
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:59,300
But the thing is, when you get to certain things, they just gloss over.

121
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,740
And Jason says he read it 40 or 50 times, and he didn't know about the Ten Commandments.

122
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,560
He didn't know about this.

123
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,580
So it goes on not to harp on him at all.

124
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,780
I actually like what he's doing.

125
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,400
It's just a perfect example.

126
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,680
You could read it 100 times and not get it if you read it the same way every time.

127
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:26,460
For example, with myself in relationships, I've been around some unsavory people that initially looked unsavory,

128
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,960
that most people would not want to associate with,

129
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,240
that turned out to be some pretty decent people you want to know and have on your side, right?

130
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,580
But on the other hand, if you judge them initially, you wouldn't want to be with them, right?

131
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,220
You see what I mean?

132
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,539
So you have to do both.

133
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,680
You can judge a book by its cover,

134
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,660
but you have to be able to efficiently negotiate.

135
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,000
You know how they say you can't judge a book by its cover?

136
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,140
Bullshit. Bullshit.

137
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,040
The Yellow Pages.

138
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,880
You look at the Yellow Pages, you think it's a cookbook? Come on.

139
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,780
No, but you can identify something about what's in it based on the cover,

140
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,640
but not necessarily know all of what's in it.

141
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,540
Exactly. You get a pretty good idea by looking at it.

142
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,720
Okay. Fair enough.

143
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,320
So here's the point.

144
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,020
Communication is the problem.

145
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,500
The level of inefficiency.

146
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
When you have relationships with people,

147
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,800
there is a point where no matter how bad the relationship is,

148
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,360
there was some benefit to having that relationship.

149
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,900
And if it's possible to hold on to that,

150
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,120
you maintain the relation.

151
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,760
I'm not talking about husband and wife or anything.

152
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,720
I'm talking about acquaintances or whatever.

153
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,160
And people say, well, I was having a discussion with someone about this.

154
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,460
Yeah, well, I don't burn bridges.

155
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,340
And I said, well, it's not a matter of burning bridges.

156
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,360
You know what happens when a blowtorch meets a paper asshole?

157
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,260
You have no choice.

158
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,620
You have no choice.

159
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,600
It's going to get burned.

160
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,420
So there's those kinds of levels.

161
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,880
So, yeah.

162
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,740
So the whole thing is, from a selfish point of view,

163
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,340
was to meet people that could work on the level that I like working on.

164
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,740
And at the same time, give back, give out what I've discovered.

165
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,720
Nothing that you have to go and do some crazy thing to find somewhere,

166
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,200
or trust me, trust me, trust me.

167
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,620
It's all stuff that is either happening around you within five feet or ten feet

168
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:13,700
or stuff you're dealing with.

169
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,420
So when we get into the legal stuff and the money stuff,

170
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:19,200
remember there's a commercial, What's in Your Wallet?

171
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,480
That's right there.

172
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,540
You need to know what, yeah.

173
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,400
All this stuff.

174
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,360
So, and still, I'm looking, I'm still looking.

175
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,500
But here's the, for whoever likes the Sonics,

176
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,200
if I met, let's say, one, two, or three, or four people,

177
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,440
even two people that I could work with on the level that I like to work on,

178
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,480
would I be doing Sonics?

179
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:38,740
No.

180
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,580
I wouldn't be doing it at all.

181
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,080
We would be working privately and developing things that I develop.

182
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,620
But eventually you'd want to reach out with it then

183
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,640
and implement these things, wouldn't you?

184
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,020
Yeah, well, right now we have the scalar, well, you mean the things,

185
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,320
the fruit of my work?

186
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,080
Yeah, the fruit of your work.

187
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,100
I've been like the Scalarator and the Aqueous Argentum

188
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,820
and now the Acoustic Counterspace.

189
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:02,800
Yeah.

190
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,260
These are remarkable things that simple people can grasp,

191
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,740
but if you take it to the university, they flip out, you know?

192
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,300
Of course.

193
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,400
So, yeah.

194
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,240
People ask me with the Acoustic Counterspace,

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,320
I want to mention something.

196
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,180
Someone did a video I mentioned, and he asked ChatGBT,

197
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,060
and he says, yeah, there's research being done on Acoustic Counterspace

198
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,720
and it seems to enhance the sound quality and lower distortion.

199
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,240
And the guy was impressed because I told him no one's doing it.

200
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,600
He says, well, ChatGBT knows about it.

201
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,040
I said, idiot, ChatGBT knows about it

202
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,520
because every time you write or say something,

203
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,660
the transcript is being made that gets fed to the AI.

204
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,700
Everything is.

205
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,480
So, especially when it's local.

206
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,080
Well, now if you make a YouTube video, it didn't used to be.

207
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,400
You used to have to create a transcript or whatever,

208
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,520
but no, that's now automatically generated

209
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,180
whether you have access to it or not,

210
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,420
and guess where it goes?

211
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,580
Into the grand Google database, which is a huge thing.

212
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:58,740
That's right.

213
00:11:59,300 --> 00:11:59,920
So, yeah.

214
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,500
So, he asked.

215
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,860
Now, the thing is, if someone that's less local

216
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,140
asks about Acoustic Counterspace module,

217
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:10,360
they may not get a response because it's kind of localized.

218
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,680
So, in other words, I had about three or four conversations,

219
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,180
not lengthy, but half as long as these Sonics are about it,

220
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,580
and they were able to pull it up to ChatGBT,

221
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,900
and it's a magic trick kind of thing.

222
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,720
But the Scalarator is still,

223
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,280
people that are new don't know about it.

224
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,600
If you go away 10 pages back in the Chatango,

225
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,820
you'll see pictures of it.

226
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,120
Basically, it's a pipe that you run dirty water through

227
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,840
and clean water comes out the other side

228
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,400
if you have hard water.

229
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,720
All these, and no filtering, no whatever.

230
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,580
We're using things that are obvious that no one else has,

231
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,240
and the reasons are very sound once you, you know.

232
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:56,220
Anyway, so if people sense a sense of frustration that I have,

233
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,100
yes, I do, I'm very angstful

234
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,200
because there's never enough time in the day, right?

235
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,940
Never enough time to get stuff done.

236
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,100
Some things come immediately and are done immediately.

237
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,920
Other things are very slow and require assistance.

238
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,100
So I'm still looking for people that are inventor types

239
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,360
that know a little bit about everything

240
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,980
and a lot about a lot.

241
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,620
So catch up because the next major push,

242
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,220
someone had put a question in the Chatango,

243
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,260
what should we do now with what's going on with the war

244
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,140
and this and that.

245
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,920
Nothing, you just go ahead.

246
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,440
You should always, you have no wants, you have needs.

247
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,240
You should only want what you need, right?

248
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,340
So if you have a car, for example, keep it forever.

249
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,620
Doesn't matter if it's worth $500

250
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,960
and it costs $3,000 to fix the transmission.

251
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,360
Spend the $3,000 on the transmission, don't buy a new car.

252
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,020
When you have things that can be repaired,

253
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,080
even if it costs more than buying a new one, do it, right?

254
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,900
Do it, stop, get out of commerce, get out of marketing, right?

255
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,460
Imagine as if all the shops are closed

256
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,820
and you have to fend for yourself.

257
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,700
There's a lot of survivalist people.

258
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,340
You will not go into this mode for less than a decade still,

259
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,980
but if you, people prepare for survival, right?

260
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,400
The grid goes down, they live on the grid, right?

261
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,380
I said, well, what are you wondering about?

262
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,940
You're listening to all these bullshit ads,

263
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,380
buy this, buy that, no, no, no, no.

264
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,820
Go ahead, buy whatever they're, yeah, you know.

265
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,820
Don't let them sell you rice for $10 a pound, right?

266
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,180
Or, you know, a kilo of rice for 20 euro.

267
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,540
Don't do that, but be smart.

268
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,120
So if you want to know what happens when the grid goes down,

269
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,800
if you don't, if you have an apartment,

270
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,400
you probably could do it, but if you live in a house

271
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,500
or shared environment, go outside where the main,

272
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,820
the water main is, turn it off.

273
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,900
And where the power is, turn it off.

274
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,700
If you have gas coming to us, turn it off.

275
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:00,200
Turn off all the utilities to the house for three days,

276
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,440
for three days, and see how you do, right?

277
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,540
And then you'll know what happens when the shit hits the fan.

278
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,140
That's true.

279
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,860
Okay, but the thing that I like to embark in,

280
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,400
which is I've been speaking of for a while, is this.

281
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,260
When you live within an area, let's say,

282
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,040
even if you're not very social,

283
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,380
you know there's someone in your neighborhood or you're nearby

284
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,040
that, hey, this guy is good at cars.

285
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,040
If you have a car problem, go talk to him, right?

286
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,880
Or, this guy is good with air conditioners.

287
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,720
Or, this guy is good with, you know, plumbing, right?

288
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,580
This guy is good with plants, right?

289
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,320
You hear that, you know, people in the neighborhood, right?

290
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,320
And you have, like, someone who acts like the mayor.

291
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:36,880
Yeah, sure.

292
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,820
Yeah, okay, you have that, but no one ever says,

293
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,620
this guy is good if you have a broken leg.

294
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,240
This guy is good if you have a bad cut.

295
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,760
This guy is if you're sick for your body.

296
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,940
Where does everyone still go for that?

297
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,920
To the accursed hospital, the accursed doctors.

298
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,640
Actually, the last neighborhood I lived in,

299
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,860
a lot of people were coming to me

300
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,260
because I had solved a few problems for people that were in distress

301
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,620
that I just ran into.

302
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,580
And I had solved a few of these problems.

303
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,640
Like, it was like a miracle.

304
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,320
I'm like, no, it's just common sense, a couple of things.

305
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,160
And the next thing I knew is people were knocking on my door

306
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,440
when somebody, you know, oh, my God, do I need stitches or what?

307
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,340
No, you don't.

308
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,280
Just relax.

309
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,560
What you need to do is put this back together,

310
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,520
compression, very basic, you know,

311
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,660
which I didn't learn from you, believe it or not,

312
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,020
but you reinforced what I had utilized in the past.

313
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,800
And it was just, to me, very common sense stuff.

314
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,240
And it's basic battlefield medic stuff.

315
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,020
It's not a, yeah.

316
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,700
Well, here's the thing.

317
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,160
It's the common sense thing.

318
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,520
Because I used to have a thing called uncommon radio, right?

319
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,420
Uncommon sense.

320
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:39,880
Right.

321
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:45,740
These things, people think that common sense is uncommon.

322
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:46,820
Right.

323
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,740
So how do you use everything that you have around you already?

324
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,340
Just like in nature when there's something that's toxic right next to it

325
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,080
is something that's the remedy for it.

326
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,700
So how do you use all the things that you have immediately around you?

327
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,480
I talk all the time.

328
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,440
Especially for fixing.

329
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,859
Poison ivy is a perfect example of this.

330
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:08,940
You remember the name of the plant, actually, that's a perfect remedy to it?

331
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,420
Yeah, I think it's a white oak bark, not the birch bark.

332
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,420
I think it's white oak.

333
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,060
Something like that.

334
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,619
It always grows around oak, yeah.

335
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,800
Within your line of sight, if you're standing on a patch of poison ivy,

336
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,680
you could, to a 360 turn, you'll find it in your line of sight.

337
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,280
Right, like a venomous animal or venomous insect,

338
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,080
it's the urine that's in the first 30 seconds to one minute.

339
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,020
Now, I'm not saying be a urine drinker because there was a fad for that a while back.

340
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,740
But the antidote is produced in the bladder.

341
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:40,460
Right.

342
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,900
And I brought this up with medical people,

343
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,260
and they were like, oh no, you can't do that.

344
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,960
The body produces the antidote, right?

345
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,080
For example, certain diseases, certain blood diseases,

346
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,600
they give a real simple example,

347
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,320
is if a healthy person who is processing everything

348
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,500
and eliminating and has proper nutrition

349
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,620
drinks their urine, they will get sick

350
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,740
because they're expelling the stuff the body needs to go out.

351
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,660
But if a sick person drinks their urine,

352
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,980
they're actually expelling the stuff that needs to be in their body,

353
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,540
and that could reverse it.

354
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,600
It's also the induction from it.

355
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:22,680
But that's more complicated because you have to know how to diagnose what the thing is.

356
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,520
But the thing to get heavily into is dentistry and trauma.

357
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,420
What do you do when someone gets hit by a car and is unconscious?

358
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,620
What do you do when someone's oral health goes down?

359
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:43,140
Exactly, proper care of a head injury, proper care of broken limbs or displaced limbs,

360
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,540
things like this is very important.

361
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,360
Now, I'm not good with the dentistry part,

362
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,540
but I just don't have that skill at the moment.

363
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,800
I mean, I have some basics on it, but it was something I could never do to myself.

364
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,660
Well, for now, okay, this is the thing before we even got to your questions yet,

365
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,360
but that is very, very important because, you know,

366
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,020
a lot of people got off on the spirit, the soul, and the body,

367
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,300
and you hear people that are seemingly fairly read in,

368
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,640
and they say, oh, I disagree, I disagree.

369
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,240
That is, it's a very difficult one because it was reversed during the Hellenic period, right?

370
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,820
Like, for example, they still say the ideal pneuma,

371
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,700
which literally means the set-apart or the non-earthly breath,

372
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,640
and the ideal pneuma is translated as the Holy Spirit in the Greek, and it's not.

373
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,920
Because here's the thing, there's no word holy in the Bible.

374
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,740
It's set-apart or non-earthly.

375
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,200
Everyone's spirit is not earthly, everyone.

376
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,900
So it can't be the spirit, even though we've taken it as being a,

377
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,440
a spirit is unique to each creature as a unique spirit.

378
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,420
Like, if you met a thousand demons, there are a thousand unique demons, right?

379
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,000
If you met a thousand cats, there are a thousand unique cats,

380
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,600
a thousand chickens, a thousand humans, right?

381
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:04,940
They're all unique, they're all set-apart from themselves.

382
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,700
So the Greek, the Christian thing that's called the Holy Spirit,

383
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,820
it's really the Holy Breath, and that's where the whole thing became confused

384
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,220
because all spirits are set-apart or holy, all of them.

385
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,500
Now, it's interesting, even if you read in the Piss 4 translations,

386
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,060
they're not unholy spirits, they're unclean spirits is the difference.

387
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,660
They're keeping the main translation, but they've confused everything.

388
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,760
Like, with the Christ, all they have to do is throw in the J-E-S-U-S

389
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,980
and throw in crucifixion, and the whole thing is screwed.

390
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,300
You'll never see what happens. There's no crucifixion at all.

391
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,600
So don't, when you fall for all that,

392
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,300
and people that seemingly are well-educated are the worst,

393
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,220
because they, you know, I've had several people say,

394
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,000
well, I disagree with your etymology, and I say, let's go with the etymology.

395
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,840
Perfect, because that's exactly where I was going to go.

396
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,240
The etymology shows it like black and white.

397
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,720
Now, there's no gray area at all, at all.

398
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,880
And see, because they've reversed it, they don't know what is,

399
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,960
when you hear Holy Spirit, all spirits are holy, all of them.

400
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,660
It's the breath that's set-apart.

401
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,060
So I just wanted to make this correction.

402
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,360
It has nothing to do, I'm not religious, by the way,

403
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,720
and I'm not into all that stuff at all.

404
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,280
I use it as my law, and I use it for timekeeping,

405
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,940
which is the same that everyone did.

406
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,460
For example, if you lived like they did in the Bible,

407
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,540
and you went back to China 2,000 years ago,

408
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,640
you'd be totally accepted, so you'd see exactly what you're talking about, right?

409
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,380
But now with all the divisions and all that,

410
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,980
it's a timepiece kind of thing.

411
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,800
But I'm not into that religious stuff at all,

412
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,440
because it's, you know, it's like politics, you know?

413
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,720
It's all bullshit.

414
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:51,180
But again, etymology is going to show it to you,

415
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,160
but when you have so many examples that are contradicting,

416
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,720
you can't look at the etymology, because it won't make any sense.

417
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,060
That's why I brought up, I just summed it up,

418
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,020
because I've gotten quite a few messages regarding the spirit,

419
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,280
and it's not really the wrestling with the difference between soul and spirit,

420
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,540
it's because they keep hearing that Holy Spirit thing.

421
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,100
The Holy Spirit is, everyone's got, everything has a Holy Spirit.

422
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,380
It's the breath that makes it different,

423
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,700
and that's what gave particular, you know, the metabolism also.

424
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,600
Well, the biggest problem here is not even the etymology versus,

425
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,520
it's the fact that that common usage, which is shown to you in the dictionary,

426
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,960
which the dictionary is supposed to teach you how to pronounce said word,

427
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,280
and they're only giving you the common usage

428
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,740
so that you know which word, so you can recognize it.

429
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,440
Well, you just, the word nice is very difficult to,

430
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,860
because it's been used so much, right?

431
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,460
The use of an opinion, opinion means, yeah, no knowledge.

432
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,980
Right. In its diction, though, it's very simple.

433
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,780
Nice is very simple in its diction.

434
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,780
Then they're showing you how it's used.

435
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,740
It's not a matter of what it means.

436
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,580
So that's always the problem.

437
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,180
Well, no, hold on, hold on.

438
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:07,440
It's not a problem if you understand what's going on,

439
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,080
and what's going on is when you have an enemy,

440
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,980
when you have an enemy, it takes a lot of resources to fight them,

441
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,000
because the thing is not to defeat them.

442
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,100
It's to keep them weak.

443
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,160
You ruin, you mess up their communications, their ability to communicate.

444
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,480
Now you have control over them.

445
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,960
Like, for example, recently I was looking again at the Lieber Code

446
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,680
and the things that came out.

447
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,840
I didn't know, by the way, in the U.S. the Treasury closed 12 years

448
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,660
between before 1933 and 1921 or so.

449
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,160
They had already shut it down and shipped all the gold out.

450
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,460
But all the U.S. citizens were declared enemies of Washington, D.C.,

451
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,340
you know, the United States.

452
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:49,660
And the interesting reason was because they're the closest, right?

453
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,000
They're the closest, so they'd have to be declared enemies first

454
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,660
versus, you know, someone outside,

455
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,060
because everyone is foreign to the United States, by the way.

456
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,980
You're either an alien resident or a non-alien resident.

457
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,280
You're all alien to it.

458
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,740
So there's a very interesting logic that they put together,

459
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,520
and if you brought that out to the public, they wouldn't understand a word of it,

460
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,420
even though it's in third-grade level because, again, of the usage

461
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,180
and what you're pointed to to look.

462
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,620
But anyway, my point, this seems like I feel like I'm ranting

463
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,840
because the sonics will go on as long as they do.

464
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,080
Who knows? We could end them in whatever.

465
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,400
It's just that I'm still hopeful to meet some people that are exceptional

466
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,740
in what they do and see if they could contribute to the topics

467
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,160
that we discuss here.

468
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,540
Mainly, it's the body.

469
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,200
Now, the thing is most people say health.

470
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,220
One thing I just want to interject, again, I keep telling people,

471
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,780
get that word out of your mind, health.

472
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,680
There is no health.

473
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,620
You have things that are healthful and things that are unhealthful,

474
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,560
healthy and unhealthy as such, and there is no health.

475
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,580
It's what fitness level you have, right?

476
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,380
So if you have someone who says,

477
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:05,200
I want to go climb Mount Everest, they're in good shape.

478
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,900
I want to go climb Mount Everest in a month or let's say in a week.

479
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,120
They won't make it.

480
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,800
They'll get high-altitude disease and they may not make it.

481
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,060
You have to train for that.

482
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,020
If someone says, I'm going to sit in an office for eight hours a day,

483
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:23,580
they're probably okay to do that, and their fitness will,

484
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,660
if you're active and you go and do an office job for eight hours a day,

485
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,840
five days a week or six days a week, let's say,

486
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,220
your fitness level will decline, right?

487
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,600
So it's all fitness.

488
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:39,540
Now let's say you have a malady like a brain injury or not an injury,

489
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,520
like a tumor in your head or a heart attack or something like that.

490
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,080
Yes, that's fitness level again.

491
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,940
That's fitness level.

492
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,360
It's a level of fitness that you have,

493
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:53,240
and these things are known very well in certain circles,

494
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,640
and they're not discussed publicly.

495
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,720
Publicly they tell you you have health care.

496
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,700
You cannot care for your health.

497
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,920
You must decide what level of fitness you want to operate on,

498
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,000
and when your body makes it so,

499
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,100
let's say you have a brain tumor the size of a grapefruit in your head,

500
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,480
your fitness level is the first thing that you're going to notice

501
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,720
that's going to direct you to have that examined, right?

502
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,780
Yes, of course.

503
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,100
Your fitness level, you'll probably be dizzy or whatever.

504
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,800
So all of these things are fitness levels.

505
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,060
There is no health.

506
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,740
So I've been getting questions about health and things like that,

507
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,840
and it's really difficult.

508
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,280
It's worse than the soul and spirit

509
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,960
because the thing is when someone brings up something

510
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,560
regarding their quote-unquote health,

511
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,060
I'm using the common term here,

512
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,140
it's like what fitness level?

513
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,180
In other words, let's say you're diagnosed with all these diseases, right?

514
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,880
Most of them are fictional, by the way.

515
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,780
They're all blood quality issues.

516
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,080
Most of them are blood quality issues,

517
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,360
and they're diverted into being called this, that, or that,

518
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,680
blaming an organ on it or something like that.

519
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,200
They're blood quality issues, I would say.

520
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,220
So what do you know about blood quality?

521
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,600
And the other thing is the reason you probably went

522
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,620
and got diagnosed with that stuff

523
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,780
is because your fitness level was not up to the par that you wanted, right?

524
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,000
Meaning if you feel pretty good,

525
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:17,260
and then suddenly you don't feel pretty good, you're just fair,

526
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,280
that's not your health.

527
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,640
That's your level of fitness that has changed.

528
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:22,500
Yeah?

529
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,740
Okay, so once you start looking at it that way,

530
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,140
you'll be able to do...

531
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,960
Okay, if you don't understand that,

532
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,580
you will not be able to diagnose.

533
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,560
Diagnose means like, hey, what's wrong with me?

534
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,460
And look at someone.

535
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,920
If you think there's health, you won't be able to...

536
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,320
That's why these doctors and medical technicians,

537
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,300
they can't diagnose anything

538
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,840
because they don't know what's going on.

539
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,620
I'll give you an example.

540
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,060
When I was in the athletic circles and bicycle racing,

541
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,280
and someone's fitness level was not well,

542
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,520
and this happened all the time,

543
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,140
they would go to a general practitioner,

544
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,180
and I would laugh at them.

545
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,060
I would laugh at them.

546
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,260
People would laugh at them also.

547
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,800
I said, these general practitioners are looking at people

548
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,920
that are of a very low fitness level or very old and sedentary,

549
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,200
and they're basically just bad examples of what a human should be.

550
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,960
You're going to go in there.

551
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:18,320
You're over 500 times more fit than anyone they've seen in 10 years.

552
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,920
They're going to say, you're fine, right?

553
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:25,060
They're going to say, you have to go to a sports doctor, right?

554
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,120
That's why the majority of them...

555
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,660
An athlete has to go to a sports doctor,

556
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,800
and everyone should be on that level.

557
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:34,080
Yeah, well, the majority of people that really are seeking a solution

558
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,580
can find it by dietary adjustment, really.

559
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,900
Well, no, okay, well, it's not even that

560
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,140
because we've gotten into that, the dietary adjustment.

561
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,760
You must understand the energy of it.

562
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,840
That's why if you look at 99% of the people that are vegetarian or vegan look sick

563
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,500
because they don't understand.

564
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,580
They just think taking meat out of the diet

565
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,820
and then eating whatever else is not meat is good,

566
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,540
and they don't understand the energy system.

567
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,240
Right, that's a poor idea there

568
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:02,240
because they're usually overloaded with something

569
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,760
that's producing this one thing over and over again.

570
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,520
The body doesn't need just one thing.

571
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,280
Yeah, and it's part of the propaganda system.

572
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,400
You see how they're marketed.

573
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,460
We've gone into earlier Sonics,

574
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,920
and I think it's not the teens, maybe the 50s, 60s, and 80s.

575
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,840
Those Sonics, I might even have to do a little bit more.

576
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,420
The energy of the food, you know,

577
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,900
think of it this way, like fruit.

578
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,040
Okay, let's look at fruit.

579
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,060
Oranges, apples, pears, cherries, right?

580
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,720
Think of it this way.

581
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,280
The Westerners will have you do how much sugar.

582
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,520
No one knows what's in fruit, by the way.

583
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,520
When they tell you there's vitamin C,

584
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,720
no one knows what's in it

585
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,300
because the way they find out what's in it

586
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,460
is by crushing it, blending it, and burning it,

587
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,240
and then measuring what's left.

588
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,860
Well, burning is literally the main point of reference

589
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,340
because people talk, and I explained this to someone recently,

590
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,340
the calories thing.

591
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,820
Well, what is a calorie?

592
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,140
It has nothing to do with the body.

593
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,320
And they have people walking around saying,

594
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,300
I'm burning calories.

595
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,700
Does your body have a furnace?

596
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,220
This was my question to the small audience.

597
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,400
Does your body have a furnace?

598
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,500
Are you able to burn anything inside of your body?

599
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,040
Think about it.

600
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,460
Well, yeah, but that's again like the Holy Spirit

601
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,780
and like an ice, and it's a conditioning.

602
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,680
They've been soaked.

603
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:19,500
But again, remember, we're here to have our time wasted, right?

604
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,540
Right, but I'm trying to eliminate that by saying,

605
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
listen, just think for a moment.

606
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,240
Do you burn?

607
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,880
Just use that one point of view.

608
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,320
Is there burning going on?

609
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,700
Yeah, but it's more than that.

610
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,400
Wait until they've...

611
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,760
I think we've gotten into diabetes and AIDS.

612
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,560
Those are completely fictional, do not exist,

613
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,920
and blood pressure does not exist,

614
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,540
and they're killing like 5 million people a year

615
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,640
with treating them with these things that don't exist.

616
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,220
I'm not you, so I'm trying to start with the most basic thing,

617
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:46,740
which is, can you identify where you're burning anything?

618
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,260
Yeah, go ahead.

619
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,000
Yeah, let's go back to the fruit of this.

620
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,220
So you're going to say, oh, fruit is this.

621
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,100
It has antioxidants.

622
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:51,760
Bullshit.

623
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,620
All that's bullshit.

624
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,720
Okay, so let's look at the fruit from an energetic perspective,

625
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:00,840
purely oranges, apples, pears, cherries, apricots, whatever.

626
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:01,980
Okay, let's look at it.

627
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:02,960
It comes off the tree.

628
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,860
The tree is rooted in the ground, and it grows on a trunk.

629
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:09,060
It could be a shrub, and it goes up into the air.

630
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,380
It keeps growing, and then it blossoms, right?

631
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,380
It blossoms, and then the fruit grows out of the blossom.

632
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,520
And remember, everything is going up, up, up, up, up.

633
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,480
And when a fruit grows, it's all going down, down, down, down now, right?

634
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,560
Remember, if you leave the fruit on the plant,

635
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,060
if you leave the fruit on the plant and it falls off,

636
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,520
does it fall up or does it fall down towards the ground again?

637
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,840
It reaches up first, then the energy starts going downward.

638
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,160
Right, so when you're eating fruit,

639
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,020
you're eating something at its terminal point where it's on its direction down.

640
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,520
That's the way, for example, it's on its way back to Earth, down.

641
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,520
So what is it going to do to your body?

642
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,800
Your body will not get any uplifting.

643
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,540
It'll get an immediate uplifting energy because remember,

644
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,360
the fruit was still attached on one end,

645
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,600
but the other end, the majority of the mass, is going to bring you down.

646
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,600
Right, but when it gets into the body,

647
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,120
because of the quality that brings it down,

648
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,040
the energy is going to run to the top of your head

649
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,520
because that's the part that represents the yang or the contracted part.

650
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,140
Now this sounds complicated, but let's say we did a sonic

651
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,520
and gave 10 different examples like this, like with meat.

652
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,980
Forget about protein and blood and animal and all that.

653
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,700
What is it doing? What have you got there?

654
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,480
For example, here I'll leave off and we'll get to the questions.

655
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,520
Let's say you're cooking a steak.

656
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,660
We'll get specific because I've measured this.

657
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,420
You're cooking a steak on a grill, let's be specific, a charcoal grill,

658
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,400
let's say a mesquite grill,

659
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,860
and you measure the steak with a thermometer down to like a tenth of a degree.

660
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,180
So you measure the steak, and when it gets to about 130 degrees,

661
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,340
you want it rare, let's say.

662
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,460
You flip it, and it's still 130 degrees on the grill, still, right?

663
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,100
You shoot the laser right on the meat, not on the fire.

664
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,780
132 degrees, 133, it's going up, so we better take it off, right?

665
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,300
So it stabilizes at 132, remember that number.

666
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:12,840
I put it on the plate, off the grill, and I keep measuring it.

667
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:20,780
It's off the grill now, and suddenly it's 132.5, 133, 133.5.

668
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,560
What they say is it continues cooking.

669
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,860
No, no, no, no, see again.

670
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,900
No, the temperature is actually going up,

671
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,220
even though it's out of the heat source, on its own.

672
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,300
But I said that's what they say, it continues cooking.

673
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,400
Yeah, but hold on.

674
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,720
If you listen to what I said carefully, while it was on the grill,

675
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,260
you're measuring 130, 132, it's pretty stable on the grill.

676
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,200
The moment you take it off the grill, it goes up one or two degrees immediately.

677
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,160
Now, why does that happen?

678
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,780
This is the energy part, and if there's other ways of measuring,

679
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,400
we've gone into temperature also.

680
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,760
Do we base all of our temperature basically on mercury?

681
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,540
There were like four different temperature scales,

682
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,280
and now we've settled down to, well, there's more like eight of them,

683
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,880
but Celsius and Fahrenheit, but it's based on mercury.

684
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,380
So here's the energy part.

685
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:14,560
Well, mercury, first of all, it's a toxic metal in certain ways.

686
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,620
People don't know this, but if you had a stomach ailment 150 years ago,

687
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,340
you drank a quarter cup of mercury.

688
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,739
Are you familiar with this?

689
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,239
Yeah, I've heard of this, yeah.

690
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:27,960
Yeah, but it is an interesting metal, but here's the thing.

691
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,800
I've never done it, but I've heard of it.

692
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:33,219
Here's the energy part again, and this confounds people,

693
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,620
because this is all about once you understand these energy matters,

694
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,739
you'll see how all this has been brought,

695
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,540
how much more with this type of thinking you can get out of any situation.

696
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,600
So let's say the mercury says it's 72 degrees Fahrenheit.

697
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,400
And I'm at sea level.

698
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,540
I'm at sea level.

699
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,920
I can pretty much be outside in a single-layer long-sleeve shirt,

700
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,920
very comfortable, very comfortable, right?

701
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,440
Okay, it's 72 degrees.

702
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,680
We go to a place like Death Valley, still 72 degrees,

703
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,240
which is below sea level a few hundred feet.

704
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,340
Now you feel like you're a little warm in the same shirt,

705
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,540
same temperature, same exact temperature.

706
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,180
Right.

707
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,380
Okay, now we go up near a high altitude, near a mountain,

708
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,700
and what's the temperature?

709
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,560
Oh, 72.

710
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,920
Yeah, but you're going to start to feel cold.

711
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,020
But now you feel cooler.

712
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,360
Yeah.

713
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,960
Now you feel cooler.

714
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,160
Okay, but wait a second.

715
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,600
Three different altitudes gave us three different feelings

716
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,380
with the same temperature of mercury,

717
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,080
so there's got to be a better way to measure temperature.

718
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,240
And it's not just altitude-based,

719
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,400
but you see the altitude also adds a component,

720
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,760
which is, by the way, you use the barometric pressure in a lot of things,

721
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,400
but, again, they brush it under the rug.

722
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,840
We're talking about the way we feel.

723
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,940
This is all part of the way you diagnose things.

724
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,400
Now let's jump to something that's more complicated.

725
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,300
The yin and yang thing.

726
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,900
Barometric pressure is a significant measurement

727
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,680
that can be utilized for good purpose, though, right?

728
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,700
Yeah, yeah, but I'm showing you how that relates to temperature.

729
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,200
Okay, good.

730
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,360
Very much, right?

731
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,100
But, again, who says barometric pressure?

732
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,360
Again, that's another column of mercury again, right?

733
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:11,740
True.

734
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,280
So let's just jump to what remedies you can do.

735
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,340
Let's say earlier I spoke about a tumor in the brain, right?

736
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:20,700
Right.

737
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:25,300
And I'm not going to mention names, Gilder, Radner, but anyway,

738
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,160
that kind of situation, a tumor in the brain,

739
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:38,300
the top of the head is the most yang, most contractive part of the body.

740
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:43,740
So anything that goes to the brain has to be very yin to balance out, right?

741
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,940
So because, you know, hot and cold, let's say, yin and yang,

742
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,720
the yin rushes towards the yang.

743
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,540
So if someone has a brain tumor or a brain condition

744
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:56,900
that can be seen on a CAT scan or something like that or an X-ray,

745
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:04,000
that is an extreme yang in the body that has rushed to extreme yin energy

746
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,920
from chemical or environment or even thinking

747
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,880
that has drawn and created that situation

748
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,460
and collected itself in the most yang contractive part of the body.

749
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,120
So in order to get, if it got there quickly,

750
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,160
which very often there's people that get these tumors can develop overnight,

751
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,140
by the way, what would be a remedy for that?

752
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,900
Well, you want to find, since it's the yin that ran to the most yang part of the body,

753
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,220
you want to put something in the body that is so yang, so yang,

754
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:41,180
that it will see this extreme yin concentration and balance it out

755
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,500
and make it smaller, make the tumor smaller immediately almost.

756
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,940
So what do you do for that?

757
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:53,160
Well, one of the most yin conditions known is radiation, right?

758
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:56,420
And cockroaches can take the most radiation.

759
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,820
That means they're very, very yang.

760
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,880
One of the most yang creatures or yang things you can take,

761
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,600
which I don't recommend, this is not a dietary thing

762
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,860
because the law that I live by, I wouldn't eat that insect anyway,

763
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,520
would be an animal, a cockroach is the most yang animal

764
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,140
because any other creature you bombard with radiation will die

765
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,340
while the cockroach will not.

766
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,420
But we want to make the cockroach even more yang,

767
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:26,420
so we broil it until it carbonizes into black powder,

768
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,720
not burn it into ash, but until it turns into a piece of carbon.

769
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,340
Poor roaches, right?

770
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,800
And then you take that and you put it in a capsule

771
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,620
and you take three of those in the morning,

772
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,120
three of those in noon, and three at night.

773
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,140
And within a few days, that tumor seems to have almost disappeared.

774
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,780
This is a purely energy thing.

775
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,500
Now, this is extreme.

776
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:52,780
What I just gave is like an example of the most advanced course

777
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,400
you can take in macrobiotic remedies, for example.

778
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,160
Actually, what I just mentioned,

779
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,900
you can go to people that are healers

780
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,560
that understand the Taoist philosophy and the Taoist medicine

781
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,480
and they would freak out if you told them that.

782
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,660
Who told you that?

783
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,460
That's like within their innermost circles, right?

784
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:17,020
And if you don't believe that, go research Taoist medicine online.

785
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,080
It's all fluff and bullshit.

786
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,200
So once you understand the energy of these things,

787
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,200
you can make remedies and combinations.

788
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,000
An example would be when you look at these Chinese medicinal shops.

789
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,860
You go in, they have herbs in containers,

790
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,920
and they see you, they do a diagnosis, they ask you some questions,

791
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,440
and then they walk around and they open jars and things

792
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,000
and throw stuff in a bag and tell you to boil this and drink it.

793
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,200
That is a completely... I mean, that's the right idea.

794
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,220
That's the right idea, but what they're doing

795
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,600
is just taking advantage of people that are ignorant.

796
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,320
It doesn't work that way.

797
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,200
Putting all these things in there.

798
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:56,320
Some people are helped, of course, because it's a change in their pattern, right?

799
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,140
Let's say, yeah.

800
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,780
So I'm still asking for help.

801
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,520
Another way to call yin and yang, something else,

802
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:07,240
because now it sounds like I'm doing a modified...

803
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,900
speaking about modified Asian philosophy

804
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,800
or modifying Asian techniques when you say yin and yang.

805
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,720
So if anyone out there has any more suggestions

806
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,600
where, you know, one would be dispersive, yin,

807
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,400
and one would be contractive, right? Yang.

808
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,680
If there's another way to discuss this, another way completely,

809
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,660
because I don't want to sound like I'm a proponent of a modified Asian philosophy,

810
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,000
but right now it seems to be the best.

811
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,320
For example, if we're speaking about geometry,

812
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,680
are we always stuck with Pythagoras?

813
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,420
You could be. You could be.

814
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,800
Okay, so that's my rant for tonight.

815
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,620
Do you want to throw some questions or do you want to do it another time?

816
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,580
I think we should save them up for Saturday

817
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,940
because you actually answered a bunch from one set of questions anyway

818
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,800
without knowing it.

819
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,620
Okay, good.

820
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,560
There you go.
